This comparison serves as a prelude to a deeper exploration of the company's value, ingeniously integrating financial assessment with essential company details.Verisk Analytics (VRSK): A Fairly Valued Stock with Strong ProfitabilityGF Value: A Measure of Intrinsic ValueThe GF Value is an estimation of a stock's intrinsic value, calculated based on historical multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line represents the ideal fair value at which the stock should be traded.For Verisk Analytics (NASDAQ:VRSK), the GF Value indicates that the stock is fairly valued.

Companies with poor financial strength pose a higher risk of permanent loss. The cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage provide a good understanding of a company's financial strength. Verisk Analytics has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.1, which ranks worse than 83.8% of 1043 companies in the Business Services industry. The overall financial strength of Verisk Analytics is rated 5 out of 10, indicating fair financial strength.Verisk Analytics (VRSK): A Fairly Valued Stock with Strong ProfitabilityProfitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies, especially those with consistent profitability over the long term, poses less risk.

Its operating margin is 32.18%, which ranks better than 93.93% of 1055 companies in the Business Services industry. Overall, GuruFocus ranks the profitability of Verisk Analytics at 9 out of 10, indicating strong profitability.Growth is a significant factor in the valuation of a company.

The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 21.4%, which ranks better than 68.28% of 845 companies in the Business Services industry.ROIC vs WACCComparing a company's return on invested capital (ROIC) and the weighted cost of capital (WACC) is another way to assess its profitability. ROIC measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. WACC is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. Ideally, the ROIC should be higher than the WACC. For the past 12 months, Verisk Analytics's ROIC is 9.06, and its WACC is 9.45.Verisk Analytics (VRSK): A Fairly Valued Stock with Strong ProfitabilityConclusionIn conclusion, the stock of Verisk Analytics (NASDAQ:VRSK) appears to be fairly valued.

The company also saw a slowing in bank deposit outflows, but still beat expectations.Instacart (CART) shares are lower as Wall Street initiates bullish coverage on the stock, including JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs.Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton take a look at some of the trending tickers of the day. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video Transcript- Let's talk about Charles Schwab, or Chuck Schwab as you like to call it. Their shares are in the green today. They've been helping lead the S&amp;P 500 higher that's after the brokerage giant reported earnings this morning. And it comes as the firm saying bank deposit outflows were slowing down 7% from the previous quarter, down more than that year over year down 28% year over year, but still, that deposit drop was smaller than had been anticipated by analysts.And one of the other interesting things here is we've been seeing something happen at some of the banks, which Charles Schwab talked about something they call cash sorting, which is people taking money from their cash deposits and putting it in higher-yielding stuff like money markets. That's good for the people. It's not as good for Charles Schwab. And it says some of that activity is starting to slow down.- Yeah, so this was an expectations game story. So earning's beat, as you noted. Bank deposits did drop but still beat with the Street was looking for. Citi saying telling their clients results in September trends were a touch better than expected. They noted the recent negative sentiment in their words, and that is true. This has been a rough year for Charles Schwab. You remember back early in the year, the regional banking crisis, the stock got absolutely walloped and is still down hard year to date.- Yeah, it's down, and the deposits are still down. Net interest revenue, which we talked a lot about at the other banks that we heard from on Friday being positive, was down 24% year over year.Story continues- But a pop today for Chuck, so.- Yeah.- Moving on, JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs have kicked off coverage on Instacart today with a bullish view, and the stock is down about 1.2% here. Around half of the company's IPO underwriters have initiated coverage with their top ratings that's despite the stock flatlining following its IPO debut. So Instacart always interesting, Julie, because it makes its debut. Well known brand. We all know it. Some of us even gave it a shot during the pandemic but had a decent bottom line, which we didn't always see.The other side of the coin, though, growth had slowed, and the company said, well, that's macro. That's inflation. That's a tough comp. But I do remember at least some investors at the time saying that's also competition, and you've got a ton of it. But it is notable today. We did have some analysts weighing in, and they were generally positive.- And it's also notable that the stock is down even though they're generally positive, right?- Correct.- Remember the IPO price was $30? The average price target of those who have initiated on the stock is now $34.14. There are a total of nine buys, seven holds, and one sell on Instacart of the various firms that have initiated coverage here. Some of them are more positive because the company has newer advertising business that they say is going to help matters.But again, you have a disconnect between what's happening with the actual stock and what the Street is saying, so we'll see if that gap closes at some point.- A lot of it has to do with the advertising business, which is interesting when you read through the notes. Analysts knowing this is the profitability driver of the company. Baird's saying it's one of the most successful rollouts of retail media, perhaps only second to Amazon. So very positive note. Not a very positive reaction, though, today.- Definitely not.]"

Investors may already be aware of what is happening with the cash part of the equation: While clients once left a big slug of their investment money in cash that could go into Schwab’s bank and earn a nice margin, after the Federal Reserve starting raising rates customers began “sorting” their cash into higher-yielding alternatives like money-market funds.Continue reading]"

Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with SPGI.As of 2023-10-16, Texas Instruments Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $244.76. It's currently trading at a price of $152.77. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is 37.58%. The company is significantly undervalued.Unlocking Intrinsic Value: Analysis of Texas Instruments IncThe modelThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Texas Instruments Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.AssumptionsTermValueExplanationEPS without NRI$8.32GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.Discount Rate11%An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.69%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.Growth StageGrowth rate (g1) = 19.10% Years of Growth Stage = 10We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.Terminal StageGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.CalculationGrowth Stage=EPS without NRI*[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)*(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=125.09Terminal Stage=EPS without NRI*(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10*[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)+(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=119.67Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)=Growth Stage+Terminal Stage=244.76Discounted Free Cash Flow ModelGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $58.75. This valuation indicates that the Texas Instruments Inc is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -160.03%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.Story continuesThe Bottom LinePlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation.  Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:Future Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.Navigating with GuruFocus:Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

12,d9d7c588-19bd-3300-9a35-924f06c13827,RRC,2023-10-17,Natural Gas Price Retreats on Weather Forecast,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/natural-gas-price-retreats-weather-121200284.html,1697458320,STORY,"['NG=F', 'LNG', 'RRC']","[The U.S. Energy Department's weekly inventory release showed a lower-than-expected increase in natural gas supplies. The positive inventory numbers notwithstanding, futures settled with a loss week over week, overwhelmed by predictions of insipid weather-related demand.In fact, the market hasn't been kind to natural gas in 2023, with the commodity trading considerably lower year to date and briefly breaking below the $2 threshold for the first time since 2020. At this time, we advise investors to focus on stocks like Range Resources RRC, Coterra Energy CTRA and Cheniere Energy LNG.EIA Reports a Smaller-Than-Anticipated BuildStockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states rose 84 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended Oct 6, below the guidance of a 91 Bcf addition per a survey conducted by S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights. The build compared with the five-year (2018-2022) average net injection of 93 Bcf and last year’s growth of 125 Bcf for the reported week.The latest increase puts total natural gas stocks at 3,529 Bcf, which is 316 Bcf (9.8%) above the 2022 level and 163 Bcf (4.8%) higher than the five-year average.The total supply of natural gas averaged 106.9 Bcf per day, up 1.1 Bcf per day on a weekly basis due to higher shipments from Canada and an increase in dry production.Meanwhile, daily consumption rose to 95.8 Bcf from 94.5 Bcf in the previous week, mainly reflecting a slight pickup in deliveries to LNG export terminals, together with higher residential/commercial and industrial usage. These factors were partly offset by lower power burn.Natural Gas Prices Still Finish LowerNatural gas prices trended downward last week despite the lower-than-expected inventory build. Futures for November delivery ended Friday at $3.24 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, retreating 3.1% from the previous week’s closing. The decrease in natural gas realization is the result of unfavorable weather predictions.As is the norm with natural gas, changes in temperature and weather forecasts can lead to price swings. With forecasts for milder weather in the days ahead, usage of the commodity to generate electricity to meet cooling demand is expected to be tepid.However, on a positive note, there are signs of curtailment in domestic output. According to energy services provider Baker Hughes, the U.S. natural gas rig count — a pointer to where production is headed — is down more than 25% from last year. Industry observers believe this could set the stage for a pullback in near-term drilling and supplies.Meanwhile, a stable demand catalyst in the form of continued strong LNG feedgas deliveries is supporting natural gas. While falling from their April highs, LNG shipments for export from the United States have been elevated for months due to environmental reasons and Europe’s endeavor to move away from its dependence on Russian natural gas supplies following the war in Ukraine. Furthermore, with union workers planning to resume strikes at LNG facilities in Australia, flows to export plants might be threatened, thereby driving up commodity prices.Story continuesFinal ThoughtsFollowing last week’s decrease, the natural gas market is down 28% so far this year. Based on several factors, the space is currently quite unpredictable and spooked by the sudden changes in weather and production patterns. As such, investors are clueless about what to do. As of now, the lingering uncertainty over the fuel means that they should preferably opt for holding on to fundamentally strong stocks like Range Resources, Coterra Energy and Cheniere Energy.Range Resources: RRC is a leading operator in the prolific Appalachian Basin — a premier natural gas play — with huge inventories of low-risk drilling sites that are likely to provide production for several decades. About 68% of the company’s total output is natural gas.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Range Resources beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, with the average being 21.7%. Valued at around $8.4 billion, RRC has gained 27.9% in a year.Coterra Energy: It is an independent upstream operator primarily engaged in the exploration, development and production of natural gas. Headquartered in Houston, TX, the firm owns some 183,000 net acres in the gas-producing Marcellus Shale of the Appalachian Basin. The Zacks Rank #3 company churned out an average of 2,204 million cubic feet on a daily basis from these assets in 2022.Coterra beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 9.5%. Valued at around $22 billion, CTRA has edged up 0.6% in a year.Cheniere Energy: Being the first company to receive regulatory approval to export LNG from its 2.6 billion cubic feet per day Sabine Pass terminal, Cheniere Energy certainly enjoys a distinct competitive advantage.Cheniere Energy has a projected earnings growth rate of 492.6% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this #3 Ranked natural gas exporter’s 2023 earnings has been revised 2.7% upward over the past 60 days.

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Nucor Nucor Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the President, Leon Topalian, sold US$3.3m worth of shares at a price of US$168 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$147. So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.In the last year Nucor insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insiders At Nucor Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Nucor. In total, insiders sold US$11m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Insider OwnershipLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Nucor insiders own about US$216m worth of shares (which is 0.6% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Nucor Tell Us?Insiders haven't bought Nucor stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company.

Never miss another market-moving headline.Pfizer upped Jefferies after guidance cutPfizer (NYSE:PFE) shares kicked higher Monday after analysts issued glowing notes after the healthcare giant lowered its revenue and earnings forecasts for the year, given the decline in demand for its COVID-19 treatment, Paxlovid.Pfizer said it now sees adjusted EPS at $1.55, down from the prior guidance of $3.35. Full-year revenue is now seen at $59.5 billion, down from the previous $68.5 billion.But some analysts, including those at Jefferies, responded favorably to the revised guidance. Jefferies notably shifted its rating from Hold to Buy with a price target of $39.00 (from $38.00), driven by several key factors: the guidance adjustment is predominantly influenced by Paxlovid, Comirnaty's performance is exceeding buy-side expectations, cost reductions totaling $3.5B make the projected EPS for 2024/5 achievable, there's a promising trajectory of catalysts for investors, and the anticipated closing of the SGEN deal further solidifies their optimistic view.After a premarket slump, Pfizer shares were up some 5% to $33.74 in recent regular-session trading.Wayfair shares goosed on upgradeWayfair (NYSE:W) shares were rising 1.6% to $48.05 pre-market today after Loop Capital upgraded the company to Hold from Sell and raised its price target of $50.00 from $25.00, as reported in real time on InvestingPro.Last month the company was upgraded at Bernstein, which moved its rating from Underperform to Market Perform with a price target of $65.00 (from $60.00) on improving revenue growth and margin commentary.The company is set to report its Q3/23 earnings on Nov 1. Street estimates stand at ($0.48) for EPS and $2.98 billion for revenues.Story continuesInstacart gets several buy initiationsFollowing Instacart's ( Maplebear Inc.) (NASDAQ:CART) IPO last month, numerous Wall Street firms initiated coverage on Monday, primarily rating the company with buy-equivalent ratings.Citi, for instance, began its analysis of the company with a Buy rating, setting a price target of $34.00. Considering the 12% penetration of Online Grocery (compared to the U.S. e-commerce average of approximately 20%), coupled with Instacart’s strong tech partnerships with many leading U.S. grocers and its coverage of 95% of North American households, Citi analysts think the company has the potential to boost growth as it reinvests in customer acquisition.Stifel likewise started coverage on the company with a buy rating, setting a price target of $48.00.And other Wall Street firms - Piper Sandler, JPMorgan, and Barclays - started coverage with Overweight ratings and price targets of $36.00, $33.00, and $40.00, respectively.Two more upgradesMorgan Stanley upgraded Nice (NASDAQ:NICE) to Overweight from Equalweight with a price target of $220.00 (from $225.00).JPMorgan upgraded  Nucor (NYSE:NUE) to Neutral from Underweight with a price target of $151.00.In fast-moving markets, every second counts - and InvestingPro subscribers are always one step ahead with lightning-quick updates.Related ArticlesPfizer bags Jefferies buy call after guidance cut: 5 big analyst picksBiontech Shares Drop Amid Pfizerâs Vaccine Write-Offs, Establishment Labs Gains on FDA ClearanceLululemon shares hit nearly two-year high on S&amp;P 500 inclusion]"

17,527395d8-ba48-3059-bc5d-5d2f0e9e86f2,STT,2023-10-17,Lower NIR & Fee Income to Hurt State Street (STT) Q3 Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lower-nir-fee-income-hurt-093700380.html,1697535420,STORY,['STT'],"[State Street STT is slated to report third-quarter 2023 results on Oct 18 before the opening bell. The company’s revenues and earnings are expected to have decreased on a year-over-year basis.In the last reported quarter, STT’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were largely driven by an increase in net interest revenues (NIR) and fee revenues. STT recorded a provision benefit in the quarter under review, which was another positive. However, higher expenses hurt results to some extent.State Street has a decent earnings surprise history. The company’s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, delivering an earnings surprise of 0.84%, on average.State Street Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseState Street Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseState Street Corporation price-eps-surprise | State Street Corporation QuoteThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for State Street’s third-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.77 per share. The consensus estimate has been revised 1.1% lower over the past seven days. The figure indicates a fall of 2.8% from the year-ago quarter. Our estimate for earnings stands at $1.67, implying an 8.1% decline.The consensus estimate of $2.92 billion for sales suggests a 1.5% year-over-year decline. Our estimate for sales is the same as the consensus number.Key Factors &amp; Estimates for Q3Net Interest Revenues: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest-earning assets for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $228.7 billion, which implies a fall of 1.4% from the previous quarter. Our estimate for the metric is pegged at $224.2 billion.Lending activities continued at a slower pace in the second quarter. The Federal Reserve increased rates by 25 basis points in July and then kept the rates unchanged at 5.25-5.5% during the September FOMC meeting. These factors are expected to have supported State Street’s NIR during the quarter. However, an increase in funding costs weighed on NIR as interest rates remained high. Thus, NIR is likely to have been adversely impacted.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NIR (on a fully taxable-equivalent or FTE basis) of $600.8 million indicates a sequential decline of 13.1%. We project NIR on FTE basis of $586.9 million.Management projects NIR to decline 12-18% sequentially on non-interest-bearing deposit rotation and interest-bearing deposit betas as monetary tightening and interest rate hikes continue.Fee Revenues: Lower volatility in foreign exchange (FX) markets is likely to have aided State Street’s FX trading services income. The consensus estimate is pegged at $307.5 million, reflecting an increase of 1.5% from the prior-quarter level. Our estimate for the metric is pegged at $332 million.The consensus estimate for management fees of $468.3 million implies 1.6% growth on a sequential basis. The company expects the metric to be up 0.5-1.5% on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Our estimates for the same is pegged at $466.5 billion.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for servicing fees of $1.25 billion indicates a 1% decrease. The company anticipates the same to fall 1-2% as below-average fee repricing witnessed in the second quarter normalizes. Also, the guidance includes headwinds from previously disclosed client exits. We project the metric to be $1.24 billion.The consensus estimate for securities finance revenues of $110.3 million suggests a 5.7% decline from the last quarter. Our estimates for the same is pegged at $115 billion.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for software and processing fees suggests a 6.6% decrease to $206 million. As on-premise renewals are not expected to be at the level recorded in the second quarter, STT anticipates software and processing fees to decline 7%. Our estimates for the same is pegged at $205.2 billion.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total fee revenues of $2.25 billion indicates a 6.8% fall from the prior quarter. We project the metric to be $2.39 billion.Management expects fee revenues to be down 1-1.5% on a sequential basis.Expenses: Higher information systems and communication expenses, inflationary pressure and the company’s strategic buyouts and investments in franchises are expected to have led to a rise in operating expenses in the third quarter. Nonetheless, business restructuring activities are likely to have offered some support.Management expects adjusted expenses to be down 0.5-1% on a sequential basis.We anticipate total non-interest expenses to increase almost 1% from the last quarter to $2.2 billion.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model RevealsPer our proven model, the chances of an earnings beat for State Street this time are high.

In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Qorvo has an Earnings ESP of +4.46% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

SEM, Marathon Oil Corp. MRO, PVH Corp. PVH and KB Home KBH.Unlock the Value of Your Portfolio with 4 Low P/CF StocksWe always try to hit the jackpot while picking stocks. But striking the right chord each time is not easy unless blessed with Midas touch. When it comes to the investment market, experts consider value style as one of the most effective approaches. Value investing is essentially about selecting stocks that have good things going on for them, even at a time when they have been beaten down by some external factors.There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock’s inherent strength but a random selection of ratios cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company’s financial position. For this, we recommend Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) as one of the key metrics. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis — the lower the number, the better. Select Medical Holdings Corp., Marathon Oil Corp., PVH Corp. and KB Home boast a low P/CF ratio.Price to Cash Flow Reveals Financial HealthQuestions may arise as to why we are considering the Price to Cash Flow valuation metric, when the most widely used metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E). Well, what makes P/CF stand out is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly reflecting the financial health of a company.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. It is net cash flow that reveals how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is putting the same to use.A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company’s liquid assets. This gives the company the means to settle debt, shell out for its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Then again, a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.Story continuesWhat’s the Best Strategy?An investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and also consider the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.Here are four of the eight stocks that qualified the screening.Select Medical Holdings, one of the largest operators of critical illness recovery hospitals, rehabilitation hospitals, outpatient rehabilitation clinics, and occupational health centers, sports a Zacks Rank #1.

22,786cb75f-77c0-3133-a154-5114dd29e952,PVH,2023-10-17,Should Value Investors Buy Guess (GES) Stock?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/value-investors-buy-guess-ges-134010523.html,1697463610,STORY,"['PVH', 'GES']","[While the proven Zacks Rank places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find strong stocks, we also know that investors tend to develop their own individual strategies. With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with both ""A"" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.One company to watch right now is Guess (GES). GES is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) and an A for Value. The stock is trading with a P/E ratio of 6.87, which compares to its industry's average of 10.81. Over the past year, GES's Forward P/E has been as high as 10.08 and as low as 5.02, with a median of 6.71.Another notable valuation metric for GES is its P/B ratio of 2.15. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks solid versus its industry's average P/B of 6.07. GES's P/B has been as high as 2.74 and as low as 1.71, with a median of 2.13, over the past year.Value investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. GES has a P/S ratio of 0.42. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.5.Story continuesFinally, investors will want to recognize that GES has a P/CF ratio of 7.18. This figure highlights a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find firms that are undervalued when considering their impressive cash outlook. GES's P/CF compares to its industry's average P/CF of 19.15. GES's P/CF has been as high as 8.28 and as low as 4.89, with a median of 6.72, all within the past year.Another great Textile - Apparel stock you could consider is PVH (PVH), which is a # 2 (Buy) stock with a Value Score of A.Shares of PVH currently holds a Forward P/E ratio of 6.47, and its PEG ratio is 0.49. In comparison, its industry sports average P/E and PEG ratios of 10.81 and 1.02.PVH's price-to-earnings ratio has been as high as 11.27 and as low as 5.64, with a median of 8.11, while its PEG ratio has been as high as 1.10 and as low as 0.47, with a median of 0.58, all within the past year.Furthermore, PVH holds a P/B ratio of 0.86 and its industry's price-to-book ratio is 6.07. PVH's P/B has been as high as 1.22, as low as 0.59, with a median of 1.01 over the past 12 months.Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that Guess and PVH are likely undervalued currently. And when considering the strength of its earnings outlook, GES and PVH sticks out as one of the market's strongest value stocks.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospects.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.Here are four of the eight stocks that qualified the screening.Select Medical Holdings, one of the largest operators of critical illness recovery hospitals, rehabilitation hospitals, outpatient rehabilitation clinics, and occupational health centers, sports a Zacks Rank #1.

TMO is likely to gain in the coming quarters, backed by the strength of its M&amp;A strategy.  The company continues to fortify its industry leadership through a slew of high-impact product launches. We are also positive about Thermo Fisher’s business performance across end markets. However, competitive pressures and the impact of macroeconomic pressures are concerning for the company.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has decreased 6.6% compared with the 0.9% fall of the industry and an 18.1% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned medical and laboratory equipment provider has a market capitalization of $186.36 billion. TMO has an earnings yield of 4.63% against the industry’s -8.24%. The company’s earnings surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed in one, delivering an average surprise of 1.7%.Let’s delve deeper.UpsidesStrategic Acquisitions to Boost Growth: Thermo Fisher’s business strategy primarily includes expansion through the strategic acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment the company’s existing products and services. In August 2023, TMO acquired CorEvitas for $912.5 million in cash. The buyout of the science-led, real-world data intelligence company advances Thermo Fisher’s world-class clinical research capabilities with the leading regulatory-grade registry platform.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEarlier in June, Thermo Fisher acquired MarqMetrix, which is considered an excellent strategic fit for the company and adds highly complementary Raman-based in-line Process Analytical Technology to Thermo Fisher’s portfolio.Impressive Product Introductions: Thermo Fisher recently launched two new next-generation sequencing-based options to support preimplantation genetic testing-aneuploidy used commonly to inform in vitro fertilization and intracytoplasmic sperm injection research. During the same month, the company introduced Diomni Enterprise Software, helping streamline routine diagnostics testing for standardization and faster time to results.Story continuesThermo Fisher’s Gibco OncoPro Tumoroid Culture Medium Kit is the first commercially available culture medium specifically developed for the expansion of patient-derived tumoroids or cancer organoids from multiple cancer indications. The new-generation, fully automated (S)TEM metrology solution — the Thermo Scientific Metrios 6 Scanning Transmission Electron Microscope ((S)TEM) — is designed to help enhance productivity and deliver data quality assurance for high-volume semiconductor manufacturing.Strength in End Markets:  Of late, it has been observed that the company’s biosciences and bioproduction businesses have expanded their capacity to meet the needs of pharma and biotech customers to meet global vaccine manufacturing requirements. Additionally, the pharma services business has been providing pharma and biotech customers with the services they need to develop and produce vaccines and therapies globally.Thermo Fisher registered the strongest growth in the pharma and biotech end market in the last reported second quarter of 2023. The company registered very strong growth in the electron microscopy and chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses, as well as the research and safety market channel. The strongest growth in the end market was in analytical instrument businesses.DownsidesTough Competitive Pressure: For its diversified portfolio, Thermo Fisher faces different types of competitors, including a broad range of manufacturers and third-party distributors. The competitive landscape is quite tough with changing technology and customer demands that require continuous research and development.Macroeconomic Challenges Continue to Weigh on TMO: The challenging macroeconomic scenario and slower economic recovery in China have affected Thermo Fisher's growth. The company has been witnessing headwinds in the government and academic markets. Moreover, many countries in Europe are also going through a tough time, which might impact their academic budgets. In the second quarter of 2023, Thermo Fisher registered a year-over-year decline in sales in North America and Asia Pacific.Estimate TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 earnings per share (EPS) has remained constant at $22.37 in the past 30 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $45.53 billion.

The company’s quarterly revenues are expected to have improved year over year, while earnings are projected to have declined.In the last reported quarter, USB’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on higher expenses. Also, the deterioration of the company’s credit quality was a headwind. Nonetheless, an increase in net interest income (NII), supported by higher interest rates and loan growth, and a rise in non-interest income were positives.U.S. Bancorp has a strong surprise history. Earnings surpassed estimates in the three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average beat being 2.68%.U.S. Bancorp Price and EPS Surprise U.S. Bancorp Price and EPS SurpriseU.S. Bancorp price-eps-surprise | U.S. Bancorp QuoteThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings of $1.04 has moved 1% south in the past week. Further, the figure indicates a decline of 11.9% from the year-ago reported number.The consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $7.01 billion, suggesting growth of 11.4% from the year-earlier reported figure. Management projects adjusted total revenues in the $6.9-$7.1 billion band, whereas it reported $7.2 billion in the second quarter. The outlook includes purchase accounting accretion of around $75 million.Key Developments During the QuarterIn August 2023, USB issued 24 million shares of its common stock to MUFG Bank, a core banking subsidiary of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. MUFG for approximately $936 million. The issuance is part of a debt-to-equity conversion and will help U.S. Bancorp to meet its repayment obligation to MUFG, as agreed upon during the acquisition of MUFG Union Bank N.A.'s core regional banking franchise on Dec 1, 2022.This will increase MUFG Bank’s total shareholding in USB to 4.39% and further strengthen the strategic relationship between the two financial institutions.Story continuesThe debt/equity conversion is projected to have a positive impact on U.S. Bancorp's capital levels. It will increase Common Equity Tier 1 ratio by roughly 20 basis points, signaling a solid financial position of the company.Major Factors to Influence U.S. Bancorp’s Q3 ResultsLoan Demand &amp; NII: Given the challenging macroeconomic backdrop and high interest rates, banks’ lending activities are likely to have remained muted in the third quarter. Specifically, demand for commercial and industrial loans stayed muted in the third quarter, per Fed’s latest data. Moreover, demand for commercial real estate loans declined in the quarter under review from second-quarter end.Given U.S. Bancorp's substantial exposure to commercial and real estate loans, the company’s lending book is likely to have been affected. Nonetheless, consumer loans experienced soft demand in September compared with second-quarter 2023 end.Hence, moderate loan demand is likely to have negatively influenced USB’s average earning asset balance for the third quarter. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $604.57 billion for average earning assets indicates a 1.5% sequential decrease.Federal Reserve raised interest rates by another 25 basis points in the quarter under review. Thus, the policy rate reached 5-5.25% in July 2023, marking the 11th time FOMC has hiked interest rates in a tightening process that began in March 2022.In September, the rate hike was paused. With this, interest rates reached a target of 5.25-5.5% in the third quarter, marking the highest level in around 22 years. Such high rates are likely to have a positive impact on the company’s NII.However,an inverted yield curve, deposit migrations and higher funding costs are expected to weigh on NII and margins. Moreover, the investment securities portfolio balance dipped sequentially in second-quarter 2023, having offered limited scope for growth in interest income in the third quarter.The consensus estimate for NII (taxable-equivalent basis) suggests a 4.1% sequential tumble to $4.27 billion. The company projects the metric in the $4.2-4.4 billion range, whereas it reported $4.4 billion in the second quarter.Non-Interest Income: Market volatility and client activity were subdued in the third quarter due to seasonality. Also, risks of an economic downturn, central bank’s hawkish monetary policy stance to stem out “sticky” inflation and geopolitical concerns led to ambiguity among investors.These factors resulted in lower volatility in equity markets and other asset classes. Hence, USB is likely to have recorded a weak performance in trading revenues this time. This is expected to have hindered commercial product revenues.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for commercial products revenues is pegged at $351 million, suggesting a 2% sequential rise.In the third quarter, mortgage rates continued to increase, with the rate on 30-year fixed mortgage reaching 7.31% in September, the highest level in nearly 23 years. The climb in mortgage rates, which kept home buyers on the sidelines, led to a smaller origination market, both purchase and refinancing compared with the prior-year quarter.Hence, U.S. Bancorp is likely to have continued seeing declines in its home lending portfolio and mortgage banking revenues in third-quarter 2023. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for USB’s third-quarter 2023 mortgage banking revenues is pegged at $151 million, implying a 6.2% fall sequentially.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for income from card fees is pegged at $417 million, indicating a decline of 1.2% from the prior quarter’s reported figure. Nonetheless, the consensus mark for trust and investment management fees is pegged at $636 million, indicating a sequential rise of 2.4%.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total non-interest income is pegged at $2.76 billion, implying a rise of 1.4% on a sequential basis.Expenses: As USB continues to invest in digital initiatives, payment capabilities and technology modernization, such costs are likely to have weighed on its expense base to some extent in the to-be-reported quarter. Moreover, higher merger and integration costs and negative impacts of MUFG Union Bank’s operating expenses are expected to have increased expenditures. In fact, the company anticipates merger and integration charges to be between $150 million and $200 million.Management expects non-interest expenses (excluding merger and integration charges) of around $4.3 billion, flat from its reported figure in the second quarter. The estimate includes $120 million of core deposit intangibles amortization related to the Union Bank acquisition.Asset Quality: With expectations of a worsening macroeconomic outlook, growing recession risk and slower GDP growth, USB’s credit quality is likely to have deteriorated. Thus, it is expected to have built reserves in the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total non-performing assets of $1.2 billion implies a 10.9% jump from the prior quarter.What the Zacks Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for U.S. Bancorp this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat which is not the case here.

Don't Ignore These 2 Basic Materials Stocks Set to Beat Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/want-better-returns-dont-ignore-130005659.html,1697461205,STORY,['CF'],"[Wall Street watches a company's quarterly report closely to understand as much as possible about its recent performance and what to expect going forward. Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. CF Industries (CF) earns a Zacks Rank #2 16 days from its next quarterly earnings release on November 1, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.98 a share.CF Industries' Earnings ESP sits at 0.73%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.98 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.97.CF is one of just a large database of Basic Materials stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Bunge (BG).Slated to report earnings on October 26, 2023, Bunge holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $2.30 a share 10 days from its next quarterly update.For Bunge, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.30 is 0.22%.Story continuesCF and BG's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

""brought me back to life""Living with a disability is filled with challenges that Akuma N. knows all too well. Akuma, a folder at the Rental Location in Union, N.J., is visually impaired.The Nigerian-born employee-partner said his six-year Cintas career has provided critical personal validation. He has mastered folding multiple products in a welcoming and accepting environment.""I enjoy a lot of things about Cintas, but what I enjoy most is it bringing me back to the workforce. It makes me feel like a human again,"" Akuma said.Cintas was recognized among the ""Best Places to Work for Disability Inclusion"" after receiving a qualifying score of 90 on the 2023 Disability Equality Index®, the leading non-profit resource for business disability inclusion worldwide.At Cintas, where diversity, equity and inclusion are embedded in the culture, every October celebrates National Disability Employment Awareness Month. Employee-partners like Akuma are crucial to the company's success and are valuable members of the team.Akuma said a misconception that people with disabilities ""are useless in society"" does not exist at Cintas.""When I came to Cintas and was able to move around and work like other people, it made me feel like I'm a human being again,"" Akuma said. ""My coming to Cintas kind of brought me back to life.""Akuma arrived at Cintas through INROADS, a nonprofit that strives to foster diverse and inclusive workplaces. He said the organization helped him return to the routine of awakening early and going to work. It also provided training that prepared him for his Cintas career.Nothing was easy at first as he acclimated to his role as a folder, but over time Akuma thrived personally and professionally. He grew accustomed to the layout of his environment. He said Cintas' ""strong feeling of family"" lifted his spirits.Story continuesUnion, N.J.'s Rental Location General Manager Doug Rader said Akuma's friendly demeanor is part of the positive culture. He called Akuma a great addition to the team.""The (employee-)partners love being around him. He's always cracking jokes in the cafeteria. When he's walking around, everybody is trying to help him get where he needs to go. He always has a smile on his face and again, he loves to make jokes and keeps it very light,"" Rader said.Joking around, Akuma said, has helped his mental health as his eyesight has diminished over the years.""If I don't (joke around), I'll keep on thinking about my situation or my conditions,"" Akuma said.He doesn't have time for introspection in the folding section, where different languages sometimes necessitate creative communication - but the employee-partners' camaraderie is always strong.When Akuma isn't working, he loves to cook. He has a particular affinity for Nigerian fare.If he were to give advice to others with disabilities, it would be to seek assistance to find purpose and develop self-confidence. Akuma believes his story is just one example of what someone with a disability can do at Cintas.""I don't think I'm the only person that's in this condition,"" Akuma said.

""We've been hiring throughout the year to be sure we are ready to serve customers however they want to shop.""Stores needing extra hands will offer workers additional hours and hire more as necessary, a spokesperson said on Monday.The holiday shopping season traditionally begins on the day after Thanksgiving, which falls on Nov. 23 this year, and ends on Christmas, but has been starting earlier every year. The period accounts for more than a third of annual income for most U.S. retailers.Walmart, like other retail chains, has been cautious in its holiday season outlook, saying customers are stressed by high food prices, depleted savings and higher interest rates. This could make them hold back on buying top holiday items, like electronics, apparel and home goods, its executives have said.Rising labor costs are also a factor.""There is a greater sense from retailers that they are going to have increasingly higher costs of labor that they cannot pass down to consumers who are feeling the pinch of rising interest rates,"" said Andrew Challenger, senior vice president of Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas.Retailers are also asking employees for more help with staffing this year, said Neil Costa, founder of recruitment marketing company HireClix.""There's a bigger push for referrals in the retail market than there was previously versus just putting all the money into advertising.""Seasonal hiring by U.S. retailers is set to drop to levels last seen in 2008, a Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas report showed, while holiday sales are estimated to grow at their slowest in five years.Story continuesWalmart's LinkedIn post about hiring was unusual, after years of public announcements about its hiring numbers and job openings. The statement from America's largest private employer with 1.7 million employees offered analysts insight into possible holiday shopping results.Last year, Walmart said it would hire 40,000 workers. The LinkedIn post did not state a hiring target for this year.Except for Amazon, which plans to hire 250,000 holiday season workers, several other U.S. chains including Macy's have issued muted hiring plans for the period.While U.S. retail job applications are up 46%, job openings are down 25% and actual retail hiring is down by 12% in the year through September, according to talent acquisition company iCIMS.In Britain, retailers such as Sainsbury's and Marks &amp; Spencer anticipate hiring more temporary workers than last year, despite one in three Britons planning to cut back on Christmas spending.(Reporting by Siddharth Cavale in New York; Editing by Mark Porter and Richard Chang)]"

Hunt that are eyeing blockchain and crypto.Arkansas “is home to innovative entrepreneurs, major corporations with global reach and policymakers including Rep. French Hill and Sen. John Boozman, both of whom have taken an interest in digital asset technology,” a Haun executive said.Cryptocurrency-focused investment firms Coinbase Ventures and Haun Ventures are backing a technology accelerator program at the University of Arkansas, noting the southern state’s mix of entrepreneurs and large corporations, as well as some influential policymakers.Referring to Arkansas’ potential when it comes to shaping policy around crypto, Tomicah Tillemann, chief policy officer at Haun Ventures, said Arkansas is at the confluence of a number of forces shaping the landscape around blockchain technology and digital assets.“The state is home to innovative entrepreneurs, major corporations with global reach and policymakers including Rep. French Hill and Sen. John Boozman, both of whom have taken an interest in digital asset technology. All of this makes Arkansas a great place to work with the startup community,” Tillemann told Coindesk.Coinbase and Haun are embracing a model seen elsewhere in the U.S., where many universities have tech-focused programs where corporations can set up shop to recruit students as interns. For example, Jump Trading, the Chicago-based crypto and traditional financial trading giant, had a group at the University of Illinois' Research Park; Jump Crypto President Kanav Kariya joined the company through that program.The collapse of FTX last year caused alarm among lawmakers, not least because of disgraced boss Sam Bankman-Fried’s energetic solicitation of Capitol Hill to try and shape favorable regulation of crypto.To some extent, Coinbase Ventures and Haun Ventures are preaching to the converted in Arkansas: Hill, the vice chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, also chairs a subcommittee on digital assets; Boozman, the ranking member on the Senate Agriculture Committee, is a co-sponsor of the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act (known colloquially as the “SBF Bill” because of being backed by the now-disgraced FTX founder).Story continuesTillemann of Haun Ventures pointed to other states which could be usefully targeted to boost crypto jobs and adoption, and also further policy discussions, similar to blockchain-focused Bounds Accelerator in Arkansas.“There’s a great deal of engagement going on right now across the 50 states,” Tillemann said in an interview. “Arkansas is a very compelling example for a variety of reasons. But there are important conversations with founders and policymakers underway in places like Ohio and Montana and many other jurisdictions that are part of this evolving story of building the next generation of the internet.”Shan Aggarwal, head of corporate development and ventures at Coinbase, pointed to large firms based in Arkansas like Walmart, Tyson Foods and J.B. Hunt, adding that blockchain tech can help streamline areas like supply chain management. (Walmart’s extensive explorations into so-called enterprise blockchain with the likes of IBM have been well documented.)“I wouldn’t describe it as enterprise blockchain,” Aggarwal said in an interview. “But I do think there’s a rising tide of interest in blockchain and crypto technology from large enterprises like Walmart. Some of them are thinking about that more for enterprise use cases, such as helping revolutionize their supply chain, others are thinking about it more from a community or end consumer engagement perspective.”The 16-week Bounds accelerator program is now accepting applications from startups with a U.S.-based location or representative until Nov. 3. The program begins on Jan. 8, 2024, and is bookended by an in-person orientation and demo day event in Bentonville, with weekly remote learning and mentoring sessions.]"

40,2a3d80c4-e032-3a58-916b-b7b3bfbf0429,MMC,2023-10-17,Brown & Brown (BRO) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brown-brown-bro-reports-next-140015450.html,1697464815,STORY,"['BRO', 'MMC']","[Brown &amp; Brown (BRO) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 23. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis insurance company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.61 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +22%.Revenues are expected to be $1.03 billion, up 10.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 4.44% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Brown &amp; Brown?For Brown &amp; Brown, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +4.92%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Brown &amp; Brown will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Brown &amp; Brown would post earnings of $0.59 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.68, delivering a surprise of +15.25%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Brown &amp; Brown appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerMarsh &amp; McLennan (MMC), another stock in the Zacks Insurance - Brokerage industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $1.38 for the quarter ended September 2023. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +17%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $5.19 billion, up 8.8% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Marsh &amp; McLennan has been revised 1.9% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.56%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that Marsh &amp; McLennan will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

43,4dc34339-d7c8-3f06-90af-0d4f5600f9fb,XYL,2023-10-17,Should You Investigate Xylem Inc. (NYSE:XYL) At US$90.17?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investigate-xylem-inc-nyse-xyl-123933252.html,1697459973,STORY,['XYL'],"[Xylem Inc. (NYSE:XYL) saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$114 and falling to the lows of US$89.52. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Xylem's current trading price of US$90.17 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Xylem’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Xylem Is Xylem Still Cheap?According to my valuation model, Xylem seems to be fairly priced at around 13% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Xylem today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $103.69, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Xylem’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What kind of growth will Xylem generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Xylem. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? XYL’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on XYL, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 2 warning signs with Xylem, and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you are no longer interested in Xylem, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

44,878da073-0f33-317e-889b-00f5f7c3e9c2,XYL,2023-10-17,7 Infrastructure Stocks to Snap Up as Government Spending Jumps,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-infrastructure-stocks-snap-government-201741254.html,1696969061,STORY,"['GBX', 'VMC', 'XYL', 'CAT', 'PWR']","[For the second straight year, American states will receive huge amounts of money allocated by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. For example,  New York state is getting $2.76 billion for the current fiscal year, Vermont is receiving $329 million, and Oregon is obtaining $757 million. Most of these funds will be used to bankroll traditional transportation projects, such as roads, bridges, and tunnels.Meanwhile, the Department of Transportation is devoting  $1.4 billion to improving the nation’s “rail infrastructure.” U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell announced on Sept. 25. that the funds would be spent on “70 projects across the nation to improve rail safety, strengthen supply chains and passenger rail service.”And just last week, the Environmental Protection Agency allocated $7.5 billion for “low-interest loans” which will finance the development of  “infrastructure for drinking water, wastewater and stormwater projects.” Here are seven infrastructure stocks that should get big boosts from all of this government spending.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsVulcan Materials Company (VMC)The Vulcan Materials (VMC) website is displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: madamF / Shutterstock.comVulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC) provides various materials used in construction, including asphalt, concrete, sand, and gravel. The company is poised to  get a big boost from the many extra tens of billions of dollars that will be spent by American states on building highways, bridges, streets and tunnels over the next year.Likely partially driven by state governments’ huge spending on infrastructure last year, VMC’s “mix adjusted sales price” climbed 15% last quarter versus the same period a year earlier, and the firm reported that it expected strong price increases to boost its “profitability” going forward.VMC added that the “cash gross profit” of its asphalt business “nearly tripled (year-over-year)…to $66 million.” Governments’ elevated spending on traditional infrastructure had a major impact on the profits of VMC’s asphalt unit.Story continuesOverall, VMC’s EBITDA, excluding certain items, soared to $595 million last quarter from $450 million during the same period a year earlier.Given VMC’s strong growth and excellent prospects, the company’s forward price-earnings ratio of 26 is quite attractive.Given these points, it is one of the best infrastructure stocks to buy.Greenbrier (GBX)The Greenbrier Companies (GBX)logo on the website homepageSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comA leading provider of equipment for trains, Greenbrier (NYSE:GBX) can benefit in two ways from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. First, as I mentioned in the introduction, Washington is going to spend $1.4 billion on measures to  “improve rail safety…and passenger rail service.”  A portion of those funds should find their way into GBX’s accounts.Secondly,  because “railroads haul components used in construction,” Greenbrier should get more orders as a result of Washington’s spending on roads, bridges, and tunnels.Aside from government funds, GBX is also likely getting a boost from the onshoring trend, which has resulted in record spending on factory construction.Greenbrier recently announced that it had received an impressive total of $1.9 billion in orders last quarter.Quanta Services (PWR)An image of a man charging an electric car with icons for renewable energy sources in the background; renewable energy gridSource: petovarga/ShutterstockAs I noted in a previous column, “Quanta (NYSE:PWR) builds…electrical power stations, (and) facilities for renewable energy and natural gas transmission.” It also provides “infrastructure” for electric utilities.PWR should get a significant portion of the $14 billion allocated by the Infrastructure Law “for enhancing the reliability, resilience, and efficiency of the electric grid.”And as I noted in my prior article, PWR is also benefiting tremendously from the energy transition. For example, it was chosen to play a major role in two multi-billion dollar renewable energy projects in the Western U.S.: SunZia Wind  and SunZia Transmission.Last quarter, the company’s net income jumped to $165.9 million from $88 million during the same period a year earlier.Given the company’s rapid profit growth, its forward price-earnings ratio of 20 times is quite low.Sterling Infrastructure (STRL)Cars on an urban highway driving into the sunsetSource: Anna Kraynova / ShutterstockTexas-based Sterling (NASDAQ:STRL) carries out “infrastructure and rehabilitation projects for highways, roads, bridges, airports, ports, light rail, water, wastewater, and storm drainage systems” on behalf of various governments.As a result, the company is well-positioned to benefit from multiple parts of the Infrastructure Law, including the funds that will be spent by states on roads and highways, the $7.5 billion that Washington will provide to enhance water infrastructure, and the $1.4 billion that it’s spending on improving “rail infrastructure.”Last quarter, Sterling’s top line jumped 13% year-over-year to $522 million, while its net income soared 40% YOY to $49.5 million.On July 21, Sterling announced that it had been awarded a large portion of a $216 million “design-build contract….by the Utah Department of Transportation.”I believe that Sterling will also get a boost from Texas’ rapid population growth and resulting need for new and wider roads.Xylemxylem appSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comXylem (NYSE:XYL) “engages in the design, manufacture, and servicing of engineered products and solutions for the water and wastewater applications.”  As a result, the company should get a lift from the $7.5 billion that Washington will provide to bankroll improved “infrastructure for drinking water, wastewater and stormwater projects.”Earlier this year, Xylem acquired Evoqua, another company in the water infrastructure sector which I wrote about in an August 2022 column. On Evoqua’s Q3 earnings call, its CEO predicted that the firm would start to obtain revenue from the Infrastructure Law in the second half of 2023. Consequently, I expect Xylem to get a major boost from the legislation in upcoming quarters.In the wake of Xylem’s acquisition of Evoqua, investment bank Robert Baird upgraded the stock to “outperform.” The bank believes that XYL can “outperform” in any sort of economy while it is well-positioned to increase its profits.Granite Construction (GVA)Railroad tracks with a junctionSource: ShutterstockGranite (NYSE:GVA) carries out the construction of roads, bridges, and rail lines. It also provides materials, such as asphalt, used in construction and implements water improvement projects.Of course, GVA is very well-positioned to benefit from multiple portions of the Infrastructure Law,  including Washington’s investments in roads, bridges, railroads, and water infrastructure.In August, Granite announced that it had been selected to carry out a $73 million water improvement project in Utah.Last quarter, the company’s top line jumped 17% year-over-year to $899 million, while its earnings per share, excluding certain one-time items, gained  $12 million versus Q2 of 2022  to $46 million.Caterpillar (CAT)Image of a yellow construction vehicle with the Caterpillar (CAT) logo on itSource: astudio / Shutterstock.comCaterpillar (NYSE:CAT) sells construction equipment such as excavators, haulers, backhoes, and bulldozers.As a result, the company should get a lift from Washington’s huge spending on building roads, bridges, and tunnels. Additionally, the firm should be helped by the current record spending on building factories amid the onshoring trend.Moreover, CAT sells equipment used to search for and extract oil, so the company should get a lift from the current high oil prices.In the second quarter, CAT’s revenue jumped 22% year-over-year to $17.3 billion, while its earnings per share soared to $5.67 from $3.13 during the same period a year earlier.Given the company’s strong growth and excellent prospects, its forward price-earnings ratio of 13 is quite low.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

If you want to skip our analysis of the technology industry, then take a look at 5 Technology Stocks To Buy That Are Too Cheap To Ignore. Technology has proven to be the most remarkable industry of our age since it has virtually (no pun intended) transformed every aspect of modern day living. We've written this article using technology, you're using technology to read this article, and the stocks that everyone is trading are now available through digital mediums that would have been unimaginable just a couple of decades back.Before we get to the financial bit about the technology industry it's important to understand what the term actually means. Due to its near ubiquity in modern day living, technology is simply defined as the use of knowledge involving technical processes to achieve an objective. In a broad definition, this adaptability of technical processes to different use cases naturally affects a lot of different walks of life. At its very heart, technology can also be defined as using an electronic system to speed up data collection, analysis, and computation - three things that can power anything from the iPhone to a data center, an airplane, or a car.Since computing sits at the heart of technology, one of the most important segments of the technology industry is the semiconductor sector. A semiconductor is a small piece of silicon with circuits made of different materials printed on top of it. The smaller these circuits get, the greater the semiconductor's performance since small feature sizes lead to greater power savings and electrical conductivity. This criticality of semiconductors, also called chips, to the global technological landscape has also made semiconductors one of the most controversial and risky industries these days.This is because the high end technologies involved in making chips coupled with the billions of dollars in capital expenditure needed to set up a new chip manufacturing plant mean that the barriers of entry to this industry are among the highest in the world and stand in parallel to other high tech sectors such as rocket and aircraft manufacturing. Consequently, only three companies in the world, namely the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), and Samsung Electronics can make the latest chips, with others limited to older models. Out of these, only TSMC and Samsung sell their chips to third party customers such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) since Intel only makes and sells its own chips.Story continuesWhy is this important? Well, TSMC is the biggest contract chip manufacturer in the world in terms of volume and all of its advanced chip manufacturing facilities are located in the disputed island of Taiwan. Taiwan and China share a common history, and Beijing considers it an integral part of its territory even though Taiwan has its own passport and holds its own elections. Therefore, the island's status is a cause of significant friction between China and the Western rules based order led by the United States, and one of the biggest worries in the chip sector is that a potential conflict in China can disrupt the global semiconductor supply chain to lead to unimaginable consequences.The potential repercussions of such a conflict are so significant that they even made the well known Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway to change his mind. Mr. Buffett's investment firm made headlines at the end of last year as its filings with the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) revealed that it had bought a whopping 60 million TSMC shares for a $4.1 billion investment for its third quarter of 2022 investments. Since Mr. Buffett takes his sweet time before investing, the decision suggested that TSMC could do nothing wrong. However, in the very next quarter, Berkshire Hathaway reduced its stake by an equally stunning $3.5 billion and disposed off of the shares entirely in the succeeding quarter. The $3.5 billion reduction made waves in the industry as speculation started to become rife about the reason behind the Oracle of Omaha's sudden shift of mood.Mr. Buffett explained his decision soon, sharing that he believes that TSMC is a solid company but the firm's geopolitical risks simply proved too much to ignore. According to CNN which quotes several of his statements:“I feel better about the capital that we’ve got deployed in Japan than in Taiwan,” the Berkshire Hathaway chairman added. “I wish it weren’t sold, but I think that’s a reality.”Despite the share sale, Buffett lauded TSMC as “one of the best-managed companies and [most] important companies in the world.”“There’s no one in the chip industry that’s in their league, at least in my view,” he said.“Marvelous people and marvelous competitive position and everything, [but] I’d rather find it in the United States.”Buffett said his reassessment of the company was in “light of certain things that were going on.” He had previously pointed to geopolitical tensions as a concern.Before we get to our latest pick of the cheapest technology stocks, it's also important to briefly consider the current investment climate for these stocks. The technology sector is a growth industry that depends on robust purchasing power for both businesses and consumers as well as easy access to capital due to expensive products and services. These days, technology stocks are under pressure as high rates and troubling economic data have dampened investors' risk appetites. Therefore, the major catalysts for the sector as a whole are announcements regarding interest rate cuts as well as economic growth since a slowing economy sees capital fly to safety in sectors such as consumer defensive.So, time to look at some great cheap technology stocks, and some notable picks are QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM).13 Technology Stocks To Buy That Are Too Cheap To IgnoreA Wall Street trader on the phone, quickly executing a technology-driven trade.

Analysts presented their findings during Gartner IT Symposium/Xpo, which is taking place here through Thursday.""Technology disruptions and socioeconomic uncertainties require willingness to act boldly and strategically enhance resilience over ad hoc responses,"" said Bart Willemsen, VP Analyst at Gartner. ""IT leaders are in a unique position to strategically lay down a roadmap where technology investments help their business's sustenance of success amidst these uncertainties and pressures.""""They and other executives must evaluate the impacts and benefits of strategic technology trends, but this is no small task given the increasing rate of technological innovation,"" said Chris Howard, Distinguished VP Analyst and Chief of Research at Gartner. ""For example, generative and other types of AI offer new opportunities and drive several trends. But deriving business value from the durable use of AI requires a disciplined approach to widespread adoption along with attention to the risks.""The top strategic technology trends for 2024 are:Democratized Generative AIGenerative AI (GenAI) is becoming democratized by the confluence of massively pretrained models, cloud computing and open source, making these models accessible to workers worldwide. By 2026, Gartner predicts that over 80% of enterprises will have used GenAI APIs and models and/or deployed GenAI-enabled applications in production environments, up from less than 5% early 2023.GenAI applications can make vast sources of information — internal and external — accessible and available to business users. This means the rapid adoption of GenAI will significantly democratize knowledge and skills in the enterprise. Large language models enable enterprises to connect their workers with knowledge in a conversational style with rich semantic understanding.Story continuesAI Trust, Risk and Security ManagementThe democratization of access to AI has made the need for AI Trust, Risk and Security Management (TRiSM) even more urgent and clear. Without guardrails, AI models can rapidly generate compounding negative effects that spin out of control, overshadowing any positive performance and societal gains that AI enables. AI TRiSM provides tooling for ModelOps, proactive data protection, AI-specific security, model monitoring (including monitoring for data drift, model drift, and/or unintended outcomes) and risk controls for inputs and outputs to third-party models and applications.Gartner predicts that by 2026, enterprises that apply AI TRiSM controls will increase the accuracy of their decision making by eliminating up to 80% of faulty and illegitimate information.AI-Augmented DevelopmentAI-augmented development is the use of AI technologies, such as GenAI and machine learning, to aid software engineers in designing, coding and testing applications. AI-assisted software engineering improves developer productivity and enables development teams to address the increasing demand for software to run the business. These AI-infused development tools allow software engineers to spend less time writing code, so they can spend more time on more strategic activities such as the design and composition of compelling business applications.Intelligent ApplicationsIntelligent applications include intelligence — which Gartner defines as learned adaptation to respond appropriately and autonomously — as a capability. This intelligence can be utilized in many use cases to better augment or automate work. As a foundational capability, intelligence in applications comprises various AI-based services, such as machine learning, vector stores and connected data. Consequently, intelligent applications deliver experiences that dynamically adapt to the user.A clear need and demand for intelligent applications exists. Twenty-six percent of CEOs in the 2023 Gartner CEO and Senior Business Executive Survey cited the talent shortage as the most damaging risk for their organization. Attracting and retaining talent is CEOs’ top workforce priority, while AI was named the technology that will most significantly impact their industries over the next three years.Augmented-Connected WorkforceThe augmented-connected workforce (ACWF) is a strategy for optimizing the value derived from human workers. The need to accelerate and scale talent is driving the ACWF trend. The ACWF uses intelligent applications and workforce analytics to provide everyday context and guidance to support the workforce’s experience, well-being, and ability to develop its own skills. At the same time, the ACWF drives business results and positive impact for key stakeholders.Through 2027, 25% of CIOs will use augmented-connected workforce initiatives to reduce time to competency by 50% for key roles.Continuous Threat Exposure ManagementContinuous threat exposure management (CTEM) is a pragmatic and systemic approach that allows organizations to evaluate the accessibility, exposure and exploitability of an enterprise’s digital and physical assets continually and consistently. Aligning CTEM assessment and remediation scopes with threat vectors or business projects, rather than an infrastructure component, surfaces not only the vulnerabilities, but also unpatchable threats.By 2026, Gartner predicts that organizations prioritizing their security investments based on a CTEM program will realize a two-thirds reduction in breaches.Machine CustomersMachine customers (also called 'custobots') are nonhuman economic actors that can autonomously negotiate and purchase goods and services in exchange for payment. By 2028, 15 billion connected products will exist with the potential to behave as customers, with billions more to follow in the coming years. This growth trend will be the source of trillions of dollars in revenues by 2030 and eventually become more significant than the arrival of digital commerce. Strategic considerations should include opportunities to either facilitate these algorithms and devices, or even create new custobots.Sustainable TechnologySustainable technology is a framework of digital solutions used to enable environmental, social and governance (ESG) outcomes that support long-term ecological balance and human rights. The use of technologies such as AI, cryptocurrency, the Internet of Things and cloud computing is driving concern about the related energy consumption and environmental impacts. This makes it more critical to ensure that the use of IT becomes more efficient, circular and sustainable. In fact, Gartner predicts that by 2027, 25% of CIOs will see their personal compensation linked to their sustainable technology impact.Platform EngineeringPlatform engineering is the discipline of building and operating self-service internal development platforms. Each platform is a layer, created and maintained by a dedicated product team, designed to support the needs of its users by interfacing with tools and processes. The goal of platform engineering is to optimize productivity, the user experience and accelerate delivery of business value.Industry Cloud PlatformsBy 2027, Gartner predicts more than 70% of enterprises will use industry cloud platforms (ICPs) to accelerate their business initiatives, up from less than 15% in 2023. ICPs address industry-relevant business outcomes by combining underlying SaaS, PaaS and IaaS services into a whole product offering with composable capabilities. These typically include an industry data fabric, a library of packaged business capabilities, composition tools and other platform innovations. ICPs are tailored cloud proposals specific to an industry and can further be tailored to an organization’s needs.This year's top strategic technology trends highlight those trends that will drive significant disruption and opportunity for CIOs and other IT leaders within the next 36 months.

This shift provides two key focus areas for CIOs and IT executives as AI becomes an enterprise initiative, not just an IT initiative.""GenAI is not just a technology or just a business trend. It is a profound shift in how humans and machines interact,"" said Mary Mesaglio, Distinguished VP Analyst at Gartner. ""We are moving from what machines can do for us to what machines can be for us. Machines are evolving from being our tools to becoming our teammates. Gartner predicts that by 2025, GenAI will be a workforce partner for 90% of companies worldwide.""""CIOs have a major role in how they shape AI and how AI shapes us,"" said Don Scheibenreif, Distinguished VP Analyst at Gartner. ""According to recent Gartner surveys of CEOs, CIOs are their number one choice to unlock the value of GenAI.""During the opening keynote of Gartner IT Symposium/Xpo, which is taking place here through Thursday, Gartner analysts told the audience of over 8,000 CIOs and IT executives to prioritize two areas to unleash the possibility of AI over the next 12-24 months – decide their AI Ambition and become AI-Ready.Decide Your AI AmbitionThere are two flavors of AI:Everyday AI is focused on productivity. The machine is a productivity partner. It enables workers to do what they already do faster and more efficiently. Currently, 77% of CIOs and technology leaders worldwide are focused on the opportunities of everyday AI. ""It is important to note that everyday AI will go from dazzling to ordinary with outrageous speed,"" said Mesaglio. ""Everyone will have access to the same tools, and it will not provide a sustainable competitive advantage. Everyday AI is the new table stakes.""Game-changing AI is focused primarily on creativity. ""It doesn’t just make us faster or better. Either it creates new results, via AI-enabled products and services; or it creates new ways to create new results, such as with AI-enabled new core capabilities. With game-changing AI, machines will disrupt business models and entire industries,"" said Mesaglio.Story continues""More and more AI will be jointly delivered by IT and the wider enterprise,"" said Scheibenreif. ""To succeed, the whole executive team must be engaged. This provides a tremendous opportunity for CIOs to make a difference.""CIOs can help their CEO and CxO peers cut through AI complexity and define their organization’s AI ambition by examining the opportunities and risks of using GenAI in four areas: the back office, the front office, new products and services, and new core capabilities (See Figure 1).Be AI-Ready""As AI continues transforming the relationship between humans and machines, CIOs must actively shape the nature of this change,"" said Scheibenreif. ""In this new era of human-machine interaction, there will be many unforeseen consequences.""""A technology decision is not just a technology decision anymore. It is a technology, economic, social and ethical decision all at once,"" said Mesaglio. ""To navigate decisions about AI in their organization, CIOs and IT leaders need lighthouse principles — a vision for AI that lights the way and says what kind of human-machine relationships they will and will not accept.""However, few organizations have established lighthouse principles or even a clear vision for AI. A Gartner survey in June 2023 of 606 CIOs and technology leaders found that only 9% of organizations have an AI vision statement in place, and more than one-third of respondents had no plans to create an AI vision statement.To facilitate swift and safe adoption of generative AI in the next 12 months, organizations must do three things:Establish AI-ready principles: Lighthouse principles must align with the values of the organization. The organization’s values must be the guiding light for navigating the unknowns of how humans and machines will interact.Make data AI-ready: For data to be AI-ready, it must meet five criteria. It is secure, enriched, fair, accurate and is governed by the lighthouse principles.Implement AI-ready security: For every positive use of AI, someone is putting that same technology to negative use. This is the dark side of AI. CIOs should prepare for new attack vectors and work with the executive team to create an acceptable use policy for public generative AI solutions.""The era of AI-powered business will lead to unintended consequences without advance planning. CIOs need a way to light the way forward, even when everything seems new or murky,"" said Scheibenreif. ""To safely harness this disruption, CIOs must work with executive leaders to define their ambitions for using everyday AI and game-changing AI, and to establish AI-ready principles, data and security.""About Gartner IT Symposium/XpoGartner IT Symposium/Xpo is the world's most important gathering for CIOs and other IT executives.

It appeared to put the situation on hold for a day at least.The 1%-plus rally in the S&amp;P 500, which was the best start to the week since February, was matched by a retreat in crude oil, gold and Treasury bond prices and the dollar.Global stocks in Asia and Europe aped at least some of that bounce overnight, but Wall St futures ticked back a touch ahead of Tuesday's opening bell. U.S. crude held steady and Treasury yields crept higher.But after impressive Q3 readouts from JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Citigroup on Friday, markets are braced on Tuesday for updates from Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Bank of New York Mellon.Reflecting the optimism around how banks and financials are benefitting from a higher interest rate world and rising asset management growth, Charles Schwab shares also jumped 4.7% on Monday as the brokerage posted a smaller-than-expected drop in quarterly profit.Third-quarter earnings for S&amp;P 500 companies are estimated to have increased 2.2% year-over-year, up from an estimated increase of 1.3% a week earlier, according to LSEG data.Story continuesBut a welter of economic numbers will barrel into the mix today too - chief among them the September retail sales release, but also industrial output data and an October reading on U.S. housing. Canada's latest consumer price data will be also be closely eyed.And a full schedule of Federal Reserve speakers tees up Fed boss Jerome Powell's public appearance on Thursday.Before then, bond markets will have to negotiate tomorrow's 20-year Treasury auction.The relatively new 20-year tenor has often proved unpopular and will be watched closely after a poor reception for the latest 30-year bond last week. But with yields back above 5% and close to record highs of 5.25% set earlier this month, it will be an interesting test of investor appetite to grab these elevated long-term coupons.Another key moment on the radar is China's third-quarter GDP release on Wednesday - but angst about the ongoing property sector bust there just won't go away.Country Garden's entire offshore debt will be deemed to be in default if China's largest private property developer fails to make a $15 million coupon payment on Tuesday, the end of a 30-day grace period.And non-payment of this tranche is set to trigger cross defaults in other bonds as is standard in bond contracts.To add to the complication of foreign investment in China, Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in Beijing to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping on a widely watched trip aimed at showcasing the trust and ""no-limits"" partnership between the countries even as the war in Ukraine raged on.Elsewhere, there was some relief for the Bank of England amid signs of ebbing wage growth for the first time since January. That helped drag back government gilt yields and the pound slightly lower. Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Tuesday: * U.S. corporate earnings: Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Bank of New York Mellon, Lockheed Martin, Johnson &amp; Johnson, United Airlines, Omnicom, Prologis, JB Hunt, * U.S. Sept retail sales, industrial production, Aug business and retail inventories, Oct NAHB housing index; Canada Sept consumer price inflation, housing starts * Federal Reserve Board Governor Michelle Bowman, New York Fed President John Williams, Minneapolis Fed chief Neel Kashkari and Richmond Fed chief Tom Barkin all speak; European Central Bank board member Luis de Guindos speaks in Frankfurt * U.S. President Joe Biden and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz travel to Israel * ECOFIN meeting of European Union finance ministers in Luxembourg(By Mike Dolan, editing by XXXX mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com.

That lifted the less volatile four-week average to about 3.36 million barrels a day.The increase came from a jump in Black Sea flows to a six-week high and a recovery in shipments from the Arctic port of Murmansk after a slump in the previous week.Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said in early August that Moscow would prolong export restrictions at a reduced level of 300,000 barrels a day below their May-June average until the end of the year. Bloomberg calculations indicate that shipments through ports should be running now at about 3.28 million barrels a day.Four-week average shipments have been creeping up relative to that target since the start of September, exceeding it by abut 80,000 barrels a day in the most recent period. That said, compliance has so far been good compared with the country’s past performance against OPEC+ targets. Since the export restriction was introduced at the start of August, flows have averaged about 15,000 barrels a day below their required level, assuming pipeline deliveries have remained unchanged.The increase in volumes raised the Kremlin’s weekly revenues from oil export duties, while the four-week average rose for an 11th straight week, setting a new high for the period since mid-January.Story continuesRussia’s rising oil income has called into question the effectiveness of the price cap imposed on its exports by the Group of Seven nations and European Union that’s supposed to restrict it. The US Treasury responded by imposing sanctions on two tankers accused of carrying cargoes sold at prices above the $60-a-barrel ceiling. The sanctions are the first time there’s been an effort to enforce the cap since it came into effect in December.Russia’s oil refiners are increasing daily processing rates as October progresses. Oil processing in the country rose by the most in more than a month in the week ended Oct. 11. But ongoing maintenance and temporary diesel export restrictions, which have now been lifted, meant that rates during the Oct. 1-11 period totaled about 150,000 barrels a day below the average for most of September.Flows by DestinationRussia’s seaborne crude flows rose in four weeks to Oct. 15 averaged 3.36 million barrels a day. That’s the highest since July 4 and up from 3.26 million barrels a day in the period to Oct. 8. Shipments remain about 220,000 barrels a day below the highs seen between April and June.All figures exclude cargoes identified as Kazakhstan’s KEBCO grade. Those are shipments made by KazTransoil JSC that transit Russia for export through Novorossiysk and the Baltic port of Ust-Luga and are not subject to European Union sanctions or a price cap.The Kazakh barrels are blended with crude of Russian origin to create a uniform export grade. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Kazakhstan has rebranded its cargoes to distinguish them from those shipped by Russian companies.AsiaMost Read from BloombergIsrael Latest: Blinken Works on Gaza Aid as Biden Set to VisitPutin Arrives in China to Meet Xi on Rare International TripBiden Plans High-Stakes Israel Visit to Keep War From EscalatingYour Guide to Understanding the Roots of the Israel-Hamas WarUS Yields Rise as Hot Economic Data Fuel Fed Bets: Markets WrapObserved shipments to Russia’s Asian customers, including those showing no final destination, rose for a third week. Flows edged higher to 2.95 million barrels a day in the four weeks to Oct. 15, from a revised 2.86 million barrels a day in the period to Oct. 8. That’s still well below a peak of about 3.6 million barrels a day seen in May.Even if all of the cargoes on ships without an initial destination eventually end up in India, shipments to the country will still be about 450,000 barrels a day, or 21%, down from their May high. Adding the “Unknown Asia” and “Other Unknown” volumes to the total for India gives a figure of 1.7 million barrels a day in the four weeks to Oct. 15. That’s the most in 15 weeks, but down from a high of 2.15 million barrels a day in the period to May 21.The equivalent of about 210,000 barrels a day was on vessels signaling Port Said or Suez in Egypt, or are expected to be transferred from one ship to another off the South Korean port of Yeosu. Those voyages typically end at ports in India or China and show up in the chart below as “Unknown Asia” until a final destination becomes apparent.The “Other Unknown” volumes, running at about 260,000 barrels a day in the four weeks to Oct. 15, are those on tankers showing no clear destination. Most of those cargoes originate from Russia’s western ports and go on to transit the Suez Canal, but some could end up in Turkey. Others could be moved from one vessel to another, with most such transfers now taking place in the Mediterranean.EuropeMost Read from BloombergIsrael Latest: Blinken Works on Gaza Aid as Biden Set to VisitPutin Arrives in China to Meet Xi on Rare International TripBiden Plans High-Stakes Israel Visit to Keep War From EscalatingYour Guide to Understanding the Roots of the Israel-Hamas WarUS Yields Rise as Hot Economic Data Fuel Fed Bets: Markets WrapRussia’s seaborne crude exports to European countries fell to equal their lowest level in 14 weeks of about 125,000 barrels a day in the 28 days to Oct. 15, with Bulgaria the sole destination. These figures do not include shipments to Turkey.A market that consumed about 1.5 million barrels a day of short-haul seaborne crude, coming from export terminals in the Baltic, Black Sea and Arctic has been lost almost completely, to be replaced by long-haul destinations in Asia that are much more costly and time-consuming to serve.No Russian crude was shipped to northern European countries in the four weeks to Oct. 15.Exports to Turkey, Russia’s only remaining Mediterranean customer, jumped to about 290,000 barrels a day in the four weeks to Oct. 15. That’s the highest in eleven months. Flows had topped 425,000 barrels a day in October 2022, before falling sharply after a Group of Seven price cap came into effect in early December.The jump in flows comes after Lukoil resumed deliveries to the Azerbaijani-owned Star refinery at Aliaga. Supplies are expected at about 100,000 barrels a day, equivalent to half of the refinery’s capacity.Flows to Bulgaria, now Russia’s only Black Sea market for crude, fell to a six-week low of about 125,000 barrels a day. High levels of imports seen in recent weeks have come despite lawmakers recently approving a motion to end Bulgaria’s dependence on Russian crude sooner than permitted under a European Union import ban.Flows by Export LocationAggregate flows of Russian crude rebounded, making up more than half of the previous week’s drop. Seaborne exports averaged 3.51 million barrels a day in the seven days to Oct. 15. The increase of about 285,000 barrels a day was driven by higher flows from the Arctic and the Black Sea.Figures exclude volumes from Ust-Luga and Novorossiysk identified as Kazakhstan’s KEBCO grade.Vessel-tracking data are cross-checked against port agent reports as well as flows and ship movements reported by other information providers including Kpler and Vortexa Ltd.Export RevenueInflows to the Kremlin's war chest from its crude-export duty jumped to $80 million in the seven days to Oct. 15, while four-week average income edged up to $73 million. The four-week average set a new high for the period since mid-January. Rising oil prices and the rebound in flows are both contributing to the increase in receipts.Russia’s government calculates oil taxes — including export duty — using a discount to global benchmark Brent, which sets the floor price for the nation’s crude for budget purposes. If Russian oil trades above that threshold, the Finance Ministry uses the market price for tax calculations, as has been the case in recent months. The discount used to calculate taxes including export duty is set at $20 a barrel for September and subsequent months.The duty rate for October has been set at $3.26 a barrel, based on an average Urals price of $77.03 during the calculation period between Aug. 15 and Sept. 14. That was $11.60 a barrel below Brent over the same period. October’s duty rate sets a new high for the year. The rate for November has been set at $3.57 a barrel, based on an average Urals price of $83.35 during the calculation period between Sept. 15 and Oct. 14. That was about $7.70 a barrel below Brent over the same period. November’s duty rate sets a new high for the year.Origin-to-Location FlowsThe following charts show the number of ships leaving each export terminal and the destinations of crude cargoes from the four export regions.A total of 32 tankers loaded 24.6 million barrels of Russian crude in the week to Oct. 15, vessel-tracking data and port agent reports show. That’s up 2 million barrels from the previous week.A jump in shipments from Ust-Luga in the Baltic more than offset a drop in the number of vessels leaving nearby Primorsk.Destinations are based on where vessels signal they are heading at the time of writing, and some will almost certainly change as voyages progress. All figures exclude cargoes identified as Kazakhstan’s KEBCO grade.The total volume on ships loading Russian crude from the Baltic terminals was unchanged, averaging 1.56 million barrels a day for a third week.Shipments of Russian crude from Novorossiysk jumped to 625,000 barrels a day, equal to the highest since the week ending July 2.Two cargoes of Kazakh crude were loaded at the port during the week, up from one during the previous seven days.Two Suezmax tankers completed loading cargoes at the Arctic port of Murmansk in the week to Oct. 15, boosting flows to about 285,000 barrels a day.Two tankers were drifting outside the port waiting to load at the end of the week.Ten tankers loaded at Russia’s three Pacific export terminals, down by two from the previous week. The volume of crude shipped from the region fell to just over 1 million barrels a day, down by 200,000 barrels a day from the previous seven days.The drop in flows was driven by fewer ships lading Sokol grade from the terminal at De Kastri and no tankers completing loading of Sakhalin Blend crude. Shipments from the Sakhalin Island terminal are running at one every other week.The volumes heading to unknown destinations are Sokol cargoes that are currently being shuttled to an area off the South Korean port of Yosu from the loading terminal at De Kastri. Most of these are ending up in India.NOTESNote: This story forms part of a weekly series tracking shipments of crude from Russian export terminals and the export duty revenues earned from them by the Russian government. Weeks run from Monday to Sunday. The next update will be on Tuesday, Oct. 24.Note: All figures exclude cargoes owned by Kazakhstan’s KazTransOil JSC, which transit Russia and are shipped from Novorossiysk and Ust-Luga as KEBCO grade crude.If you are reading this story on the Bloomberg terminal, click here for a link to a PDF file of four-week average flows from Russia to key destinations.--With assistance from Sherry Su.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWall Street’s Surprising Quest for Ways to Finance Coal AgainAd-Free Versions of Facebook and Instagram Have One Audience in Mind: RegulatorsThe K-Pop Mogul Behind BTS Is Building the Next BTSIntroducing The Businessweek Show With Max AbelsonHas Bob Iger Lost the Magic?©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of the global oil and gas market, the reason why gas is so cheap in the U.S., and the use of artificial intelligence in the oil and gas industry, and go directly to 5 Countries with the Cheapest Gas Prices. Supplying 40% of the entire global energy, oil is the world’s primary fuel. Gasoline is made when crude oil is broken into various petroleum products through a process of fractional distillation. Since gas is essential to running most internal combustion engine cars, it is the most popular petroleum product. The average price of gasoline in the world is currently around $5.11 per gallon. Global Oil and Gas Market:According to The Business Research Company, the global oil and gas market was valued at $6.99 trillion in 2022, and is expected to grow to $8.67 trillion in 2027, with a CAGR of 4.4% during the forecast period. The largest region in the global oil and gas market share is Asia Pacific, with North America coming in second.   The primary factors driving the growth of the industry include the rising demand for oil and gas, growing competition in the industry, financial capital, and public scrutiny. Furthermore, the rising oil and gas exploration activities and the increase in prices globally are also anticipated to drive the industry's growth.Why Gas is so Cheap in the U.SAs a general rule, richer countries have higher gas prices, while the prices in poorer countries or countries that produce and export oil are significantly lower. However, the U.S. is an exception to this rule and has surprisingly low gas prices, despite being among the Richest Countries in the World. The principal reason for this is that gas taxes have always been exceptionally low in America. The federal gas tax was first charged in 1932 at 1 cent per gallon and is now at 18.4 cents a gallon, but this tax has remained unchanged since 1993. Story continues1 liter of gas in USA had an average price of $1.047 (or $3.965 a gallon) on the 9th of October 2023. Artificial Intelligence in the Oil and Gas Industry: Major players in the oil and gas industry are looking into big data analytics and AI to enhance decision making abilities and thus profits. AI will allow these companies to make better drilling and operational decisions, assist them in overcoming their challenges, and position them for long-term success. Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) has deployed AI across its entire oil and gas supply chain, with over 160 active AI projects. It uses reinforcement learning in its exploration and drilling programme to reduce gas extraction costs. From machine learning to computer vision, deep learning to virtual assistants and autonomous vehicles to robotics, Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) has been focused on a range of technologies that have supported advances in AI. In fact, the oil giant also offers an AI Residency Program, which gives data scientists and AI engineers experience with several AI projects across the company. Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) ranks among the 10 Best ADR Stocks to Buy Now. The Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is another major player that has prominently adopted a digital mindset in the oil and gas sector. The Texas-based company has collaborated with IBM’s Data Science and AI Elite Team and seismic experts to use AI to interpret and integrate data from siloed systems into one repository, which is hosted on a multi-cloud environment. The Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is also enhancing its customers’ experience at the pump by offering mobile apps for payment options, customer loyalty programs, and comprehensive car maintenance experiences. In fact, the Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is one of the Most Innovative Companies in the World in 2023. Shares of XOM were held by 71 hedge funds in the Insider Monkey database at the end of Q2 this year. With that said, here are the Countries with the Cheapest Gas in the World.20 Countries with the Cheapest Gas PricesPhoto by Juan Fernandez on UnsplashMethodology:To collect data for this article, we have referred to GlobalPetrolPrices, looking for Countries with the Lowest Prices of Gas. The following countries have been ranked according to their gasoline prices on the 9th of October 2023. If you also wish to read about countries with the most expensive gas prices in the world, here are the 30 Countries with the Highest Gas Prices.  20. BelarusPrice of Gas per Gallon: $2.711Despite having the world’s third-largest production of peat and small amounts of crude oil, Belarus depends heavily on Russia for its fossil fuel needs. Belarus is a sizable East European refiner, reliant on Russian crude, and before the invasion of Ukraine was also a significant exporter of oil products to its southern neighbor.19. EcuadorPrice of Gas per Gallon: $2.4Ecuador held 0.5% of the global share of oil reserves in 2022, making it the fourth-highest in Latin America and the Caribbean, with approximately 8.27 billion barrels. In 2022, the country produced approximately 482,000 barrels per day of petroleum and other liquids. 18. Saudi ArabiaPrice of Gas per Gallon: $2.351It comes as no surprise that Saudi Arabia makes it in our list of Countries with the Cheapest Gas. After all, the Middle Eastern Country was the second-largest oil producer in the world last year, with a share of 13.2% in the global crude oil production. The country’s largest oil company, Saudi Aramco, boasted a massive revenue of $535.2 billion last year, up 49% from 2021. 1 liter of petrol in Saudi Arabia is currently priced at $0.621. 17. OmanPrice of Gas per Gallon: $2.35Oman is the largest oil and natural gas producer in the Middle East that is not a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). The country can produce upwards of one million barrels per day of crude oil and condensates, but honors OPEC quotas.16. AzerbaijanPrice of Gas per Gallon: $2.227Azerbaijan has a mature oil and gas sector and has produced hydrocarbons for almost 150 years now. The main destinations for crude petroleum exports from Azerbaijan are Italy, Israel, and Croatia. Azerbaijan is counted among the Top Oil Producing Countries in the World.  15. QatarPrice of Gas per Gallon: $2.183Qatar, one of OPEC’s longest-standing members, left the organization in January 2019 to shift more of its resources and investment from oil production to natural gas and LNG infrastructure projects. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, Qatar’s earnings from its hydrocarbon sector accounted for 81% of the country’s total government revenues in 2021, up from 77% in 2020.14. IraqPrice of Gas per Gallon: $2.168Iraq is the second-largest crude oil producer in OPEC after Saudi Arabia, holding the world's fifth-largest proved crude oil reserves, at 145 billion barrels. Iraq's oil production amounted to roughly 4.5 million barrels per day in 2022. 13. RussiaPrice of Gas per Gallon: $2.112Although Russia is the third-largest producer of oil in the world, the country’s oil industry has recently been facing a number of problems, including sanctions from the West for its invasion of Ukraine, reduction in output from brownfields in Western Siberia, rising costs, and the high carbon intensity of the country’s oil production. 12. BoliviaPrice of Gas per Gallon: $2.049Oil has been known to exist in Bolivia since the colonial period, but serious exploration did not begin until the beginning of the twentieth century. The South American country has more than 240.95 million barrels of proved crude oil reserves as of 2022. Bolivia also has two oil refineries and meets most of its petroleum needs through local production. 11. BahrainPrice of Gas per Gallon: $2.008As a small non-OPEC Gulf oil producer with approximately 124.6 million barrels of proved reserves, Bahrain receives its oil revenues from two fields – the onshore Bahrain field and the offshore Abu Safah field, which is shared with Saudi Arabia. The oil sector has been the second-largest contributor to Bahrain’s real GDP in Q2 of this year, at 17.1%. The financial sector made up the largest segment, with its size reflecting the government’s focus on financial technology and digital banking.10. KazakhstanPrice of Gas per Gallon: $1.721Kazakhstan has the largest proven oil reserves in the Caspian Sea region, and the country’s crude and condensate output in 2021 was 1.8 million barrels per day. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is the largest private oil producer in Kazakhstan, holding important stakes in two of the nation's biggest oil-producing fields – Tengiz and Karachaganak. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is also the largest private shareholder in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC). The Caspian Pipeline provides an important export route for crude oil from Tengiz and Karachaganak. A major expansion of the pipeline was recently completed.Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) ranks among the 12 Best Dividend Stocks for Passive Income. 9. MalaysiaPrice of Gas per Gallon: $1.642In 2022, Malaysia produced approximately 567 thousand barrels of oil per day, a decrease of 8.8% from the 622 thousand barrels of daily oil production capacity in 2020. The country is also a big exporter of crude oil, with $6.59 billion worth exported in 2021.Malaysia sits among the Largest Oil Producing Countries in Asia. 8. TurkmenistanPrice of Gas per Gallon: $1.625Turkmenistan is an important oil producer in Central Asia, with current output of about 8 million mt/year. The country plans to offer two offshore blocks for exploration of crude oil in 2023, near an area of the Caspian Sea that is currently producing 1 million barrels per day.Turkmenistan ranks among the Top 10 Countries with the Cheapest Petrol Prices in the World. 7. EgyptPrice of Gas per Gallon: $1.409Egypt has significant energy resources, both in traditional fossil fuels and in renewable energy. As of January 2021, the country has proved oil reserves of 3.3 billion barrels. Egypt also exported $3.69 billion worth of crude petroleum in 2021. 6. AngolaPrice of Gas per Gallon: $1.375Aside from being the second-largest oil producing country in Africa, Angola also gives gas subsidies to its people and doesn’t add taxes to the pump price.

""And we're kind of getting to a level where you don't want to use it.""The SPR, the world's largest reserve of emergency crude oil, is usually used to stabilize disruptions in oil supply. Last year, the US government siphoned 180 million barrels from the SPR in the aftermath of the Russia-Ukraine war.The reserve currently sits at 40-year lows at 351 million barrels, according to the Energy Department. That's less than half of the all-time highs from 2010 and about 40% below where it was when the withdrawals began.Despite the big drawdown last year, a spokesperson for the Energy Department told Insider last month that the SPR ""stands ready to deliver on its mission to respond to future supply disruptions, providing relief when needed most.""Weekly US stock of crude oil in SPRUS Energy Information AdministrationYergin estimated that under the best case scenario next year, oil prices might trade in the mid-$80-per-barrel range.

The countries are said to have made close to $3 billion the past quarter from slashing production.Story continuesStill, Yergin noted that production growth outside the OPEC+ alliance has pressured oil prices lower, more so than prospects for lower demand in China.In fact, US oil production surged to a record high of 13.2 million barrels a day earlier this month. The prior record was 13.1 million barrels a day hit in February 2020, right before the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down the economy.Read the original article on Business Insider]"

Specifically, if the US and Iran were to get more directly involved, there would be significant disruptions to oil supply.This was echoed by Bloomberg Economics, who said the big fear for the global economy is if Israel ends up in direct conflict with Iran, which could pull the US more directly into the conflict. If that were to happen, they predict that oil prices would skyrocket more than 70% to $150 per barrel from just under $90 we have now.An estimated 20-30% of global oil supply passes through the Strait of Hormuz, which is controlled by Iran. If Iran were to get directly involved in the war, there would be increased pressure for the US and other Western nations to increase sanctions on Iran, which could then turn around and close the strait, disrupting global oil supplies and elevating prices.Bloomberg does not think the impact on oil prices would be as severe as the quadrupling seen during the ""Oil Shock"" in 1973 when Arab states imposed an embargo in retaliation for US support of Israel during the Yom Kippur War. However, they believe it could be in line with the surge seen after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, but with a much higher starting point this time around.Story continuesThe impact would be enormousA price of $150 per barrel would be the highest in over a decade.Bloomberg's economists surmise that such a surge in oil prices alone could cause global GDP growth to fall from the 3.0% predicted for 2023 to 1.7%, a drop in about $1 trillion of world output.If oil prices do surge, inflation could spike again in the US, as they directly impact gas prices for the American consumer to fill their cars and travel on planes. It would also raise the cost of shipping goods, affecting supply chains and causing prices to soar.As the US continues its fight against inflation, former US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin called oil prices the big mystery in the US economy's short-term future, during a Friday interview on Fox Business' ""Kudlow."" He noted that the Fed is ""close to done"" hiking interest rates, but they will likely remain high well into 2024 and warned things could get rocky if Middle East tensions escalate even higher.""There's no question that long-term interest rates have risen significantly, also that's going to help the Fed's job. That's going to slow down the economy,"" Mnuchin said. ""I think there is going to be risk pressure against equities as the US economy slows down, and the big unknown is what happens to oil prices if the situation in the Middle East continues to escalate.""Buildings in the Abu Nasr district of Gaza City after strikes by Israeli forces during Operation Protective Edge on July 11, 2014.Mustafa Hassona/Anadolu Agency/Getty ImagesThe answer might be in the USWhile US oil production recently hit a record high of 13.2 million barrels a day, Mnuchin called on the US to boost its ouput of oil even higher. He said the fight against climate change should take a backseat for now and national security should take precedence.""We need to increase domestic production,"" Mnuchin said. ""We have plenty of capacity here. We have both capacity for oil. We have capacity for natural gas. There is a time for climate change and to be worried about that, but right now, these are national security issues, and we should make sure the US has plenty of energy to supply ourselves and supply our allies.""Raising oil production would go against the Biden administration's push for green energy. However, complicating matters is that the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve is near a 40-year low. The Biden administration unloaded 180 million barrels last year to help counter the price surge following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.With fewer barrels in reserve, there's now less oil the US can release into the economy and help increase supply and thus lower prices.Now the US wants to refill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but the government could be facing another round of price hikes at the pump and a lot less in its reserve to help. While the already record level of domestic oil production helped offset OPEC+ cuts, it would be a formidable task to fight a new round of price hikes and refill the reserve.US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell attends a press conference in Washington, DC, on March 22, 2023.Liu Jie/Xinhua via Getty ImagesWhen the Fed paused rate hikes in September for the first time in 15 months, Chairman Jerome Powell was asked if a soft landing had become a baseline expectation.While he said it was possible, he warned that ""ultimately, this may be decided by factors that are outside our control at the end of the day.""Read the original article on Business Insider]"

U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) was unchanged at $86.66.Oil prices fell earlier in the session when Richmond Federal Reserve Bank chief Thomas Barkin said that higher long-term U.S. borrowing costs are putting downward pressure on demand but it was unclear how that will affect the central bank's rates decision in three weeks.Interest rate hikes to curb inflation can slow economic growth and reduce oil demand.Both oil benchmarks rallied last week on fears that the Israel-Hamas conflict could widen into the oil-producing region. Global benchmark Brent gained 7.5% in its largest weekly gain since February.Biden's visit to Israel on Wednesday will seek to balance showing support for Israel's war on Hamas and trying to rally Arab states to help prevent a regional conflict, after OPEC-member Iran pledged ""pre-emptive action"" from the ""resistance front"" of its allies that include the Hezbollah movement in Lebanon.""Oil prices are wavering as energy traders await to see if the U.S. diplomatic efforts will be successful in preventing the Israel-Hamas conflict from turning into a wider regional war,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA.Providing some support to prices, U.S. retail sales increased more than expected in September as households stepped up purchases of motor vehicles and spent more at restaurants and bars.Weighing on prices with the possibility of increased supply, Venezuela's government and opposition are set to resume long-suspended talks on Tuesday, which could lead to Washington easing sanctions, multiple sources said.Since 2019, the U.S. has imposed sanctions on oil exports from Venezuela, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), to punish President Nicolas Maduro's government following elections in 2018 that Washington considered a sham.Story continuesThe U.S. government has been seeking ways to increase the flow of oil to world markets to alleviate high prices. But any real oil output increase by Venezuela will take time because of a lack of investment.Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser said the world's biggest oil company could ramp up production within weeks if needed.Nasser said global oil demand was set to rise to 103 million barrels per day (bpd) in the second half of this year while the company's spare capacity is 3 million bpd.""The market is really tight right now and that's why we're so nervous,"" Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group, said.""Even if OPEC raised production, the most they could raise production is by 3 million barrels a day. That's a scary number,"" Flynn said.OPEC+, which comprises OPEC countries and leading allies including Russia, has cut output since last year in what it says is pre-emptive action to maintain market stability.On U.S. supply, industry data showed crude stocks fell by about 4.4 million barrels in the week ended Oct. 13, according to market sources citing American Petroleum Institute figures on Tuesday.

Bearish sentiment notched up 4 percentage points to 49% from last quarter—nearing Q1 levels (52%).Views on the economy remain cautiously optimistic. Slightly over half of investors (55%) believe the economy will be in better shape by the end of year and think we’ll see inflation normalize (52%). Further, just over two in five investors (41%) think the Fed will cut rates in the first half of 2024 or sooner.Yet, inflation continues to be a top concern. When it comes to investment portfolios, investors ranked high inflation as their top concern (51%), followed by a recession, (32%) and market volatility (31%).""As we approach the end of 2023, headwinds abound with continued elevated inflation and geopolitical tensions on the rise,"" said Mike Loewengart, Head of Model Portfolio Construction for Morgan Stanley Portfolio Solutions. ""Yet somewhat remarkably, the economy has continued to chug along—particularly on the jobs front. This leaves investors facing a conundrum—a resilient economy coupled with a volatile market. Environments like these show the power of a diversified portfolio, which can help an investor weather whatever may be ahead for the market. The goal is to invest through the volatility, not react to it.""The survey explored investor views on sector opportunities for the fourth quarter of 2023:Energy – Interest in energy spiked 4 percentage points and took the top spot in investment opportunities this quarter as oil prices were driven higher. Elevated crude prices can translate to potential gains in the sector.IT – Technology continues to be a mainstay in investor portfolios with interest remaining strong (46%) but dropping 5 percentage points quarter over quarter.Health care – Amid volatility, investors tend to focus on historically defensive areas of the market like health care.

What could be this quarter's standout theme for bank earnings?RBC Capital Markets Analyst Gerard Cassidy joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss credit quality conditions amid the Fed's higher for longer interest rates and their impacts on regional banks.""There's also been... the unrealized bond losses in bond portfolios and margin pressure that's developed because deposit rates have moved higher,"" Cassidy outlines, ""but in the long run — or when we look out over the next 12 to 18 months — it's all going to be focused on credit quality, which today is actually quite strong.""For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video Transcript- Could Big Bank set the standard for how earnings season will play out this quarter? Let's bring in Gerard Cassidy, RBC Capital Markets analyst. And Gerard, one of the kind of magical words that we've been looking for, at least as has come up through some of our previous discussions as we were looking for what would be the tenor of this earnings season was cost discipline. Is there a kind of a magic word or a general theme that you expect to prevail over the course of this earnings season?GERARD CASSIDY: Yes. There is, in our opinion, and that's all going to do with credit quality. And as you know, the single most important issue for any bank is the trends in credit quality. Now there's also been, of course, topics such as the unrealized bond losses in their bond portfolios and margin pressure that's developed because deposit rates have moved higher.But in the long run, or when we look out over the next 12 to 18 months, I think it's all going to be focused on credit quality, which today is actually quite strong.- But Gerard, is that something that you think can stay intact? And also going back to what you just mentioned there about deposit rates. We talk about the fact that many of the larger banks, obviously, in a better position to weather some of that headwind right now, but how does that position some of the smaller, more regional players?Story continuesGERARD CASSIDY: It's a good question because when you take a look at credit quality, obviously, we all know about the downtown office space in big urban markets, that's a real troubled market. Most of the smaller regional banks are not exposed to that market. They generally have higher exposures to commercial real estate, but it's not in those downtown large office buildings in our big urban markets.And on the deposit side, the real key question what we have to focus on is when does the Federal Reserve reach its terminal rate for Fed funds? Because over the last four tightening cycles, around five to six months following the terminal rate for Fed funds, deposit rates stopped going up, and that's real positive for the banks because what happens is the cash flows coming off of the asset side of the balance sheet from securities and loans are reinvested at higher yields, helping their net interest margin expand.So the key question, again, is, when will the Fed reach its terminal rate? And in the past, that's been a real catalyst for bank stocks to do better.- For banks, especially as you were mentioning, some of the dynamic that they're going through right now where you do have some of the banks that are kind of carrying the most wealthy client base in the assets under management, and you think about what Goldman is potentially going to say, especially given the outflows that we've started to see, at least for some of those bank customers that have said, you know what? I want to sit on the sidelines outside of some of my typical investments now, and, perhaps, go into cash or go into other asset types. Where do you expect that to show up in some of the financial performance?GERARD CASSIDY: I think you put your finger on it because that old expression cash is king I think is coming back, when you can earn over 5% on your cash sitting in a money market mutual fund. So I think what you're going to hear from Goldman and others that have the wealth management business is that the inflows are still strong, but they're moving more into cash like products that have lower margins. The push into equities is kind of softened, and so assets are moving higher, but they're moving more into cash. And we would expect to hear not only Goldman talk about that, but Morgan Stanley as well when they release their numbers this week.]"

The group needs to repay or refinance half its debt before July 2025.Morgan Stanley Real Estate is bidding against Cerberus Capital Management for control of some of Stonegate’s distressed pub portfolio, the Times reported.Representatives for Cerberus and Stonegate didn’t immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment on the reported bid. A representative for Morgan Stanley declined to comment.Stonegate owns several unbranded pubs, as well as chains including Slug &amp; Lettuce, Be at One, and Craft Union.The pub chain has found itself trapped under £3.8 billion ($4.6 billion) in borrowings, according to its latest quarterly financial report. The group needs to either pay back more than £2 billion of that debt by 2025 or negotiate new, likely unfavorable terms.In January, credit rating agency Fitch gave Stonegate a negative B- rating, reflecting its looming refinancing risk in mid-2025.“It also includes Stonegate's vulnerability to the U.K. consumer whose discretionary spend may decrease wet sales despite the group's diverse portfolio of brands, locations, and operating models,” the agency said of the newly fickle British pub patron.British pubs in declineStonegate has sought to find new ways to make money amid its challenging financial situation.The group introduced “dynamic pricing” at its venues in September, charging customers about 20p ($0.24) more per pint at peak times. Stonegate said the plan, to be introduced at about 800 of its locations, would help it meet additional staffing requirements, in addition to licensing and security needs at its pubs.Story continuesHowever, the strategy was derided by customers and industry experts alike, who argued it increased uncertainty and could drive people away during peak hours.The group’s struggles encapsulate a U.K. pub sector in perennial decline over the 21st century.There were 14,000 fewer pubs across the U.K. in 2022 compared with 2000, according to British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) data, representing a nearly 25% fall.This accelerated to more than two pubs a day closing in the first six months of the year in the face of high energy costs, the Guardian reported citing Altus data. The 383 closures in the first half of 2023 almost matched the figure for the whole of 2022, when 386 pubs vanished, according to Altus.Stonegate, on the other hand, has swollen its portfolio from just 333 when it started operations in 2010 to around 4,500 today, according to its website.The proposed sale of a quarter of its premises may further accelerate the closure of U.K. pubs, with margin-focused bidders more likely to convert the spaces than continue to operate them in the same capacity.Pubs are also facing unprecedented pricing pressures in the face of a supply chain crunch following COVID-19 and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The average price of a pint jumped 12.5% between 2020 and 2022, according to BBPA data.For Stonegate, this translated into price increases of between 7% and 8% at its pubs, according to Fitch. The ratings agency also noted that Stonegate’s energy costs doubled to £70 million ($85 million) in 2023.Despite the struggle of British pubs, Morgan Stanley and Cerberus may spy an opportunity to pick up a host of U.K. real estate premises on the cheap, perhaps converting them into residential spaces.Morgan Stanley may also be using the bid to pivot away from its investments in office properties.

But in any diversified portfolio of stocks, you'll see some that fall short of the average. That's what has happened with the FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE:FE) share price. It's up 12% over three years, but that is below the market return. Zooming in, the stock is actually down 1.6% in the last year.Since the stock has added US$774m to its market cap in the past week alone, let's see if underlying performance has been driving long-term returns. Check out our latest analysis for FirstEnergy While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During the three years of share price growth, FirstEnergy actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) drop 7.3% per year.Earnings per share have melted like a stack of ice cubes, in stark contrast to the share price. So we'll need to take a look at some different metrics to try to understand why the share price remains solid.The dividend is no better now than it was three years ago, so that is unlikely to have driven the share price higher. But it's far more plausible that the revenue growth of 6.4% per year is viewed as evidence that FirstEnergy is growing. It could be that investors are content with the revenue growth on the basis that the company isn't really focussed on profits just yet. And that might explain the higher price.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthYou can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, FirstEnergy's TSR for the last 3 years was 27%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveFirstEnergy provided a TSR of 2.5% over the last twelve months. Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it's actually better than the average return of 2% over half a decade This could indicate that the company is winning over new investors, as it pursues its strategy. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Even so, be aware that  FirstEnergy is showing  3 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 2 of those are concerning...Of course FirstEnergy may not be the best stock to buy.

If you want to skip our overview of the SaaS industry, then take a look at the 5 Best SaaS Stocks To Buy Now. The dot com era of the 1990s  focused on the consumer side of the internet, but in the background, a quiet corporate revolution was also taking place. For that time, most people can only recall the growth in internet use and bulky personal computers most likely made by International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) that could support CD disks, and flash drives, and came with a variety of accessories such as added speakers. However, the world was also seeing companies starting to rely on computers for their production, manufacturing, and supply chain planning as part of a broader group of corporate planning called enterprise resource planning (ERP).Since then, not only have the computer and the internet made unbelievable advances, but the progress of the two has created a new industry. This industry is called software as a service (SaaS) and it includes software based products that can be accessed from anywhere on the planet given that one has a stable internet connection. These products enable users, whether corporate or consumer, to use a firm's hardware infrastructure and simply pay a subscription for the usage. This comes with a variety of advantages, which include cost savings from avoiding buying bulky servers, hardware agnosticism for most of the parts except for basic specifications required for the user, and data security since all data is held on external servers.If you're having trouble understanding SaaS, then perhaps an example will help. The world's most popular digital streaming service Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) can also be classified as a SaaS. This is because all Netflix offers to its customers is a software product that can be accessed either through a computer or a smartphone. This simple software subscription enables access to television shows, movies, and documentaries - all of which are hosted on Netflix's own servers. So, the consumers are saved from having to download and save TV shows on their own devices, and for most of the part, they can also access Netflix's content from different locations without the need to carry their own computer or smartphone with them. Another popular example of a SaaS product is the online courses offered by firms such asStory continuesOn the corporate side of things, SaaS is equally as diverse. A large number of business functions now rely on third party software which saves the operating from having to invest in its own products and allows them to leverage the expertise of others that are providing customized services in the area. Some business functions that utilize SaaS are payroll processing, human resource management, supply chain management, data analysis, and accounting. Each of these has specialized tasks that can be met by software, and in the case of the SaaS services provider, the software is often regularly updated over time to account for changes from user feedback and glitches. Some examples of corporate SaaS providers include PTC Inc. (NASDAQ:PTC), which provides product design software, Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK) which provides data analysis products, and HubSpot, Inc. (NYSE:HUBS), which enables customer relationship management.As to the latest trends in the SaaS industry, like nearly every other industry, it is also focusing on leveraging artificial intelligence to offer new services. For instance, HubSpot announced a new AI assistant in April 2023 to allow sales and marketing teams to create content. Additionally, one of the biggest SaaS security companies, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD), is also integrating AI into its Falcon platform, with management explaining during the firm's second quarter of fiscal 2024 earnings call:Falcon is a platform that brings the benefits of generative AI to life for every SOC, CISO, CXO and enterprise. We do it with proprietary threat data, and we do it with industry-leading AI expertise. Charlotte AI is the engine powering our portfolio of generative AI capabilities across the platform, utilizing CrowdStrike's high-fidelity data advantage. Charlotte AI helps Falcon users of all skill levels to do more in the platform by automating workflows, which fuels module adoption and reduces the mean time to detect and respond. The net benefit to customers from our pioneering use of AI in a single platform is faster results, better security outcomes and lower overall cost, ushering in a new era of machine speed security. We showcased Charlotte AI earlier this month at Black Hat where we're the only vendor of consequence to showcase a live, not PowerPoint, demo of generative AI in action.Public reception was fantastic, and we will release Charlotte AI pricing at Falcon.So, with AI transforming the SaaS industry, what are the best stocks to buy?

(NYSE:CRM) is a favorite amongst the big guns",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/81-institutional-ownership-salesforce-inc-130033593.html,1697461233,STORY,['CRM'],"[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in Salesforce implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price50% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Analyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a businessTo get a sense of who is truly in control of Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 81% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Salesforce. Check out our latest analysis for Salesforce ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Salesforce?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.Salesforce already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Salesforce, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Salesforce. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.6% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.3% and 4.7%, of the shares outstanding, respectively. In addition, we found that Marc Benioff, the CEO has 2.6% of the shares allocated to their name.On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of SalesforceWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in Salesforce, Inc.. It is a very large company, and board members collectively own US$5.9b worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently. General Public OwnershipWith a 16% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Salesforce. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Salesforce better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Salesforce that you should be aware of before investing here.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

The company's customers — who already have some of the highest rates in the country — would have to pay for it.Regulators want PG&amp;E to put a protective cover over many of its overhead power lines instead of burying them. The cover approach is cheaper, but riskier. PG&amp;E says burying a power line reduces the chance it will start a wildfire by 99% because it can't be blown down by wind storms. The protective cover, which would better insulate the power line should it fall to the ground, would reduce that chance by 62%.“We’re not going to live with 35% risk,” said PG&amp;E CEO Patti Poppe, who was rounding down in her assessment. “Who wants to get on a plane that has a 35% chance of crashing?”PG&amp;E, which filed for bankruptcy protection in 2019 after it faced more than $30 billion in damages for wildfires started by its equipment, is trying to convince regulators that its burying plan is better. The company filed its plan with state regulators last year.The California Public Utilities Commission, whose members are appointed by Gov. Gavin Newsom, is scheduled to decide the issue next month. PG&amp;E will make it's case in person before the commission on Wednesday.What PG&amp;E wants to do is unprecedented in both scale and speed. It’s plan to bury 2,000 miles (3,219 kilometers) of power lines is part of a broader goal of putting 10,000 miles (16,093 kilometers) underground over the next decade. The case is being closely watched, not just in California but throughout the country as more utilities weigh the risks versus the cost of burying power lines.Story continuesMost of the nation's power lines are above ground because its cheaper to do it that way. But more utilities have been burying power lines in response to bigger and more destructive natural disasters. In Florida, where hurricanes are more of a threat than wildfires, about 45% of Florida Power and Light's distribution system is underground, according to the company's website.California's other big investor-owned utilities have also been putting power lines underground. Southern California Edison, the utility that covers much of central and Southern California, says it plans to bury 600 miles (966 kilometers) of power lines by 2028. San Diego Gas &amp; Electric has buried 145 miles (233 kilometers) of power lines since 2020 and plans to do another 1,500 miles (2,414 kilometers) by 2031.The issue can have repercussions beyond the price of electricity. In the past year, seven of the top 12 insurance companies doing business in California have either paused or restricted new business in the state, citing wildfire risk.On a recent afternoon, Poppe — PG&amp;E's CEO since 2021 — visited a construction site between Sacramento and San Francisco where crews were burying a stretch of overhead power lines. Poppe was there to celebrate the company meeting its goal of burying at least 350 miles (563 kilometers) of power lines this year, a milestone she says is proof the company can meet its ambitious targets.Poppe donned a hard hat and protective glasses to watch workers pour a concrete mixture into a freshly dug trench along a rural, two-lane road. Behind them, charred trees stood sentry on brown hills, evidence of the 2020 LNU Complex Fire that destroyed nearly 1,500 structures and killed six people. That fire was started by lightning, not PG&amp;E's power lines, but it is a reminder of the lasting damage that wildfires can cause.“One of the big criticisms about PG&amp;E is we did not adapt to changing conditions. Everyone says we should have seen these wildfire conditions. Everyone says PG&amp;E should have invested in the infrastructure,” Poppe told The Associated Press. “And so, here we are. We've now changed and we're asking people to catch up with us.”Critics scoff, noting that PG&amp;E's plan would boost profits for a company that pleaded guilty to 84 counts of manslaughter in connection with the 2018 wildfire that mostly destroyed the town of Paradise. Their plan, which includes projects in addition to burying power lines, would raise customer rates an average of nearly 18%, or $38.73 per month.“I really find it hard to believe anything they say about their commitment to safety. They are going to make a lot of money burying these lines,” said Ken Cook, president of Environmental Working Group and a PG&amp;E customer.The Public Utilities Commission is considering two other plans that would include both burying power lines and using protective coverings. The plans reduce the number of power lines that PG&amp;E could bury by at least half. One plan would raise rates by just over 12% and the other would raise rates by about 10%.Already, PG&amp;E’s residential rates have more than doubled since 2006. It’s been even worse for low-income customers, whose rates have gone up 170% over that same time period, according to The Utility Reform Network, an advocacy group for ratepayers. PG&amp;E says its electric-only rates have increased an average of 4% per year since 2006.While burying power lines is the most effective way to prevent wildfires, it is not a quick fix. It takes a long time compared to other methods because of time needed to plan, and acquire the necessary permits and permissions to dig.At the start of 2018, both PG&amp;E and Southern California Edison had only 5% of their high-threat fire districts protected with either underground lines or protective covers, according to the California Public Advocates Office, the state agency that represents customers before the Public Utilities Commission.Five years later, 55% of Southern California Edison's equipment in high-threat fire districts are protected compared to just 9% of PG&amp;E's system. Matt Baker, director of the California Public Advocates Office, says it's good for PG&amp;E to bury some power lines — but they must also use other methods to get more areas protected faster.“We have to get it done as quickly as possible to reduce the risk as much as possible,” Baker said. “It doesn’t matter if we have like this incredibly gold-plated, awesome, underground system if, over the next ten years, we’ve got a hundred or so wildfires that are starting to hit the other places because we’re not there yet.”PG&amp;E says it had improved protections for 14% of its system in areas at high risk for wildfires by the end of 2022. Plus, it says it has more than two and a half times more miles of distribution lines in high-risk areas than Southern California Edison.Poppe, PG&amp;E's CEO, says the company has a “a moral obligation” to reduce wildfire risk. Poppe said she still wears a lady bug pin on her shirt every day to remind her of Feyla McLeod, an 8-year-old girl who died in a 2020 Northern California wildfire that was started by PG&amp;E's equipment.“Every day I'm recommitting to preventing that from happening again,” she said.]"

SEM, Marathon Oil Corp. MRO, PVH Corp. PVH and KB Home KBH.Unlock the Value of Your Portfolio with 4 Low P/CF StocksWe always try to hit the jackpot while picking stocks. But striking the right chord each time is not easy unless blessed with Midas touch. When it comes to the investment market, experts consider value style as one of the most effective approaches. Value investing is essentially about selecting stocks that have good things going on for them, even at a time when they have been beaten down by some external factors.There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock’s inherent strength but a random selection of ratios cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company’s financial position. For this, we recommend Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) as one of the key metrics. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis — the lower the number, the better. Select Medical Holdings Corp., Marathon Oil Corp., PVH Corp. and KB Home boast a low P/CF ratio.Price to Cash Flow Reveals Financial HealthQuestions may arise as to why we are considering the Price to Cash Flow valuation metric, when the most widely used metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E). Well, what makes P/CF stand out is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly reflecting the financial health of a company.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. It is net cash flow that reveals how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is putting the same to use.A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company’s liquid assets. This gives the company the means to settle debt, shell out for its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Then again, a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.Story continuesWhat’s the Best Strategy?An investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and also consider the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.Here are four of the eight stocks that qualified the screening.Select Medical Holdings, one of the largest operators of critical illness recovery hospitals, rehabilitation hospitals, outpatient rehabilitation clinics, and occupational health centers, sports a Zacks Rank #1.

Financial Uplift Starting Jan 2024HOUSTON, Oct. 16, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE: MRO) announced that through its wholly-owned subsidiaries it has entered into a five-year firm LNG sales agreement with Glencore Energy UK Ltd, a subsidiary of Glencore PLC (LSE: GLEN), for a portion of its equity natural gas produced from the Alba Field (Alba Unit, MRO 64% working interest) in Equatorial Guinea (E.G.), effective Jan. 1, 2024. The pricing structure for the LNG sales agreement is linked to the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) index, less a fixed transportation fee, providing Marathon Oil with significant incremental exposure to the European LNG market.(PRNewsfoto/Marathon Oil Corporation)Separately, due to the expected arbitrage between LNG and methanol pricing, Marathon Oil announced it expects to optimize its E.G. integrated gas operations in 2024 by redirecting a portion of Alba Unit natural gas from the local methanol facility (MRO 45% working interest) to the LNG facility (MRO 56% working interest).""I'm excited to announce this new sales agreement linked to the European LNG market, signaling the conclusion of the legacy Henry Hub linked contract,"" said chairman, president, and CEO Lee Tillman. ""The timing of this new sales agreement, EG LNG's track record of reliable operations, and the plant's proximity to Europe resulted in tremendous demand and an extremely competitive process. At recent forward curve pricing, we expect to realize an approximate year-on-year EBITDA increase of over $300 million next year across our E.G. integrated gas business, reflecting our differentiated and increasing exposure to the global LNG market. This success positions us strongly for the next phase of opportunities to advance the E.G. Gas Mega Hub, including up to two infill development wells in the Alba Unit and the potential tie-in of the third-party Aseng gas cap monetization.""Story continuesAlex Sanna, Head of Oil and Gas Marketing, Glencore PLC, said: ""We are delighted to further expand our cooperation with Marathon Oil.

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Marathon Oil has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Equitrans Midstream has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that MRO likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than ETRN has recently. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.MRO currently has a forward P/E ratio of 10.48, while ETRN has a forward P/E of 20.67. We also note that MRO has a PEG ratio of 0.53. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. ETRN currently has a PEG ratio of 1.17.Another notable valuation metric for MRO is its P/B ratio of 1.54. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, ETRN has a P/B of 2.91.Based on these metrics and many more, MRO holds a Value grade of A, while ETRN has a Value grade of C.Story continuesMRO has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than ETRN, so it seems like value investors will conclude that MRO is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

86,00edffa8-e25e-361b-b844-73ac44a11bd3,MRO,2023-10-17,Unlock the Value of Your Portfolio With 4 Low P/CF Stocks,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unlock-value-portfolio-4-low-124500759.html,1697460300,STORY,"['MRO', 'PVH', 'KBH', 'SEM']","[We always try to hit the jackpot while picking stocks. But striking the right chord each time is not easy unless blessed with Midas touch. When it comes to the investment market, experts consider value style as one of the most effective approaches. Value investing is essentially about selecting stocks that have good things going on for them, even at a time when they have been beaten down by some external factors.There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock’s inherent strength but a random selection of ratios cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company’s financial position. For this, we recommend Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) as one of the key metrics. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis — the lower the number, the better. Select Medical Holdings Corporation SEM, Marathon Oil Corporation MRO, PVH Corp. PVH and KB Home KBH boast a low P/CF ratio.Price to Cash Flow Reveals Financial HealthQuestions may arise as to why we are considering the Price to Cash Flow valuation metric, when the most widely used metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E). Well, what makes P/CF stand out is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly reflecting the financial health of a company.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. It is net cash flow that reveals how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is putting the same to use.A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company’s liquid assets. This gives the company the means to settle debt, shell out for its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Then again, a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.Story continuesWhat’s the Best Strategy?An investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and also consider the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.Here are the parameters for selecting true value stocks:P/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.P/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to their peers.P/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.P/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company’s sales — the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.PEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospects.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.Here are four of the eight stocks that qualified the screening.Select Medical Holdings, one of the largest operators of critical illness recovery hospitals, rehabilitation hospitals, outpatient rehabilitation clinics, and occupational health centers, sports a Zacks Rank #1.

The stock outperformed the S&amp;P 500, which registered a daily gain of 1.06%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.93%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 1.2%.The software maker's shares have seen a decrease of 0.75% over the last month, surpassing the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 2.02% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 3%.Investors will be eagerly watching for the performance of Microsoft in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings report is set to be unveiled on October 24, 2023. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $2.65, indicating a 12.77% growth compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $54.42 billion, up 8.57% from the year-ago period.For the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $10.90 per share and a revenue of $233.8 billion, signifying shifts of +11.11% and +10.33%, respectively, from the last year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Microsoft should also be noted by investors. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the company's business performance and profit potential.Our research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future.

Five have done the same for next year.That sent full year estimates down from $3.97 to $3.53.

Next year is estimated at 5.3%.For earnings, this year is contracting by 11.3%. Next year calls for a return to growth of 10%. Average those two years out and you still have contraction coming.ValuationThe lack of growth has valuations very cheap.

100,81e656e2-bbc7-353e-aebc-f452c1694d25,WBA,2023-10-17,Investing in Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA): Navigating the Thin Line Between Value and Trap,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-walgreens-boots-alliance-wba-153556126.html,1697470556.0,STORY,['WBA'],"[Value-focused investors are consistently seeking stocks that are priced below their intrinsic value. One such stock that deserves attention is Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA). The stock, currently priced at 22.62, recorded a loss of 2.71% in a day and a 3-month decrease of 20.55%. The stock's fair valuation is $45.98, as indicated by its GF Value.Understanding the GF ValueWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with WBA.The GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our unique method. It is calculated based on historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future estimates of the business performance. We believe the GF Value Line is the fair value that the stock should be traded at. If the stock price is significantly above or below the GF Value Line, it could indicate overvaluation or undervaluation respectively.Investing in Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA): Navigating the Thin Line Between Value and TrapHowever, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with Walgreens Boots Alliance should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of 1.74. These indicators suggest that Walgreens Boots Alliance, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Understanding the Altman Z-ScoreBefore delving into the details, it's crucial to understand what the Altman Z-score entails. Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Story continuesWalgreens Boots Alliance: A SnapshotWalgreens Boots Alliance is one of the largest retail pharmacy chains in the U.S., with over 8,500 locations. Nearly three quarters of Americans live within five miles of a Walgreens location. Roughly two thirds of revenue is generated from prescription drug sales, with Walgreens making up 20% of total prescription revenue in the U.S. Walgreens also generates sales from retail products, European drug wholesale, and healthcare. With more locations incorporating additional services like Health Corner and Village Medical, Walgreens creates an omnichannel experience for patients and positions itself as a one-stop healthcare provider.Investing in Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA): Navigating the Thin Line Between Value and TrapWalgreens Boots Alliance's Low Altman Z-Score: A Breakdown of Key DriversA dissection of Walgreens Boots Alliance's Altman Z-score reveals the company's financial health may be weak, suggesting possible financial distress:The Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio provides insights into a company's capability to reinvest its profits or manage debt. Evaluating Walgreens Boots Alliance's historical data, 2021: 0.38; 2022: 0.42; 2023: 0.34, we observe a declining trend in this ratio. This downward movement indicates Walgreens Boots Alliance's diminishing ability to reinvest in its business or effectively manage its debt, exerting a negative impact on its Z-Score.The EBIT to Total Assets ratio serves as a crucial barometer of a company's operational effectiveness. An analysis of Walgreens Boots Alliance's EBIT to Total Assets ratio from historical data (2021: 0.03; 2022: 0.07; 2023: -0.05) indicates a descending trend. This reduction suggests that Walgreens Boots Alliance might not be utilizing its assets to their full potential to generate operational profits, which could be negatively affecting the company's overall Z-score.When it comes to operational efficiency, a vital indicator for Walgreens Boots Alliance is its asset turnover. The data: 2021: 1.44; 2022: 1.48; 2023: 1.43 from the past three years suggests a recent decline following an initial increase in this ratio. The asset turnover ratio reflects how effectively a company is using its assets to generate sales. Therefore, a drop in this ratio can signify reduced operational efficiency, potentially due to underutilization of assets or decreased market demand for the company's products or services. This shift in Walgreens Boots Alliance's asset turnover underlines the need for the company to reassess its operational strategies to optimize asset usage and boost sales.ConclusionDespite its seemingly attractive valuation, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA) presents several risk factors that potential investors should not ignore. The company's low Altman Z-score and declining financial ratios suggest possible financial distress, making Walgreens Boots Alliance a potential value trap. Therefore, thorough due diligence is essential before making an investment decision.GuruFocus Premium members can find stocks with high Altman Z-Score using the following Screener: Walter Schloss Screen .This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

But unfortunately, some companies simply don't succeed. To wit, the Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) share price managed to fall 70% over five long years. We certainly feel for shareholders who bought near the top. And we doubt long term believers are the only worried holders, since the stock price has declined 30% over the last twelve months. Furthermore, it's down 20% in about a quarter. That's not much fun for holders. We note that the company has reported results fairly recently; and the market is hardly delighted. You can check out the latest numbers in our company report.While the last five years has been tough for Walgreens Boots Alliance shareholders, this past week has shown signs of promise. So let's look at the longer term fundamentals and see if they've been the driver of the negative returns. View our latest analysis for Walgreens Boots Alliance To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over five years Walgreens Boots Alliance's earnings per share dropped significantly, falling to a loss, with the share price also lower. This was, in part, due to extraordinary items impacting earnings. Since the company has fallen to a loss making position, it's hard to compare the change in EPS with the share price change. However, we can say we'd expect to see a falling share price in this scenario.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..Story continuesWhat About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Walgreens Boots Alliance, it has a TSR of -63% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 21% in the last year, Walgreens Boots Alliance shareholders lost 26% (even including dividends). However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 10% per year over five years. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should ""buy when there is blood on the streets"", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Walgreens Boots Alliance  that you should be aware of.Walgreens Boots Alliance is not the only stock that insiders are buying.

I'll now turn the call over to Ginger.Story continuesGinger L. Graham: Thanks, Tiffany, and good morning, everyone. The good news you heard yesterday is that Tim Wentworth has agreed to join WBA as our new Chief Executive Officer effective October 23. We are thrilled to have Tim and believe he will make a meaningful contribution to the future of the company with his deep knowledge and expertise in heath care. We’ve asked him to make a few comments this morning and I would like to turn it over to him now. Tim?Tim Wentworth: Thanks, Ginger. I’m excited to join the call today and even more excited to get to work after next week. During my nearly three decades in health care, I’ve led efforts to create innovative and flexible health services to meet the needs of health plans, employers and government organizations as well as their employees and members. And building a team that grew the largest, most operationally efficient PBM in the country or helping to establish Accredo as the most significant specialty pharmacy in the United States or helping to put together Evernorth [ph], a $100 billion plus health services business, I’ve consistently built relationships and offered solutions both for customers who are looking for a trusted innovative partner who listens, and for patients who are looking for access and affordability.This impact was the direct result of having a winning team of employees and a culture that valued patients. Now I know WBA. I have worked with Walgreens as a customer, partner, competitor, investor and family member, and I understand the challenges ahead for us as well as for the health care industry. Walgreens is built on convenience, access and trust and has unique advantages in today's health care environment. I see the opportunities before us to build on our pharmacy strength, and our trusted brand to evolve health care and the customer experience to deliver better outcomes at a lower cost. Now I've learned a lot over the recent weeks, as you might imagine. I've spent time with each and every Board member, talking about the future and their priorities, learning about our challenges and opportunities, and most importantly, the importance of execution.Those discussions inform my own research. And of course, I have my personal experiences. For example, just last week, Maeve, a terrific store employee in Rochester, New York, professionally and cheerfully delivered to me a critical prescription to help my mother. It was the kind of experience I appreciate and everyone deserves. And I know that Maeve is surrounded by committed pharmacists and other team members, all of whom together can improve the lives of each person who walks through our door in my mom's hometown Walgreens in Rochester, and in every store we operate. All of these experiences together made my decision to join WBA, frankly, an easy one. There is a reservoir of goodwill for this company across communities, and a substantial opportunity to return value to our customers, employees and shareholders.Alongside the Board, our team members and partners, I'm enthusiastic about our future and realizing our health care strategy and vision. I'm humbled to serve as WBA's next CEO and look forward to speaking to many of you in the coming weeks. Ginger, thank you, and thank you to the entire WBA Board for this opportunity. I'll now turn it back to you.Ginger L. Graham: Thanks, Tim. I'm excited and looking forward to working with you. While Tim won't be on the Q&amp;A, I'm sure he will be talking with all of you soon after he joins the company. With that let me turn to our business results. My time here has been very focused on stabilizing our talent, addressing our level of spending relative to the scale of our business, and critically reviewing our capital allocation across the business. With the benefit of having been on the Board, it has accelerated my ability to work with the team and make swift decisions and implement changes across many areas of our operations. We have focused on three near-term operational priorities. We must support our customer facing activities, scrutinize every penny of spend that does not directly benefit the customer, and improve cash management.I will restate what we know and is critical to our future. We believe the fundamentals of our core business remain strong. We dispensed over a billion prescriptions annually across our retail and specialty pharmacies. We play a key role in health care delivery in this country. 78% of Americans live within 5 miles of a Walgreens or a Duane Reade and 58% of us are likely to visit a local pharmacy as the first step for a non-emergency health need. Our trusted brand, deep community relationships and convenience form the foundation of our pharmacy business and our platform for growth as we expand throughout other areas of health care. I see significant opportunity to improve the cost base of this business. During the last 6 weeks, we have taken decisive actions to right size our cost structure.We expect over $1 billion of cost savings during fiscal year 2024 based on the actions we have already taken and are in progress. Examples include reducing our headquarter cost going line by line, expense category by expense category and reducing all non-essential spend. We've reviewed and are reducing areas for contracted or project work. We are altering our store operating hours based on local market trends. We are closing unprofitable stores. We're driving supply chain efficiencies including using AI to more accurately forecast demand and optimizing our transportation network. We're also implementing centralized services that control inventory, reduce workload and provide better customer support. We're taking a hard look at all projects and stopping those that are not essential.These actions reduce expenses, but more importantly, they help focus our energy on the most important needs for the business and for our customers. We are more aggressively managing decisions that impact cash. This includes working capital management, targeting over $500 million of improvement and defining near-term capital expenditure reductions, which we expect will bolster our balance sheet and support our priorities. Let me give you some examples. One major effort at Walgreens has been to introduce a perpetual pharmacy inventory system across the chain. As of last week, it is available to all 9,000 of our stores. This provides complete visibility of our inventory in the pharmacies, and supports our work to reduce excess inventory and free up working capital.It also has many benefits for the pharmacy staff and feedback has been overwhelmingly positive as it simplifies workflows reducing store level activities. Another area where we have reduced working capital and impacted our workflow at the store level is related to regional micro fulfillment centers. These centers allow us to improve product availability, while at the same time reduce total inventory levels. Our 11th Micro fulfillment Center opened 3 weeks ago. These centers currently support more than 4,300 stores, filling over 2.3 million prescriptions each week across 29 states. As we fill more prescriptions centrally, it frees up our staff to spend more time with customers offering other health related products and services, and it relieves some of the pressure on store staffing.It is important to note that we have paused further expansion of our fulfillment centers to first drive improvements in the rollout. So we may fully realize the many benefits the center's offer; working capital reduction, inventory tracking and control, customer service enhancements, workflow improvements and reduction in cost of sale. The team has defined threshold requirements of performance before we move to implement the final five locations. There is significant opportunity to reduce retail inventory and optimize our retail product mix. We are reducing SKUs, addressing slow moving product categories and moving eCommerce shipments to fulfillment by our stores, getting the delivery to the customer in most cases in less than 1 hour. This is augmented by real progress on our own brands, which offers a big opportunity that we have been slow to capture.All of these working capital improvements yield customer service benefits and workflow improvements for our staff. Cash is also influenced by our capital expenditure budgets. And we are reducing our capital expenditures in fiscal year 2024 compared to last year, down approximately $600 million. We have already identified many of the actions required to deliver this improvement and to ensure that we execute all capital and project expenses are now being reviewed and approved centrally. One other important action I want to mention is our return to the office. I have recently communicated that our leaders are expected to return to the office this month, and all other team members are expected back in late November. We're convinced that our ability to act quickly, deliver priority projects and respond to business demands will be improved by being together.With that, I'll hand it over to Manmohan to review our financial results and our outlook for fiscal year 2024.Manmohan Mahajan: Thank you, Ginger, and good morning. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS came in near the low end of the range provided on June 27 and in line with our update on September 1. Our results reflected a further slowdown in respiratory events, shifting consumer behaviors driven by a challenging macroeconomic environment and lower COVID-19 related contributions. Overall, we delivered 8.3% sales growth on a constant currency basis. This includes $1.4 billion in growth in our health care business versus the prior year. Our U.S Retail Pharmacy business grew 3.6% and our Boots U.K business delivered 10.9% sales growth. Adjusted EPS of $0.67 was down 18%, on a constant currency basis. The 18% decline was driven by lower COVID-19 contributions, lower sale leaseback gains net of rent and a higher tax rate.We saw positive results from underlying retail pharmacy performance, lower incentive accruals strong international growth and improved profitability in U.S health care. GAAP net loss of $180 million improved by $235 million compared to prior year. Remember that we had a $783 million noncash impairment charge in the year ago quarter. The loss in the quarter was driven by charges for certain legal and regulatory accruals and settlements, and one-time charges related to transformational cost management program. Now let's move to the year-to-date highlights. Fiscal '23 sales increased 5.6% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EPS of $3.98 was down 20.3% on a constant currency basis. Our results reflected lower COVID-19 contributions and increased labor investments.These challenges were partly offset by lower incentive accruals, growth in international and retail performance in the U.S. GAAP net loss was $3.1 billion compared to net earnings of $4.3 billion in fiscal '22. Fiscal '23 included a $5.5 billion after tax charge for opioid-related claims and lawsuits. Now, let's move to the U.S Retail Pharmacy segments. Comp sales growth was 5.7% reflecting higher brand inflation and mix impacts in our pharmacy business and comp script growth. AOI was down 29.4% in the quarter, reflecting a 27% impact from lower COVID-19 contributions and a 17% impact from lower levels of sale leaseback gains net of rent, higher underlying pharmacy gross profit, and lower incentive accruals contributed positively to AOI. Let me now turn to U.S Pharmacy.Pharmacy comp sales increased 9.2% in the quarter, driven by brand inflation and mix impacts and comp script growth. A weaker than normal respiratory season and impact of Medicaid redeterminations resulted in a weaker overall prescription market during the quarter. Third-party market data showed flu, cold and respiratory activity down 35% compared to the prior year quarter. Despite these weaker trends, comp scripts grew 1.6% excluding immunizations. We administered roughly 400,000 COVID-19 vaccinations in the quarter, down from 2.9 million in the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of COVID-19, fourth quarter adjusted gross profit increased versus the prior year period. Turning next to our U.S Retail business. During the quarter, the Retail business was impacted by a weaker than normal respiratory season, and a continued shift in consumer behaviors driven by a challenging macroeconomic environment.As a result, comparable sales declined 3.3% in the quarter. There are three main drivers. First, an 80% decline in COVID-19 test kits impacted growth by around 160 basis points. Second, weaker cough, cold, flu sales had an approximately 100 basis points impact. And lastly, we were impacted by approximately 60 basis points from summer seasonal weakness as customers continue to pull back on discretionary spending, reflecting the challenging macroeconomic environment. Looking at category performance, we saw a decline in health and wellness while personal care and beauty both grew low single digits. Retail gross margin was impacted by elevated shrink and lower sales in a higher margin categories such as cough, cold, flu, seasonal and COVID-19 test kits.Despite the pressure in the second half, gross margin grew by nearly 100 basis points in fiscal '23 on top of 100 basis point increase in the prior year. Turning next to the international segment, and as always, I will talk in constant currency numbers. The International segment again performed very well in the quarter delivering profit ahead of guidance. Sales increased 6.7% with growth across all international markets. Boots U.K was up 10.9% and Germany wholesale grew 3.5%. Gross Profit increased nearly 10%, outpacing sales growth. Boots U.K experienced continued strong retail growth and improved pharmacy margin compared to the prior year period. Despite higher inflation and increased store related costs, SG&amp;A as a percentage of sales improved, benefiting from disciplined cost management.These impacts resulted in adjusted operating income growth of 52%. Let's now look in more details at Boots U.K. Comp retail sales increased 11.7% on top of a 15.2% comp in the prior year quarter. Boots grew market share for the 10th consecutive quarter, approximately 1 percentage point versus the prior year quarter. With gains in beauty and health and wellness, Boots.com sales grew 29% year-on-year and represented over 13% of our U.K Retail sales. Turning next to U.S Healthcare. U.S Healthcare segment results were in line with the guidance provided on June 27 with AOI and adjusted EBITDA both up sequentially and year-over-year. The business continues to rapidly scale with fourth quarter sales of $2 billion, reflecting the acquisition of CareCentrix, the acquisition of Summit Health by VillageMD and growth in all businesses.Segment pro forma sales grew 19% driven by VillageMD sales of $1.4 billion, up 17% on a pro forma basis. The growth was led by higher value-based lives, expansion of the clinic footprint and increased fee-for-service volumes as clinics mature. CareCentrix sales were up 24% on a pro forma basis, and Shields delivered pro forma sales growth of 29%. Segment gross profit improved 29% sequentially. Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $30 million, an improvement of $103 million from the prior year quarter. Turning next to the cash flow. We generated $2.3 billion of operating cash flow in fiscal '23, reflecting lower COVID-19 contributions, opioid settlement payments and losses in our U.S Healthcare segment. Fiscal '23 capital expenditures of $2.1 billion increased by approximately $400 million compared to the prior year.This was driven by growth initiatives, including VillageMD and the micro fulfillment center rollout. This resulted in free cash flow of $665 million. We also reduced debt by $2.6 billion in fiscal '23. As Ginger discussed, we are taking a number of actions to drive improvement in free cash flow in fiscal '24, including approximately $600 million in reduced capital expenditures, and approximately $500 million benefit from working capital optimization initiatives. I will now turn to our fiscal '24 guidance. We are guiding to fiscal '24 adjusted EPS of $3.20 to $3.50, down from $3.98 in fiscal '23. Before discussing underlying performance, I want to mention some key headwinds that we will face in fiscal '24. These include lower sale and leaseback contributions, a higher tax rate and lower COVID-19 contributions.We're also assuming continued macroeconomic pressure on the consumer and a weaker respiratory season compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of these headwinds, our forecast assumes underlying growth which is primarily driven by two factors. First, we expect accelerating profitability in our U.S Healthcare business in 2024 as the segment continues to scale with adjusted EBITDA expected to be at or around breakeven Second, we expect U.S Retail Pharmacy underlying adjusted operating income to be driven by immediate actions to improve the cost base and modest underlying growth in both retail and pharmacy. Let me now illustrate the larger moving pieces as we bridge from fiscal '23 to fiscal '24. I mentioned three notable headwinds to adjusted EPS, sale and leaseback is estimated to have a negative year on year impact of between 11% to 13%.As we have said before, we do not expect any contribution from sale and leaseback beyond fiscal '24. Tax rates will be higher in 2024, increasing by approximately 10 percentage points compared to 2023 due to higher international rates and benefits recognized in 2023 that are not expected to repeat in 2024. Finally, we're projecting lower COVID-19 contributions that result in a 6% to 7% year-on-year impact. Excluding these impacts, we expect underlying growth of 9% to 12% driven by accelerating profitability in U.S Healthcare, and immediate actions to improve our cost base across the company. Let me now walk you through the 2024 guidance in greater detail. Overall, we expect total sales in fiscal '24 to be up 1% to 4% on a constant currency basis.Adjusted operating income is expected to be down 5% to 12% on a constant currency basis. Let me now walk you through the assumptions and guidance for each of our reporting segments starting with U.S Retail Pharmacy. U.S Retail Pharmacy segment sales are projected to be flat to up 2%. AOI will be negatively impacted by approximately 8 percentage points from the lower COVID-19 contributions and roughly 11 percentage points of lower sale and leaseback gains. Excluding these impacts, the underlying business is projected to drive 5% to 10% AOI growth. I will now take you through the key business drivers. First, we anticipate script volume growth driven by overall market growth. On reimbursement, we have roughly 75% of the contract signed for calendar year '24.We do expect reimbursement pressure to be less of a headwind in fiscal '24 than in fiscal '23. We're projecting approximately 5 million COVID vaccinations in 2024. Quarter-to-date, we're well on track and have already administered over 3 million COVID vaccinations. In Retail, we expect margins to benefit from our category performance improvement program and a roughly 1 percentage point increase in on-rent penetration. At the same time, we're adopting a prudent approach. We see a continuation of the challenging trends that impacted the second half of fiscal 2023. We're projecting flat comparable sales due to a milder cough, cold and flu season year-on-year; lower COVID OTC test kit volume and continued consumer pressure. We're also planning a higher level of shrink, which has been increasing in the last several months and continues to represent a serious systemic issue across the retail industry.Within SG&amp;A, we expect to achieve over $1 billion of cost savings during fiscal 2024 as Ginger has already described. Turning next to guidance for the International segment. Segment sales are projected flat to up 4% on a constant currency basis. We expect adjusted operating income of $745 million to $770 million, representing a constant currency decline of 18% to 21%. The year-on-year decline is entirely driven by property transactions during fiscal '23 which will not be repeated and the pending sales of the business in Chile. Excluding those impacts, we expect AOI growth to be flat to up 2% with continued execution within Boots U.K Retail business held back by the impact of inflationary pressures. Now let's turn to U.S Healthcare. We are focused on driving improved financial performance for U.S Healthcare in 2024.We expect fiscal '24 sales of $8.3 billion to $8.8 billion, reflecting first full year of Summit held an ongoing growth in all businesses. On a pro forma basis, we see sales growth of 10% to 17% and expect fiscal '24 adjusted EBITDA to be breakeven at the midpoint of the guidance range. This represents an increase of $325 million to $425 million compared to fiscal '23 driven by growth in full risk lives, fee-for-service volume, optimization of the clinic footprint and realignment of the cost base at VillageMD. Robust growth at Shields and Walgreens health business growth driven by scaling of our clinical trial business and health care services and through cost management. We assume an effective tax rate of approximately 19% to 20% with the year-over-year increase driven by higher international statutory tax rates and benefits recognized in 2023 that are not expected to repeat in 2024.Interest expense is expected to decrease by approximately $80 million. In the first quarter, we will be lapping the prior year quarters adjusted EPS of $1.16. The following five factors are expected to have an outsized impact in the first quarter this year. First, we had a significant tax benefit in prior year period, which will not repeat in the first quarter of 2024. Second, we're expecting COVID-19 contributions to be lower in the first quarter, reflecting last year's Omicron wave and seasonality. Third, we anticipate lower contributions from sale and leaseback activity. Fourth, we're lapping elevated levels of labor investments in our pharmacy staff. Finally, we also expect a more normalized flu season in fiscal '24 peaking in the second quarter versus the early start in the prior year.Moving beyond the first quarter, we will see sequential improvement, and I will discuss the top four drivers. First, we're executing a series of actions to lower our cost base. These will have limited impact on the first quarter, but will start to ramp in the second quarter. There is adjusted EPS benefit of $0.50 to $0.60 in the balance of the year compared to the first quarter. Second, in our U.S Healthcare segment, we expect profitability to improve from optimizing the clinic footprint, growing patient panels and realigning costs. Third, we expect growing contributions from retail initiatives, including sequentially improving retail comps and margin expansion programs. Finally, seasonality plays a role in our business benefiting the second quarter, which is usually the height of the cough, cold, flu season in the U.S and as when Boots U.K sees significant profit driven by the holiday season.With that, let me now hand it over to John to discuss our U.S Healthcare business.John Driscoll: Good morning, and thanks Manmohan. Over the past 2 years, we've acquired or launched new businesses in primary care, multi specialty, post acute care, urgent care, specialty pharmacy services, population health and provider enablement. Each of these businesses builds upon our strong foundation in retail pharmacy to tap into high growth health care services. Walgreens uniquely has an advantage in convenience, consumer traffic, independence and trust that will help us with our health plan and provider partners create solutions that deliver better outcomes at lower cost. We connect daily with many of the patients that our plan and provider partners struggle to reach. Our goal is to be the independent partner of choice, not just in pharmacy, but also in health care services, where we can lower costs and help patients.Today, most of our customers come to Walgreens to meet their pharmacy needs. Increasingly and in the future, our pharmacy teams will be a critical part of how our plan and provider partners bend the cost curve. So whether you're a health plan or a health system, you're dealing with one Walgreens and a suite of capabilities and services. Here are some of the ways that our U.S Healthcare assets work with Walgreens to better serve our customers and payer provider and pharma clients. Shields is working with our Walgreens Specialty Pharmacy to convert Walgreens locations to Shields partner sites, collaborating with our contract pharmacies and delivering better adherence for patients on complex specialty drugs, and better value for hospitals. Walgreens Health and CareCentrix are partnering with Pearl Health to support providers who'd like to transition from fee-for-service to value-based care by leveraging Pearls Tech Solutions with Walgreens Healthcare Services, will accept full medical risk as we support physicians, patients by providing post acute and home health solutions from CareCentrix and population health services for more green [indiscernible], all of this is underpinned by Walgreens engagement of our customers, ensuring them access to better care.Our clinical trials business, which launched just last year, leverages our pharmacy capabilities and data to recruit and execute on clinical trials for our pharma clients. We will engage patients in all markets, including underserved communities. To date, we've signed 15 contracts and continue to see increasing demand for our services. CareCentrix provides an increasing number of post acute services to health plans. Combining Walgreens convenient locations, and CareCentrix health plan relationships, and patient management opens the door for a significant opportunity in durable medical equipment sales in our stores. The U.S Healthcare segment has ramped to an $8 billion sales run rate in just 2 years. Our health care services aim to deliver better value for our payer and provider partners.We meet patients where they are in order to improve access to lower cost solutions. While we have made progress on the build out of our health care business, we are not satisfied with the near-term returns on our investments. We will continue to grow in 2024, but with a renewed focus on more profitable growth. We have seen some improved performance in the fourth quarter with adjusted EBITDA sequentially increasing by $83 million. Our results reflect gross profit growth with each quarter this year building on the prior with an enhanced focus on expense discipline. We are taking swift action to unlock the embedded profits at Village and already see the benefit of improved capital and expense management with the addition of our new CFO at Village, Rich Rubino.VillageMD, Summit Health and CityMD will be the most meaningful drivers of growth in fiscal 2024. It has taken us longer than anticipated to realize the cost synergies across the combined assets. We also need to solve for a less efficient cost profile and excellence in execution. We believe that we can best enhance VillageMD growth and value by focusing on increased density in our highest opportunity markets and expanding integration of our digital assets. As we grow, we are constantly evaluating our footprint. With that, we plan to exit approximately five markets and approximately 60 clinics in fiscal 2024. These exits may take a variety of forms, including outright sales and hybrid equity arrangements as examples. As we exit these non-strategic markets, our long-term focus will be on achieving density and those regions with the greatest potential to drive future profitability growth and where we can best serve patients with our consolidated set of assets.The VillageMD model works as evidenced by the consistent performance of reducing total cost of care and improving outcomes in our more mature markets. VillageMD has a net promoter score of 89 which is one point higher than what I shared a year ago. We are also launching new virtual and less capital intensive models. In August we launched a pilot program with CityMD and Duane Reade, where a Duane Reade Walgreens customer can click a QR code and set up a visit at CityMD or a virtual telehealth visit with a clinician. We plan to roll out this digital partnership across Manhattan in the fall. Our VillageMD business is a primary care led risk bearing platform serving all customers and payers focusing on utilizing their technology platform to deliver the best health outcomes and a lower total cost of care.Growth in clinics translates into growth and full risk lives as evidenced by the growth in member months in all markets and mature markets. From fiscal year 2022 to 2023, VillageMD has grown full risk member months by 40% across all markets and 24% in our mature markets. Even with the rapid growth of VillageMD clinics, we're seeing positive proof points of the business's ability to perform in full risk arrangements. For our full risk MA population in three mature markets, we've seen Village bend the cost curve across multiple payers. Going forward as we focus on more profitable growth, we will build on positive clinical margin to deliver contribution margin on a consolidated basis. Next, I'd like to discuss our latest Walgreens Health partnership.We're partnering with Pearl Health, a provider enablement company that can help Walgreens expand our risk offering to more community based primary care providers. Walgreens and Pearl together will provide a management services offering with Walgreens providing prescription fulfillment, medication adherence, immunizations, care gap closures and diagnostic testing. Integrating local Walgreens pharmacies translates into more access to members with chronic illness, and more opportunities to influence better patient outcomes. This partnership enables physicians and health systems to work with us to manage the chronically ill in a much more targeted fashion. Pearl's access to doctors through the ACR reach program creates a care, traffic control system that can deliver on our commitment to provide better health care at a lower price for plans and patients.This model is also capital efficient, scalable and configurable nationwide. With this partnership, we are initially assuming risk for 9,000 lives in 12 markets. Our existing Walgreens health payer relationships have started with deeper service arrangements tied to care gap closures, clinical quality services and screening. Successful performance with these services provides a sound foundation for moving up the risk continuum. We expect to develop a range of risk arrangements that will leverage our assets across the care continuum, including VillageMD, Summit and CareCentrix, all building on our suite of clinical services available at Walgreens. With that, I'd like to pass it back to Ginger for closing remarks.Ginger L. Graham: Thank you, John. The last several weeks have reinforced my confidence in the company's potential and also crystallized what actions must be taken to achieve it. We are focused on the right things. I am already encouraged by early results from decisions that advance our customer focus, eliminate cost and conserve cash. While we have a challenging year ahead of us, as Manmohan said earlier, our plan anticipates 9% to 12% growth in adjusted operating income from our underlying business. This comes in large part from our aggressive actions to manage costs we control. Of course, none of this would be possible without the hard work and dedication of a vast team of people here at WBA. They are doing the work, and they move quickly to respond to the realities of the business.I'm thankful for their responsiveness and commitment and for the opportunity that lies ahead as we set up WBA for a successful future together. Now I would like to open the line for questions. Operator?See also 20 Best US Cities for Athletes and 10 Stocks With Huge Catalysts on the Way.Q&amp;A SessionOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Lisa Gill from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.Lisa Gill: Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. I just really wanted to understand two things a little bit better. First, John, when you talk about the ramp and the challenges to profitability, one; when we think about that improved profitability, the exit of those markets from the 60 clinics, is that contributing to better AOI as we think about 2024? And then secondly, kind of trying to better understand where you see the biggest opportunities from a talent perspective, you talked about a lot of positives, Pearl, you talked about the turnaround at Village, obviously CareCentrix did really well this quarter, but can you maybe just talk about what are some of the other challenges you feel like you need to overcome to really truly make this a profitable business?John Driscoll: Sure. I think, Lisa, thanks for the question. If you think about the cost reduction, that's only one piece of what we're doing at Village, City and Summit. It's really a three prong strategy. We are right sizing the footprint and getting our expenses in the right place. There are revenue synergy opportunities and we are seeing consistent growth in core revenues, which indicate that there's some opportunity on the margin side, which we are quickly getting after. And then the rest of U.S Healthcare, actually, we're seeing substantial growth and building profitability and CareCentrix, Shields, our Analytics Business, or U.S Healthcare business. So we're seeing substantial demand clinical trials is doing quite well. And so I think as a portfolio, we have -- we are very confident in our ability to perform in '24. If you look at those revenue numbers, we've got the revenues. Now we're going to get at some -- more effectively some of the embedded profits.Lisa Gill: And then does this ties into kind of what everybody is talking about on the retail side, right. And I know you've given some guidance there. But as we think about expectation of scripts coming down, I would think that maybe there's an opportunity for more scripts to be pulled through into Walgreens. I understand respiratory, et cetera. But maybe if somebody can comment, Rick, if Rick is on the call, how do you think about that pull-through an opportunity on the script, excluding what we're seeing on the respiratory side? I know that the talk was 75% of relationships are signed on reimbursement, but reimbursements are expected to be down like what are going to be some of the big drivers beyond the $1 billion of incremental cost saves, that we can actually see drive the operating profit and your core pharmacy business?Rick Gates: Yes. And, Lisa, this is Rick, it's a great question. And I'll kind of give the building blocks to script growth that we're expecting this year. Obviously, we saw a weaker end of the fiscal year from market growth, specifically around cough, cold, flu, some of the respiratory and some of the Medicaid redetermination, which showed some lower utilization from consumers. So the primary driver is the market coming back in line with what the expectations are from IQVIA and others. And so that's really what we've seen as we've started into the first quarter of the fiscal year. And market is going to be a big underpinning to what we do. But we continue to advance our adherence programs that are really driving incremental script growth, partnering with health plans and others to really drive better adherence.And obviously, that does help on the script side. You're also going to see some access initiatives, especially going into calendar year '24, which should be some tailwind for us. I think some change in dynamics in the marketplace or having individuals choose more open access and things that should give us access differently than what we've seen in the past. And the last one would be that we're really focused on potential profile buys and opportunities, given some of the changes in the marketplace. So I think there's a bunch of drivers that really give us confidence that we have tailwinds behind us in the script [indiscernible].Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.Charles Rhyee: Yes, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about Tim, coming on board here. Obviously, it seems like it was a fairly quick turnaround process. Maybe you can give us a little bit more insight into the -- that kind of hiring process, sort of when he was identified. And also here, obviously, starting in a week and a half or so, the company has given guidance. Any kind of sense on his involvement in sort of the business planning for the coming year -- anything there? And then also, obviously, you've given a lot of details in preserving and generating greater cash flow, obviously, through working capital reduction, et cetera. Any thoughts from the Board on sort of the dividend policy at this point?Ginger L. Graham: Thanks, Charles. Let me start off with the process around Tim. We, as a Board, engaged Global Executive Search firm, and spent quite a bit of time with them talking about what we believe were the important characteristics, attributes and experiences of someone who would lead an organization of this impact and magnitude. We did review dozens of candidates, there was quite an extensive search process was undertaken. And we then narrowed it down to a top few where personal interviews were conducted with those individuals. We did a very aggressive background and reference check with the primary candidates, and then have had what I would call very extended conversations, in a broad sense about philosophy, background, experiences, the future, the market dynamics, the capabilities required, and about the ability to manage a very complex global organization.As Tim mentioned in his comments, every single Board member has been involved. I would say that we've done a very extensive evaluation through the process. And we did decide in the process that Tim was a very striking candidate for us on a number of fronts. Obviously, we were clear that we were looking for someone who had extensive background in health care. And Tim brings that pharmacy, provider, payer networks distribution. He really does understand a surround sound of the feedback that we get from the market about Walgreens and its many businesses. He also has managed scale and complexity before, which I think is very important. This is $140 billion business, it's global. It has many possibilities. But someone has to be able to manage the strategic and the operational aspects of that.And I think you heard from him, even in his quick comments, he's very patient and customer focused, which to me is of primary importance because that passion for the business, the understanding we have on human lives, the importance of our disciplines, our safety and compliance, our quality, our personnel, and the love he has of the store, those are big, big wins for the company. So I personally am thrilled I've had I don't know how many hours with Tim. And it's a lot and he and I are not done yet. We actually start together next week in a very extended work session. So I think the Board is excited as Tim conveyed his excitement. And we're all looking forward to him starting obviously, that won't happen again now for till the 23rd. So you -- the second question, you ask, what's his involvement in all of this?Obviously, we've only recently come to this agreement between us. And so Tim has not been involved at all, in the business or the operations. He's not been a party to forming the 2024 plan. Although he and I have had extensive discussions about what the opportunities are the business capabilities and our challenges, I think he mentioned maybe in his comments as well, that he comes in eyes wide open. So I think that's very important. But Tim is not a party to this plan. He is a party to what we believe is possible, and he understands the assumptions we're making. And he can't wait to get here. The third question I think you asked was the Board and its discussions about the dividend. So as you might imagine, this is a very important topic to the company.We have a very thorough process as a Board that we review every year. And at this point, the Board's made no changes to the dividend policy.Operator: Your next question comes from the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.George Hill: Yes. Good morning, guys. This is kind of a two-part question that go together. I guess, can you talk about -- think about the segment's how we should look at apportioning the $1 billion in cost savings. And kind of the other side of that is the cut in CapEx seems pretty severe. Its taking $0.5 billion or so [indiscernible] $2 billion number. How should we think about from a segment perspective, kind of where the CapEx cuts are coming from, and kind of how they're being apportioned. And I don't know if you can kind of give any examples, specifically of big sources of cost cutting savings, where the bigger sources of CapEx savings? Thanks.A - Manmohan Mahajan: Yes, sure. So let me start with the cost savings. We're expecting at least a $1 billion of cost saving. And I think the way you need to think about this is majority of this is going to be coming from our U.S Retail Pharmacy business. And you have three or four components, let me just walk through them real quick. Ginger talked about, we're looking at all costs related to headquarters support office, and we're going line by line. So that's one. We are closing unprofitable locations, and that's going to be accretive in the year. We have optimized store hours in certain locations to match with, where the local market already is. And I think the other big component of this is, we've looked at all the project spend, and all the projects that exist across the company, and I think the focus is there twofold.More importantly, it's how do we focus the organization on customer focus initiated so that we deliver more value. But then obviously, reducing the spend on the income statement. So that's on the cost side. Look on the CapEx side, I'd say, if you look at the trend we've seen, you go back to maybe fiscal '22, I think we were at around $1.4 billion in the year. We increased to -- this is '21, sorry. So -- and then we went up $300 million. And again, last year was the peak of 2.1. And so all we're trying to achieve here is getting back to kind of the normal levels of CapEx here. Two parts that are going to contribute into this, again, is one, as John talked about, we're very focused on our health care segment, on profitable growth and so. We will see a lower level of CapEx or growth CapEx coming out from U.S Healthcare segment.And then, if you look at a couple of drivers of the CapEx on the U.S Retail Pharmacy, Micro Fulfillment Centers as well as our digital transformation, some of those things are coming to fruition. And Ginger talked about, taking the pause on Micro Fulfillment Center, so that we increase the productivity and achieve the desired results [indiscernible]. So those are some of the factors, high-level that are driving the CapEx reduction.Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Caliendo from UBS. Please go ahead.Kevin Caliendo: Thanks and thanks for taking my question. The 60 clinics that are closing, sort of what was the driving factor there? Why were they not successful? Was it competition in the marketplace? Was it payer relationships? Like why weren't you able to drive volumes in those markets? What happened there? What can you learn from that?A - Manmohan Mahajan: Kevin, it's a fair question. I think the way to think about the 60 clinic reductions is that some of them will be closed. In some cases, we're going to transition those to affiliate relationships. But it comes down to how quickly can we unlock profitable growth. And in the Village, City, Summit, it's about concentration of power and relevance within certain markets. Every one of our clinics actually shows month over month growth, but we don't see the growth coming fast enough in certain markets. And so we're going to pivot there and be very focused on where we can drive the most profitable growth. We're growing through the right sizing of our footprint, and some of the changes in our relationships. But our strategy going forward will be really focusing on markets where we see that momentum and scale and at a level that we want to see to drive the profits and the margin expectations that we want.So it's really more of a discipline around focusing on markets where we can go deep and continue to grow in a compounded series way, profitably.Kevin Caliendo: Okay. That -- that's helpful. Can I just ask a quick follow-up on cash flow? Is the right way to think about it? I know you didn't provide fiscal '24 free cash flow, but should we take the 655, add the 600 million and reduce CapEx? 500 million benefit in working cap and then adjust for net income, is that like a rough range of where you think it would -- should come out for fiscal '24?A - Manmohan Mahajan: Yes, sure. So, look, as at the end of the stand, and as you rightly pointed out, we do not generally provide guidance on the free cash flows. But we have outlined -- we do expect significant growth. And what we did here is we've carved out two significant drivers year-on-year. But having said that, and then we're looking at a third one to that as well just on the U.S Healthcare, we are expecting in fiscal '24 at the midpoint of the range to be breakeven on the EBITDA. And when you look at that year-on-year, that is significant improvement on the cash as well. So having said that, we're also looking at other offsetting items. So, we just wanted to make sure we have kind of the three. We do expect significant improvement and we’ve those three key drivers there.Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies. Please go ahead.Brian Tanquilut: Hi, good morning. I guess, John, just a question of VillageMD, right. You're clearly showing some expectation for meaningful year-over-year improvement there or at least the whole Walgreens Health segment. As I think about the fact that you're opening new clinics, how does the J curve factor into this, right. Because I'm just trying to bridge to that significant improvement when you're opening new clinics, simply [ph] you will lose money?John Driscoll: Sure. Well, first of all, I think we're essentially stopped the opening of new clinics. But remember, the J curve really refers most clearly to Village. With Summit and City, we've got consistent growing revenues that balance that a bit and actually help kind of develop -- show a better profit profile. And then we've got solid growth building quarter-over-quarter which Shields, CareCentrix, our Analytics Business, our Clinical Trials business and U.S Healthcare. So I think you've got to think about it as a portfolio. The J curve specifically impacting the new clinics that we are in the early stage clinics at four village but we've got a lot of other levers to pull or really advantages in the momentum and the margin profile -- improving margin profile across the other businesses.Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Anderson from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.Elizabeth Anderson: Hi, guys. Thanks so much for the question. One thing that's been obviously a hot topic this year is utilization. Obviously, you guys have a mixed model that both has fee-for-service as well as value-based care lives. Can you talk through us how you sort of see those inflections in utilization impacting of the VillageMD overall -- business overall? And then secondly, can you just comment more generally on sort of any additional deleveraging plans you have for this year? Thank you.John Driscoll: I think on the utilization, utilization is our friend, obviously at City and at Summit, and has been more of a headwind in Village. The good news from a Village perspective is that even with that, increasing in utilization post-COVID, that we are particularly in our mature markets showing an improved margin profile on our full risk lives. And so it's the way we solve for what's a benefit of having a two-part portfolio is continuing to convert more of those fee-for-service lives to full risk lives with a better margin profile, and optimizing our cost base so that we can get the full value of that improvement in revenues.A - Manmohan Mahajan: Yes, and I think on the question around deleveraging, couple of thoughts there. Number one, we're absolutely committed to our investment grade reading. And as we've said, one of the key areas of focus here in last 6 to 8 weeks for me and Ginger has been cash management. I've gone through that as to how we're going to drive the improvement there. And last I would point out is we continue to have a portfolio of investments which we look at simplification and optimizing that provides us flexibility.Operator: Our final question comes from Eric Percher from Nephron Research. Please go ahead.Eric Percher: Thank you. I'd like to turn to the topic of labor and ask to what extent you're seeing headwinds from labor cost? And I think there's probably a bit of a reminder on the one-time costs you saw on fiscal year '23 versus fiscal year '24?John Driscoll: Yes, maybe let me start with the one-time costs. Look, we have significant savings here that we're going to achieve in fiscal '24. And obviously there is going to be a cost associated with it. But when I look at the cash flow impact in the year within '24, we see a positive impact net-net from a cash flow perspective of cost savings initiative net of the costs associated with it. On the labor cost, yes, look, we have seen investments in last year and a half. If you think about Q1, Q1 would be the last quarter where we would see headwinds from a labor investment perspective. Because most of these investments were in play starting second quarter last year. Apart from that I think normal business course investments and labor will continue.Operator: We have no further questions in the queue at this time. Ginger Graham, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.Ginger L. Graham: Thanks so much, and thanks everyone for joining the call and your questions. We really appreciate the feedback and the support. We are clear on our challenges and our priorities and we are focused on the future. We're looking forward to your further question. So please reach out to our Investor Relations team. Thanks very much.Operator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.]"

The program involves strategic priorities, which include enhancing customers’ experiences via digital tools and improving the supply chain to cater to customers efficiently. In its last earnings call, management highlighted that it expects to witness continued gains from the Recipe for Growth plan and is on track to grow 1.5 times faster than the market by the end of fiscal 2024.Sysco also believes in acquiring assets to strengthen and expand its businesses. Recently, the company revealed its intentions to take over Edward Don &amp; Company, which boasts annual revenues of roughly $1.3 billion. This buyout underscores its focus on Recipe for Growth. The buyout is likely to help Sysco establish a specialty Equipment and Supplies platform, offering a more comprehensive selection and improved customer service. Also, in June 2023, Sysco’s specialty produce business — FreshPoint — took over BIX Produce. The buyout helps FreshPoint strengthen its geographical presence in unexplored areas and enhance its specialty produce offerings.Despite the positives, the company has been encountering product cost inflation in the U.S. Foodservice unit for a while now. For instance, SYY witnessed product cost inflation of 4.9% and 2.1% in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2023, respectively. In the fiscal fourth quarter, its operating expenses rose by 1.9% year over year.The company has been experiencing slower overall industry market volume growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023.

They attend company conference calls/presentations and scrutinize every piece of document available in the public domain before instructing investors.Since brokers meticulously follow the stocks in their coverage, they revise their earnings estimates after carefully examining the pros and cons of an event for the concerned company.

The rise in oil prices after Saudi Arabia and Russia extended voluntary supply cuts has also been one of the reasons for the turbulent scenario. Despite the headwinds, the solid September jobs report has lifted spirits as far as the U.S. equity markets are concerned. The better-than-expected report has gone a long way in reducing rate hike fears.Given this topsy-turvy backdrop, investors would look to have stocks favored by brokers in their watchlist. This is because brokers are deemed to be experts in the field of investing. Therefore, investors would like to have stocks like Rev Group REVG, CVR Energy CVI, Cardinal Health CAH, Commercial Vehicle Group CVGI and Archer Daniels Midland Company ADM in their respective portfolios for attractive returns.Why Broker Advice is Important?As brokers indulge in extensive research on stocks under their coverage, they have access to detailed information on a company. They attend company conference calls/presentations and scrutinize every piece of document available in the public domain before instructing investors.Since brokers meticulously follow the stocks in their coverage, they revise their earnings estimates after carefully examining the pros and cons of an event for the concerned company. Naturally, their estimate revisions serve as an important pointer regarding the price of a stock.Given this extensive know-how, brokers are deemed to be experts in the field of investing, equipped with thorough knowledge and a clear insight into the nitty gritty of the investment world. Paying heed to such well-researched information is, therefore, advisable for investors to avoid the unfortunate scenario of one’s hard-earned money invested in stock markets going down the drain.Making the Most of Broker KnowledgeThe above write-up clearly suggests that by following broker actions, one can arrive at a promising basket of stocks. Keeping this in mind, we have designed a screen to shortlist stocks based on improving analyst recommendations and upward earnings estimate revisions over the last four weeks.Story continuesAlso, since the price/sales ratio is a strong complementary valuation metric in the presence of analyst information, it is considered in designing a winning portfolio of stocks.

Companies meeting this criterion are in the bottom 10% of our universe of over 7,700 stocks with respect to this ratio.Price greater than 5: A stock trading below $5 will not likely create significant interest for most investors.Average Daily Volume greater than 100,000 shares over the last 20 trading days: Volume has to be significant to ensure that these are easily traded.Market value ($ mil) = Top #3000: This gives us stocks that are the top 3000 if one judges by market capitalization.Com/ADR/Canadian= Com: This eliminates the ADR and Canadian stocks.Here are five of the 10 stocks that made it through the screen:REV Group manufactures specialty vehicles that operate within niche segments like fire and emergency, commercial activities and RVs.

At American Airlines AAL, fuel costs accounted for roughly 29% of the company’s total operating expenses incurred in 2022.Oil price has been moving northward recently mainly due to Saudi Arabia and Russia extending voluntary supply cuts. The upward movement in oil prices is not a welcome development for AAL and is likely to hurt its bottom line.Declining Fuel Costs Aid Q2 EarningsIn second-quarter 2023, oil price declined 6.6% in the April-June period. This boosted the bottom-line performance of airlines including AAL. In the second quarter, total operating costs (on a reported basis) declined 4.1% year over year to $11,892 million.Aircraft fuel expenses and related taxes decreased to $2,723 million from $4,020 million a year ago. Average fuel price per gallon (including related taxes) declined to $2.62 from $4.03 a year ago.Picture Changes in Q3As mentioned above, oil price has been rising (up 28.5% in the July-September period) due to extension of production cut by Saudi Arabia and Russia through the end of the current year. The sharp hike in one of the primary input costs is likely to have dented AAL’s bottom-line performance in the third quarter.In September, management stated, “fuel prices have increased considerably since the company’s initial third-quarter guidance issued on Jul 20, 2023”. American Airlines now expects fuel cost per gallon (including taxes) in the $2.90-$3.00 band (the earlier guidance was in the $2.55-$2.65 range). This metric is likely to have been high in the quarter under review due to the northward movement in oil prices, thus hurting this Fort Worth, TX-based carrier’s overall quarterly results, which will be announced on Oct 19.Overall Top &amp; Bottom-Line ProjectionsDue to high fuel costs, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter bottom line is currently pegged at 26 cents per share. This indicates a 62.32% decline from third-quarter 2022 actuals. For quarterly sales, the consensus mark is pegged at $13.52 billion, suggesting a 0.42% increase from third-quarter 2022 levels.Story continuesAAL is currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

CEO Ed Bastian says Delta is reconsidering those changes.Under Southwest's announced changes, which start Jan. 1, it'll take 20 one-way qualifying flights instead of 25 to hit the A-List, and 40 such flights instead of 50 to make A-List Preferred.

117,b7a99000-c546-3566-9a9d-9d6f509f6198,PM,2023-10-17,What Awaits Philip Morris (PM) as It Queues for Q3 Earnings?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/awaits-philip-morris-pm-queues-121900475.html,1697458740,STORY,"['PM', 'SAM', 'CL']","[Philip Morris International Inc. PM is likely to register top-and-bottom-line growth when it reports third-quarter 2023 earnings on Oct 19. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $9.2 billion, suggesting a rise of 14.3% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.The consensus mark for quarterly earnings has risen by 1.3% in the past seven days to $1.61 per share, implying growth of 5.2% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. Philip Morris has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 7.6%, on average.Factors to NotePhilip Morris has been benefiting from its strong pricing power. Though higher pricing might lead to a possible decline in cigarette consumption, it is seen that smokers tend to absorb price increases due to the addictive quality of cigarettes. Higher pricing variance was an upside to the company’s performance (mainly due to increased combustible tobacco pricing) in the second quarter of 2023. Pricing is likely to have remained a driver in the quarter under review as well.Philip Morris’ focus on a smoke-free future has been working well. The company is progressing well with its business transformation, with smoke-free products generating 35.4% of its net revenues in the second quarter of 2023. PM is well-placed to become a majority smoke-free company by 2025. Toward this end, the company’s IQOS, a heat-not-burn device, counts among one of the leading RRPs in the industry.In the second quarter of 2023, revenues from smoke-free products (excluding Wellness and Healthcare) jumped 35.3% to $3,101 million (up 18.3% organically). Total IQOS users at the end of the second quarter were estimated at roughly 27.2 million (including nearly 19.4 million who switched to IQOS and stopped smoking).For the third quarter, management expects heated tobacco unit (HTU) shipment volumes of 31-33 billion units. We expect smoke-free product revenues (excluding Wellness and Healthcare) to increase 26.1% in the third quarter. Further, our model suggests total HTU shipment volume growth of 17.9% to 32.4 billion units in the third quarter.Story continuesPhilip Morris International Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurprisePhilip Morris International Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Philip Morris International Inc. QuoteHowever, PM has been battling cost-related headwinds for a while now. In the second quarter of 2023, the adjusted operating income was somewhat affected by global inflationary headwinds associated with direct materials, tobacco leaf, energy and wages. On its last earnings call, management highlighted intentions to make additional growth-oriented investments, including the commercialization of ILUMA. These may have impacted margins in the quarter under review. Our model suggests an adjusted operating margin contraction of 90 basis points for the third quarter.Apart from this, soft cigarette shipment volumes have been a concern. Cigarette volumes, in general, have been affected by consumers’ rising health consciousness and a shift to low-risk tobacco alternatives. In the second quarter of 2023, cigarette shipment volumes dropped 0.4% to 157 billion units.  Our model suggests a 2.1% decline in cigarette shipment volumes for the third quarter.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Philip Morris this time. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is not the case here.Philip Morris carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and has an Earnings ESP of -0.31%.

(NYSE:PPG) shareholders are probably generally happy, the stock hasn't had particularly good run recently, with the share price falling 15% in the last quarter. But at least the stock is up over the last five years. In that time, it is up 27%, which isn't bad, but is below the market return of 67%.In light of the stock dropping 3.5% in the past week, we want to investigate the longer term story, and see if fundamentals have been the driver of the company's positive five-year return. See our latest analysis for PPG Industries There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, PPG Industries achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 2.6% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 5% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. This free interactive report on PPG Industries' earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for PPG Industries the TSR over the last 5 years was 38%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectivePPG Industries' TSR for the year was broadly in line with the market average, at 19%. Most would be happy with a gain, and it helps that the year's return is actually better than the average return over five years, which was 7%. It is possible that management foresight will bring growth well into the future, even if the share price slows down. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

It delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of around 7.3% on average.The stock has gained 13.4% over the past year compared with a 15% rise recorded by its industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat Do the Estimates Say?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales for the to-be-reported quarter is currently pegged at $4,621 million, which implies a rise of 3.4% from the year-ago reported number. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PPG’s Industrial Coatings segment’s net sales is pegged at $1,767 million, indicating a year-over-year rise of 0.2%. Our estimate for the segment is pegged at $1,749.8 million.Also, the consensus estimate for net sales for PPG’s Performance Coatings segment stands at $2,860 million, suggesting an increase of 5.7%. Our estimate for the quarter for the segment is $2,765.9 million.Factors to WatchIn the third quarter, PPG is expected to continue to have faced subdued demand on weak global industrial production, impacted by cautious consumer buying behavior in Europe and a slow recovery in China. This is likely to have been compounded by softening demand in certain end-use markets in the United States. Specific industry sectors, including aerospace and automotive, are demonstrating resilience. Demand is expected to remain weak in industrial and packaging coatings in the September quarter.Throughout the third quarter, the company is expected to have realized additional benefits stemming from the moderation of cost inputs. Per the company, at the peak of supply disruptions, PPG grappled with over 160 force majeures in its global supply chain, which has now declined to approximately 10, aligning with historical norms. Despite this progress, the full financial advantages of normalizing the commodity supply chain are yet to be fully recognized. As of the end of June, input costs remained 20% higher than pre-pandemic levels. Further reductions in inventories are expected to have yielded additional earnings benefits.Story continuesThe company's ongoing restructuring initiatives are making headway, with an anticipated year-over-year earnings benefit of $15 million expected to have realized in the third quarter. Moreover, PPG's recent acquisition in the paint film industry has strategically positioned the company in the premium segment of the emerging market, showcasing robust customer demand and promising growth potential. This business segment currently generates approximately $100 million in annual sales.

The bank is selling off its GreenSky business, which the bank had to write off this quarter.“We’re confident that the work we’re doing now provides us a much stronger platform for 2024,” said David Solomon, chairman and CEO, in a statement.Goldman has struggled in the past year as fewer businesses have sought to do deals amid higher inflation and geopolitical uncertainty, and market conditions have been tougher this year compared to last.The bank saw a 1% rise in investment banking revenues from last year, and its trading business of bonds, currencies and commodities was down 6% in the period. Equities trading was up 8%.The bank's return on equity, a measurement on how well an investment bank is performing with the assets they hold, was 7.1% in the quarter.

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. DraftKings (DKNG) earns a Zacks Rank #3 17 days from its next quarterly earnings release on November 2, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at -$0.43 a share.DraftKings' Earnings ESP sits at 37.79%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the -$0.43 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of -$0.69.DKNG is one of just a large database of Consumer Discretionary stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Mattel (MAT).Slated to report earnings on October 25, 2023, Mattel holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $0.88 a share nine days from its next quarterly update.For Mattel, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.85 is 3.99%.Story continuesDKNG and MAT's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

The stock's change was less than the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 1.06%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.93%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 1.2%.Shares of the world's largest oilfield services company witnessed a loss of 2.67% over the previous month, trailing the performance of the Oils-Energy sector with its loss of 0.77% and outperforming the S&amp;P 500's loss of 3%.Investors will be eagerly watching for the performance of Schlumberger in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings report is set to be unveiled on October 20, 2023. On that day, Schlumberger is projected to report earnings of $0.77 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 22.22%. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $8.33 billion, showing a 11.39% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.For the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates project earnings of $2.98 per share and a revenue of $32.92 billion, demonstrating changes of +36.7% and +17.19%, respectively, from the preceding year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Schlumberger. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the company's business performance and profit potential.Empirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Schlumberger presently features a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Story continuesLooking at valuation, Schlumberger is presently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 19.8. This expresses no noticeable deviation compared to the average Forward P/E of 19.8 of its industry.It's also important to note that SLB currently trades at a PEG ratio of 0.75. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate.

Earnings surpassed the consensus estimate but declined year over year.PKG has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 5.1%, on average.Packaging Corporation of America Price and EPS Surprise Packaging Corporation of America price-eps-surprise | Packaging Corporation of America QuoteQ3 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Packaging Corp’s third-quarter earnings per share is pegged at $1.91, suggesting a decline of 32.5% from the prior-year quarter’s reported level. Estimates have been unchanged for the past 60 days.The consensus estimate for total sales is pegged at $1.96 billion, indicating a 7.8% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Factors at PlayPackaging Corp’s third-quarter results are expected to reflect the impacts of the weakness in packaging demand. This is due to the ongoing inflationary pressures, high interest rates and supply-chain disruptions throughout the quarter. Customers have been working to reduce their high inventory levels, which have been affecting order flow and demand for PKG’s products, as witnessed in the past few quarters.Given that packaging products are essential for the distribution of food, beverage and pharmaceutical products, the stable demand for these products and growth in e-commerce activities are likely to have negated some of these headwinds for the Packaging segment in the third quarter. Our model predicts the segment’s volume to decline 3.4% year over year in the quarter.However, lower prices in the Packaging segment in the third quarter of 2023 as a result of the recent decreases in the published domestic containerboard prices, as well as lower export prices, are likely to have impacted the segment’s revenues. Price and mix impacts are expected to be an unfavorable 5.4% in the quarter, per our model.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s quarterly revenues is pegged at $1.78 billion, suggesting a decline of 8% from the year-ago quarter’s reported number. The consensus mark for the segment’s operating income is pegged at $250.8 million, indicating a fall of 31% from the prior-year reported figure.The Paper segment’s revenues are likely to reflect weak quarterly volumes. We expect volume to fall 4.7% from last year. The segment is likely to have gained from the price increase that took effect in September 2022 . We expect a positive pricing/mix impact of 5.3% for the third quarter.  However, higher operating costs, primarily labor and benefit expenses, and higher energy costs are expected to have hurt the segment’s profits in the quarter under review.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Paper segment’s revenues is pegged at $148 million for the September-end quarter, suggesting a fall of 10% from the year-ago reported figure. The consensus estimate for the segment’s operating income is $25.4 million, indicating a 7% fall from the $27.4 million reported in the prior-year quarter.Story continuesWhat Our Model IndicatesOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Packaging Corp this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.

133,c1c370a1-2b9a-3abc-8e1b-1992a6ca8889,NTRS,2023-10-17,Is FlexShares International Quality Dividend ETF (IQDF) a Strong ETF Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/flexshares-international-quality-dividend-etf-102006759.html,1697538006,STORY,['NTRS'],"[The FlexShares International Quality Dividend ETF (IQDF) made its debut on 04/12/2013, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund that provides broad exposure to the World ETFs category of the market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?The ETF industry has long been dominated by products based on market cap weighted indexes, a strategy created to reflect the market or a particular market segment.Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way.If you're the kind of investor who would rather try and beat the market through good stock selection, then smart beta funds are your best choice; this fund class is known for tracking non-cap weighted strategies.This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.The smart beta space gives investors many different choices, from equal-weighting, one of the simplest strategies, to more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting. However, not all of these methodologies have been able to deliver remarkable returns.Fund Sponsor &amp; IndexBecause the fund has amassed over $516.70 million, this makes it one of the average sized ETFs in the World ETFs. IQDF is managed by Flexshares. IQDF seeks to match the performance of the Northern Trust International Quality Dividend Index before fees and expenses.The Northern Trust International Quality Dividend Index is designed to provide exposure to a high-quality income-oriented portfolio of long-only international securities issued by non-U.S.-based companies, with an emphasis on long-term capital growth and a targeted overall beta that is similar to that of the Northern Trust International Large Cap Index.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesSince cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.Story continuesOperating expenses on an annual basis are 0.47% for this ETF, which makes it on par with most peer products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 4.82%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.Looking at individual holdings, Bhp Group Ltd Common Stock Aud 0 (BHP) accounts for about 3.12% of total assets, followed by Royal Bank Of Canada Common Stock Cad 0 (RY) and Novo Nordisk A/s Common Stock Dkk 0.2 (NOVOb.CO).Performance and RiskYear-to-date, the FlexShares International Quality Dividend ETF has added roughly 7.99% so far, and was up about 26.33% over the last 12 months (as of 10/17/2023). IQDF has traded between $18.11 and $23.06 in this past 52-week period.IQDF has a beta of 0.86 and standard deviation of 15.75% for the trailing three-year period, which makes the fund a medium risk choice in the space. With about 278 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesFlexShares International Quality Dividend ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the World ETFs segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.FlexShares International Quality Dividend Defensive ETF (IQDE) tracks Northern Trust International Quality Dividend Defensive Index and the FlexShares International Quality Dividend Dynamic ETF (IQDY) tracks Northern Trust International Quality Dividend Dynamic Index. FlexShares International Quality Dividend Defensive ETF has $27.31 million in assets, FlexShares International Quality Dividend Dynamic ETF has $68.20 million. IQDE has an expense ratio of 0.47% and IQDY charges 0.47%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the World ETFs.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to skip our overview of the SaaS industry, then take a look at the 5 Best SaaS Stocks To Buy Now. The dot com era of the 1990s  focused on the consumer side of the internet, but in the background, a quiet corporate revolution was also taking place. For that time, most people can only recall the growth in internet use and bulky personal computers most likely made by International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) that could support CD disks, and flash drives, and came with a variety of accessories such as added speakers. However, the world was also seeing companies starting to rely on computers for their production, manufacturing, and supply chain planning as part of a broader group of corporate planning called enterprise resource planning (ERP).Since then, not only have the computer and the internet made unbelievable advances, but the progress of the two has created a new industry. This industry is called software as a service (SaaS) and it includes software based products that can be accessed from anywhere on the planet given that one has a stable internet connection. These products enable users, whether corporate or consumer, to use a firm's hardware infrastructure and simply pay a subscription for the usage. This comes with a variety of advantages, which include cost savings from avoiding buying bulky servers, hardware agnosticism for most of the parts except for basic specifications required for the user, and data security since all data is held on external servers.If you're having trouble understanding SaaS, then perhaps an example will help. The world's most popular digital streaming service Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) can also be classified as a SaaS. This is because all Netflix offers to its customers is a software product that can be accessed either through a computer or a smartphone. This simple software subscription enables access to television shows, movies, and documentaries - all of which are hosted on Netflix's own servers. So, the consumers are saved from having to download and save TV shows on their own devices, and for most of the part, they can also access Netflix's content from different locations without the need to carry their own computer or smartphone with them. Another popular example of a SaaS product is the online courses offered by firms such asStory continuesOn the corporate side of things, SaaS is equally as diverse. A large number of business functions now rely on third party software which saves the operating from having to invest in its own products and allows them to leverage the expertise of others that are providing customized services in the area. Some business functions that utilize SaaS are payroll processing, human resource management, supply chain management, data analysis, and accounting. Each of these has specialized tasks that can be met by software, and in the case of the SaaS services provider, the software is often regularly updated over time to account for changes from user feedback and glitches. Some examples of corporate SaaS providers include PTC Inc. (NASDAQ:PTC), which provides product design software, Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ:SPLK) which provides data analysis products, and HubSpot, Inc. (NYSE:HUBS), which enables customer relationship management.As to the latest trends in the SaaS industry, like nearly every other industry, it is also focusing on leveraging artificial intelligence to offer new services. For instance, HubSpot announced a new AI assistant in April 2023 to allow sales and marketing teams to create content. Additionally, one of the biggest SaaS security companies, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD), is also integrating AI into its Falcon platform, with management explaining during the firm's second quarter of fiscal 2024 earnings call:Falcon is a platform that brings the benefits of generative AI to life for every SOC, CISO, CXO and enterprise. We do it with proprietary threat data, and we do it with industry-leading AI expertise. Charlotte AI is the engine powering our portfolio of generative AI capabilities across the platform, utilizing CrowdStrike's high-fidelity data advantage. Charlotte AI helps Falcon users of all skill levels to do more in the platform by automating workflows, which fuels module adoption and reduces the mean time to detect and respond. The net benefit to customers from our pioneering use of AI in a single platform is faster results, better security outcomes and lower overall cost, ushering in a new era of machine speed security. We showcased Charlotte AI earlier this month at Black Hat where we're the only vendor of consequence to showcase a live, not PowerPoint, demo of generative AI in action.Public reception was fantastic, and we will release Charlotte AI pricing at Falcon.So, with AI transforming the SaaS industry, what are the best stocks to buy?

Oppenheimer Managing Director &amp; Head of Internet Research Jason Helfstein joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the three things he is watching for in the company's earnings.Helfstein is watching for net subscriber adds, average revenue per membership, and plans for ad-tier.“There is a general view that [Netflix will] beat the overall street estimate. The question's how much they come higher than that?,” Helfstein says. Average revenue per membership, or ARM, was “basically flat year-over-year… but the pushback on the ARM is that if ultimately you’re getting more people to opt into paid sharing... why isn’t it going up more than that?”Netflix “can control the rollout of paid sharing… and they are purposely slow-rolling that. We think they wouldn’t do that if they weren’t otherwise confident in their guidance,” Helfstein adds. Netflix has also said that they will increasing prices after the Hollywood strike ends.Click here to watch the full interview on the Yahoo Finance YouTube page or you can watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live here.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]- Netflix kicking off tech earnings for the season with its third quarter report on Wednesday after the bell. Our next guest has his eyes on three key things in this report, net number of subscribers added, average revenue per subscriber, and the company's plans for its struggling ad tier. Joining us now is Jason Helfstein, Oppenheimer Managing Director and Head of Internet Research. Jason, great to see you. So you are a Netflix believer, Jason. You got an outperform. I think your target is for 470. Why are you bullish, Jason, heading into this report?JASON HELFSTEIN: You know, while there's been a lot of headlines about what they can't control, which is the rollout of their advertising business, they can control the rollout of paid sharing. That's basically getting kind of a-- some of the more egregious shares to either pay more money per month or get their own account. And they are purposely slow rolling that. And we think they wouldn't do that if they weren't otherwise confident in their guidance. So, you know, we think for the next few quarters-- next two quarters, they've got pretty good control on kind of where the numbers play out. And then they've also told you that a pricing increase will come at the end of the Hollywood strike.Story continuesJULIE HYMAN: And, Jason, hey, it's Julie here. Give us a little more detail on those three things that you're looking for. And let's take the two first first, because they sort of go together here. How many subscribers are going to be added, and then the average revenue per member or per subscriber. What are you looking for here from Netflix?JASON HELFSTEIN: So we have 6 million new subscribers in the quarter. I think that the street is 5.6. And if you look at the high-end of the street, they're are about 6 and 1/2, right? So I think there is a general view that they'll beat the overall street estimate. The question is how much they come higher than that. And then for revenue, basically, per subscriber, you know, ARM we're basically flat year-over-year. Maybe it'll be a little bit better with currency. But the pushback on the ARM is that if ultimately you're getting more people to opt into paid sharing, right, pay for the unused accounts, why isn't it going up more than that?And there's a thought of are people downgrading from, let's say, a premium plan to a less premium plan, which the company is saying they're not, or kind of other factors, as well as for folks who were moving into the ad tier, they're kind of behind plan on monetizing that. So to the extent if you do have somebody who, let's say, leaves kind of the ad free through paid sharing, it ends up on the advertising tier. They're not getting the full monetization they're advertising right now because that's going slower. So that's where the noise is in the numbers. And ultimately, that kind of revenue per subscriber, they call it ARM.]"

And this week, we’ll have a flurry of reports, with even more slated to come in the following periods.It’s set up to be another critical earnings cycle, particularly following the market’s already impressive run year-to-date and lingering uncertainties weighing on investors' minds. Nonetheless, we’ve continued to elude the feared ‘earnings apocalypse’ many had feared, helping to inject positive sentiment throughout 2023.Regarding this week’s slate, a few heavy hitters are scheduled to report, including streaming titan Netflix NFLX and Tesla TSLA, the undisputed leader among EVs. But how do expectations stack up for the two heavyweights heading into their releases? Let’s take a closer look.Netflix Netflix shares have seen notable buying pressure in 2023 following a rough showing last year, up roughly 20% and outperforming the S&amp;P 500’s 15% gain. The company’s quarterly releases have regularly brought volatility to shares, as illustrated below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSubscriber (or membership) additions are the key metric investors will be closely watching for in the release, an area that Netflix crushed in its latest release. For the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Paid Net Membership additions stands at 5.8 million, notably above the year-ago figure of 2.4 million.It’s worth noting that the company’s recent crackdown on password sharing has helped grow its subscribers significantly, as reflected by its most recent subscribers beat. As shown below, the company has exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Paid Net Membership Additions in four of its last six releases.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFor the company’s upcoming release, Netflix expects revenue of $8.5 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 7%. As noted in its latest call, management expects revenue growth to accelerate further in Q4 as Netflix continues to monetize account sharing and improve its advertising revenue.Story continuesAnalysts have shown light positivity for the release, with the $3.47 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate up +1% over the last several months and reflecting year-over-year growth of 12%. Netflix will reveal its quarterly results on Wednesday, October 18th, after the market’s close.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTeslaLike NFLX, Tesla has seen volatility surrounding its quarterly releases in 2023, as shown below. Nonetheless, the company’s +100% gain has crushed the general market, rewarding investors handsomely.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe EV leader revealed that it produced over 430,000 vehicles and delivered roughly 435,000 throughout Q3, reflecting a decline from the prior quarter. The company’s 2023 volume target of 1.8 million vehicles has remained unchanged, though, a critical factor to note. Tesla has consistently exceeded our consensus delivery expectations as of late.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company has seen negative revisions for the release, with the $0.73 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate down -7.6% over the last several months and reflecting a year-over-year decline of -30%. Our consensus revenue estimate stands at $24.4 billion, 13% higher than the year-ago period.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, it’ll be interesting to see how recent price cuts to EVs will affect quarterly results, as the company has consistently slashed prices throughout 2023. Tesla will report on Wednesday, October 18th, after the market’s close.Bottom LineThe Q3 cycle will shift into a much higher gear this week following ‘Big Bank Friday,’ with a full slate of companies on deck to report in the coming weeks. It’s undoubtedly another critical round of earnings, with investors remaining optimistic for the market’s rally to continue into year-end. And this week, two big reports to watch out for include none other than Netflix NFLX and Tesla TSLA. Both companies will report this Wednesday after the market’s close.Regarding Netflix, investors will continue to focus on subscriber additions, particularly following the company’s recent success in its password-sharing crackdown efforts. Concerning Tesla, investors will be closely tuned into how recent price cuts have affected margins and top-line performance.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This company, which is in the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.When looking at the last two reports, this world's largest biotech drugmaker has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 8.13%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the most recent quarter, Amgen was expected to post earnings of $4.44 per share, but it reported $5 per share instead, representing a surprise of 12.61%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $3.84 per share, while it actually produced $3.98 per share, a surprise of 3.65%.For Amgen, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Amgen has an Earnings ESP of +1.65% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on October 31, 2023.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Axsome Therapeutics (AXSM) earns a Zacks Rank #3 21 days from its next quarterly earnings release on November 6, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at -$1.21 a share.Axsome Therapeutics' Earnings ESP sits at 2.33%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the -$1.21 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of -$1.24.AXSM is one of just a large database of Medical stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Amgen (AMGN).Slated to report earnings on October 31, 2023, Amgen holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $4.72 a share 15 days from its next quarterly update.For Amgen, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.64 is 1.65%.Story continuesAXSM and AMGN's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

""These findings illustrate how we are attacking cancer from many different angles to deliver new approaches poised to alter the natural history of disease across many cancers.""Amgen will present data from two late-breaking abstracts at ESMO:Results from CodeBreaK 300 (Abstract #LBA10), a global, registration-enabling Phase 3 trial evaluating LUMAKRAS (sotorasib) combined with Vectibix (panitumumab) in chemorefractory KRAS G12C-mutated metastatic CRC. These data will be featured as a Presidential Symposium Oral Presentation on Sunday, October 22.Results from DeLLphi-301 (Abstract #LBA92), a global, potentially registration-enabling Phase 2 trial evaluating tarlatamab, a first-in-class DLL3 targeting bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE®) molecule, in patients with SCLC who had failed two or more prior lines of treatment. These data will be presented in a Proffered Paper Oral Session on Friday, October 20.Story continuesInterim results from a Phase 1 study of AMG 509 (xaluritamig) will be presented during a Proffered Paper Oral Session (Abstract #1765O), demonstrating that the novel bispecific STEAP1 x CD3 XmAb® 2+1 T-cell engager had a positive benefit/risk profile with robust anti-tumor activity in heavily pretreated patients with mCRPC (N=97). Overall, of the 67 RECIST-evaluable patients, 16 (24%) had confirmed partial responses (PR) and 32 (48%) had stable disease (SD), demonstrating encouraging preliminary efficacy. At higher dosing levels (n=37), 15 patients (41%) had confirmed PR and 14 (38%) with SD. The most common treatment-related adverse events were cytokine release syndrome (CRS; 72%; primarily low grade), fatigue (45%), myalgia (34%) and pyrexia (32%).These results further justify exploration of this modality as a potential therapy for prostate cancer. Dose expansion and optimization are currently ongoing.For more information on the Amgen abstracts, see below.Abstracts and Presentation Times:Amgen Sponsored AbstractsLUMAKRAS®/LUMYKRAS® (sotorasib) + VECTIBIX® (panitumumab) for CRCSotorasib plus panitumumab versus standard-of-care for chemorefractory KRAS G12C-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC): CodeBreaK 300 phase 3 studyAbstract #LBA10, Proffered Paper Oral Session: Presidential 2, Madrid Auditorium - Hall 6, Sunday, October 22 from 5:50 - 6:02 p.m. CESTTarlatamabTarlatamab for patients (pts) with previously treated small cell lung cancer (SCLC): Primary analysis of the phase 2 DeLLphi-301 studyAbstract #LBA92, Proffered Paper Oral Session: Non metastatic NSCLC and other thoracic malignancies, Sevilla Auditorium - Hall 9, Friday, October 20 from 3:20 – 3:30 p.m. CESTAMG 509 (xaluritamig)Interim Results From a Phase 1 Study of AMG 509 (xaluritamig), a STEAP1 x CD3 XmAb® 2+1 Immune Therapy, in Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC)Abstract #1765O, Proffered Paper Oral Session: Genitourinary tumours, prostate, Granada Auditorium - Hall 3, Friday, October 20 from 4:10 - 4:20 p.m. CESTBemarituzumabPhase 1b Results of Bemarituzumab (BEMA)+mFOLFOX6+Nivolumab (NIVO) for Advanced Gastric/Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer (G/GEJC): FORTITUDE-102 Part 1Abstract #1526P, Onsite Poster, Monday, October 23LUMAKRAS®/LUMYKRAS® (sotorasib) for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)Real-world routine KRAS testing practices in France for patients (pts) with advanced or metastatic (AM) Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC): data from the ESME cohortAbstract #1402P, Onsite Poster, Monday, October 23Clinical characteristics and therapeutics sequences of KRAS G12C metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (mNSCLC) patients treated by sotorasib in the French pre-marketing authorization (MA) early access program (cohort temporary authorization of use, cATU)Abstract #1404P, Onsite Poster, Monday, October 23Characteristics and treatment sequences of patients (pts) with KRAS G12C, other KRAS and non-KRAS advanced or metastatic (AM) Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) in the French ESME cohortAbstract #1407P, Onsite Poster, Monday, October 23Characterization of patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring KRASG12C mutation and their associated direct healthcare costs in Spanish routine clinical practice (SILK study)Abstract #1410P, Onsite Poster, Monday, October 23Investigator Sponsored StudiesVECTIBIX® (panitumumab)Panitumumab (P) + FOLFIRINOX or mFOLFOX6 in unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients (pts) with RAS/BRAF wild-type (WT) tumor status from circulating DNA (cirDNA).

The Supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for full approval of LUMAKRAS was accepted by the FDA for standard review and a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of December 24, 2023, has been set.About Advanced Colorectal Cancer and the KRAS G12C MutationColorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, comprising 10% of all cancer diagnoses.1 It is also the third most commonly diagnosed cancer globally.2Patients with previously treated metastatic CRC need more effective treatment options. For patients in the third-line setting, standard therapies yield median progression-free survival (PFS) times of about two months, and patients' response rates are less than 10%.3KRAS mutations are among the most common genetic alterations in colorectal cancers, with the KRAS G12C mutation present in approximately 3-5% of colorectal cancers.4,5,6About CodeBreaK The CodeBreaK clinical development program for Amgen's drug sotorasib is designed to study patients with an advanced solid tumor with the KRAS G12C mutation and address the longstanding unmet medical need for these cancers.CodeBreaK 100, the Phase 1 and 2, first-in-human, open-label multicenter study, enrolled patients with KRAS G12C-mutant solid tumors.7 Eligible patients must have received at least a prior line of systemic anticancer therapy, consistent with their tumor type and stage of disease. The primary endpoint for the Phase 2 study was centrally assessed objective response rate. The Phase 2 trial in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) enrolled 126 patients, 124 of whom had centrally evaluable lesions by RECIST at baseline.8 The Phase 2 trial in colorectal cancer (CRC) enrolled 62 patients and results have been published.9CodeBreaK 200, the global Phase 3 randomized active-controlled study comparing sotorasib to docetaxel in KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC, completed enrollment of 345 patients. Eligible patients had previously treated, locally advanced and unresectable or metastatic KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival and key secondary endpoints include overall survival, objective response rate, and patient-reported outcomes.10CodeBreaK 300, the global Phase 3 randomized active-controlled study comparing sotorasib in combination with panitumumab to investigator's choice (trifluridine and tipiracil, or regorafenib) in chemorefractory KRAS G12C-mutated mCRC, has completed enrollment of 160 patients. Eligible patients had KRAS G12C-mutated mCRC, received at least one prior line of therapy, and have received and progressed on or after fluoropyrimidine, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival, and key secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS) and objective response rate (ORR).11Amgen also has several Phase 1b studies investigating sotorasib monotherapy and sotorasib combination therapy across various advanced solid tumors (CodeBreaK 101) open for enrollment.12 A Phase 2 randomized study evaluating sotorasib in patients with stage IV KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC in need of first-line treatment is ongoing (CodeBreaK 201).13 Amgen has also initiated a Phase 3 study of LUMAKRAS plus carboplatin and pemetrexed in first-line KRAS G12C-mutant and negative for programmed cell death PD-L1 advanced NSCLC (CodeBreaK 202), with enrollment expected to start before the end of 2023.LUMAKRAS® (sotorasib) U.S. Indication LUMAKRAS is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with KRAS G12C-mutated locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as determined by an FDA-approved test, who have received at least one prior systemic therapy.This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR). Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s).LUMAKRAS® (sotorasib) Important U.S. Safety Information Hepatotoxicity LUMAKRAS can cause hepatotoxicity, which may lead to drug-induced liver injury and hepatitis.Among 357 patients who received LUMAKRAS in CodeBreaK 100, hepatotoxicity occurred in 1.7% (all grades) and 1.4% (Grade 3). A total of 18% of patients who received LUMAKRAS had increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST); 6% were Grade 3 and 0.6% were Grade 4. In addition to dose interruption or reduction, 5% of patients received corticosteroids for the treatment of hepatotoxicity.Monitor liver function tests (ALT, AST and total bilirubin) prior to the start of LUMAKRAS every 3 weeks for the first 3 months of treatment, then once a month or as clinically indicated, with more frequent testing in patients who develop transaminase and/or bilirubin elevations.Withhold, dose reduce or permanently discontinue LUMAKRAS based on severity of adverse reaction.Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis LUMAKRAS can cause ILD/pneumonitis that can be fatal. Among 357 patients who received LUMAKRAS in CodeBreaK 100, ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 0.8% of patients, all cases were Grade 3 or 4 at onset, and 1 case was fatal. LUMAKRAS was discontinued due to ILD/pneumonitis in 0.6% of patients.Monitor patients for new or worsening pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis (e.g., dyspnea, cough, fever). Immediately withhold LUMAKRAS in patients with suspected ILD/pneumonitis and permanently discontinue LUMAKRAS if no other potential causes of ILD/pneumonitis are identified.Most Common Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions occurring in ≥ 20% were diarrhea, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, fatigue, hepatotoxicity and cough.Drug Interactions Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider of all concomitant medications, including prescription medicines, over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, dietary and herbal products.Inform patients to avoid proton pump inhibitors and H2 receptor antagonists while taking LUMAKRAS.If coadministration with an acid-reducing agent cannot be avoided, inform patients to take LUMAKRAS 4 hours before or 10 hours after a locally acting antacid.Please see LUMAKRAS full Prescribing Information. About Vectibix® (panitumumab)Vectibix is the first and only fully human monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody approved by the FDA for the treatment of mCRC. Vectibix was approved in the U.S. in September 2006 as a monotherapy for the treatment of patients with EGFR-expressing mCRC after disease progression after prior treatment with fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-containing chemotherapy.In May 2014, the FDA approved Vectibix for use in combination with FOLFOX as first-line treatment in patients with wild-type KRAS (exon 2) mCRC. With this approval, Vectibix became the first-and-only biologic therapy indicated for use with FOLFOX, one of the most commonly used chemotherapy regimens, in the first-line treatment of mCRC for patients with wild-type KRAS mCRC.In June 2017, the FDA approved a refined indication for Vectibix for use in patients with wild-type RAS (defined as wild-type in both KRAS and NRAS as determined by an FDA-approved test for this use) mCRC.INDICATION AND LIMITATION OF USEVectibix® is indicated for the treatment of patients with wild-type RAS (defined as wild-type in both KRAS and NRAS as determined by an FDA-approved test for this use) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC): as first-line therapy in combination with FOLFOX, and as monotherapy following disease progression after prior treatment with fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-containing chemotherapy.Limitation of Use: Vectibix® is not indicated for the treatment of patients with RAS mutant mCRC or for whom RAS mutation status is unknown.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION BOXED WARNING: DERMATOLOGIC TOXICITY Dermatologic Toxicity: Dermatologic toxicities occurred in 90% of patients and were severe (NCI-CTC grade 3 and higher) in 15% of patients receiving Vectibix monotherapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].In Study 20020408, dermatologic toxicities occurred in 90% of patients and were severe (NCI-CTC grade 3 and higher) in 15% of patients with mCRC receiving Vectibix®. The clinical manifestations included, but were not limited to, acneiform dermatitis, pruritus, erythema, rash, skin exfoliation, paronychia, dry skin, and skin fissures.Monitor patients who develop dermatologic or soft tissue toxicities while receiving Vectibix® for the development of inflammatory or infectious sequelae. Life-threatening and fatal infectious complications including necrotizing fasciitis, abscesses, and sepsis have been observed in patients treated with Vectibix®. Life-threatening and fatal bullous mucocutaneous disease with blisters, erosions, and skin sloughing has also been observed in patients treated with Vectibix®. It could not be determined whether these mucocutaneous adverse reactions were directly related to EGFR inhibition or to idiosyncratic immune- related effects (e.g., Stevens Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis). Withhold or discontinue Vectibix® for dermatologic or soft tissue toxicity associated with severe or life-threatening inflammatory or infectious complications. Dose modifications for Vectibix® concerning dermatologic toxicity are provided in the product labeling.Vectibix® is not indicated for the treatment of patients with colorectal cancer that harbor somatic RAS mutations in exon 2 (codons 12 and 13), exon 3 (codons 59 and 61), and exon 4 (codons 117 and 146) of either KRAS or NRAS and hereafter is referred to as ""RAS.""Retrospective subset analyses across several randomized clinical trials were conducted to investigate the role of RAS mutations on the clinical effects of anti-EGFR-directed monoclonal antibodies (panitumumab or cetuximab). Anti-EGFR antibodies in patients with tumors containing RAS mutations resulted in exposing those patients to anti-EGFR related adverse reactions without clinical benefit from these agents. Additionally, in Study 20050203, 272 patients with RAS-mutant mCRC tumors received Vectibix® in combination with FOLFOX and 276 patients received FOLFOX alone. In an exploratory subgroup analysis, OS was shorter (HR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.01-1.45) in patients with RAS-mutant mCRC who received Vectibix® and FOLFOX versus FOLFOX alone.Progressively decreasing serum magnesium levels leading to severe (grade 3-4) hypomagnesemia occurred in up to 7% (in Study 20080763) of patients across clinical trials. Monitor patients for hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia prior to initiating Vectibix® treatment, periodically during Vectibix® treatment, and for up to 8 weeks after the completion of treatment. Other electrolyte disturbances, including hypokalemia, have also been observed. Replete magnesium and other electrolytes as appropriate.In Study 20020408, 4% of patients experienced infusion reactions and 1% of patients experienced severe infusion reactions (NCI-CTC grade 3-4). Infusion reactions, manifesting as fever, chills, dyspnea, bronchospasm, and hypotension, can occur following Vectibix® administration. Fatal infusion reactions occurred in postmarketing experience. Terminate the infusion for severe infusion reactions.Severe diarrhea and dehydration, leading to acute renal failure and other complications, have been observed in patients treated with Vectibix® in combination with chemotherapy.Fatal and nonfatal cases of interstitial lung disease (ILD) (1%) and pulmonary fibrosis have been observed in patients treated with Vectibix®. Pulmonary fibrosis occurred in less than 1% (2/1467) of patients enrolled in clinical studies of Vectibix®. In the event of acute onset or worsening of pulmonary symptoms interrupt Vectibix® therapy. Discontinue Vectibix® therapy if ILD is confirmed.In patients with a history of interstitial pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis, or evidence of interstitial pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis, the benefits of therapy with Vectibix® versus the risk of pulmonary complications must be carefully considered.Exposure to sunlight can exacerbate dermatologic toxicity. Advise patients to wear sunscreen and hats and limit sun exposure while receiving Vectibix®.Keratitis and ulcerative keratitis, known risk factors for corneal perforation, have been reported with Vectibix® use. Monitor for evidence of keratitis or ulcerative keratitis. Interrupt or discontinue Vectibix® for acute or worsening keratitis.In an interim analysis of an open-label, multicenter, randomized clinical trial in the first-line setting in patients with mCRC, the addition of Vectibix® to the combination of bevacizumab and chemotherapy resulted in decreased OS and increased incidence of NCI-CTC grade 3-5 (87% vs 72%) adverse reactions. NCI-CTC grade 3-4 adverse reactions occurring at a higher rate in Vectibix®-treated patients included rash/acneiform dermatitis (26% vs 1%), diarrhea (23% vs 12%), dehydration (16% vs 5%), primarily occurring in patients with diarrhea, hypokalemia (10% vs 4%), stomatitis/mucositis (4% vs &lt; 1%), and hypomagnesemia (4% vs 0).NCI-CTC grade 3-5 pulmonary embolism occurred at a higher rate in Vectibix®-treated patients (7% vs 3%) and included fatal events in three (&lt; 1%) Vectibix®-treated patients. As a result of the toxicities experienced, patients randomized to Vectibix®, bevacizumab, and chemotherapy received a lower mean relative dose intensity of each chemotherapeutic agent (oxaliplatin, irinotecan, bolus 5-FU, and/or infusional 5-FU) over the first 24 weeks on study compared with those randomized to bevacizumab and chemotherapy.Vectibix® can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment, and for at least 2 months after the last dose of Vectibix®.In monotherapy, the most commonly reported adverse reactions (≥ 20%) in patients with Vectibix® were skin rash with variable presentations, paronychia, fatigue, nausea, and diarrhea.The most commonly reported adverse reactions (≥ 20%) with Vectibix® + FOLFOX were diarrhea, stomatitis, mucosal inflammation, asthenia, paronychia, anorexia, hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, rash, acneiform dermatitis, pruritus, and dry skin. The most common serious adverse reactions (≥ 2% difference between treatment arms) were diarrhea and dehydration.To see the Vectibix® Prescribing Information, including Boxed Warning visit www.vectibix.com.About Tarlatamab  Tarlatamab is an investigational, targeted immunotherapy engineered by Amgen researchers that brings a patient's own T cells in close proximity to SCLC cells by binding both CD3 on T cells and DLL3 on SCLC cells. This results in the formation of an immunological synapse with lysis of the cancer cell.14,15 DLL3 represents an exciting therapeutic target for patients with SCLC, as approximately 85% to 94% of patients have expression of DLL3 on the cell surface of SCLC cells, with minimal expression in normal cells.16,17,18Amgen is currently investigating tarlatamab in multiple trials, including DeLLphi-304, a Phase 3 study comparing tarlatamab versus standard of care chemotherapy in second-line treatment of SCLC that is enrolling patients. Amgen has plans to initiate two additional Phase 3 studies of tarlatamab in earlier settings of SCLC.About Amgen Amgen is committed to unlocking the potential of biology for patients suffering from serious illnesses by discovering, developing, manufacturing and delivering innovative human therapeutics.

Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market.Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to realize any of the strategic benefits, synergies or opportunities arising from the Horizon acquisition, and such benefits, synergies or opportunities may take longer to realize than expected. We may not be able to successfully integrate Horizon, and such acquisition or integration may take longer, be more difficult or cost more than expected. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach of our information technology systems could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business and operations may be negatively affected by the failure, or perceived failure, of achieving our environmental, social and governance objectives. The effects of global climate change and related natural disasters could negatively affect our business and operations. Global economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.The scientific information discussed in this news release related to our product candidates is preliminary and investigative. Such product candidates are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and no conclusions can or should be drawn regarding the safety or effectiveness of the product candidates.

(NYSE:M) shareholders, who have seen the share price decline a rather worrying 34%. But don't let that distract from the very nice return generated over three years. In fact, the company's share price bested the return of its market index in that time, posting a gain of 72%.Although Macy's has shed US$148m from its market cap this week, let's take a look at its longer term fundamental trends and see if they've driven returns. Check out our latest analysis for Macy's While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During three years of share price growth, Macy's moved from a loss to profitability. That would generally be considered a positive, so we'd expect the share price to be up.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Macy's has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? This free interactive report on Macy's' balance sheet strength is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Macy's' TSR for the last 3 years was 85%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 21% in the last year, Macy's shareholders lost 37% (even including dividends). Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 10% per year over five years. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Even so, be aware that  Macy's is showing  3 warning signs in our investment analysis , you should know about...But note: Macy's may not be the best stock to buy.

Higher sales volume from three major segments, along with a lower share count, is likely to have benefited LMT’s third-quarter performance.Let's see how things might have shaped up prior to the announcement.Aeronautics to Post Dismal SalesThe Aeronautics segment, which primarily manufactures advanced, combat-proven jets, and contributes almost 40% to the company’s top line, is likely to deliver unimpressive results in the to-be-reported quarter.Lockheed Martin Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseLockheed Martin Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseLockheed Martin Corporation price-eps-surprise | Lockheed Martin Corporation QuoteHigher production and sustainment volumes for the F-16 and classified programs are expected to have boosted the segment’s performance. However, unfavorable F-35 deliveries due to software maturation with the Tech Refresh 3 program and hardware delivery timing might have impacted this business unit’s overall sales.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Aeronautics unit’s third-quarter revenues is pegged at $6,732 million, indicating a 5% decline from the prior-year period’s reported figure.Other Segments to ShineThe remaining three segments are projected to have performed favorably in the third quarter.Higher development volume from the next-generation interceptor as well as the classified program is expected to have benefited the Space business segment’s third-quarter performance. Favorable program lifecycle timing on Orion spacecraft might have also aided this unit’s sales growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s revenues is pinned at $3,084 million, indicating 7% growth from the prior-year quarter’s reported number.Lockheed’s Missiles and Fire Control (MFC) segment provides critical missile defense support to the United States and foreign allies. Within this unit, higher sales volume from tactical and strike missiles is likely to have outweighed lower volume from integrated air and missile defense.Story continuesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for MFC’s third-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $2,920 million, indicating a 3.1% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Higher sales volume from integrated warfare systems and sensors programs might have bolstered the Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) segment’s sales in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the RMS segment’s third-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $4,014 million, indicating a 6.2% improvement from that registered in the prior-year quarter.Impressive Delivery ProjectionsFor manufacturing companies like Lockheed, successful delivery of its manufactured goods indicates solid revenue generation. To this end, we notice that our forecast estimates LMT to have delivered 58 jets in the third quarter, which indicates year-over-year growth of 6.5%.Q3 ExpectationsThe anticipated sales improvement in LMT’s three major segments is likely to have outweighed the sales deterioration from the Aeronautics segment. This, along with solid delivery projections, is expected to have boosted Lockheed’s overall sales performance.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter revenues is pegged at $16.66 billion, indicating a 0.5% increase from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Such a solid top-line performance, along with lower share count projections as well as tax benefits, is expected to have contributed favorably to LMT’s earnings.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the defense giant’s third-quarter earnings is pinned at $6.66 per share.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Lockheed this time around.

Today the focus is not purely on emissions, it is: we need to either shut or slow down big time your conventional (energy),"" Nasser said.Renewables alone cannot shoulder the burden of global energy demand, he said, adding that cuts to oil and gas production would result in energy shortages and price spikes.The focus should be on adding carbon capture and storage and improving the efficiency of hydrocarbon production to reduce their emissions, Nasser said.On Monday, climate ministers from the European Union said they would push for a world-first deal to phase out CO2-emitting fossil fuels at COP28.However, countries are far from bridging the gap between those demanding a deal to phase out fossil fuels and nations insisting on preserving a role for coal, oil and natural gas.Scientists say the world needs to cut greenhouse gas emissions by around 43% by 2030 from 2019 levels to stand any chance of meeting the 2015 Paris Agreement goal of keeping warming well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels.

It appeared to put the situation on hold for a day at least.The 1%-plus rally in the S&amp;P 500, which was the best start to the week since February, was matched by a retreat in crude oil, gold and Treasury bond prices and the dollar.Global stocks in Asia and Europe aped at least some of that bounce overnight, but Wall St futures ticked back a touch ahead of Tuesday's opening bell. U.S. crude held steady and Treasury yields crept higher.But after impressive Q3 readouts from JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Citigroup on Friday, markets are braced on Tuesday for updates from Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Bank of New York Mellon.Reflecting the optimism around how banks and financials are benefitting from a higher interest rate world and rising asset management growth, Charles Schwab shares also jumped 4.7% on Monday as the brokerage posted a smaller-than-expected drop in quarterly profit.Third-quarter earnings for S&amp;P 500 companies are estimated to have increased 2.2% year-over-year, up from an estimated increase of 1.3% a week earlier, according to LSEG data.Story continuesBut a welter of economic numbers will barrel into the mix today too - chief among them the September retail sales release, but also industrial output data and an October reading on U.S. housing. Canada's latest consumer price data will be also be closely eyed.And a full schedule of Federal Reserve speakers tees up Fed boss Jerome Powell's public appearance on Thursday.Before then, bond markets will have to negotiate tomorrow's 20-year Treasury auction.The relatively new 20-year tenor has often proved unpopular and will be watched closely after a poor reception for the latest 30-year bond last week. But with yields back above 5% and close to record highs of 5.25% set earlier this month, it will be an interesting test of investor appetite to grab these elevated long-term coupons.Another key moment on the radar is China's third-quarter GDP release on Wednesday - but angst about the ongoing property sector bust there just won't go away.Country Garden's entire offshore debt will be deemed to be in default if China's largest private property developer fails to make a $15 million coupon payment on Tuesday, the end of a 30-day grace period.And non-payment of this tranche is set to trigger cross defaults in other bonds as is standard in bond contracts.To add to the complication of foreign investment in China, Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in Beijing to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping on a widely watched trip aimed at showcasing the trust and ""no-limits"" partnership between the countries even as the war in Ukraine raged on.Elsewhere, there was some relief for the Bank of England amid signs of ebbing wage growth for the first time since January. That helped drag back government gilt yields and the pound slightly lower. Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Tuesday: * U.S. corporate earnings: Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Bank of New York Mellon, Lockheed Martin, Johnson &amp; Johnson, United Airlines, Omnicom, Prologis, JB Hunt, * U.S. Sept retail sales, industrial production, Aug business and retail inventories, Oct NAHB housing index; Canada Sept consumer price inflation, housing starts * Federal Reserve Board Governor Michelle Bowman, New York Fed President John Williams, Minneapolis Fed chief Neel Kashkari and Richmond Fed chief Tom Barkin all speak; European Central Bank board member Luis de Guindos speaks in Frankfurt * U.S. President Joe Biden and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz travel to Israel * ECOFIN meeting of European Union finance ministers in Luxembourg(By Mike Dolan, editing by XXXX mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com.

That lifted the less volatile four-week average to about 3.36 million barrels a day.The increase came from a jump in Black Sea flows to a six-week high and a recovery in shipments from the Arctic port of Murmansk after a slump in the previous week.Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said in early August that Moscow would prolong export restrictions at a reduced level of 300,000 barrels a day below their May-June average until the end of the year. Bloomberg calculations indicate that shipments through ports should be running now at about 3.28 million barrels a day.Four-week average shipments have been creeping up relative to that target since the start of September, exceeding it by abut 80,000 barrels a day in the most recent period. That said, compliance has so far been good compared with the country’s past performance against OPEC+ targets. Since the export restriction was introduced at the start of August, flows have averaged about 15,000 barrels a day below their required level, assuming pipeline deliveries have remained unchanged.The increase in volumes raised the Kremlin’s weekly revenues from oil export duties, while the four-week average rose for an 11th straight week, setting a new high for the period since mid-January.Story continuesRussia’s rising oil income has called into question the effectiveness of the price cap imposed on its exports by the Group of Seven nations and European Union that’s supposed to restrict it. The US Treasury responded by imposing sanctions on two tankers accused of carrying cargoes sold at prices above the $60-a-barrel ceiling. The sanctions are the first time there’s been an effort to enforce the cap since it came into effect in December.Russia’s oil refiners are increasing daily processing rates as October progresses. Oil processing in the country rose by the most in more than a month in the week ended Oct. 11. But ongoing maintenance and temporary diesel export restrictions, which have now been lifted, meant that rates during the Oct. 1-11 period totaled about 150,000 barrels a day below the average for most of September.Flows by DestinationRussia’s seaborne crude flows rose in four weeks to Oct. 15 averaged 3.36 million barrels a day. That’s the highest since July 4 and up from 3.26 million barrels a day in the period to Oct. 8. Shipments remain about 220,000 barrels a day below the highs seen between April and June.All figures exclude cargoes identified as Kazakhstan’s KEBCO grade. Those are shipments made by KazTransoil JSC that transit Russia for export through Novorossiysk and the Baltic port of Ust-Luga and are not subject to European Union sanctions or a price cap.The Kazakh barrels are blended with crude of Russian origin to create a uniform export grade. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Kazakhstan has rebranded its cargoes to distinguish them from those shipped by Russian companies.AsiaMost Read from BloombergIsrael Latest: Blinken Works on Gaza Aid as Biden Set to VisitPutin Arrives in China to Meet Xi on Rare International TripBiden Plans High-Stakes Israel Visit to Keep War From EscalatingYour Guide to Understanding the Roots of the Israel-Hamas WarUS Yields Rise as Hot Economic Data Fuel Fed Bets: Markets WrapObserved shipments to Russia’s Asian customers, including those showing no final destination, rose for a third week. Flows edged higher to 2.95 million barrels a day in the four weeks to Oct. 15, from a revised 2.86 million barrels a day in the period to Oct. 8. That’s still well below a peak of about 3.6 million barrels a day seen in May.Even if all of the cargoes on ships without an initial destination eventually end up in India, shipments to the country will still be about 450,000 barrels a day, or 21%, down from their May high. Adding the “Unknown Asia” and “Other Unknown” volumes to the total for India gives a figure of 1.7 million barrels a day in the four weeks to Oct. 15. That’s the most in 15 weeks, but down from a high of 2.15 million barrels a day in the period to May 21.The equivalent of about 210,000 barrels a day was on vessels signaling Port Said or Suez in Egypt, or are expected to be transferred from one ship to another off the South Korean port of Yeosu. Those voyages typically end at ports in India or China and show up in the chart below as “Unknown Asia” until a final destination becomes apparent.The “Other Unknown” volumes, running at about 260,000 barrels a day in the four weeks to Oct. 15, are those on tankers showing no clear destination. Most of those cargoes originate from Russia’s western ports and go on to transit the Suez Canal, but some could end up in Turkey. Others could be moved from one vessel to another, with most such transfers now taking place in the Mediterranean.EuropeMost Read from BloombergIsrael Latest: Blinken Works on Gaza Aid as Biden Set to VisitPutin Arrives in China to Meet Xi on Rare International TripBiden Plans High-Stakes Israel Visit to Keep War From EscalatingYour Guide to Understanding the Roots of the Israel-Hamas WarUS Yields Rise as Hot Economic Data Fuel Fed Bets: Markets WrapRussia’s seaborne crude exports to European countries fell to equal their lowest level in 14 weeks of about 125,000 barrels a day in the 28 days to Oct. 15, with Bulgaria the sole destination. These figures do not include shipments to Turkey.A market that consumed about 1.5 million barrels a day of short-haul seaborne crude, coming from export terminals in the Baltic, Black Sea and Arctic has been lost almost completely, to be replaced by long-haul destinations in Asia that are much more costly and time-consuming to serve.No Russian crude was shipped to northern European countries in the four weeks to Oct. 15.Exports to Turkey, Russia’s only remaining Mediterranean customer, jumped to about 290,000 barrels a day in the four weeks to Oct. 15. That’s the highest in eleven months. Flows had topped 425,000 barrels a day in October 2022, before falling sharply after a Group of Seven price cap came into effect in early December.The jump in flows comes after Lukoil resumed deliveries to the Azerbaijani-owned Star refinery at Aliaga. Supplies are expected at about 100,000 barrels a day, equivalent to half of the refinery’s capacity.Flows to Bulgaria, now Russia’s only Black Sea market for crude, fell to a six-week low of about 125,000 barrels a day. High levels of imports seen in recent weeks have come despite lawmakers recently approving a motion to end Bulgaria’s dependence on Russian crude sooner than permitted under a European Union import ban.Flows by Export LocationAggregate flows of Russian crude rebounded, making up more than half of the previous week’s drop. Seaborne exports averaged 3.51 million barrels a day in the seven days to Oct. 15. The increase of about 285,000 barrels a day was driven by higher flows from the Arctic and the Black Sea.Figures exclude volumes from Ust-Luga and Novorossiysk identified as Kazakhstan’s KEBCO grade.Vessel-tracking data are cross-checked against port agent reports as well as flows and ship movements reported by other information providers including Kpler and Vortexa Ltd.Export RevenueInflows to the Kremlin's war chest from its crude-export duty jumped to $80 million in the seven days to Oct. 15, while four-week average income edged up to $73 million. The four-week average set a new high for the period since mid-January. Rising oil prices and the rebound in flows are both contributing to the increase in receipts.Russia’s government calculates oil taxes — including export duty — using a discount to global benchmark Brent, which sets the floor price for the nation’s crude for budget purposes. If Russian oil trades above that threshold, the Finance Ministry uses the market price for tax calculations, as has been the case in recent months. The discount used to calculate taxes including export duty is set at $20 a barrel for September and subsequent months.The duty rate for October has been set at $3.26 a barrel, based on an average Urals price of $77.03 during the calculation period between Aug. 15 and Sept. 14. That was $11.60 a barrel below Brent over the same period. October’s duty rate sets a new high for the year. The rate for November has been set at $3.57 a barrel, based on an average Urals price of $83.35 during the calculation period between Sept. 15 and Oct. 14. That was about $7.70 a barrel below Brent over the same period. November’s duty rate sets a new high for the year.Origin-to-Location FlowsThe following charts show the number of ships leaving each export terminal and the destinations of crude cargoes from the four export regions.A total of 32 tankers loaded 24.6 million barrels of Russian crude in the week to Oct. 15, vessel-tracking data and port agent reports show. That’s up 2 million barrels from the previous week.A jump in shipments from Ust-Luga in the Baltic more than offset a drop in the number of vessels leaving nearby Primorsk.Destinations are based on where vessels signal they are heading at the time of writing, and some will almost certainly change as voyages progress. All figures exclude cargoes identified as Kazakhstan’s KEBCO grade.The total volume on ships loading Russian crude from the Baltic terminals was unchanged, averaging 1.56 million barrels a day for a third week.Shipments of Russian crude from Novorossiysk jumped to 625,000 barrels a day, equal to the highest since the week ending July 2.Two cargoes of Kazakh crude were loaded at the port during the week, up from one during the previous seven days.Two Suezmax tankers completed loading cargoes at the Arctic port of Murmansk in the week to Oct. 15, boosting flows to about 285,000 barrels a day.Two tankers were drifting outside the port waiting to load at the end of the week.Ten tankers loaded at Russia’s three Pacific export terminals, down by two from the previous week. The volume of crude shipped from the region fell to just over 1 million barrels a day, down by 200,000 barrels a day from the previous seven days.The drop in flows was driven by fewer ships lading Sokol grade from the terminal at De Kastri and no tankers completing loading of Sakhalin Blend crude. Shipments from the Sakhalin Island terminal are running at one every other week.The volumes heading to unknown destinations are Sokol cargoes that are currently being shuttled to an area off the South Korean port of Yosu from the loading terminal at De Kastri. Most of these are ending up in India.NOTESNote: This story forms part of a weekly series tracking shipments of crude from Russian export terminals and the export duty revenues earned from them by the Russian government. Weeks run from Monday to Sunday. The next update will be on Tuesday, Oct. 24.Note: All figures exclude cargoes owned by Kazakhstan’s KazTransOil JSC, which transit Russia and are shipped from Novorossiysk and Ust-Luga as KEBCO grade crude.If you are reading this story on the Bloomberg terminal, click here for a link to a PDF file of four-week average flows from Russia to key destinations.--With assistance from Sherry Su.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWall Street’s Surprising Quest for Ways to Finance Coal AgainAd-Free Versions of Facebook and Instagram Have One Audience in Mind: RegulatorsThe K-Pop Mogul Behind BTS Is Building the Next BTSIntroducing The Businessweek Show With Max AbelsonHas Bob Iger Lost the Magic?©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

For 10 straight months, investors enjoyed a strong comeback rally in the S&amp;P 500. After plunging sharply into bear market territory last year, the broad-based index roared ahead 28% in 2023 to hit a peak at the end of July. The rally stalled afterwards, but gave up only a few percentage points of the gains. Still, it’s understandable that investors are nervous heading into October. Some of the biggest market crashes occurred this month. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe collapse of 1929 that ushered in the Great Depression happened in October as did Black Monday in 1987.Although we can’t predict when the next big downturn will occur or how long it will last, we do know they are a normal part of the market cycle. It’s why it is important to keep our eyes focused on the horizon. Because every crash is eventually followed by a bull market. Corrections test our mettle, but they remain the perfect time to buy stocks. The following seven companies are among the best to own during a downturn.Mastercard (MA)A close-up shot of Mastercard credit or debit cards.Source: Alexander Yakimov / Shutterstock.comPayments processor Mastercard (NYSE:MA) should be one of the first defensive stocks an investor should own in a recession. Despite consumers curtailing spending in a period of economic hardship, the downside is protected. Because it narrowly sticks to its knitting of only processing payments, it shields itself from liability associated with credit defaults and delinquencies if it also made loans. It may lose out on interest income during market expansions, but there is no need to set aside reserves for losses during downturns. Operating margins consistently stay north of 50%, with its five-year average standing at 55.7%.Market corrections typically last only a few months. Bull markets go on for years. Since 1928, the average bear market lasted 15 months while the subsequent rally went on for three years. Even better, since 1970, bull markets tend to last more than six years on average.Story continuesThat means any softness resulting from a crash will be short-lived compared to the sustained growth that follows. It makes Mastercard a solid choice for investors to buy. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A)(BRK-B)The logo for Berkshire Hathaway displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comSince Warren Buffett became chairman of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A)(NYSE:BRK-B) in 1965, he generated returns double those of the S&amp;P 500. Overall, through the end of 2022, he generated 3.7 million percent return for investors. What’s less known is that Berkshire excels during bear markets. Data from Bespoke Investment Group shows that every time the S&amp;P 500 dropped 20% or more, Berkshire stock beat the index by a median of 14.89 percentage points. It achieved this distinction through a combination of focusing on long-term investment horizons, keeping a lot of cash on hand, and favoring dividend stocks. Buffett will receive $5.7 billion in dividend checks alone this year.With Berkshire’s Class A shares going for more than $525,000 each and the Class B lot trading at $346, I recommend investors buy the latter. The two walk virtually lockstep in returns and their lower price obviously makes them much more accessible.Zoetis (ZTS)a magnifying glass enlarges the Zoetis logo on a websiteSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comZoetis (NYSE:ZTS) is a perfect stock to own regardless of market conditions.Zoetis is one of the world’s biggest animal health companies possessing a portfolio of therapies, vaccines, diagnostics, and technologies in use in over 100 countries. It generates over $8 billion in annual sales and growing.During downturns, owners will downgrade from premium products to discounted brands. They will limit discretionary purchases. We’re seeing that show up in the results of Chewy (NASDAQ:CHWY) and Petco (NASDAQ:WOOF). What they won’t do is cut back on their pet’s health and wellness. If Fido is sick, they will still take him to the veterinarian for care.For example, Petco saw vet visits jump 26% last quarter even as sales in its discretionary spending category were pressured. Zoetis’ own sales grew 6% last quarter to $2.2 billion with per share earnings rising 29% over last year.Shares of Zoetis are up 20% this year, and investors should buy in on any weakness.CrowdStrike (CRWD)A sign with the Crowdstrike (CRWD) company logoSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.comCybersecurity remains an area that businesses can’t scrimp on. While they may spend less during downturns, they must maintain their networks and protect their data. As more companies move their data to the cloud, CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) will benefit from it.Family genetics site 23andMe Holding (NYSE:ME) just reported millions of individual data points from an unknown number of customer accounts were compromised. They are selling the stolen data on the Dark Web. 23andMe denies the company was hacked. It says stolen passwords were likely used to access the accounts. It highlights just how vulnerable information is online. The Identity Theft Research Center’s says data breaches are on pace to set a new record this year.CrowdStrike has over 23,000 customers including over half of all Fortune 500 companies. It also gets them to spend more. Some 63% of customers buy five or more of its modules, 41% use six or more, and nearly a quarter of them use seven or more modules. CrowdStrike previously changed to a subscription-based model. That switch is bearing fruit with annual recurring revenue growing 37% last quarter to $2.9 billion. Subscription gross margins just hit 78%.The leading cybersecurity specialist is a recession-resistant stock, if not recession-proof.Genuine Parts (GPC)Source: ShutterstockIn good times or bad, people need their cars to work. The cost of a new car averages around $48,000, a 33% increase in five years. A used car carries a list price of over $26,000. Keeping the car that you already own on the road is imperative. Aftermarket auto parts retailer Genuine Parts (NYSE:GPC) helps consumers maintain the car they have. The owner of the 9,600-store NAPA Auto Parts chain reported record sales of $5.9 billion last quarter, up 5.6% year over year. Adjusted earnings per share were 11% higher.Morningstar says if you want to buy a new car, you should probably earn over $100,000 a year. The Census Bureau says U.S. median household income fell last year to $74,580. Government spending and Federal Reserve policies are pricing Americans out of the auto market.Shortages also continue to plague the auto industry. From computer chips to OEM replacement parts, there just aren’t as many vehicles available on dealer lots. The current strike by the United Auto Workers union will only exacerbate the situation. Genuine Auto Parts trades at just 14 times earnings estimates and a fraction of sales. It also pays a dividend that yields 2.6% annually. Having raised the payout every year for 67 years, it is a Dividend King worth buying.Microsoft (MSFT)Image of corporate building with Microsoft logo above the entrance.Source: NYCStock / Shutterstock.comIf Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was still just a computer operating system stock, I wouldn’t be recommending it. But it’s been a long time since that was the case and the tech giant is now an integral part of business and the economy. One that not even a market crash can derail.Personal computing is now Microsoft’s smallest operating segment with less than $14 billion in revenue last quarter. The cloud has become its primary growth driver with sales of $24 billion, up 15% year over year. Productivity products such as its Office suite is the second biggest source of revenue.As mentioned with CrowdStrike, business continues to move data and processes to the cloud and Microsoft’s Azure is the second largest platform behind Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services. Azure is primarily responsible for the growth witnessed in the cloud business with revenue surging 27% higher. Mixing cloud services with artificial intelligence (AI) is also proving profitable. Another cybersecurity outfit, Snowflake, is increasing the amount it spends on Azure as it incorporates Azure OpenAI into its platform. OpenAI, of course, is the creator of the popular AI chatbot ChatGPT. AI will be a huge driver of future growth.Cloud services, artificial intelligence, and a core computing technology foundation ensure Microsoft will remain relevant regardless of the market scenarios that play out.Cardinal Health (CAH)Cardinal Health (CAH) sign with bushes in front of itSource: ShutterstockCardinal Health (NYSE:CAH) is one of the largest drug and medical product distributors in the country. It serves nearly 90% of U.S. hospitals, over 60,000 U.S. pharmacies, and more than 10,000 specialty physician offices and clinics.Pharmaceuticals fuel Cardinal’s growth. Sales grew 15% to $49.7 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, generating a 12% increase in segment profits; that’s $504 million. Medical products have stalled at $3.8 billion in quarterly sales.Much of the growth seen in the drug distribution segment is a result of the class of weight-loss drugs known as glycogen-like peptide-1, or GLP-1, therapies. Novo Nordisk‘s (NYSE:NVO) Ozempic and Wegovy are two of the hottest drugs on the market. A month’s supply costs around $1,000 and produces large payouts for distributors. Cardinal said the primary reason it was raising its full-year guidance was because of the demand for GLP-1’s.Healthcare is another recession resistant industry and with incredible demand providing a tailwind, Cardinal Health ought to be a defensive stock to own during a downturn.On the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in CAH and GPC stock.

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. However, after investigating NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE), we don't think it's current trends fit the mold of a multi-bagger.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on NextEra Energy is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.065 = US$9.3b ÷ (US$168b - US$25b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Therefore, NextEra Energy has an ROCE of 6.5%. On its own that's a low return, but compared to the average of 4.5% generated by the Electric Utilities industry, it's much better. See our latest analysis for NextEra Energy roceIn the above chart we have measured NextEra Energy's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Can We Tell From NextEra Energy's ROCE Trend?There are better returns on capital out there than what we're seeing at NextEra Energy. The company has employed 68% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 6.5%. Given the company has increased the amount of capital employed, it appears the investments that have been made simply don't provide a high return on capital.The Bottom LineIn conclusion, NextEra Energy has been investing more capital into the business, but returns on that capital haven't increased. Since the stock has gained an impressive 42% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. However, unless these underlying trends turn more positive, we wouldn't get our hopes up too high.Story continuesIf you'd like to know more about NextEra Energy, we've spotted   3 warning signs,  and 1 of them is potentially serious.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

The Zacks analyst believes that strong growth from artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance computing and accelerated computing is boosting its Compute &amp; Networking revenues. Large language models using GPUs based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures, rising demand for generative AI and surge in Hyperscale demand also aid its growth.Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings have driven the top-line growth.However, the company’s near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by weakening demand for chips used in the professional visualization end market.(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Procter &amp; Gamble shares have outperformed the Zacks Consumer Staples – Soap and Cleaning Materials industry over the past year (+13.6% vs. +10.2%).

Focus on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins have also helped.Rapid adoption of cloud-based solutions, continued deal wins in international markets, and acquisition of Slack have positioned the company as a market leader.Yet, supply-chain issues, higher SG&amp;A costs, higher transportation costs, geopolitical challenges, currency headwinds and rising inflation have plagued the company.

Also, risks in operating nuclear units, unfavorable weather conditions and increasing supply costs adversely impact earnings.However, with numerous projects in its backlog and the merger between Gulf Power and FPL have strengthened NextEra’s position in the area.

But some ESG-focused companies, especially established ones in sectors like renewable energy or sustainable infrastructure, regularly pay dividends to their shareholders.This means that even in periods of price fluctuation, investors can still realize a return on their investment through dividend payouts. Such consistent dividend distributions can provide a cushion against short-term market uncertainties and enhance long-term total returns for investors.Don't Miss:Investing in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. With as little as $100, average investors are becoming landlords thanks to this Jeff Bezos-backed startup.Elon Musk has reportedly bought 6,000 acres of land just outside of Austin. Here’s how to invest in the city’s growth before he floods it with new tech workers.Miss Section]To illustrate how this dynamic operates in the ESG world, here's a look at NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE).NextEra Energy is a global leader in the renewable energy sector, with a diversified portfolio that includes a substantial emphasis on wind and solar power generation. Based in Juno Beach, Florida, the company operates through multiple subsidiaries, including Florida Power &amp; Light Co., which serves millions of customers in Florida, and NextEra Energy Resources LLC, which is the world's largest producer of wind and solar energy.Shares of NextEra Energy have not been hot commodities lately — they are down 20% over the past month.Story continuesBut Morgan Stanley analyst David Arcaro sees a rebound on the horizon. The analyst recently reiterated an Overweight rating on NextEra Energy with a price target of $91. Considering that shares currently trade at $54.78, the price target implies a potential upside of 66%.With NextEra Energy, investors can also collect dividends.Passive Income From ESGOn Friday, NextEra Energy's board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 46.75 cents per share. At the current share price, that gives the stock an annual dividend yield of 3.4%.If you want to collect $1,000 per month from the company, you are looking at $3,000 per quarter. And that means you would need 6,417.11 shares of the company. This is calculated by dividing the $3,000 by the per share quarterly payout of $0.4675.And because NextEra Energy currently trades at $54.78 per share, 6,417.11 shares would mean about $351,529 worth of the stock.If you aim for a smaller target of earning $200 per month — or $600 per quarter — you would need 1,283.42 shares ($600/$0.4675) or $70,306 worth of NextEra Energy stock (1,283.42 x $54.78).Remember, stocks can fluctuate wildly, and even top analysts aren’t right 100% of the time. So always conduct comprehensive research and due diligence before diving in.Read Next:This REIT just teamed up with the company that built Elon Musk's tiny house to develop affordable housing communities.

Unpacking the Risks and Rewards,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nextera-energy-nee-stock-hidden-153740110.html,1697470660,STORY,['NEE'],"[Value-focused investors are always on the hunt for stocks that are priced below their intrinsic value. One such stock that merits attention is NextEra Energy Inc (NYSE:NEE). The stock, which is currently priced at 53.71, recorded a loss of 1.43% in a day and a 3-month decrease of 25.51%. The stock's fair valuation is $110.02, as indicated by its GF Value.Understanding GF ValueWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with NEE.The GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our exclusive method. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. It is calculated based on three factors:1. Historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at.2. GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth.3. Future estimates of the business performance.We believe the GF Value Line is the fair value that the stock should be traded at. The stock price will most likely fluctuate around the GF Value Line. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.NextEra Energy (NEE) Stock: A Hidden Value Trap? Unpacking the Risks and RewardsConsidering Risk FactorsHowever, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with NextEra Energy should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of 1.12. These indicators suggest that NextEra Energy, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Understanding Altman Z-scoreBefore delving into the details, let's understand what the Altman Z-score entails. Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Story continuesCompany OverviewNextEra Energy Inc (NYSE:NEE) is the largest rate-regulated utility in Florida, distributing power to nearly 6 million customer accounts in the state and owning 32 gigawatts of generation. The renewable energy segment, NextEra Energy Resources, generates and sells power throughout the United States and Canada with more than 25 GW of generation capacity, including natural gas, nuclear, wind, and solar. The company's current market cap is $108.70 billion with sales amounting to $26.90 billion.NextEra Energy (NEE) Stock: A Hidden Value Trap? Unpacking the Risks and RewardsBreaking Down NextEra Energy's Low Altman Z-ScoreA dissection of NextEra Energy's Altman Z-score reveals NextEra Energy's financial health may be weak, suggesting possible financial distress. The Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio provides insights into a company's capability to reinvest its profits or manage debt. Evaluating NextEra Energy's historical data, 2021: 0.19; 2022: 0.17; 2023: 0.18, we observe a declining trend in this ratio. This downward movement indicates NextEra Energy's diminishing ability to reinvest in its business or effectively manage its debt. Consequently, it exerts a negative impact on its Z-Score.Operational EfficiencyWhen it comes to operational efficiency, a vital indicator for NextEra Energy is its asset turnover. The data: 2021: 0.13; 2022: 0.12; 2023: 0.17 from the past three years suggests a recent decline following an initial increase in this ratio. The asset turnover ratio reflects how effectively a company is using its assets to generate sales. Therefore, a drop in this ratio can signify reduced operational efficiency, potentially due to underutilization of assets or decreased market demand for the company's products or services. This shift in NextEra Energy's asset turnover underlines the need for the company to reassess its operational strategies to optimize asset usage and boost sales.ConclusionDespite NextEra Energy's seemingly attractive valuation, the company's low Altman Z-Score and declining operational efficiency suggest potential financial distress and possible value trap risks. Therefore, investors are advised to conduct thorough due diligence before making an investment decision.GuruFocus Premium members can find stocks with high Altman Z-Score using the following Screener: Walter Schloss Screen .This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.Growth StageGrowth rate (g1) = 0.00% Years of Growth Stage = 10We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.Terminal StageGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.CalculationGrowth Stage=EPS without NRI*[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)*(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=42.64Terminal Stage=EPS without NRI*(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10*[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)+(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=18.13Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)=Growth Stage+Terminal Stage=145.36Discounted Free Cash Flow ModelGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $305.63. This valuation indicates that the S&amp;P Global Inc is fair valued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -19%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.Story continuesThe Bottom LinePlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation.  Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:Future Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.Navigating with GuruFocus:Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

The company has been struggling due to high inflation and low pricing power for its product offerings. Tyson Foods has witnessed elevated input costs and has been dealing with weak margins for several quarters. Weakness in the consumer staples sector has also contributed to poor stock performance.A member of the S&amp;P 500, Tyson Foods manufactures and markets its products under recognized brand names such as Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm, and Ball Park. The company sells its products in more than 80 countries through its sales staff to grocery retailers and wholesalers, meat distributors, chain restaurants, convenience stores and hospitals. Tyson Foods was founded in 1935 and is headquartered in Springdale, AR.The Zacks RundownTSN stock is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and is a component of the Zacks Food – Meat Products industry group, which ranks in the bottom 9% out of more than 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. As such, we expect this industry group as a whole to underperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months, just as it has over the course of the year:Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCandidates in the bottom tiers of industries can often be potential short candidates. While individual stocks have the ability to outperform even when included in a poorly-performing industry group, the inclusion in a weaker group serves as a headwind for any potential rallies and the journey forward is that much more difficult.Despite the underperformance this year, stocks in this group remain relatively overvalued:Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs a part of this group, TSN stock has experienced considerable volatility in 2023. Shares recently touched a 52-week low even as the market has bounced off the September lows.Recent Earnings Misses and Deteriorating Outlook TSN has fallen short of earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters. The food company most recently reported fiscal third-quarter earnings back in August of $0.15/share, missing the $0.34/share consensus EPS estimate by 55.9%. Earnings plunged 92.3% from the same quarter in the prior year.Story continuesTyson Foods has missed earnings estimates by an average of 50.5% over the past four quarters. Consistently falling short of earnings estimates is a recipe for underperformance, and TSN is no exception.The company has been on the receiving end of negative earnings estimate revisions as of late. For the current fiscal year, analysts have decreased estimates by 3.79% in the past 60 days. The fiscal 2023 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate now stands at $1.27/share, translating to negative growth of -85.5% relative to last year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFalling earnings estimates are a huge red flag and need to be respected. Negative growth year-over-year is the type of trend that bears like to see.Technical OutlookAs illustrated below, TSN stock is in a sustained downtrend. Notice how shares have plunged below both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages signaled by the blue and red lines, respectively. The stock is making a series of lower lows, with no respite from the selling in sight. Also note how both moving averages have rolled over and are sloping down – another good sign for the bears.StockChartsImage Source: StockChartsWhile not the most accurate indicator, TSN stock has also experienced what is known as a ‘death cross’, wherein the stock’s 50-day moving average crosses below its 200-day moving average. Tyson Foods would have to make a serious move to the upside and show increasing earnings estimate revisions to warrant taking any long positions in the stock. TSN shares have fallen more than 24% in the past year alone.Final ThoughtsA deteriorating fundamental and technical backdrop show that this stock is not set to hit new highs anytime soon. The fact that TSN is included in one of the worst-performing industry groups provides yet another headwind to a long list of concerns. A history of earnings misses will likely serve as a ceiling to any potential rallies, nurturing the stock’s downtrend.Shares continue to experience substantial volatility and have widely underperformed this year. With negative earnings estimate revisions continuing to pile up, this stock should be avoided as there are plenty of better alternatives in the current market environment.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

They chanted ""Hey hey, ho ho, exploitation's gotta go,"" according to a livestream of the event on Facebook.Tyson, the biggest U.S. meat company by sales, said it respects people’s right to protest peacefully and encourages employees to raise concerns with the company. It did not comment on child labor allegations. The company's code of conduct says suppliers are expected to ensure they do not use child labor.Magaly Licolli, an organizer of the rally, said Tyson needs to do more to keep kids out of its supply chain.""Tyson keeps avoiding the subject by saying that they are not hiring directly the workers,"" said Licolli, the director of Venceremos, an organization that advocates for poultry workers in Arkansas.Licolli said she helped two teenage boys from Guatemala recover wages after they were hired by a contractor to gather chickens on a farm that supplied Tyson and were not initially paid. Tyson did not comment on the incident.The U.S. Department of Labor said in February that a major food safety sanitation company paid $1.5 million in penalties for employing more than 100 teenagers at meatpacking plants, including two Tyson facilities in Arkansas and Tennessee.The Labor Department on Monday confirmed its Wage and Hour Division has investigations open at Tyson and Perdue Farms, when asked about reports that migrant children were used to clean slaughterhouses.Demonstrators at the rally also called on Tyson to slow speeds on processing lines in chicken plants, carrying a banner that read ""Slow down the line, keep workers in mind.""(Reporting by Tom Polansek; Editing by Rod Nickel)]"

If you want to skip our analysis of the technology industry, then take a look at 5 Technology Stocks To Buy That Are Too Cheap To Ignore. Technology has proven to be the most remarkable industry of our age since it has virtually (no pun intended) transformed every aspect of modern day living. We've written this article using technology, you're using technology to read this article, and the stocks that everyone is trading are now available through digital mediums that would have been unimaginable just a couple of decades back.Before we get to the financial bit about the technology industry it's important to understand what the term actually means. Due to its near ubiquity in modern day living, technology is simply defined as the use of knowledge involving technical processes to achieve an objective. In a broad definition, this adaptability of technical processes to different use cases naturally affects a lot of different walks of life. At its very heart, technology can also be defined as using an electronic system to speed up data collection, analysis, and computation - three things that can power anything from the iPhone to a data center, an airplane, or a car.Since computing sits at the heart of technology, one of the most important segments of the technology industry is the semiconductor sector. A semiconductor is a small piece of silicon with circuits made of different materials printed on top of it. The smaller these circuits get, the greater the semiconductor's performance since small feature sizes lead to greater power savings and electrical conductivity. This criticality of semiconductors, also called chips, to the global technological landscape has also made semiconductors one of the most controversial and risky industries these days.This is because the high end technologies involved in making chips coupled with the billions of dollars in capital expenditure needed to set up a new chip manufacturing plant mean that the barriers of entry to this industry are among the highest in the world and stand in parallel to other high tech sectors such as rocket and aircraft manufacturing. Consequently, only three companies in the world, namely the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), and Samsung Electronics can make the latest chips, with others limited to older models. Out of these, only TSMC and Samsung sell their chips to third party customers such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) since Intel only makes and sells its own chips.Story continuesWhy is this important? Well, TSMC is the biggest contract chip manufacturer in the world in terms of volume and all of its advanced chip manufacturing facilities are located in the disputed island of Taiwan. Taiwan and China share a common history, and Beijing considers it an integral part of its territory even though Taiwan has its own passport and holds its own elections. Therefore, the island's status is a cause of significant friction between China and the Western rules based order led by the United States, and one of the biggest worries in the chip sector is that a potential conflict in China can disrupt the global semiconductor supply chain to lead to unimaginable consequences.The potential repercussions of such a conflict are so significant that they even made the well known Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway to change his mind. Mr. Buffett's investment firm made headlines at the end of last year as its filings with the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) revealed that it had bought a whopping 60 million TSMC shares for a $4.1 billion investment for its third quarter of 2022 investments. Since Mr. Buffett takes his sweet time before investing, the decision suggested that TSMC could do nothing wrong. However, in the very next quarter, Berkshire Hathaway reduced its stake by an equally stunning $3.5 billion and disposed off of the shares entirely in the succeeding quarter. The $3.5 billion reduction made waves in the industry as speculation started to become rife about the reason behind the Oracle of Omaha's sudden shift of mood.Mr. Buffett explained his decision soon, sharing that he believes that TSMC is a solid company but the firm's geopolitical risks simply proved too much to ignore. According to CNN which quotes several of his statements:“I feel better about the capital that we’ve got deployed in Japan than in Taiwan,” the Berkshire Hathaway chairman added. “I wish it weren’t sold, but I think that’s a reality.”Despite the share sale, Buffett lauded TSMC as “one of the best-managed companies and [most] important companies in the world.”“There’s no one in the chip industry that’s in their league, at least in my view,” he said.“Marvelous people and marvelous competitive position and everything, [but] I’d rather find it in the United States.”Buffett said his reassessment of the company was in “light of certain things that were going on.” He had previously pointed to geopolitical tensions as a concern.Before we get to our latest pick of the cheapest technology stocks, it's also important to briefly consider the current investment climate for these stocks. The technology sector is a growth industry that depends on robust purchasing power for both businesses and consumers as well as easy access to capital due to expensive products and services. These days, technology stocks are under pressure as high rates and troubling economic data have dampened investors' risk appetites. Therefore, the major catalysts for the sector as a whole are announcements regarding interest rate cuts as well as economic growth since a slowing economy sees capital fly to safety in sectors such as consumer defensive.So, time to look at some great cheap technology stocks, and some notable picks are QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM).13 Technology Stocks To Buy That Are Too Cheap To IgnoreA Wall Street trader on the phone, quickly executing a technology-driven trade.

Unpacking the Risks and Rewards""",GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/baxter-international-bax-stock-hidden-153604956.html,1697470564,STORY,"['BAX', 'VALU']","[Value-focused investors are always on the hunt for stocks that are priced below their intrinsic value. One such stock that merits attention is Baxter International Inc (NYSE:BAX). The stock, currently priced at 31.17, recorded a loss of 2.1% in a day and a 3-month decrease of 32.28%. The stock's fair valuation is $95.34, as indicated by its GF Value.Understanding GF ValueWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with BAX.The GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our exclusive method. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. It is calculated based on three factors: historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at, GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future estimates of the business performance.However, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with Baxter International should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of 1.48. These indicators suggest that Baxter International, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.What is the Altman Z-score?Before delving into the details, let's understand what the Altman Z-score entails. Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Story continuesCompany OverviewBaxter International Inc (NYSE:BAX) offers a variety of medical instruments and supplies to caregivers. It enhanced its portfolio of hospital-focused offerings by acquiring Hillrom in late 2021, which added basic equipment, including hospital beds, to the portfolio, although about half of Hillrom's revenue comes from more digitally connected offerings like its smart beds and Voalte medical communications app. From its legacy operations, Baxter offers tools to help patients with acute and chronic kidney failure, which it plans to spin off in 2024. It also sells a variety of injectable therapies for use in care settings, such as IV pumps, administrative sets, and solutions; nutritional products; and surgical sealants and hemostatic agents.Baxter International's Low Altman Z-Score: A Breakdown of Key DriversA dissection of Baxter International's Altman Z-score reveals Baxter International's financial health may be weak, suggesting possible financial distress. The Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio provides insights into a company's capability to reinvest its profits or manage debt. Evaluating Baxter International's historical data, 2021: 0.85; 2022: 0.54; 2023: 0.49, we observe a declining trend in this ratio. This downward movement indicates Baxter International's diminishing ability to reinvest in its business or effectively manage its debt. Consequently, it exerts a negative impact on its Z-Score.The EBIT to Total Assets ratio serves as a crucial barometer of a company's operational effectiveness, correlating earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to total assets. An analysis of Baxter International's EBIT to Total Assets ratio from historical data (2021: 0.08; 2022: 0.04; 2023: -0.09) indicates a descending trend. This reduction suggests that Baxter International might not be utilizing its assets to their full potential to generate operational profits, which could be negatively affecting the company's overall Z-score.When it comes to operational efficiency, a vital indicator for Baxter International is its asset turnover. The data: 2021: 0.62; 2022: 0.51; 2023: 0.52 from the past three years suggests a decreasing trend in this ratio. The asset turnover ratio reflects how effectively a company is using its assets to generate sales. Therefore, a drop in this ratio can signify reduced operational efficiency, potentially due to underutilization of assets or decreased market demand for the company's products or services. This shift in Baxter International's asset turnover underlines the need for the company to reassess its operational strategies to optimize asset usage and boost sales.ConclusionDespite its seemingly attractive valuation, Baxter International (NYSE:BAX) might be a potential value trap, as indicated by its low Altman Z-score. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.

With 85% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).And institutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's share price fell by 5.5% last week. The recent loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 8.8% for stockholders, may not sit well with this group of investors. Institutions or ""liquidity providers"" control large sums of money and therefore, these types of investors usually have a lot of influence over stock price movements. As a result, if the decline continues, institutional investors may be pressured to sell Medtronic which might hurt individual investors.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Medtronic. Check out our latest analysis for Medtronic ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Medtronic?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Medtronic does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Medtronic, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Medtronic is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.5%. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.6% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.5% by the third-largest shareholder.A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 25 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of MedtronicWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Medtronic plc. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$44m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 15% stake in Medtronic. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Medtronic .But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

CCI is scheduled to release third-quarter 2023 results on Oct 18 after the closing bell. In anticipation of the announcement, industry analysts and investors are eager to assess the company's performance and prospects in the current economic climate.In the last reported quarter, this Houston, TX-based real estate investment trust’s (REIT) adjusted funds from operations (FFO) per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.02%. Results reflected better-than-anticipated revenues aided by robust site-rental revenue growth. However, the company lowered its outlook for 2023, citing that it expects a decline in tower activity for the remainder of the year due to reduced network spending by wireless carriers.Over the preceding four quarters, CCI’s FFO per share surpassed estimates on three occasions and missed once, the average beat being 0.91%. This is depicted in the graph below:Crown Castle Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseCrown Castle Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseCrown Castle Inc. price-eps-surprise | Crown Castle Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up before this announcement.Factors to NoteIn recent years, the advancement in mobile technology, such as 4G and 5G networks, and the proliferation of bandwidth-intensive applications have steered the growth in mobile data usage globally. Also, the rampant usage of network-intensive applications for video conferencing and cloud services and remote-working scenarios have fueled the rise. This has led to greater capital spending by wireless carriers due to incremental demand from global 4G and 5G deployment efforts, growing wireless penetration and spectrum auctions, aiding the demand for CCI’s wireless communication infrastructure.Further, CCI’s solid balance sheet position is likely to have supported its small cell deployment efforts required to increase the capacity and density of the wireless network for 5G deployment.However, according to management, the initial surge in tower activity related to the early stage of the 5G investment cycle has waned. As a result, management expected a decline in tower activity for the remainder of the year due to reduced network spending by wireless carriers. Moreover, the T-Mobile Sprint network rationalization is likely to weigh on the third quarter of 2023.Amid these, our estimate for quarterly site rental revenues stands at $1.57 billion, implying only 0.4% growth year over year. We estimate revenues from the network services and other segment to decline 10.9% year over year during the quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.71 billion, indicating a decrease of 2.28% from the year-ago reported number.Also, high interest expenses are likely to have been a spoilsport for CCI during the to-be-reported quarter. We expect third-quarter 2023 interest expenses and amortization of deferred financing costs to rise 20.8% year over year.Crown Castle’s activities in the quarter were inadequate to garner analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly FFO per share has been revised 1.1% downward over the past month to $1.78. The figure also suggests a 3.78% decrease from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.Story continuesHere Is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Our proven model predicts a surprise in terms of FFO per share for Crown Castle this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an FFO beat, which is the case here.Crown Castle currently has a Zacks Rank of 3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.70%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are two other stocks from the broader REIT sector — Prologis PLD and American Tower Corporation AMT — you may want to consider as our model shows that these also have the right combination of elements to report a surprise this quarter.Prologis is slated to report quarterly numbers on Oct 17.

CCI, may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Crown Castle is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for CCI in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.80 per share for CCI, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.70 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for CCI, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of 0.70% heading into earnings season.Crown Castle Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseCrown Castle Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseCrown Castle Inc. price-eps-surprise | Crown Castle Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that CCI has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1(Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Crown Castle, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The CHMP has also recommended the approval for extending dosing for PREVYMIS from 100 days to 200 days following transplant in adult CMV-seropositive recipients [R+] of an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) who are at risk for late CMV infection and disease. The CHMP’s recommendations will now be reviewed by the European Commission for marketing authorization in the European Union (EU) and a final decision is expected this year.""This positive CHMP opinion is an important step towards making PREVYMIS available to high-risk kidney transplant patients to help prevent CMV disease, as well as extending dosing to 200 days for adults who receive an allogeneic stem-cell transplant and are at risk for late CMV infection and disease,"" said Dr. Elizabeth Rhee, vice president, global clinical development, Merck Research Laboratories. ""CMV is a potentially serious viral infection for these high-risk transplant recipients, and we are pleased that these patients in the EU will soon be able to access PREVYMIS to help prevent CMV infection and disease.""PREVYMIS is an antiviral agent that was initially approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2017 and by the EMA in 2018 for prophylaxis of CMV infection and disease in adult CMV-seropositive recipients [R+] of an allogeneic HSCT. In June 2023, the FDA approved PREVYMIS for prophylaxis of CMV disease in adult kidney transplant recipients at high risk, and in August 2023, the FDA approved extended 200-day dosing for PREVYMIS for CMV prophylaxis in HSCT recipients at risk for late CMV infection and disease.Story continuesThe CHMP opinion for use of PREVYMIS for CMV disease prophylaxis in adult kidney transplant recipients was supported by a Phase 3, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, active comparator-controlled non-inferiority trial (P002, NCT03443869) in 589 adult kidney transplant recipients at high risk (CMV D+/R-). Additionally, the efficacy of extending PREVYMIS prophylaxis from Week 14 (~100 days) through Week 28 (~200 days) post-HSCT in patients at risk for late CMV infection and disease was assessed in a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial (P040, NCT03930615) in adult CMV-seropositive recipients [R+] of an allogeneic HSCT.About CMVGlobally, many adults are CMV-seropositive [R+], meaning they have CMV antibodies in their blood, indicating a previous exposure to or primary infection with CMV. People with healthy immune systems rarely develop CMV symptoms after initial infection, with the virus typically remaining inactive or latent in the body for life. CMV-seropositive [R+] patients who undergo an HSCT are at high risk for CMV reactivation. CMV‐seronegative recipients who receive an organ from a CMV‐seropositive donor [D+/R-] are at high risk of CMV disease after transplantation.Selected Safety Information about PREVYMISPREVYMIS is contraindicated in patients receiving pimozide or ergot alkaloids. Increased pimozide concentrations may lead to QT prolongation and torsades de pointes. Increased ergot alkaloids concentrations may lead to ergotism. PREVYMIS is contraindicated with pitavastatin and simvastatin when co-administered with cyclosporine. Significantly increased pitavastatin or simvastatin concentrations may lead to myopathy or rhabdomyolysis.The concomitant use of PREVYMIS and certain drugs may result in potentially significant drug interactions, some of which may lead to adverse reactions (PREVYMIS or concomitant drugs) or reduced therapeutic effect of PREVYMIS or the concomitant drug.The rate of adverse events occurring in at least 10% of HSCT recipients treated with PREVYMIS and at a frequency at least 2% greater than placebo were nausea (27% vs 23%), diarrhea (26% vs 24%), vomiting (19% vs 14%), peripheral edema (14% vs 9%), cough (14% vs 10%), headache (14% vs 9%), fatigue (13% vs 11%), and abdominal pain (12% vs 9%).Hypersensitivity reaction, with associated moderate dyspnea, occurred in one HSCT recipient following the first infusion of IV PREVYMIS after switching from oral PREVYMIS, leading to treatment discontinuation.The most common adverse event occurring in at least 10% of kidney transplant recipients treated with PREVYMIS and at a frequency greater than valganciclovir was diarrhea (32% vs 29%).If PREVYMIS is co-administered with cyclosporine, the dosage of PREVYMIS should be decreased to 240 mg once daily.Co-administration of PREVYMIS may alter the plasma concentrations of other drugs and other drugs may alter the plasma concentrations of PREVYMIS. Consult the full Prescribing Information prior to and during treatment for potential drug interactions.Closely monitor serum creatinine levels in patients with CLcr less than 50 mL/min using PREVYMIS injection.PREVYMIS is not recommended for patients with severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment.The safety and efficacy of PREVYMIS in patients below 18 years of age have not been established.For patients with CLcr greater than 10 mL/min (by Cockcroft-Gault equation), no dosage adjustment of PREVYMIS is required based on renal impairment. The safety of PREVYMIS in patients with end-stage renal disease (CLcr less than 10 mL/min), including patients on dialysis, is unknown.Following the completion of PREVYMIS prophylaxis, monitoring for CMV reactivation in HSCT recipients is recommended.About PREVYMIS (letermovir)PREVYMIS inhibits viral replication by targeting the CMV DNA terminase complex. Since 2017, PREVYMIS has been the only drug approved in the United States for prophylaxis of CMV infection and disease in adults who are CMV-seropositive [R+] and have received an allogeneic HSCT and has also been approved for this indication in more than 60 countries including EU member states, Canada, Japan and China.

With this approval, KEYTRUDA has six indications in NSCLC, across both metastatic and earlier stages of NSCLC.The approval was based on data from the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-671 trial evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment followed by surgery and continued adjuvant treatment with KEYTRUDA as a single agent, for patients with resectable stage II, IIIA or IIIB (N2) NSCLC per the American Joint Committee on Cancer eighth edition (AJCC 8th edition). In the study, the KEYTRUDA regimen demonstrated statistically significant improvements in event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS), the study’s dual primary endpoints, versus neoadjuvant placebo plus chemotherapy followed by adjuvant placebo alone. The EFS results, which were from the first interim analysis, were published in June 2023 in the New England Journal of Medicine. The detailed OS results will be presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress 2023 in Madrid, Spain, on October 20, 2023.Adverse reactions occurring in patients with resectable NSCLC receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with platinum-containing chemotherapy, given as neoadjuvant treatment and continued as single agent adjuvant treatment, were generally similar to those occurring in patients across tumor types receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy.Story continuesImmune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue and can affect more than one body system simultaneously. Immune-mediated adverse reactions can occur at any time during or after treatment with KEYTRUDA, including pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis, dermatologic reactions, solid organ transplant rejection, and complications of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management of immune-mediated adverse reactions are essential to ensure safe use of KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab). Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, KEYTRUDA should be withheld or permanently discontinued and corticosteroids administered if appropriate. KEYTRUDA can also cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions. Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. For more information, see ""Selected Important Safety Information"" below.""There remains a need for treatment options to improve outcomes for patients with earlier stages of non-small cell lung cancer,"" said Dr. Heather Wakelee, principal investigator for KEYNOTE-671, thoracic medical oncologist and professor of medicine at Stanford University and past president of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC). ""This important milestone has the potential to change the current treatment paradigm for resectable non-small cell lung cancer that is greater than four centimeters or has lymph node involvement, by offering an immunotherapy-based regimen that has demonstrated statistically significant improvements in overall survival and event-free survival compared to a placebo and chemotherapy regimen.""""KEYTRUDA continues to change the way non-small cell lung cancer is treated across earlier and metastatic disease regardless of PD-L1 expression,"" said Dr. Marjorie Green, senior vice president and head of late-stage oncology, global clinical development, Merck Research Laboratories. ""This approval marks a pivotal moment for the lung cancer community by providing certain patients with earlier stages of non-small cell lung cancer and healthcare providers with an important new treatment option.""The approval marks the sixth NSCLC indication for KEYTRUDA. The five other indications for KEYTRUDA in NSCLC include:1) in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations;2) in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or paclitaxel protein-bound for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC;3) as a single agent for the first-line treatment of patients with NSCLC expressing PD-L1 [tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥1%] as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations and is stage III where patients are not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation, or metastatic;4) as a single agent for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving KEYTRUDA; and5) as a single agent for adjuvant treatment following resection and platinum-based chemotherapy for adult patients with stage IB (T2a ≥4 cm), II, or IIIA NSCLC.Study designKEYNOTE-671 is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03425643) evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, followed by surgery and continued adjuvant treatment with KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) as a single agent, versus placebo plus neoadjuvant chemotherapy, followed by resection and adjuvant placebo, in patients with resectable stage II, IIIA or IIIB (N2) NSCLC per the AJCC eighth edition. Patients were enrolled regardless of tumor PD-L1 expression. Patients with active autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within two years of treatment, a medical condition that required immunosuppression or a history of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis that required steroids were ineligible. Randomization was stratified by stage (II vs. III), tumor PD-L1 expression (TPS ≥50% or &lt;50%), histology (squamous vs. nonsquamous), and geographic region (East Asia vs. non-East Asia).The study enrolled 797 patients who were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either:Neoadjuvant KEYTRUDA 200 mg intravenously (IV) every three weeks on Day 1 in combination with cisplatin 75 mg/m2 IV on Day 1 and either pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 IV on Day 1 or gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 IV on Days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle for up to four cycles. Within 4-12 weeks following surgery, KEYTRUDA (200 mg) was administered every three weeks for up to 13 cycles, or;Neoadjuvant placebo IV every three weeks on Day 1 in combination with cisplatin 75 mg/m2 IV on Day 1 and either pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 IV on Day 1 or gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 IV on Days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle for up to four cycles. Within 4‑12 weeks following surgery, placebo was administered every three weeks for up to 13 cycles.Treatment with KEYTRUDA or placebo continued until completion of the treatment (17 cycles), disease progression that precluded definitive surgery, disease recurrence in the adjuvant phase, disease progression for those who did not undergo surgery or had incomplete resection and entered the adjuvant phase, or unacceptable toxicity. Assessment of tumor status was performed at baseline, Week 7, and Week 13 in the neoadjuvant phase and within four weeks prior to the start of the adjuvant phase. Following the start of the adjuvant phase, assessment of tumor status was performed every 16 weeks through the end of Year 3, and then every six months thereafter. The trial was not designed to isolate the effect of KEYTRUDA in each phase (neoadjuvant or adjuvant) of treatment.The main efficacy outcome measures were OS and investigator-assessed EFS. Additional efficacy outcome measures were pathological complete response (pCR) rate and major pathological response (mPR) rate as assessed by blinded independent pathology review (BIPR).Eighty-one percent of patients in the KEYTRUDA in combination with platinum-containing chemotherapy arm had definitive surgery compared to 76% of patients in the placebo in combination with platinum-containing chemotherapy arm.About lung cancerLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. In 2020 alone, there were more than 2.2 million new cases and approximately 1.8 million deaths from lung cancer globally. Non-small cell lung cancer is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for about 81% of all cases. In the U.S., the overall five-year survival rate for patients diagnosed with lung cancer is 25%, which is a 21% improvement over the last five years. Improved survival rates are due, in part, to advances in diagnostic and surgical procedures, as well as the introduction of new therapies. However, screening and early detection remain an important unmet need, as 44% of lung cancer cases are not found until they are advanced. Only 5.8% of people in the U.S. who are eligible were screened for lung cancer.About Merck’s research in lung cancerMerck is advancing research aimed at transforming the way lung cancer is treated, with a goal of improving outcomes for patients affected by this deadly disease. Through nearly 200 clinical trials evaluating more than 36,000 patients around the world, Merck is at the forefront of lung cancer research. In NSCLC, KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) has six approved U.S. indications (see indications below) and is approved for advanced disease in more than 95 countries. Among Merck’s research efforts are trials focused on evaluating KEYTRUDA in earlier stages of lung cancer as well as identifying new combinations and coformulations with KEYTRUDA.About Merck’s early-stage cancer clinical programFinding cancer at an earlier stage may give patients a greater chance of long-term survival. Many cancers are considered most treatable and potentially curable in their earliest stage of disease. Building on the strong understanding of the role of KEYTRUDA in later-stage cancers, Merck is studying KEYTRUDA in earlier disease states, with approximately 20 ongoing registrational studies across multiple types of cancer.About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mgKEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.Selected KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S.Non-Small Cell Lung CancerKEYTRUDA, in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.KEYTRUDA, in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or paclitaxel protein-bound, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC.KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab), as a single agent, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with NSCLC expressing PD-L1 [tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥1%] as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations, and is:stage III where patients are not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation, ormetastatic.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving KEYTRUDA.KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with resectable (tumors ≥4 cm or node positive) NSCLC in combination with platinum-containing chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment, and then continued as a single agent as adjuvant treatment after surgery.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated as adjuvant treatment following resection and platinum-based chemotherapy for adult patients with stage IB (T2a ≥4 cm), II, or IIIA NSCLC.See additional selected indications for KEYTRUDA in the U.S. after the Selected Important Safety InformationSelected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDASevere and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsKEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the PD-1 or the PD-L1, blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.Immune-Mediated PneumonitisKEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution.Pneumonitis occurred in 7% (41/580) of adult patients with resected NSCLC who received KEYTRUDA as a single agent for adjuvant treatment of NSCLC, including fatal (0.2%), Grade 4 (0.3%), and Grade 3 (1%) adverse reactions. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 1 day to 2.3 months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 26 (4.5%) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 54% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 63% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 71% had resolution.Immune-Mediated ColitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients.Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated HepatitisKEYTRUDA as a Single AgentKEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients.KEYTRUDA With AxitinibKEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT ≥3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT ≥3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both. All patients with a recurrence of ALT ≥3 ULN subsequently recovered from the event.Immune-Mediated EndocrinopathiesAdrenal InsufficiencyKEYTRUDA can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 77% (17/22) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.3% (8) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.HypophysitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism. Initiate hormone replacement as indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.2%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 94% (16/17) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Hypophysitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) in 0.1% (4) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.Thyroid DisordersKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated thyroid disorders. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism. Initiate hormone replacement for hypothyroidism or institute medical management of hyperthyroidism as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab), including Grade 2 (0.3%). None discontinued, but KEYTRUDA was withheld in &lt;0.1% (1) of patients.Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (0.8%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (2) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. Hypothyroidism occurred in 8% (237/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (6.2%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.5% (14) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. The majority of patients with hypothyroidism required long-term thyroid hormone replacement.

The reactions resolved in 79% of the 38 patients.Other Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsThe following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of &lt;1% (unless otherwise noted) in patients who received KEYTRUDA or were reported with the use of other anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions. Cardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; Ocular: Uveitis, iritis and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica; Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism; Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection.Infusion-Related ReactionsKEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple MyelomaIn trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality.

Merck’s Keytruda continuously grows and expands into new indications and markets globally.Keytruda, the key revenue generator for Merck, is already approved for treating many cancers globally. In the first half of 2023, Merck recorded $12.1 billion in sales from Keytruda, up 20% year over year.

(NYSE:MRK) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Merck The MethodWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$18.8bUS$21.1bUS$20.2bUS$21.2bUS$21.8bUS$22.4bUS$23.0bUS$23.5bUS$24.1bUS$24.6bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x8Analyst x3Analyst x3Est @ 2.88%Est @ 2.66%Est @ 2.51%Est @ 2.40%Est @ 2.32%Est @ 2.27% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.2% US$17.7kUS$18.8kUS$16.9kUS$16.7kUS$16.2kUS$15.7kUS$15.1kUS$14.6kUS$14.1kUS$13.6k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$159bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$25b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.2%– 2.2%) = US$629bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$629b÷ ( 1 + 6.2%)10= US$346bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$506b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$104, the company appears quite undervalued at a 48% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Merck as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for MerckStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Pharmaceuticals market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatDividends are not covered by earnings.Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Merck, we've compiled three important items you should further examine:Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 4 warning signs  with Merck , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Management:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for MRK's future outlook?

That could be a factor affecting demand,"" TD Cowen analyst Cai von Rumohr said. ""It is a cyclical business after all.""Marquee names such as Bombardier, Textron, Embraer and Boeing are expected to showcase their latest models at the show, according to the NBAA.Textron took the wraps off its newest Cessna Citation CJ3 Gen2 business jet on Monday, while Embraer unveiled its Phenom 100EX business jet, its latest aircraft in the Phenom 100 series, last week.""We're happy with the conversations we're having with our customers and are looking forward to a great show,"" a Textron Aviation spokesperson said in an emailed statement.Bombardier also said on Monday it will detail flight testing progress for its Global 8000 aircraft, which it says will be the world's fastest business jet.""We continue to see growing demand globally for our BBJ (Boeing Business Jets) family of airplanes,"" Boeing said.Story continuesOn Sunday, engine maker Honeywell estimated a 10% growth in new business jet deliveries in 2024 and joined several planemakers in emphasizing the strength of global demand for new business jets.As a pure-play business jet provider with financial leverage, Bombardier is most exposed to any weakness in demand, followed by Textron, J.P.Morgan analyst Seth Seifman said in a note.Manufacturers are expected to continue reporting robust backlogs and book-to-bill ratios above 1.00, though likely not as strong as those seen 12 to 18 months ago, said Adam Cowburn, managing director at Alton Aviation Consultancy.The book-to-bill ratio is an indication of future demand and a ratio of over 1 is considered healthy.Cowburn said he expects the market will eventually settle at levels that are structurally around 15% higher than pre-COVID levels.Meanwhile, industry watchers expect new jet orders to be announced at the NBAA event. Private jet company Flexjet is expected to place a large order and analysts expect Bombardier will be the likely winner.""Textron, Dassault Falcon and Bombardier are most likely to announce fleet orders given their relatively strong positions with fractional program customers,"" said Rolland Vincent, a consultant and founder of business aviation forecasting service JetNet.Fractional ownership is an arrangement in which multiple owners share the use and costs of purchasing and operating a private aircraft.However, General Dynamics' Gulfstream Aerospace, a major business jet manufacturer, said on Monday that it is not participating in the event.(Reporting by Mehr Bedi in Bengaluru; Editing by Pooja Desai)]"

PWR has been benefiting from enduring demand in its target markets and the robust performance of its fundamental operations. The company has been effectively leveraging megatrends to take the lead in driving the transition toward sustainable energy solutions and facilitating technological advancements. The year 2023 exhibits widespread growth opportunities, with continuous growth opportunities for infrastructure solutions.Quanta stock has gained 21.7% year to date (YTD), outperforming the Zacks Engineering - R and D Services industry’s 13.9% growth. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock is also expected to gain from prudent growth strategies and accretive acquisitions.Although project delays, supply chain risks and oil &amp; gas volatility are major concerns, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has witnessed an uptrend over the past 60 days as analysts raised their estimates. Over the said time frame, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share (EPS) of $7.08 for 2023 has increased from $7.06. The estimated figure indicates 11.7% year-over-year growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s take a look at the factors supporting the growth.Solid Backlog: The company ended the second quarter with a total record backlog of $27.2 billion and a 12-month backlog of $15.64 billion. This compares favorably with the December 2022-end’s 12-month backlog of $13.79 billion and the total backlog of $24.09 billion. The reported metrics were also up from the year-ago respective figures of $11.58 billion and $19.85 billion. This underscores the resilience of its fundamental operations, showcasing the company's core strength. Quanta holds a positive outlook for its future, driven by its growing backlog, which is expected to remain healthy and continue to expand. Quanta envisions delivering a more than 15% adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate through 2026.Decarbonization Efforts: Quanta is anticipated to enjoy the benefits of its engagement in diverse technological solutions aimed at advancing decarbonization initiatives. These encompass various domains, including carbon management and mitigation, compliance consulting, as well as the full spectrum of infrastructure necessary to support carbon-neutral energy solutions. Quanta has been strategically positioned to capitalize on major trends driving the energy transition and fostering technological advancements. Notably, initiatives like the expansion of electric vehicle charging infrastructure and the undergrounding of electrical infrastructure are gaining significant traction, further contributing to the company's growth prospects.Acquisitions: Quanta considers acquisitions as a pivotal element of its strategy to augment its market presence and expand its order backlog. In January 2023, Quanta completed the acquisition of three companies. One of these specializes in providing services related to high-voltage transmission lines, overhead and underground distribution, emergency restoration, and industrial and commercial wiring and lighting. This acquisition primarily strengthens Quanta's presence in the Electric Power sector. Another acquired company offers solutions in the field of concrete construction services, bolstering Quanta's capabilities in both the Electric Power and Renewable Energy segments. The third acquisition involves a business focused on procuring components, assembling kits for sale, managing logistics, and installing solar tracking equipment for utility and development clients, primarily enhancing Quanta's operations within the Renewable Energy segment.Story continues3 Other Top-Ranked Construction Stocks Hogging in the LimelightToll Brothers, Inc.

226,878da073-0f33-317e-889b-00f5f7c3e9c2,PWR,2023-10-17,7 Infrastructure Stocks to Snap Up as Government Spending Jumps,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-infrastructure-stocks-snap-government-201741254.html,1696969061,STORY,"['GBX', 'VMC', 'XYL', 'CAT', 'PWR']","[For the second straight year, American states will receive huge amounts of money allocated by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. For example,  New York state is getting $2.76 billion for the current fiscal year, Vermont is receiving $329 million, and Oregon is obtaining $757 million. Most of these funds will be used to bankroll traditional transportation projects, such as roads, bridges, and tunnels.Meanwhile, the Department of Transportation is devoting  $1.4 billion to improving the nation’s “rail infrastructure.” U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell announced on Sept. 25. that the funds would be spent on “70 projects across the nation to improve rail safety, strengthen supply chains and passenger rail service.”And just last week, the Environmental Protection Agency allocated $7.5 billion for “low-interest loans” which will finance the development of  “infrastructure for drinking water, wastewater and stormwater projects.” Here are seven infrastructure stocks that should get big boosts from all of this government spending.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsVulcan Materials Company (VMC)The Vulcan Materials (VMC) website is displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: madamF / Shutterstock.comVulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC) provides various materials used in construction, including asphalt, concrete, sand, and gravel. The company is poised to  get a big boost from the many extra tens of billions of dollars that will be spent by American states on building highways, bridges, streets and tunnels over the next year.Likely partially driven by state governments’ huge spending on infrastructure last year, VMC’s “mix adjusted sales price” climbed 15% last quarter versus the same period a year earlier, and the firm reported that it expected strong price increases to boost its “profitability” going forward.VMC added that the “cash gross profit” of its asphalt business “nearly tripled (year-over-year)…to $66 million.” Governments’ elevated spending on traditional infrastructure had a major impact on the profits of VMC’s asphalt unit.Story continuesOverall, VMC’s EBITDA, excluding certain items, soared to $595 million last quarter from $450 million during the same period a year earlier.Given VMC’s strong growth and excellent prospects, the company’s forward price-earnings ratio of 26 is quite attractive.Given these points, it is one of the best infrastructure stocks to buy.Greenbrier (GBX)The Greenbrier Companies (GBX)logo on the website homepageSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comA leading provider of equipment for trains, Greenbrier (NYSE:GBX) can benefit in two ways from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. First, as I mentioned in the introduction, Washington is going to spend $1.4 billion on measures to  “improve rail safety…and passenger rail service.”  A portion of those funds should find their way into GBX’s accounts.Secondly,  because “railroads haul components used in construction,” Greenbrier should get more orders as a result of Washington’s spending on roads, bridges, and tunnels.Aside from government funds, GBX is also likely getting a boost from the onshoring trend, which has resulted in record spending on factory construction.Greenbrier recently announced that it had received an impressive total of $1.9 billion in orders last quarter.Quanta Services (PWR)An image of a man charging an electric car with icons for renewable energy sources in the background; renewable energy gridSource: petovarga/ShutterstockAs I noted in a previous column, “Quanta (NYSE:PWR) builds…electrical power stations, (and) facilities for renewable energy and natural gas transmission.” It also provides “infrastructure” for electric utilities.PWR should get a significant portion of the $14 billion allocated by the Infrastructure Law “for enhancing the reliability, resilience, and efficiency of the electric grid.”And as I noted in my prior article, PWR is also benefiting tremendously from the energy transition. For example, it was chosen to play a major role in two multi-billion dollar renewable energy projects in the Western U.S.: SunZia Wind  and SunZia Transmission.Last quarter, the company’s net income jumped to $165.9 million from $88 million during the same period a year earlier.Given the company’s rapid profit growth, its forward price-earnings ratio of 20 times is quite low.Sterling Infrastructure (STRL)Cars on an urban highway driving into the sunsetSource: Anna Kraynova / ShutterstockTexas-based Sterling (NASDAQ:STRL) carries out “infrastructure and rehabilitation projects for highways, roads, bridges, airports, ports, light rail, water, wastewater, and storm drainage systems” on behalf of various governments.As a result, the company is well-positioned to benefit from multiple parts of the Infrastructure Law, including the funds that will be spent by states on roads and highways, the $7.5 billion that Washington will provide to enhance water infrastructure, and the $1.4 billion that it’s spending on improving “rail infrastructure.”Last quarter, Sterling’s top line jumped 13% year-over-year to $522 million, while its net income soared 40% YOY to $49.5 million.On July 21, Sterling announced that it had been awarded a large portion of a $216 million “design-build contract….by the Utah Department of Transportation.”I believe that Sterling will also get a boost from Texas’ rapid population growth and resulting need for new and wider roads.Xylemxylem appSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comXylem (NYSE:XYL) “engages in the design, manufacture, and servicing of engineered products and solutions for the water and wastewater applications.”  As a result, the company should get a lift from the $7.5 billion that Washington will provide to bankroll improved “infrastructure for drinking water, wastewater and stormwater projects.”Earlier this year, Xylem acquired Evoqua, another company in the water infrastructure sector which I wrote about in an August 2022 column. On Evoqua’s Q3 earnings call, its CEO predicted that the firm would start to obtain revenue from the Infrastructure Law in the second half of 2023. Consequently, I expect Xylem to get a major boost from the legislation in upcoming quarters.In the wake of Xylem’s acquisition of Evoqua, investment bank Robert Baird upgraded the stock to “outperform.” The bank believes that XYL can “outperform” in any sort of economy while it is well-positioned to increase its profits.Granite Construction (GVA)Railroad tracks with a junctionSource: ShutterstockGranite (NYSE:GVA) carries out the construction of roads, bridges, and rail lines. It also provides materials, such as asphalt, used in construction and implements water improvement projects.Of course, GVA is very well-positioned to benefit from multiple portions of the Infrastructure Law,  including Washington’s investments in roads, bridges, railroads, and water infrastructure.In August, Granite announced that it had been selected to carry out a $73 million water improvement project in Utah.Last quarter, the company’s top line jumped 17% year-over-year to $899 million, while its earnings per share, excluding certain one-time items, gained  $12 million versus Q2 of 2022  to $46 million.Caterpillar (CAT)Image of a yellow construction vehicle with the Caterpillar (CAT) logo on itSource: astudio / Shutterstock.comCaterpillar (NYSE:CAT) sells construction equipment such as excavators, haulers, backhoes, and bulldozers.As a result, the company should get a lift from Washington’s huge spending on building roads, bridges, and tunnels. Additionally, the firm should be helped by the current record spending on building factories amid the onshoring trend.Moreover, CAT sells equipment used to search for and extract oil, so the company should get a lift from the current high oil prices.In the second quarter, CAT’s revenue jumped 22% year-over-year to $17.3 billion, while its earnings per share soared to $5.67 from $3.13 during the same period a year earlier.Given the company’s strong growth and excellent prospects, its forward price-earnings ratio of 13 is quite low.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

229,e896ae2e-f95b-3d95-810f-0aa51170cfce,CI,2023-10-17,Here's How Much a $1000 Investment in Cigna Made 10 Years Ago Would Be Worth Today,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-much-1000-investment-cigna-123005246.html,1697459405,STORY,['CI'],"[For most investors, how much a stock's price changes over time is important. This factor can impact your investment portfolio as well as help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.Another factor that can influence investors is FOMO, or the fear of missing out, especially with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Cigna (CI) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to CI for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Cigna's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Cigna's main business drivers.Headquartered in Bloomfield, CT and formed in 1982, Cigna Corporation has rebranded itself as The Cigna Group. The company was formed as a result of a merger between Connecticut General Life Insurance Company and Insurance Company of North America. Cigna completed its combination with Express Scripts Holding Company by 2018-end. Shares of the new combined company trade on the NYSE under the stock ticker symbol “CI.”The global health company has also announced rebranding of its segments - Cigna Healthcare and Evernorth Health Services.The role of the health benefits provider of the company will be fulfilled by Cigna Healthcare, which will cater to customers and clients through its U.S. Commercial, U.S. Government and International Health businesses. Meanwhile, the newly named Evernorth Health Services will be the pharmacy, care and benefits solutions provider of the company.Till the 2022-end, the company’s reportable segments were as follows:Evernorth Health Services (constitutes 75.7% of adjusted total segment revenues in 2022) includes a broad range of coordinated and point solution health services, including pharmacy services, benefits management, care solutions and data and analytics, which are provided to health plans, employers, government organizations, and health care providers.Cigna Healthcare (24.3%): The segment comprises of Cigna's U.S. Commercial, U.S. Government, and International Health businesses that provide comprehensive medical and coordinated solutions to clients and customers.Story continuesBottom LinePutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For Cigna, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in October 2013 would be worth $3,832.79, or a 283.28% gain, as of October 16, 2023, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.Compare this to the S&amp;P 500's rally of 154.10% and gold's return of 44.75% over the same time frame.Looking ahead, analysts are expecting more upside for CI.Cigna's revenues have been increasing consistently for the past few years, driven by acquisitions, superior operating performance and a high-quality product portfolio. Business streamlining by divesting its non-core businesses helps it to focus on core growth areas. Increasing membership on the back of a diversified portfolio, wide agent network and superior service are major positives. The company has been resorting to prudent capital deployment moves through share repurchases and dividend payments. For 2023, it expects adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to be at least $24.70, up 6.1% from 2022. CI's shares have outperformed the industry in the past year. However, high leverage can affect its financial flexibility. Also, rising operating costs might dent the company's margins. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.The stock is up 7.72% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 2 higher, for fiscal 2023.

231,f76a7e03-0dd5-374a-874e-5ef58b8e65e8,TEL,2023-10-17,13 Technology Stocks To Buy That Are Too Cheap To Ignore,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/13-technology-stocks-buy-too-191044075.html,1697483444,STORY,"['TEL', 'TSM', 'ST', 'QCOM', 'MCHP', 'AMAT', 'LDOS', 'FLEX', 'GEN']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 13 technology stocks to buy that are cheap to ignore. If you want to skip our analysis of the technology industry, then take a look at 5 Technology Stocks To Buy That Are Too Cheap To Ignore. Technology has proven to be the most remarkable industry of our age since it has virtually (no pun intended) transformed every aspect of modern day living. We've written this article using technology, you're using technology to read this article, and the stocks that everyone is trading are now available through digital mediums that would have been unimaginable just a couple of decades back.Before we get to the financial bit about the technology industry it's important to understand what the term actually means. Due to its near ubiquity in modern day living, technology is simply defined as the use of knowledge involving technical processes to achieve an objective. In a broad definition, this adaptability of technical processes to different use cases naturally affects a lot of different walks of life. At its very heart, technology can also be defined as using an electronic system to speed up data collection, analysis, and computation - three things that can power anything from the iPhone to a data center, an airplane, or a car.Since computing sits at the heart of technology, one of the most important segments of the technology industry is the semiconductor sector. A semiconductor is a small piece of silicon with circuits made of different materials printed on top of it. The smaller these circuits get, the greater the semiconductor's performance since small feature sizes lead to greater power savings and electrical conductivity. This criticality of semiconductors, also called chips, to the global technological landscape has also made semiconductors one of the most controversial and risky industries these days.This is because the high end technologies involved in making chips coupled with the billions of dollars in capital expenditure needed to set up a new chip manufacturing plant mean that the barriers of entry to this industry are among the highest in the world and stand in parallel to other high tech sectors such as rocket and aircraft manufacturing. Consequently, only three companies in the world, namely the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), and Samsung Electronics can make the latest chips, with others limited to older models. Out of these, only TSMC and Samsung sell their chips to third party customers such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) since Intel only makes and sells its own chips.Story continuesWhy is this important? Well, TSMC is the biggest contract chip manufacturer in the world in terms of volume and all of its advanced chip manufacturing facilities are located in the disputed island of Taiwan. Taiwan and China share a common history, and Beijing considers it an integral part of its territory even though Taiwan has its own passport and holds its own elections. Therefore, the island's status is a cause of significant friction between China and the Western rules based order led by the United States, and one of the biggest worries in the chip sector is that a potential conflict in China can disrupt the global semiconductor supply chain to lead to unimaginable consequences.The potential repercussions of such a conflict are so significant that they even made the well known Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway to change his mind. Mr. Buffett's investment firm made headlines at the end of last year as its filings with the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) revealed that it had bought a whopping 60 million TSMC shares for a $4.1 billion investment for its third quarter of 2022 investments. Since Mr. Buffett takes his sweet time before investing, the decision suggested that TSMC could do nothing wrong. However, in the very next quarter, Berkshire Hathaway reduced its stake by an equally stunning $3.5 billion and disposed off of the shares entirely in the succeeding quarter. The $3.5 billion reduction made waves in the industry as speculation started to become rife about the reason behind the Oracle of Omaha's sudden shift of mood.Mr. Buffett explained his decision soon, sharing that he believes that TSMC is a solid company but the firm's geopolitical risks simply proved too much to ignore. According to CNN which quotes several of his statements:“I feel better about the capital that we’ve got deployed in Japan than in Taiwan,” the Berkshire Hathaway chairman added. “I wish it weren’t sold, but I think that’s a reality.”Despite the share sale, Buffett lauded TSMC as “one of the best-managed companies and [most] important companies in the world.”“There’s no one in the chip industry that’s in their league, at least in my view,” he said.“Marvelous people and marvelous competitive position and everything, [but] I’d rather find it in the United States.”Buffett said his reassessment of the company was in “light of certain things that were going on.” He had previously pointed to geopolitical tensions as a concern.Before we get to our latest pick of the cheapest technology stocks, it's also important to briefly consider the current investment climate for these stocks. The technology sector is a growth industry that depends on robust purchasing power for both businesses and consumers as well as easy access to capital due to expensive products and services. These days, technology stocks are under pressure as high rates and troubling economic data have dampened investors' risk appetites. Therefore, the major catalysts for the sector as a whole are announcements regarding interest rate cuts as well as economic growth since a slowing economy sees capital fly to safety in sectors such as consumer defensive.So, time to look at some great cheap technology stocks, and some notable picks are QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM).13 Technology Stocks To Buy That Are Too Cheap To IgnoreA Wall Street trader on the phone, quickly executing a technology-driven trade.

Its net interest income, which measures the difference between what it makes on its loans and pays for its deposits, rose 4% year over year.Its trading and investment banking revenues were also up, a sign that a slump in dealmaking is starting to thaw.CEO Brian Moynihan said: ""We did this in a healthy but slowing economy that saw US consumer spending still ahead of last year but continuing to slow.""Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan.

Well, earnings season picking up steam this week with results from Goldman Sachs and Bank of America due Tuesday. The reports following solid results from their Wall Street peers last week. But despite upbeat results from J.P. Morgan, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo on Friday, the bank's top executives are warning of potentially challenging times ahead.J.P. Morgan CEO, Jamie Dimon, said in the company's latest earnings call, quote, that, ""This may be the most dangerous time the world has seen in decades as the bank continues to prepare for a broad range of outcomes that was in the results."" And also Citigroup CEO, Jane Fraser, saying that the recent macro headwinds have made a clear impact on investor sentiment.Let's talk about that. And we want to bring in Ben Eisen. He is a reporter with ""The Wall Street Journal."" Ben, it's good to see you. So the results here from many of the large banks that we have heard from so far are actually pretty solid, but comparing that to the tone and some of the messaging that we're hearing from diamond and what we heard from Charlie Scharf and Jane Fraser. I guess what was your-- what's your assessment so far of earnings this season and how banks are positioned, given some of that gloom and doom outlook to some extent?Story continuesBEN EISEN: Well, I think what you're seeing is that a lot of the bank executives are sort of signaling that we're kind of at a crossroads at this point. You have consumer spending, which has continued to hold up. Consumers and businesses have been really healthier than pretty much anyone had expected, given all the interest rate increases that we've seen.But we're starting to see some of the kind of downside of higher rates pop up, which is that you have loan losses starting to rise, you have demand cooling for loans. You have just some of the friction that comes from higher interest rates is kind of starting to hit us at this point. And, you know, to be fair all these executives have been sort of calling for a slowdown for some time now, and we haven't really seen that yet. But, you know, as we get further and further along into this kind of era of higher interest rates that we've seen, we are kind of seeing some of that slowdown come.BRAD SMITH: Well, yeah, and one of the other factors as well here that we had started to see reported is delinquencies, even on those loan payments as well. With all of that considered and what Jamie Dimon J.P. Morgan CEO and chairman had to say about consumers right now and tracking where they're spending down and some of the excess cash buffers they have starting to dwindle or diminish here even more so, what do you extrapolate from how much longer consumers can face this type of pressure?BEN EISEN: You know, it really remains to be seen. When you think back to the pandemic and all of the economic stimulus that the government handed out to consumers, it really gave a lot of people a very hefty cash cushion. And it's taken a lot longer than most anybody has expected for that to get spent down. Now, you are starting to see people spend down that money, and you have higher inflation, which is kind of causing everything to cost more.So it really-- it kind of depends who you ask, whether or not we are kind of getting to that point where those extra pandemic savings are getting depleted. But you know, the further and further along we get-- we get from that period of time, the more those dwindle. So you know, it really only gets tougher from here.- Ben headcount is another thing that many analysts are keeping a close eye on. Not only when it comes to the big banks, but obviously many industries at large, but more specifically what we're hearing from banks so far. And I bring that up because PNC talked about the 4% reduction in their work force and the cost savings that they are potentially going to see as a result of that. Is this a trend that you expect to see this season, or maybe in the coming quarters among some of those smaller, more regional players?BEN EISEN: You know, I think we're already starting to see some of the cutbacks that are taking place. You've got some of the big banks have been cutting their staff for a while now for the last few quarters, and I think you probably will see headcount reductions being announced at a lot of the regional banks. PNC announced that they'd be cutting some staff on Friday, you know, and as the regional banks, which really are a lot more pressured than the big banks in this current period of time. They are going to be the ones that are going to have to take more drastic cost cutting actions.BRAD SMITH: And when you think about going forward from here for-- I mean, we've focused on a lot of the regional bank and the turmoil, the sentiment, that seems like it's in the rear view mirror to a certain extent, but maybe just because it's settled relative to the turmoil that we saw play out earlier this year, do you expect any of these companies, especially in an era of perhaps cost discipline, as it's come up in one report at least over the course of this earnings season, do you expect any of them to be thinking about further consolidation?BEN EISEN: You know, it's definitely something on people's minds. We haven't seen that much of it yet. But yes, so we've had this banking crisis that took place in the spring, and maybe the acute phase of it is over. You don't necessarily have the kind of bank runs that we saw in March, but then you have these companies where their business model has really been very challenged by these higher interest rates where they're paying more to hold on to deposits, and that really throws a wrench into their business model.So definitely banks that are, you know, maybe perceived as too small to make it on their own are going to be looking around. Whether or not that picks up, or when that picks up, we'll have to wait and see. I mean, you have a lot of kind of factors that will play into that.You know, we have new regulations capital rules that have been proposed, and, you know, there's sort of a-- regulators have a certain amount of skepticism towards certain consolidations and certain industries. So we'll have to wait and see how that all plays out. But it's definitely something that we would expect going forward.BRAD SMITH: Ben Eisen, Wall Street Journal reporter joining us here today to not just talk about the banks that have reported, but preview some that are set to come here. Ben, appreciate the time.BEN EISEN: Thank you.]"

Let's bring in Gerard Cassidy, RBC Capital Markets analyst. And Gerard, one of the kind of magical words that we've been looking for, at least as has come up through some of our previous discussions as we were looking for what would be the tenor of this earnings season was cost discipline. Is there a kind of a magic word or a general theme that you expect to prevail over the course of this earnings season?GERARD CASSIDY: Yes. There is, in our opinion, and that's all going to do with credit quality. And as you know, the single most important issue for any bank is the trends in credit quality. Now there's also been, of course, topics such as the unrealized bond losses in their bond portfolios and margin pressure that's developed because deposit rates have moved higher.But in the long run, or when we look out over the next 12 to 18 months, I think it's all going to be focused on credit quality, which today is actually quite strong.- But Gerard, is that something that you think can stay intact? And also going back to what you just mentioned there about deposit rates. We talk about the fact that many of the larger banks, obviously, in a better position to weather some of that headwind right now, but how does that position some of the smaller, more regional players?Story continuesGERARD CASSIDY: It's a good question because when you take a look at credit quality, obviously, we all know about the downtown office space in big urban markets, that's a real troubled market. Most of the smaller regional banks are not exposed to that market. They generally have higher exposures to commercial real estate, but it's not in those downtown large office buildings in our big urban markets.And on the deposit side, the real key question what we have to focus on is when does the Federal Reserve reach its terminal rate for Fed funds? Because over the last four tightening cycles, around five to six months following the terminal rate for Fed funds, deposit rates stopped going up, and that's real positive for the banks because what happens is the cash flows coming off of the asset side of the balance sheet from securities and loans are reinvested at higher yields, helping their net interest margin expand.So the key question, again, is, when will the Fed reach its terminal rate? And in the past, that's been a real catalyst for bank stocks to do better.- For banks, especially as you were mentioning, some of the dynamic that they're going through right now where you do have some of the banks that are kind of carrying the most wealthy client base in the assets under management, and you think about what Goldman is potentially going to say, especially given the outflows that we've started to see, at least for some of those bank customers that have said, you know what? I want to sit on the sidelines outside of some of my typical investments now, and, perhaps, go into cash or go into other asset types. Where do you expect that to show up in some of the financial performance?GERARD CASSIDY: I think you put your finger on it because that old expression cash is king I think is coming back, when you can earn over 5% on your cash sitting in a money market mutual fund. So I think what you're going to hear from Goldman and others that have the wealth management business is that the inflows are still strong, but they're moving more into cash like products that have lower margins. The push into equities is kind of softened, and so assets are moving higher, but they're moving more into cash. And we would expect to hear not only Goldman talk about that, but Morgan Stanley as well when they release their numbers this week.]"
239,0c3e25fc-bd5e-3530-b9de-57e6164fe74e,WFC,2023-10-17,Inside an Innovative Response to California’s Homelessness Crisis,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inside-innovative-response-california-homelessness-133000925.html,1697463000,STORY,['WFC'],"[Thousands of Californians experiencing homelessness now have homes through an initiative bringing together cities, affordable housing developers, and supporters like Wells Fargo.NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / October 16, 2023 / In a new apartment in the heart of Hollywood, Karrie and her cats Gentleman and Rosebud have made a home.In 2021, she was one of the first residents to move into a redevelopment project just steps away from the Dolby Theatre, home of the Oscars. Not long before then, a divorce and family strife left Karrie alone at a train station in the middle of the pandemic. The instability quickly left her without a home, an experience that reminded her of struggling through the foster system growing up.""I know exactly what a homeless person feels like, always going from place to place, getting moved out and put somewhere else,"" she said. ""I didn't want to be on the streets. I would go out every day to look for avenues to get help. … You can't even dream on the streets.""Karrie lived on the streets of Los Angeles for a week before outreach workers connected her with temporary housing. After a couple of months, she moved into the Orchid, a former Hollywood-themed hotel that was converted into permanent supportive housing via Project Homekey.The multibillion-dollar program allowed the state of California and its housing partners to buy and renovate hotels, motels, and other sites to combat the state's homelessness crisis.Suddenly, Karrie had her own fully furnished apartment. The rehabilitated double-suite room came complete with glassware in the kitchen and sheets for her new bed. Not only were there services like daily meals and art therapy in her building, but holiday spreads on Thanksgiving and presents on Christmas, too.""I felt like I was in a five-star hotel. From a cot to a king-sized bed. It was beautiful. How could you not want [that]?"" she said. ""I was in awe. Now I'm thinking, ‘Keep it clean and keep it beautiful.'""Story continuesWhat is Project Homekey and why does it work?Behind Karrie's journey to housing were a series of partners brought together by a hugely innovative mobilization to house people in California.Project Homekey cut through the red tape typical of affordable housing development by offering billions in federal funds to Los Angeles County, cities, and housing organizations across the state to redevelop existing sites, rather than build new projects. Affordable housing projects typically require five or more years of finding and buying a site and amassing money from a laundry list of sources.Geoffrey Moen, development director of the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles, or HACLA, one of the largest developers of Project Homekey housing, called it ""unheard of.""""It's so different from how housing gets financed in every other way it's done around the country,"" he said. ""[Homekey] is just very simple. And as a result, it allowed things to move very quickly and cut down costs tremendously.""The unprecedented efforts were designed to address an unprecedented crisis. More than 171,000 people experience homelessness in California, which make up 30% of the country's homelessness population and half of its unsheltered people, according to University of California San Francisco research published in June. Across the states, there's affordable housing for only about 1 in 4 extremely low-income households.The surge in funding and the homelessness crisis amid the pandemic meant housing partners were crunched to find and build Homekey communities. That's where Wells Fargo Foundation experts saw an opportunity to help.""We wanted to be in a place where we were helping the program and, therefore, helping the state to demonstrate that there are effective pathways for helping end someone's experience of homelessness,"" said Justine Gonzalez, vice president, Philanthropy &amp; Community Impact for Wells Fargo in Los Angeles.Through seven Project Homekey Accelerator Grants, Wells Fargo supported housing groups by funding their vetting of new housing sites and their deposits to acquire them. Several grants went to HACLA and PATH, an LA-based housing nonprofit. Such grants are part of Wells Fargo's broader commitment as The Bank of Doing to making housing more attainable for individuals and families in California and throughout the nation.Among the projects supported by the grants is the Orchid, which the two organizations partnered to create. Along with Wells Fargo's initial support, the project was possible because of Homekey capital grants. Ongoing expenses are covered through housing vouchers and a portion of residents' benefits and/or wages.""Project Homekey allowed us to be nimble, to think of creative solutions, and to find new ways to end homelessness,"" said Jennifer Hark Dietz, PATH CEO. ""The fact that we have existing buildings that could be retrofitted to bring more housing online faster than ever - that's hugely innovative for us.""A new foundationThe first two rounds of Homekey funded the creation of nearly 13,000 homes, giving thousands of people experiencing homelessness an opportunity to get back on their feet. Gonzalez noted that supporting initiatives such as Homekey helps make individuals, families, and the communities they live in more sustainable.""A home is very much the foundation for a household, a family, an individual's ability to thrive. Thriving can mean economic mobility, access to education, access to transportation resources,"" Gonzalez said. ""That home is really the base for helping to make those other types of wealth building and economic advancement opportunities available.""A permanent home gave Karrie the space to process what happened to her and move forward.""The love, the kindness, touched me. People don't realize how blessed they really are,"" she said. ""You can always change your [mindset] by focusing on positive things to get out of the mentality ditch you're in.""When she's not taking care of her cats and doing art therapy, Karrie volunteers with her church to connect others who are experiencing homelessness with resources and community.""There is hope out there for everybody,"" she said. ""I hope I can help others.""After losing housing and then living in temporary housing, Karrie found her home in Hollywood because of California's Project Homekey program.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Wells Fargo on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Wells FargoWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/wells-fargoEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Wells FargoView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/793351/inside-an-innovative-response-to-californias-homelessness-crisis]"

I will now turn the call over to Charlie.Charles Scharf: Thanks very much, John. I'll make some brief comments about our third quarter results and update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review third quarter results in more detail before we take your questions. Let me start with some third quarter highlights. Our results reflected the progress we're making to improve our financial performance. Revenue, pretax provision profit, net income, diluted earnings per common share and ROTCE were all higher than a year ago. Our revenue reflected strong net interest income growth as well as higher noninterest income as we benefited from higher rates and the investments we're making in our businesses. Our expenses declined from a year ago due to lower operating losses.Story continuesAs expected, net charge-offs have continued to increase from historical low levels, and we increased our allowance for credit losses primarily driven by our office portfolio as well as growth in our credit card portfolio. Average commercial and consumer loans were both down from the second quarter as higher rates and a slowing economy have weakened loan demand, and we've continued to take some credit tightening actions. Average deposits also declined from the second quarter and a year ago driven by consumer spending as well as customers migrating to higher-yielding alternatives. Consumer spending remains strong with third quarter year-over-year growth rates for both credit and debit card spending increasing from the second quarter. Now let me update you on the progress we're making on our strategic priorities, starting with risk and control work, which remains our top priority.As time goes on, we continue to make the progress necessary to complete our work. I've said that we have detailed project plans which track interim deliverables, not just the date the work is to be finalized and turned over to the regulators for validation. The work is not finalized all at once. It's not as if there's a big bang conversion at the conclusion of a big body of work. It's just the opposite. Building our risk and control framework is a continuous ongoing effort. We are implementing changes throughout the life of the project, and we track effectiveness along the way. The numerous internal metrics we track show that the work is clearly improving our control environment, but we will not be satisfied until all of our work is complete.We remain focused on the work ahead even as we are making progress. But I will repeat what I've said in the past: regulatory pressure on banks with long-standing issues such as ours continues to grow. And until we complete our work and until it is validated by our regulators, we remain at risk of further regulatory actions. Additionally, until our work is complete, we could find new issues that need to be remediated, and these may result in additional regulatory actions. We also continued to take steps to advance our business strategy, which includes focusing on our core business and customers. We sold approximately $2 billion of private equity investments in certain Norwest Equity Partners and Norwest Mezzanine Partners funds. We are also making a number of investments to better serve our customers.As a leader in U.S. middle-market and asset-based lending, we're focused on finding ways to support our clients with the recently announced strategic relationship with Centerbridge Partners. Our middle-market clients will have greater access to alternative sources of capital that can be used to pursue a broader set of growth and value-creation initiatives across a variety of market conditions. Branches continue to play an important role in the way we serve our customers, and we continue to optimize our network, but we also look at targeted expansions in markets where we see opportunities for our franchise. Last week, we announced we are expanding our branch network in Chicago, where we only have 7 branches today. We also continue to make enhancements to our mobile app.And in the third quarter, we launched Stock Fractions, giving Wells trade clients the ability to buy fractions of company's stocks to help build a diversified portfolio regardless of stock price. Just yesterday, we announced the expanded availability of LifeSync to all consumer customers. Available on the mobile app, LifeSync is our personalized digital approach to aligning customers' goals with their money and was launched to all Wealth and Investment Management clients earlier this year. Customers' goals entered in LifeSync will be visible to bankers to enhance need-based conversations. We also expanded the capabilities of Fargo, our AI-powered virtual assistant and recently added the ability for customers to communicate with Fargo in Spanish.These enhanced capabilities are just the latest of our ongoing investments to deliver seamless and consistent experiences across all our channels. We are seeing more mobile adoption momentum, adding over 520,000 mobile active users in the third quarter, our best quarterly growth since first quarter of 2021. We've also continued to make important hires who bring expertise to Wells Fargo and businesses we're looking to grow. Before I highlight some of our new leaders, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Bill Daley, Vice Chairman of Public Affairs, who's retiring at the end of this year for all he has accomplished since he joined the company in 2019. Bill has been an invaluable asset to the company, and we benefited from his long experience in both the public and private sectors.During this time at Wells Fargo, he helped strengthen our relationships with communities we serve, established new programs in housing and small business, and worked to rebuild our reputation both locally and nationally. I'm pleased to have announced that Tom Nides joined Wells Fargo as Vice Chairman earlier this month. Tom will be a close adviser to the senior management team on a range of issues, and we will work alongside our business leaders as we continue to expand our relationships with clients. The breadth of Tom's experience across the public and private sectors will be an important asset to us as we continue to move the company ahead. We continue to invest in our Corporate Investment Banking business with new co-heads of equity capital markets.These new hires complement the other important hires we've been making over the past year. We also hired a new Head of Trust Services and Chief Fiduciary Officer in our Wealth and Investment Management segment and a new Head of Affluent and Premier Banking in consumer, small and business banking. We also continue to focus on better serving our communities. During the third quarter, we published 3 reports that provided overview of the work we are doing to build a sustainable, inclusive future in communities we serve; outline our strategic approach to managing the risks associated with climate change in deploying capital to support the transition to a low-carbon economy; and describe our methodology for aligning our financial portfolios with pathways to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and presenting interim emissions-based targets to track that alignment.We continue to make progress on our special-purpose credit program initiative we announced last year to help drive economic growth, sustainable homeownership and neighborhood stability in minority communities. We recently expanded our special-purpose refinance offers to prequalified Hispanic customers with Wells Fargo mortgages to refinance at a lower than market rate. The program launched last year for Black or African American customers has seen strong results, and the Hispanic offer has shown similar levels of customer engagement. We also announced that we're offering a $10,000 homebuyer access grant that will be applied towards down payment for eligible homebuyers who currently live and work purchasing homes in certain underserved communities in 8 metropolitan areas.And we now have 14 HOPE Inside centers of Wells Fargo branches, including the first focusing on serving the Navajo community. The centers help engage and empower communities to achieve their financial goals through financial education workshops and free one-on-one coaching. Looking ahead, the U.S. economy has continued to be resilient with key support from the labor and strength -- from the labor market and strength in consumer spending. Delinquencies have continued to deteriorate at a relatively slow consistent rate without signs of acceleration across our portfolios. Our base case remains a continued slowing of the economy, but we remain prepared for a wide range of scenarios given there is still significant uncertainty ahead. Regarding capital, the Basel III Endgame proposal included higher capital requirements as we expected.It's a complicated set of rules. But at this point, if nothing changed and we didn't take actions, we estimate that our RWA would increase by approximately 20%. There are some items that increased our capital requirements that we are hopeful will be adjusted, and we will be participating and sharing our perspectives on the proposed rules during the 120-day comment period. Additionally, we are evaluating changes we may make based on the proposed rules. Fortunately, we come into this from a strong position as our current capital levels are above the estimated regulatory minimum plus buffers. However, we still need to decide how much of an additional buffer we want to maintain and what mitigating actions we may want to take to reduce the impact of the new rules.At this point, we still see a path to concurrently increasing our level of CET1 as appropriate, increasing our dividend and repurchasing common stock. Levels of each will be influenced by CCAR, the finalization of the proposed rules and economic conditions. I'll now turn the call over to Mike.Michael Santomassimo: Thank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. Net income for the third quarter was $5.8 billion or $1.48 per diluted common share, both up from the second quarter and a year ago. Our third quarter results included $349 million or $0.09 per share of discrete tax benefits related to the resolution of prior period tax matters. Turning to capital and liquidity on Slide 3. Our CET1 ratio increased to 11% in the third quarter, 2.1 percentage points above our new regulatory minimum plus buffers effective on October 1. This was up from 10.7% in the second quarter as higher earnings, the approximately 14 basis point benefit from the sale of certain private equity investments and lower risk-weighted assets were only partially offset by share repurchases and dividends.During the third quarter, we repurchased $1.5 billion in common stock. Our strong capital levels position us well for the anticipated increases related to the Basel III Endgame proposal released in the third quarter. Based on where we ended the quarter, we estimate that our CET1 ratio would be 50 basis points above the fully phased-in required minimum if the proposed rules were implemented as written after factoring the growth in RWAs and the resulting decline in our stress capital buffer as well as the impact of the new G-SIB buffer calculation changes. Importantly, this is an early estimate, subject to change and is before any actions we may take to mitigate the impact of the new rules. Looking forward, we expect to continue to have capacity to increase our CET1 ratio, while we plan to continue to repurchase shares as we wait for the capital rules to be finalized.Turning to credit quality on Slide 5. As we expected, net loan charge-offs continue to increase, up 4 basis points from the second quarter to 36 basis points of average loans. Commercial net loan charge-offs declined modestly from the second quarter to 13 basis points of average loans as lower losses in our commercial and industrial portfolio were partially offset by $14 million of higher losses in commercial real estate. We had $32.2 billion of office loans, down 3% from the second quarter, which represented 3% of our total loans outstanding. Vacancy rates continue to be high and the office market remains weak. Our CRE teams continue to focus on monitoring and derisking the portfolio, which includes reducing exposures. As we highlighted in the past, each property situation is different and there are many variables that could determine performance, which is why we regularly review this portfolio.As expected, consumer net loan charge-offs continued to increase and were up $98 million from the second quarter to 67 basis points of average loans. Residential mortgage loans continued to have net recoveries, while our other consumer portfolios all had higher losses with the largest increase in our auto portfolio, which was up from the second quarter seasonal lows. Nonperforming assets increased 17% from the second quarter as growth in commercial real estate nonaccrual loans more than offset the decline in commercial and industrial as well as modest declines across all consumer portfolios. The decline in commercial industrial nonaccrual loans was primarily due to payoffs and paydowns, which is a good reminder that the resolution of nonperforming assets doesn't always result in charge-offs.The increase in commercial real estate nonaccrual loans was driven by a $1.3 billion increase in the office nonaccrual loan. Moving to Slide 6. Our allowance for credit losses increased $333 million in the third quarter primarily for commercial real estate office loans as well as for higher credit card loan balances, which was partially offset by a lower allowance for auto loans. Since the composition of our office portfolio is relatively consistent with what we shared with you in the past few quarters, we did not include a separate commercial real estate slide this quarter. However, we did update the table showing the allowance for credit losses coverage ratio for commercial real estate, including the breakdown of the office portfolio. We've not seen significant increases in charge-offs in our commercial real estate office portfolio yet.However, we do expect higher losses over time, and we continue to increase the coverage ratio in our commercial and -- in our CIB commercial real estate office portfolio from 8.8% at the end of the second quarter to 10.8% at the end of the third quarter. On Slide 7, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans were down modestly from both the second quarter and a year ago. While we continue to have good growth in credit card loans from the second quarter, most other portfolios declined. I'll highlight specific drivers when discussing our operating segment results. Average loan yields increased 195 basis points from a year ago and 24 basis points from the second quarter due to the higher interest rate environment. Average deposits declined 5% from a year ago predominantly driven by deposit outflows in our consumer and wealth businesses, reflecting continued consumer spending and customers reallocating cash into higher-yielding alternatives.Average deposits also declined in Commercial Banking, while they stabilized in Corporate and Investment Banking. As expected, our average deposit costs continued to increase, up 23 basis points from the second quarter of 236 basis points with higher deposit costs across all operating segments in response to rising interest rates. However, the pace of the increase has slowed, and our percentage of average noninterest-bearing deposits decreased modestly from the second quarter to 29% but remained above prepandemic levels. Turning to net interest income on Slide 8. Third quarter net interest income was $13.1 billion, up 8% from a year ago, as we continued to benefit from the impact of higher rates. The $58 million decline from the second quarter was due to lower average deposit balances, partially offset by 1 additional day in the quarter and the impact of higher interest rates.Last quarter, we increased our expectations for full year 2023 net interest income growth to approximately 14% compared with 2022, which was up from our expectation of 10% growth at the beginning of the year. We now expect full year 2023 net interest income growth to grow by approximately 16% compared with 2022 with the fourth quarter 2023 net interest income expected to be approximately $12.7 billion. The expected decline in interest income in the fourth quarter was primarily driven by our assumptions for additional deposit outflows and migration from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing deposits as well as continued deposit repricing, including continued competitive pricing on commercial deposits. Turning to expenses on Slide 9. Noninterest expense declined from a year ago driven by lower operating losses and increased 1% from the second quarter driven by higher operating losses, severance expense and revenue-related comp.Last quarter, we updated our expectations for full year 2023 noninterest expense excluding operating losses to approximately $51 billion. We now expect it to be approximately $51.5 billion or approximately $12.6 billion in the fourth quarter. The increase reflects additional severance and other onetime costs, revenue-related compensation and some lags in realizing efficiency saves. We've reduced head count every quarter since the third quarter of 2020, and it was down 3% in the second quarter and 5% from a year ago. We believe we still have additional opportunities to reduce head count and attrition has remained low, which will likely result in additional severance expense for actions in 2024. We are working through our efficiency plans now as part of the budget process.Additionally, if the FDIC deposit special assessment related to the events from earlier in the year was finalized in the fourth quarter, it would increase our expected fourth quarter expenses. And finally, as a reminder, we have outstanding litigation, regulatory and customer remediation matters that could impact operating results. Turning to our operating segments, starting with Consumer Banking and Lending on Slide 10. Consumer, small and business banking revenue increased 7% from a year ago as higher net interest income driven by the impact of higher interest rates was partially offset by lower deposit-related fees driven by the overdraft policy changes we rolled out last year. Charlie highlighted the investments we were making in our Chicago branch network, and we're also making investments in refurbishing branches across our existing network.Additionally, we are bringing our digital onboarding experience to our branches, creating a fast and easy experience for our customers. At the same time, we've reduced our total number of branches by 6% from a year ago. Home lending revenue declined 14% from a year ago due to a decline in mortgage banking income driven by lower originations in servicing income, which included the impact of sales of mortgage servicing rights. We continue to reduce head count in home lending in the third quarter, down 37% from a year ago, and we expect staffing levels will continue to decline. Credit card revenue increased 2% from a year ago due to higher loan balances, partially offset by introductory promotional rates and higher credit card rewards expense.Payment rates have been relatively stable over the past year and remained above prepandemic levels. New account growth continued to be strong, up 22% from a year ago, reflecting the continued success of our new products and increased marketing. Importantly, the quality of the new accounts continue to be better than what we were booking historically. While the majority of new cards were to existing Wells Fargo customers, we're increasingly attracting more customers that are new to Wells Fargo. Auto revenue declined 15% from a year ago driven by continued loan spread compression and lower loan balances. Personal lending revenue is up 14% from a year ago due to higher loan balances. Turning to some key business drivers on Slide 11. Mortgage originations declined 70% from a year ago and 18% in the second quarter.We continue to make progress on the strategic plans we announced earlier this year, including focusing on serving Wells Fargo Bank customers as well as borrowers in minority communities. We did not originate or fund any correspondent mortgages in the third quarter. The size of our auto portfolio has declined for 6 consecutive quarters, and balances were down 9% at the end of the third quarter compared to a year ago. Origination volumes declined 24% from a year ago, reflecting credit tightening actions as well as continued price competition. Our origination mix continue to shift towards higher FICO scores, reflecting the credit tightening actions we've taken over the past year. Debit card spend increased 2% from a year ago with growth in most categories offsetting declines in fuel, home improvement and travel.Credit card spending continued to be strong and was up 15% from a year ago. All categories grew from a year ago, including fuel, which rebounded after declining in the second quarter. Turning to Commercial Banking results on Slide 12. Middle Market Banking revenue increased 23% from a year ago due to the impact of higher interest rates and higher loan balances. Asset-based lending and leasing revenue increased 3% year-over-year due to higher loan balances as well as higher revenue from renewable energy investments. Loan balances were up 7% in the third quarter compared to a year ago driven by growth in Asset-Based Lending and Leasing. Average loans were down 1% in the second quarter due to declines in Middle Market Banking. After increasing the first half of the year, revolver utilization rates declined in the third quarter to levels similar to a year ago.Turning to Corporate Investment Banking on Slide 13. Banking revenue increased 20% from a year ago driven by higher lending revenue, stronger treasury management results reflecting the impact of higher interest rates, and higher investment banking revenue reflecting increased activity across all products. As Charlie highlighted, we've continued to hire experienced bankers, helping us deliver for our clients and positioning us well when markets improve. Commercial real estate revenue grew 14% from a year ago, reflecting the impact of higher interest rates and higher revenue in our low-income housing business, partially offset by lower loan and deposit balances. Markets revenue increased 33% from a year ago driven by higher revenue in structured products, equities, credit products and foreign exchange.We've had strong trading results for 3 consecutive quarters as we benefited from market volatility and the investments we've made in technology and talent to grow this business. Average loans were down 5% from a year ago driven by banking, reflecting a combination of slower demand payoffs and modestly lower line utilization. Average loan balances were stable with the second quarter. On Slide 14, Wealth and Investment Management revenue increased 1% compared to a year ago driven by higher asset-based fees due to the increased market valuations. Net interest income declined from a year ago driven by lower deposit balances as customers continue to reallocate cash into higher-yielding alternatives as well as lower loan balances. While average deposits were down compared to both the second quarter and a year ago, the pace of the decline slowed in the third quarter.As a reminder, the majority of WIM, Wealth and Investment Management advisory assets were priced at the beginning of the quarter, so third quarter results reflected market valuations as of July 1, which were higher from a year ago. Asset-based fees in the fourth quarter will reflect market valuations as of October 1, which were also higher from a year ago but were lower from the third quarter pricing date. Average loans were down 4% from a year ago primarily due to a decline in securities-based lending. Slide 15 highlights our corporate results. This segment includes venture capital and private equity investments, including the investments and funds that we sold in the third quarter. The sale had a nominal impact on third quarter net income.Revenue declined $345 million from a year ago, reflecting assumption changes related to the valuation of our Visa B common stock exposure as well as lower venture capital revenue. In summary, our results in the third quarter reflect a continued improvement in our financial performance. During the first 9 months of this year, we had strong growth in revenue, pretax provision profit and diluted earnings per share compared to a year ago. As expected, our net charge-offs have continued to slowly increase from historical lows, and we increased our allowance for credit losses by over $1.9 billion this year primarily for CRE office loans and higher credit card loan balances. We are closely monitoring our portfolios and taking credit tightening actions where we believe appropriate.Our capital levels have increased, and we expect to continue to return excess capital to shareholders. We will now take your questions.See also 16 Best Vacations for Seniors with Limited Mobility and 15 Cheap Places to Retire Near the Beach.Q&amp;A SessionOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And we will take our first question from John McDonald of Autonomous Research.John McDonald: I wanted to ask about the expenses, Mike. Obviously, improving efficiency has been a big goal of yours. You made progress even while investing in regulatory. What are the additional opportunities to improve efficiency from here as you head into 2024? I know you're probably not ready to give guidance for '24 yet, but are you going into the budget planning with a mindset that they should be roughly flattish? Any comments you can give on that would be helpful.Michael Santomassimo: Yes. Sure. Thanks, John. First off, let's just make sure we keep it all in context, right? We set out a program almost 3 years ago now to cut roughly $10 billion. And I think that's all still on track. We've brought head count down 40,000 from -- or closer to 50,000 from the peak back in . So sort of very good progress to date. And I think as Charlie and I have both said over the last couple of quarters, we still have more to do to make it more efficient. And I would say there are very few parts of the company that we would say are optimized at this point. Now some have more opportunity than others, some require investment in terms of automation and technology, some don't. But I do think that we go into the budget process and even just how we operate every quarter with a very disciplined approach to every single area of the company saying, what are we going to do to continue to drive more efficiency there while we make investments as well.And we highlighted some of those that we've been making on in the prepared remarks. But I think it's the same mindset we've been bringing to it now for the last few years, and I think we're going to continue to do that. Where that ultimately ends up, we'll share for next year. We'll share with you in January, like we always do.John McDonald: Okay. Fair enough. And then on the net interest income outlook for the fourth quarter, are you building in assumptions -- you mentioned deposit outflows and mix shift assumptions? Are they assuming that things accelerate from here or similar to what you've seen this quarter? It seems like a pretty big sequential decline. Just kind of wondering what some of the assumptions are there.Michael Santomassimo: Yes. No, look, I think as you can -- as we've talked about over the last -- it feels like forever, but certainly last 4, 5, 6 quarters now, there's still a lot of uncertainty out there in terms of how the path of both the deposits and pricing will shape up. Whether it's all the quantitative tightening, all of the -- any competitive reactions we may see from others. And so I think we continue to think that we're going to see these trends appear at some point. Now we've been pleasantly surprised this -- to date this year that hasn't progressed as fast as we thought it would, but at some point, it will. And so hopefully, we'll find ourselves in a position where it doesn't move as maybe fast as we've modeled in terms of pricing.But we still -- all those trends are going to happen and are happening as you look at shifts between noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing, you're seeing deposit costs continue to increase. And on the consumer side, you see people spending their money. And so exactly at what pace those things are all going to keep going as we certainly modeled it, but we try to give you a base case forecast that we can hit under a bunch of different scenarios, and this is the same.Operator: The next question will come from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research.Steven Chubak: So wanted to start, Charlie, because you had made some comments about capital targets and those potentially evolving. The inflation RWA from Basel III Endgame that you guided to does bring your CET1 minimum to 8.5%. You alluded subtly, mind you, to the possibility of managing to a lower target. Since 150 bps management cushion does feel excessive, what are some of the factors that would compel you to maintain a larger cushion than peers and maybe continue to run at or above 10%?Charles Scharf: Well, let me just -- I'll start and then I'll hand it over to Mike. We were not trying to -- or I was not trying to give any direction about where we thought the appropriate buffer would be. We're just trying to be very factual about where we are. And once everything is finalized, we'll determine what the right buffers are and we'll communicate those. So please don't try and read any more into what I said other than just that.Michael Santomassimo: Yes. And I think, Steve, I know your estimate might be 150 basis points. But I think what we've talked about over time is that at least at this point, we've been saying our buffer is probably closer to 100% -- 100 basis points over wherever the right minimum might be. And that may evolve, as Charlie said. I think as you look at Basel III, the increase in RWA is driven by the things that are probably pretty obvious, whether it's operational risk plus the -- some of the other factors. But operational risk is certainly going to be one of the bigger pieces of it. And so I really do think that we have to see how the final rule shakes out next year. We're hopeful that there'll be some changes to areas that we think just makes sense from aligning sort of the capital requirements to the risk while also maybe moderating some of the operational risk increases as well.And so we're going to engage as we go there. But one of the factors that we've talked about now for a while in terms of how big our buffer should be is that we needed the rules to be finalized and so could that lead you to having a slightly smaller buffer than what we would have had in the past? Potentially. But I think we have to get there and get these finalized, and then we'll also take actions once we have good clarity on what's going to change or not change as we go over the next year. So I mean, we're probably 9 months to 12 months away from getting a final rule, and so we still have a little bit of time for this to play out.Steven Chubak: And for a follow-up, just on the trading business. It continues to surprise positively versus expectations. You cited some of the investments that you've made, the benefits of volatility. But with revenues running multiples above what we've seen in prior years and that $1 billion-plus bogey being reached for 3 consecutive quarters, I was hoping you could just speak to whether we should be underwriting $1 billion-plus as a new normal or if there were any cyclical benefits or anomalous benefits that maybe we shouldn't be underwriting go forward. Just trying to think about what the normalized level of trading revenue should be given some of the investments you've made scaling of that business.Michael Santomassimo: Yes, I'll take that. Look, I think we've -- as you said, we've just been methodically investing in the capabilities with a focus on supporting our core clients more than -- more -- with more capabilities versus like trying to expand the scope of what we do in a way that just doesn't fit who we are. And so I think that's what you've seen us try to do there in those businesses. So businesses like FX and rates and just -- it's sort of methodically sort of adding people in a couple of slots or improving technology. And we've certainly been the benefit of some volatility in the market this year. So as you know, that could change pretty quickly one way or the other. But I think as we look at some of these businesses, what we're focused on is just adding more clients, more flows, more incrementally each month and each quarter.And so whether it ends up being $1 billion plus or minus a quarter -- per quarter, I think we'll see as we go, but we're pretty pleased with what we've seen so far. And there isn't a big onetime event that happened in the quarter that drove the results. And so that's good to see as well. And you're also not seeing big growth in market risk RWA as we do this as well. And so that's part of what we've been trying to do as well is kind of sweat the balance sheet more and make sure that we're getting paid for the exposure and the risk we've got there. And so we're happy to see that, it's starting to come together. And we're under no illusions, though, that 3 quarters is like success, right? We've got to do this over a long period of time and continue to add capabilities and clients.Operator: The next question will come from Scott Siefers of Piper Sandler.Robert Siefers: Was hoping maybe, Mike, you could spend another moment sort of discussing RWA mitigation in light of the Fed capital proposals. I guess, specifically, I was hoping for maybe a little more color. I know you touched on it in some of the earlier remarks, but the sale of the $2 billion in private equity. And then maybe if you could also discuss the new agreement with Centerbridge for direct lending, just sort of how all these factor into your thinking here.Michael Santomassimo: Sure. When you look at mitigation -- I'll just give you some examples of the types of things we're thinking about. So when you look at securities finance transactions, you have haircut -- collateral haircut floors that get implemented. And I don't want to get too technical on it because -- but there's some technical requirements there that just don't seem to make sense to us. And so -- but if they do get implemented as written, we'll adapt and we'll change the way we -- what collateral we require from clients to do trades or we'll reprice them. And so there'll be a number of things that we can do like on transactions like that, but it gets very, very technical for each of the underlying deals. There will be -- I know others have talked about this, too.We'll have to decide how much tax equity investing we do in renewables. If the risk weights hold there, it's just -- the math just doesn't make sense from a return perspective. And so we'll probably have to do less -- we'll probably do less of those. And so there's a number of things like that as you go through each of the underlying portfolios just don't make sense. And we're going to -- we'll make the adjustments as we need to. Now we're also in a position where we've got plenty of flexibility as we talked about in the prepared remarks, right? Our capital levels today are there with a buffer already. And so we have the flexibility to handle it however we think makes sense to -- for each of the underlying businesses. And what we want to make sure we do is like we're building real businesses and client relationships over a long period of time.So it's not about necessarily walking away from clients. It's about finding ways to serve them in ways that both makes sense for them and from a return perspective for us. But it's going to be a very, very granular conversation. Some of it will be repricing. You got 364-day revolvers that will need to be repriced. You've got -- there's a whole bunch of very technical things like that, that will get done over time once the rule is finalized. Switching to the partnership we have with Centerbridge. Look, it's a -- we have been getting demand from clients for a while now in the middle-market kind of mid-corporate space for solutions to help them in financing that they need where it likely wouldn't make sense for us to put on our balance sheet anyway.And so instead of having telling clients we can't help them or having them go direct to somebody else, we built a partnership with Centerbridge that allows us to remain an adviser to a client and help them solve a problem they may have. And so that's the way we're thinking about it. And we're excited to work with Centerbridge and that team, and they're a very high-quality team, they have done a lot over time. And I think this gives us another arrow in the quiver to help us provide solutions for clients. And so it's early, and it will grow over time, hopefully. And hopefully, clients will see it in the same way.Robert Siefers: Okay. Perfect. And then maybe as a follow-up, might want to revisit -- or I was hoping to revisit the NII discussion for a bit. I certainly appreciate all the comments on continuing mix shift and deposit pricing pressure. But I guess, as we get to this level at the end of the year, is the thought that there would still be on balance downward pressure on NII beyond that? Or is -- as you see it, is there enough kind of asset repricing opportunity that would ultimately allow things to settle out maybe sooner as opposed to later?Michael Santomassimo: Yes. I mean we'll see. I think we do need to wait until we get towards the end of the year and into January for us to give you a real view on 2024. I mean, I think what the last number of quarters have -- just show over and over and over that there's a lot still to play out here. And to get too far ahead of ourselves on it for next year, I think, would be a mistake at this point. So -- but look, the same -- it's the same drivers we've been talking about for a while, right? It's like what's going to happen with deposits, the mix, the pricing. And then to a lesser degree, right now, it's loan growth, but it still matters over a long period of time as well.Operator: The next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.Matthew O’Connor: Can you just elaborate on the comment of tightening the credit box a bit? And then, I guess, specifically in credit card, thoughts there? I know you've been leaning into it and have had real good growth. And I think it's still only about 5% of your loan book, but wondering your thoughts of, is this really the right time to be leaning into credit card maybe as we're kind of later cycle.Michael Santomassimo: Yes. I'll start with credit card and come back to the broader point. So we started on a journey to transform that -- the card business back in the fourth quarter of '19, so right after really Charlie started. And what we've done since then is really refreshed -- almost completely refreshed the product line. We still have a little bit more to do there. And so part of what you're seeing come through in the results is actually putting out good products that people want to buy. And you're seeing really -- we have really good new account growth in the quarter, probably our best quarter in quite some time. And so it starts with just having a good product and good service behind it, and that's the key driver, I think, of what you're seeing here.On the credit side on the new originations, the new accounts we're adding are really good relative to the back book. And when you look at both -- and even when you dig a little bit deeper there, there's -- the majority of them are still Wells Fargo Bank customers, but we're seeing more and more traction with non-Wells Fargo customers, so first-time customers. And when you look at those first time to Wells customers, those -- the credit profile is really good. And so we feel comfortable with like the risks that's being added there. And we're going to continue to look for pockets of risk. And if we see them, we'll tighten it down. But in terms of what we're seeing in originations, we feel good about what we're seeing so far. Just more broadly on credit, we've said now for probably the last 4 or 5 quarters, we've been kind of incrementally tightening the credit box on the consumer side for a while.Whether it's really across the board in home lending, auto, card, personal loans, really every single one of them had some credit tightening. And it's been a bit incremental over the last 4 or 5 quarters. And so I would still sort of think of that as like taking that last 1% or 2% or 3% of origination out that doesn't make sense in what could be a more difficult economic environment. It's not wholesale shifts in sort of the approach or the underlying box that we're operating in. It's really sort of modest and incremental. And then on the...Charles Scharf: Just on -- and just to be clear, I mean it's -- and it's the very basic stuff. It's just upping the lower FICO boundaries, it's layered risks. And so it's just as you continue to make these changes, you just -- we're just continuing to do the same types of things without just wholesale exits or anything like that. It's just kind of a smart tightening.Michael Santomassimo: Yes. And then outside the consumer space -- outside of consumer, really the only place that we've meaningfully tightened credit over the last couple of years or a few years is commercial real estate. And other than that, I think there's probably some minor tinkering, but we haven't really changed the appetite much outside of commercial real estate.Matthew O’Connor: Okay. That's helpful. And then just a clarification on the severance costs. Can you give us what the absolute amount was this quarter? I think you gave us the change versus a year ago and linked quarter. But what was the absolute level this quarter?Michael Santomassimo: Yes, there wasn't a lot a year ago, so it's not far off of the total. So a small difference, but it's -- there wasn't a lot.Matthew O’Connor: Okay. So about $200 million?Michael Santomassimo: Yes. And again, that will sort of evolve as we go. I mentioned that in my script as we look at next year and the attrition rates that we're seeing.Operator: The next question will come from John Pancari of Evercore ISI.John Pancari: On the commercial real estate front, I know you cited the increase in the office loan loss reserve from -- in the CIB from 8.8% to 10.8%. Could you just comment there in terms of what were some of the anecdotal drivers for the loan loss reserve increase? Do you think you could have incremental increases here? And maybe cite some of the office revaluations you've seen as you have seen with the underlying collateral change hands or reappraisals, if you can give us some color there as well.Michael Santomassimo: Yes, sure. When you -- the hard part of office right now is that there aren't a lot of trades happening yet, right? There's a few in certain cities, and they're all a little bit different in their complexion. So you still have somewhat limited information in price discovery in a lot of places. And so we're doing -- we do a lot of our own work to try to evaluate each of the underlying properties and what they could be worth in a bunch of different scenarios. And then it's feeling like the appraisal market is starting to kind of catch up, where they're -- we're seeing appraisals that are more realistic and more updated. So that's certainly bringing in different data points as we look at it. And as we looked at the quarter, we sort of look at all those data points and the underlying loans and try to do our best to come up what we think the different range of loss could look like here, and that's what's embedded in the results.Hopefully, we end up being conservative. But nonetheless, it's possible that this plays out this way. And so we haven't really seen any losses of significant yet -- significance yet, but we will. And it just takes some time for it to play out for each of these underlying situations, probably longer than any of us would hope to -- you'd hope that you could bring some of this stuff to resolution maybe faster than it really takes in real life. But it's really looking at all the data points, the limited sales, the new appraisals that are coming through and then our own analysis for each of the underlying properties.John Pancari: Got it. All right. And then separately, also within commercial real estate, we're getting more and more questions around multifamily exposures and just how well they really are holding up given some supply issues in certain markets. Can you just comment there? Are you seeing any noteworthy stress or any changes to underlying reserve for that book?Michael Santomassimo: Yes. Not a lot. I mean you certainly see certain markets that might appear to have some oversupply in condos in certain places. But it feels like that will work itself out over a period of time. We're not seeing real systematic stress in the portfolio at this point.John Pancari: Got it. If I can ask just one last one. On the head count cuts, you mentioned you look at every business pretty much. Are any head count cuts occurring yet in the risk area or anything? Or any changes with the contracts with consultants in the risk overhaul area at all?Michael Santomassimo: Yes. No. Look, the only thing I'd say on the risk and reg work is that we're going to spend whatever we need to spend and put the resources we need against it to get it done. And we're going to continue to do that towards...Charles Scharf: Just to be clear, like we're not cutting head count related to that. In fact, it's probably the opposite when you look over the past bunch of quarters. The only thing which goes up and down is depending on where we are with work with outside consultants, that number will go up or down in a given quarter. But we've also said, if we can use outside resources to help get the work done sooner, we're going to. So as we think about -- just as we think about our efficiencies, that is just not in scope at this point or for the foreseeable future.Operator: The next question comes from Erika Najarian of UBS.Erika Najarian: My first question is on the revenue side. As a follow-up to Chubak's line of questioning, I think not only the trading numbers come better this year but also investment banking. And so I hear you loud and clear about the cyclicality of the trading business. But I guess, help us get a sense of if the industry wallet, for example, return to 2019 levels, do you think that you're going to have generally a higher share of revenues in capital markets versus 2019? And sort of the sub-question to that is, as we think about the investments you have already made, what are the other businesses that could potentially surprise us to the upside, where it's not quite optimized yet in terms of its revenue production? And obviously, everybody is thinking about -- you mentioned card, and also everybody is also thinking about wealth management and investment advisory revenues.Charles Scharf: Yes. Well, let me take a shot at that. I think -- listen, I think the answer is, to your question on share, without getting overly specific, yes. We think when you look at where we stand on our growth in our Corporate Investment Banking share, whether it's on the trading side or whether it's on the fee-related side, our shares have grown. And certainly, on the -- within the fee-based side of the business, we do hope they continue to grow. That's driven by the investments that we're making, and investments meaning people in terms of growing our capabilities. And we've got clear goals and targets by person that we bring on in terms of what we expect, and we're going to be tracking to that. And just a reminder, certainly, when we brought some of the people on, they bring some -- a lot of clients with them, some new transactions in the short term.And we've been beneficiaries of that over the last couple of quarters just as we brought some people on. But these are relationship-based businesses, and transactions don't occur every single quarter. So we would expect our share to continue to grow. And I just -- as a reminder, without taking any additional risk overall because we're taking the risk today relative to the exposures that we have. When we look at where we can see growth coming overall across the entire company, we just go business by business. Absolutely, in our consumer small business -- small and business banking segment because -- we've basically been treading water there as we stabilized that business going back to the issues that we had there, which was an incredibly difficult thing to do, and we did.And we've not been our -- we've not been on our front foot in that business. We're going to do it in a very different way than this company did it historically, but there are opportunities to be on the front foot and actually grow share on an organic basis. And so incredibly excited about that opportunity. Not excited, as I said, about growing share in mortgage. That's not where we're after, and it's -- we've talked about where we're going there. Auto, it's about returns, not growth. So don't look for a lot of growth there unless the dynamics change in the business. Mike spoke about card. We're incredibly energized by the evidence that shows with our brand and our relationships. When you put a great product out there, we get positive selection and real growth.And by the way, look at our spend numbers. I mean, if you want to see like the impact of what it means, just look at the spend that we're seeing, which is much higher than the industry levels. Our wealth business, as you pointed out, no question, also treaded water for a long period of time. We're attracting people and teams. We're rolling out new products. So we feel really good about the opportunities that are there. And in the middle market segment, where it's a little bit more business as usual because it is such a strong franchise for us. Even there we look back at our asset-based lending businesses and the things that we acquired from GE. They ran as stand-alone businesses here for a long period of time, and we didn't bring the entire product set of Wells Fargo to those customer bases.Under Kyle Hranicky, Kristin Lesher and MK DuBose or Mary Katherine DuBose are diligently working through that and bringing the Investment Banking product to that entire Commercial Banking product. So I could go on. I just -- it should be broad-based. Most of it, by the way, I'll point out, in terms of when we see opportunities, it is fee-based growth, not because we've dictated that but just because we focused a lot on NII as a company historically. And we just have a lot of opportunities that we get excited about that will play out over a period of time.Erika Najarian: Got it. And I think that excitement is clear, Charlie. And my second question is, given all of that and taking a step back, I totally think it's too early, I agree with you, to give anything on '24 expenses. But more broadly discussing, do you feel like the company is in a little bit of an inflection point? Because on one hand, Mike was saying that very few parts of the bank are optimized. On the other, I think you guys mentioned that the head count is not going the other way, and perhaps it's really some of the outside consulting fees that could go up and down. But I'm wondering if you get asked about expenses in a framework of flat, but then all of this momentum on the revenue side seems to be on the comp. And I'm wondering how you think about as you budget for the company and as you think about just getting to that 15% ROTCE.Let's just put Basel III Endgame aside in terms of the denominator, how do you balance some of the shareholders and the analysts that are asking you about expenses in the context of flat versus the revenue momentum that obviously would need expenses to keep sustaining versus that revenue momentum that you seem to be so excited about?Charles Scharf: Let me start. And Mike, you either come in at the end or just make your comments along the way as well. So I think, first of all, we think about it as 2 separate exercises that we go through. And we're -- and it's very timely because we're in the middle of going through the exercise for next year as most other companies are, which is this company is not efficient, like period, end of story. And I've described this, even with all of the reductions that we've made, it's not surprising because as you peel the onion back, other things present themselves. And so you go in order of things that are more obvious and things like that. But when we sit around as a management team, we feel great about the progress. And there's no clearer way to see that than in the head count numbers, which ultimately drive the expense of the company.And if I -- if we stood here and told you we were going to drive the head count down that much in this period of time, I'm not sure you'd have believed us. And so when we say we're going to do something, we really do mean it. And so when we sit around as a team, there are many more efficiencies to get, and we're diligently working through those. And then separately from that, it's when we talk about making investments in the place, are we getting the payoff for it. And so whether it's the marketing in the card business, where we're spending more money on marketing than we had in the past, and we feel great about, as Mike pointed out, not just the volumes that we're getting but the underlying quality relative to how we had modeled that. And so we'll do that with each and everything.And ultimately, we need to make a decision as we finalize the process of the budget on just much more of a tactical basis of how those things net out. We're well aware of what shareholders are looking for. We're well aware of that the expense side of this company is an important equation in what investors look at us in terms of where -- unlocking value, and we hear it and we see it. And whatever -- wherever we come out when we talk to you about our guidance for next year, we will explain why we got to where we are. It's going to include efficiencies. It's going to include investments. Whether it -- where that turns out, we'll explain it. And I think so far, we've been as clear and as transparent as we can be. And if it makes sense, you'll like it.And if it doesn't, you won't, you'll tell us. But so far, we've been able to have alignment there. But overall, I would just -- it's a long way of saying it's not lost on us that we have opportunities both to reduce expenses and to invest. But making sure that the overall expense level stays in check at this place is incredibly important to us, and we have to prove that there is revenue growth there supporting investments that we make.Operator: The next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America.Ebrahim Poonawala: Just Mike, for you, a follow-up on credit on the C&amp;I side, nonaccrual charge-offs staying relatively flat, I guess, as we look through. Just talk to us in terms of when you look at that C&amp;I book, is the impact of the Fed rate hikes felt by your customers? And how are you seeing that evolve? Is your expectation right now -- you talked about the economy being resilient. Are you seeing any soft spots on the C&amp;I book where you're seeing bankruptcies rise within a vertical or a certain segment?Michael Santomassimo: Yes. No. Look, I think, first, you're seeing it come through in utilization of revolvers, right, which are pretty much in check. They aren't moving much and down in some cases. So people are building less inventory given where rates are. They may be making decisions on like how fast they want to invest in their businesses. And so you're seeing that come through in loan growth, which is sensible for -- from their perspective. I think when you look across the portfolio, there are certainly pockets where you may be seeing margin compression still or different idiosyncratic issues. But across the portfolio, the credit quality is still good.Ebrahim Poonawala: Got it. And do you think your customers have felt the hit from higher rates already? Or is that on the comp?Michael Santomassimo: Well, I think they certainly felt it so far, right? I mean most of them have variable rate loan that they service, right? And obviously, the longer rates stay high, they'll maybe feel it more. But certainly, I think they've been impacted.Ebrahim Poonawala: Got it. And just one separate quick question on the outlook for buybacks. Clearly, big reset lower. When you -- like your excess capital, you probably have visibility on the worst case on Basel Endgame. It's very rare that banks have excess capital when the stocks are actually near lower. You're creating a tangible book. How do you think about outside of CCAR and SCB in terms of near-term pace of buybacks over the next few quarters relative to what we did this quarter?Michael Santomassimo: Yes. I mean we're not going to get into like trying to give you a view on pacing. We're going to go -- we have a process we go through every quarter to look at all of what's happening. First, it's like how are we going to support clients, what's demand we're seeing, what kind of risks are out there. In the fourth quarter, we have the FDIC special assessment potentially coming. And so there's a whole -- each quarter, there's going to be a whole range of things that we're going to go through, and then we'll decide on pacing.Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.Gerard Cassidy: Mike, can you share with us -- you and your peers as well as investors, we've all been surprised with how this deposit trend of moving money into higher-yielding deposits is going slower than expected. Is there any categories within your deposit base, whether it's just your regular consumer deposits or high net worth deposits or the nonoperational commercial deposits that are moving more slowly? And I know you said you expect it to happen, but is there something that says that it could pick up real quickly in the next 6 months? Or is it just a gradual increase?Michael Santomassimo: Yes. Gerard, I think you really have to pick it apart by the different businesses. I think in the wealth business, it moved quite quickly, right, in terms of seeing deposits decline from where they were and that is now moderated. So it's good to see that, that shifting has sort of slowed down quite substantially in the quarter relative to the last couple of quarters. On the consumer side, the majority of the deposits that we've got sit in accounts with less than $250,000. And so to some degree, these are -- to a large degree, these are operational accounts for folks. And so there's some portion of those funds that are never going to move into other places because people need it in the accounts to live and operate every day.And so I think what's -- so I think we'll see, right? And I think we're all in a bit of uncharted territory at this point with rates being where they are and the pace at which they got there, quantitative tightening happening. And so I think we need to be prepared for it to change. Exactly at what pace and over what period of time, we'll see. But we certainly haven't seen deposit pricing move the way we modeled it a year ago, for sure.Gerard Cassidy: Very good. And then as a follow-up, since you and Charlie have come on board, Wells has really done a very good job in returning that excess capital. I understand everything that's going on today, and you guys described it in your comments. Can you share with us, is there a buffer -- whenever the final numbers come out, are you guys planning to keep a 100 basis point buffer above that? Or any color there?Michael Santomassimo: Yes. We haven't decided exactly what it'll -- what the buffer will look like after Basel III is implemented. But so far, what we've said a number of times is that 100 basis points is about where we've been targeting. Obviously, we've been running above that for a while. But we'll -- as we get a better view of where these rules are going to shake out, we'll probably talk about that more. But I would think that 100 basis points, at least for now is sort of the bottom end of the range.Operator: And that was our final question for today. I will now turn it over to your speakers for closing remarks.Charles Scharf: All righty. Everyone, thank you very much. We look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Take care now.Operator: Thank you for your participation on today's conference call. At this time, all parties may disconnect.]"

242,be5bdbc7-b05c-3cc7-ab0f-f38646e22641,WFC,2023-10-17,"JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo are part of Zacks Earnings Preview",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jpmorgan-citigroup-wells-fargo-part-121700360.html,1697458620,STORY,"['JPM', '^GSPC', 'WFC', 'C']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – October 16, 2023 – Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week’s list includes JPMorgan JPM, Citigroup C and even Wells Fargo WFC.Analyzing Positive Bank Earnings: An Uncertain OutlookThe market liked what it saw in the quarterly releases from JPMorgan, Citigroup and even Wells Fargo. There was plenty to like in these results, with the resilient economy helping keep credit demand positive and higher interest rates allowing them to charge more for those loans.The bank worries that took center stage in the Spring following the Silicon Valley Bank fiasco have largely eased by now. But those solvency worries were never meant for JPMorgan, Citi, and Wells Fargo, which reported Friday morning, and Bank of America, which is scheduled to report Tuesday morning (October 17th). These banks regularly go through the Fed’s stress tests and are perceived as very safe. The issue was all along centered on the small and mid-sized regional banks that will start reporting results this week.We should note, however, that while JPMorgan and its large money-center peers may not have been directly affected by the Spring banking issue, even these big players have been forced to offer higher rates to depositors, pressuring their net interest margins. The Q3 net interest margin at JPMorgan, Citi, and Wells was still up from the year-earlier period but has notably leveled off relative to what they reported in the preceding quarter.Getting back to the group’s Q3 results, the fact that the investment banking business was weak during the period was no surprise for the market. This has been the trend for many quarters, as tighter monetary policy and other macroeconomic headwinds have weighed on deal-making. While there are some ‘green shoots’ on the horizon concerning M&amp;A and IPO activities, no significant improvement is expected in these businesses until the macroeconomic ‘clouds’ lift.Story continuesJPMorgan beat on the top and bottom-lines, with Q3 earnings and revenues up +35.1% and +21.9% from the year-earlier levels, respectively. The bank benefited from First Republic purchase, but JPMorgan’s earnings would still be up significantly relative to the year-earlier level as a result of improved margins.Another area of potential read-through from these reports is commercial real estate exposure, which is a far bigger line of business for the regional operators than for the likes of JPMorgan, Citi, and Wells Fargo. Of these three, Wells Fargo is perhaps more exposed here, as reflected in the roughly $1.2 billion reserve booking, up from $784 million in the year-earlier period, a big part of which reflected the Wells’ commercial real estate exposure.Management’s commentary about the economic outlook reflected tentativeness, citing continued downside risks, though they acknowledged the economy’s resiliency and increasing odds of a ‘soft landing’ for the economy.Bank stocks have notably lagged the broader market, particularly since the onset of regional bank worries in March.The issue with the bank stocks isn’t their current earnings power but rather how their profitability will shape up in the coming economic slowdown. Bank investors are wary of the group’s track record of making a lot of money during the good times, which the group then gives back during the bad times. The question is how ‘bad’ will the coming ‘bad times’ be for the economy and what will that do to bank earnings.Regarding the Finance sector scorecard for Q3, we now have results from 19.2% of the sector’s market capitalization in the S&amp;P 500 index. Total earnings for these companies are up +21.9% from the same period last year on +13.6% higher revenues, with 100% beating EPS estimates and 66.67% beating revenue estimates.Looking at the Finance sector as a whole, total Q3 earnings for the sector are expected to be up +9.5% on +2.4% higher revenues.As noted earlier, skeptics of the banking industry argue that the group gives away all the profits it had accumulated during the good times when the macro environment turns south. The Covid downturn was an anomaly in that respect, but there is some truth to the allegation.We will see how the economic picture unfolds in the coming quarters, but the credit quality metrics in the reported Q3 results do not point towards a material deterioration, even though delinquencies have started going up from the record low levels of the Covid years.The Earnings Big PictureLooking at 2023 Q3 as a whole, the expectation currently is of S&amp;P 500 earnings declining by -1.3% from the same period last year on +0.8% higher revenues. This would follow the -7.1% decline on +1.1% higher revenues in 2023 Q2.2023 Q3 is expected to be the last period of declining earnings for the index, with positive growth resuming from 2023 Q4 onwards. In fact, had it not been for the Energy sector drag, earnings growth in 2023 Q3 would already be positive.Excluding the Energy sector, however, net margins would be modestly up from the year-earlier period.One sector that has made significant progress on the margins front is the Tech sector, whose year-over-year comparison turned positive in the preceding period and is expected to expand further this quarter.Look at current expectations for next year and the year after to understand the disconnect between the reality of current bottom-up aggregate earnings estimates and the seemingly never-ending worries about an impending economic downturn. That said, most economic analysts have been steadily lowering their recessionary odds in recent months.This Week’s Notable Earnings ReleasesJPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup weren’t the first companies to report Q3 results, as several companies with fiscal quarters ending in August that we count as part of our September-quarter tally have been coming out with quarterly numbers in recent weeks. But the reporting cycle will really get going this week, with almost 150 companies reporting Q3 results, including 54 S&amp;P 500 members.Including Friday’s results from the big banks, we now have Q3 results from 32 S&amp;P 500 members. Total Q3 earnings for these 32 index members are up +13.5% from the same period last year on +8.8% higher revenues, with 87.5% beating EPS estimates and 65.6% beating revenues estimates.For a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bank Earnings Loom: A Challenging Set up Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

Some value shopping looks to have taken place, as industries that had been taking a backseat during this most recent pullback — such as Consumer Discretionary and Communications Services — gained on the day, roughly +1.5% or more on the day. The small-cap Russell 2000, still under water over the past month, led the way higher today.Ultimately, the pop in the stock market was across the board today: the Dow, still working up from its near-term lows at the start of this month, gained +313 points, +0.93%. The Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500, both snapping two-day losing streaks, were up +1.20% and +1.06% on the day, respectively. And the Russell grew +1.59% for the session. Generally speaking, bull runs like those many investors are looking for at the end of the calendar year, are spearheaded by the small-cap index.E-commerce specialty Etsy ETSY shot to one-month highs as of today’s close; it finished +4.1% but was up north of +5% earlier in the session. Warner Brothers Discovery WBD performed even better on the day, +5.1%, enjoying a bit of resurgence now that the Writers Guild strike is over. On the other side, Moderna MRNA shares were down -6.5% this session after Pfizer PFE announced late last week that Covid vaccines were down from expectations.Bond yields remain elevated today, but at least they’re not breaching new levels higher at this stage. The yield-curve inversion is still present, but currently less than by 50 basis points (bps). We’re still at historically high levels, especially on the the 10-year bond yield side, at 4.71%. The 2-year yield still carries a 5-handle, at 5.10%. An economy that looks like a steady-moving train — solid labor market numbers exist even in this high interest rate environment — is keeping these rates up.Big Q3 earnings hit the tape tomorrow morning, including Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ, Bank of America BAC, Goldman Sachs GS, United Airlines UAL and Lockheed Martin LMT. All of these industry leaders carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) into their earnings release aside from J&amp;J, which is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

However, the company's fundamentals look pretty decent, and long-term financials are usually aligned with future market price movements. In this article, we decided to focus on Fox's  ROE.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. View our latest analysis for Fox How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Fox is:12% = US$1.3b ÷ US$11b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.12 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.A Side By Side comparison of Fox's Earnings Growth And 12% ROEAt first glance, Fox seems to have a decent ROE. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 11%. As you might expect, the 8.6% net income decline reported by Fox is a bit of a surprise. So, there might be some other aspects that could explain this. These include low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital.Story continuesThat being said, we compared Fox's performance with the industry and were concerned when we found that while the company has shrunk its earnings, the industry has grown its earnings at a rate of 10% in the same 5-year period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is FOXA fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Fox Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Fox's low three-year median payout ratio of 19% (or a retention ratio of 81%) over the last three years should mean that the company is retaining most of its earnings to fuel its growth but the company's earnings have actually shrunk. This typically shouldn't be the case when a company is retaining most of its earnings. It looks like there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline.Moreover, Fox has been paying dividends for four years, which is a considerable amount of time, suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer consistent dividends even though earnings have been shrinking. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 18% of its profits over the next three years. As a result, Fox's ROE is not expected to change by much either, which we inferred from the analyst estimate of 13% for future ROE.ConclusionIn total, it does look like Fox has some positive aspects to its business. However, given the high ROE and high profit retention, we would expect the company to be delivering strong earnings growth, but that isn't the case here. This suggests that there might be some external threat to the business, that's hampering its growth. Having said that, looking at current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings growth rate is expected to see a huge improvement.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 Most Productive Countries Per Capita.What Drives Productivity in a Country?Efficiency in production, also coined as productivity, is one of the major driving forces behind economic resilience in a country. There are several factors which contribute to this productivity. The national structural policies play a primary role in this context since they build an environment where productive labor and companies can thrive. A competitive business environment typically fosters growth and innovation in a country. Globalization is another key element in national-level productivity since it expands the export and business market for a country. An example of this could be Luxembourg, as reported by KPMG, which offers just the right kind of stable and low corporate tax environment for businesses to invest and operate in the country, which in turn boosts economic growth.

On Oct 13, the University of Michigan reported that the preliminary index for Consumer Sentiment in October came in at 63, missing the consensus estimate of 67.4. The final reading of the index for September was 68.1. October marked the third consecutive month of the index’s decline and the largest monthly decline since May.The Present Situation Index — based on consumers’ assessment of current business and labor market conditions — fell to 66.7 in October from 71.4 in September.

Molson Coors Brewing (TAP), which belongs to the Zacks Beverages - Alcohol industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This beer maker has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 58.45%.For the most recent quarter, Molson Coors was expected to post earnings of $1.63 per share, but it reported $1.78 per share instead, representing a surprise of 9.20%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $0.26 per share, while it actually produced $0.54 per share, a surprise of 107.69%.With this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Molson Coors. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Molson Coors has an Earnings ESP of +3.46% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on November 2, 2023.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

SAM.Industry: Alcoholic BeveragesLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2165426/5-alcohol-industry-stocks-poised-to-counter-adverse-trendsPlayers in the Zacks Beverages – Alcohol industry have been witnessing higher commodity and logistics costs due to escalated input and packaging costs. Additionally, the industry participants have been keen on spending on advertising and marketing, which has resulted in higher operational costs.These elevated costs are likely to persist and may hurt the margins of alcohol makers. However, companies in the alcohol space are placed to benefit from the continued recovery across markets and channels, robust demand for premium and high-quality products, and innovative spirits. The diversification of product portfolios of alcohol companies has been helping boost their top lines. Companies are expected to benefit from the momentum in spirits and ready-to-drink (RTD) cocktails.Investments in product innovations, premiumization and technology platforms bode well for players like AnheuserBusch InBev, Constellation Brands Inc., Brown-Forman, Molson Coors and The Boston Beer Company Inc.About the IndustryThe Zacks Beverages – Alcohol industry mainly comprises producers, importers, exporters, marketers and sellers of alcoholic beverages like beer, craft beer, ciders, wine, rum, whiskey, liqueurs, vodka, tequila, champagnes, brandy, amaretto, RTD cocktails and malt. Some industry players also produce and sell non-alcoholic beverages like carbonated soft drinks, sparkling waters, bottled water, energy drinks, powdered and natural juices, and RTD teas.The companies sell products through wholesalers and retailers like supermarkets, warehouse clubs, grocery stores, convenience stores, package stores, drug stores and other retail outlets. The industry participants also sell beer directly to consumers in cans and bottles at restaurants, pubs, bars and liquor stores. Some brewers operate brewpubs or taste rooms at breweries, offering consumers the freshest beer.Story continuesWhat's Shaping the Future of Beverages - Alcohol IndustryElevated Costs: Players in the alcohol industry have been enduring pressures from the ongoing impacts of inflationary labor, transportation and commodity costs. The industry players have been experiencing elevated ingredient and other input costs, including shipping and freight, labor, trucking, fuel, co-packing fees, and secondary packaging materials, leading to increased costs of sales and higher operating costs. These have been resulting in adverse gross and operating margins for beverage companies.Apart from elevated input and packaging costs, players in the alcohol industry are anticipated to witness higher advertising and promotional expenses, as well as SG&amp;A costs, further threatening profitability. Rising brand investments, particularly in media, advertising, production and local marketing, and increased freight to distributors due to higher volumes are resulting in elevated advertising, promotional and selling expenses.Growing external costs, increased compensation expenses and higher discretionary spending are expected to drive SG&amp;A deleverage. Most industry players expect the trend to continue in the near term, impacting profitability to some extent.Premiumization &amp; Product Diversification: Premiumization has been a key growth driver for players in the alcohol space due to consumers’ continued desires for refreshing and newer tastes. Many beverage companies are diversifying their product offerings to capture more sales. Alcohol companies have also been witnessing robust demand trends for premium and high-end products. As a result, the companies focused on innovation and portfolio premiumization stand to gain from today’s market.Players have been exploring opportunities beyond the traditional beer, whiskey, spirits and wine categories.

Last Tuesday, Ford already stated it is at the limit of what it can offer to the United Auto Workers and but on Wednesday, it got an unpleasant surprise as the UAW expanded the strike to its most profitable plant that brings in one sixth of its global automotive revenue.GM And Ford’s EV Plans Are At RiskWith the Kentucky plant, the UAW hit Ford hard as this plant alone bring in $25 billion in annual revenue. Ford and General Motors (NYSE: GM) announced ambitious EV plans that were practically funded by strong profits from combustion trucks and SUVs. Before the UAW strike, both GM and Ford scaled down their EV plans during summer, simultaneously increasing their cost cutting efforts. With the mounting costs of the UAW strike and the eventual settlements, these EV plans are at serious risk. GM already revealed that the strike took $200 million from its third quarter profits and that it got a $6 billion credit line as insurance. On Monday, JP Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman estimated that Ford is now losing $44 million a day followed by GM who is losing $21 million a day, therefore the strikes are costing the two automakers more than $500 million. Precise figures will be known when GM reports its third quarter results on October 24th with Ford scheduled to release its third quarter results on October 26th.Over 34,000 UAW Workers Employed At Detroit's Three Automakers Are On StrikeLast week ended with Stellantis (NYSE: STLA) and Ford Motor stating on Friday they will be temporarily laying off 1,250 employees due to the strike. Stellantis now has 1,340 employees on temporary layoff across three states, including the 700 employees it laid off on Friday. With the Kentucky truck plant and Chicago Assembly plant walkouts, Ford temporarily laid off 550 employees last week and announced it will be dismissing 300 employees at an Ohio transmission plant, about 250 at four Michigan plants and 12 in Chicago. With the Kentucky plant down, a dozen of Ford’s facilities are to suffer the impact of the strike. Since this unprecedented workers’ action kicked off, Ford laid off 2,480 workers.Story continuesMeanwhile, Expectations Are Low For Tesla Who Is Due To Report Its Quarterly Results This WeekOn late Wednesday, the EV king, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) is due to report its third quarter performance after already revealing lackluster Q3 deliveries. Earlier in October, Tesla revealed it delivered 435,059 EVs which is a 6% drop compared to the second quarter. However, all eyes are on the fourth quarter when Tesla could rebound with the Cybertruck launch and revamped model 3 deliveries in China. Therefore, analysts will be looking less at Q3 numbers and more on the fully year guidance and the pricing/margin strategy that Tesla executives are expected to communicate.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

The firm has also estimated that the strike already cost both companies over $500 million each.In addition, EV maker Tesla (TSLA) is facing pressure from increased competition and unenthusiastic consumers. A poll from Yahoo Finance shows 57% of respondents claim they're unlikely to purchase an EV as their next car. AutoBlog Editor-in-Chief Greg Migliore joins the Live show to break down the details of the ongoing strike and the challenges that Tesla faces.Migliore expresses his optimism for Tesla: ""As you take like a longer look, though, Tesla stock is still up about $50 from last year, and it's more than doubled from that low point that kind of hit in January. I think they're going to have an okay, performance here for the third quarter earnings.""Click here to watch the full interview on the Yahoo Finance YouTube page or you can watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live here.Video Transcript- So Greg we still don't really know about the timeline of this. Obviously, millions at stake when we break it down by that per day impact. But when we talk about a new contract and what that could potentially mean here for these automakers, any sense just how big of a hit they could take if they do, in fact, go with what the unions want to say in terms of the conclusion of the upcoming battery plants and then also just the higher salaries and benefits.GREGORY MIGLIORE: Right now it's a little hard, I think, to kind of cut through the rhetoric on both sides as far as just how much of a financial impact this might have long term. We do know General Motors has signaled that they might take a $200 million hit just in third quarter earnings, which we're going to hear about later this month. So obviously they're going to start to feel that impact immediately.Bigger picture, labor has always been a part of costs for any automaker. So whether they end up with like a 23% raise, which is what Ford most recently offered or something closer to what the union has asked for, which was closer to 40, perhaps they meet in the middle and maybe they find a number that's tenable for both sides.Story continues- All right, Greg. We're also watching Tesla. It's a big story this week. We're going to get earnings results from the company after the bell on Wednesday. When it comes to the EV maker, lots of talk about the pressure that the price cuts are going to put on margins. And of course, this comes after their third quarter delivery numbers fell short of what the Street was looking for. Give us a sense of what you're expecting to hear from Tesla and how that's going to shape maybe the price action that we see in the stock over the coming months.GREGORY MIGLIORE: It's really interesting. Tesla's cut prices multiple times this year and several of their models are actually really good deals. It's actually a pretty good time to buy a Tesla if you could get your hands on one. They're below the average price of a new vehicle, which was $48,000 in October. Now the other side of this for Tesla is lower prices cut into margins, which means third quarter earnings are probably going to be a little bit lighter, more pedestrian than we've seen in some recent years.The other hand, they've succeeded in propping up sales. Sales are up about 27% in the third quarter. So it's going to be a bit of a mixed bag. I think here for Tesla. The competition has gotten tougher. That's a big takeaway I see. You guys ran a study that said 57% of US car buyers are not interested in EVs and that tells me you have that on one side and then you have all these new EVs from Hyundai, Ford, Volkswagen, General Motors. The list goes on.There's, you know, right now the pie hasn't gotten bigger, so I think that's put more pressure on Tesla and it's a much more competitive landscape. As you take like a longer look though, Tesla stock is still up about $50 from last year and it's more than doubled from that low point to hit in January. So I think they're going to have an OK I think performance here with the third quarter earnings. The big thing is what are they going to say about the Cybertruck. That's what I'm really looking most forward to.]"

Often, a country’s automotive sector is a reflection of its broader economic condition. It affects every aspect of daily life and is an important source of employment – approximately 5% of the global labor force is directly or indirectly employed in the automobile sector. The total turnover of the global vehicle manufacturing industry is, in fact, greater than the GDP of France. Automotive Industry in the U.S.: The United States has one of the largest automotive markets in the world. The total light vehicle market sales in the U.S. totaled just over 13.7 million units in 2022, down 7.9% from the previous year’s sales of 14.9 million vehicles. Sales were hampered by supply constraints and higher interest rates – a response to an uptick in price inflation. Transaction prices hit record levels and inventory stayed low, despite some improvement in the second half of the year. In 2023, light vehicle sales in America are still expected to remain well below pre-pandemic levels at 14.9 million units, an increase of 9% from last year. In pre-pandemic 2019, the U.S. market was 17 million units, a level it is not expected to return to until 2025. As we mentioned in our article – 15 Most Profitable Car Companies in the World – around 4.5% of all U.S. jobs are supported by the country’s auto industry and people working in these jobs collectively earn over $500 billion annually in compensation and contribute over $70 billion in tax revenues. The American automotive industry contributed $2.3 trillion to the country’s economy in 2021, amounting to 12% of the total U.S. GDP. Story continuesBest-Selling Automaker in America:Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) made headlines in 2021 when it overtook General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) for the first time ever as the Top-Selling Car Company in the United States. The Japanese automaker, which for decades has worked to expand its presence in the U.S., sold a total of 2.3 million vehicles in the country’s market, against GM’s sales of 2.2 million. Prior to this, the General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) had been the top auto seller in the U.S. since 1931. Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) had largely benefited from its decision to stockpile computer chips, which are used in a vast array of vehicle electronics. It bet earlier than most other car manufacturers on a recovering U.S. car market and cut parts and production orders less sharply than rivals, making it better prepared for an eventual surge in consumer demand.However, the status quo was restored in 2022 when the General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) regained its top spot, with its brands selling 2.27 million vehicles in the American market, against Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM)’s 2.1 million units. Three of GM's four brands saw year-over-year sales increases in 2022, with Buick being the only brand to decline.Stocks of the General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) were held by 72 out of 910 hedge funds in the Insider Monkey database at the end of Q2 2023. GM ranks among the 11 Best Consumer Cyclical Stocks to Buy Now. Global Semiconductor Shortage:A major problem that the automotive sector has recently been faced with is the global semiconductor chip shortage. In conventional automobiles, chips process information in various vehicle subsystems that improve the vehicle’s efficiency and make driving safer. According to a study by the United States International Trade Commission, conventional vehicles had approximately $330 worth of chips in 2019, with this number rising even further now. Additionally, the adoption of electric vehicles, with their more complicated systems, has raised the demand for semiconductor chips even higher. The global semiconductor industry has struggled to keep up with this rising demand, mainly due to Covid-19 disruptions, trade action uncertainty, and accelerated digital transformation. A report by Techwire Asia has revealed that the shortage of semiconductors had caused vehicle manufacturing lead times to increase from an average 3 to 4 months, to an average of 10 to 12 months. Automakers around the world lost an estimated $210 billion in revenue in 2021 due to the chip shortage. Although the semiconductor crisis is now largely resolved, the chip supply situation still carries a degree of uncertainty. Demand still exceeds supply of several chip types and there is still a shortage, even if the auto industry can better manage it today than two years ago.With that said, here are the Top-Selling Car Brands in America. 15 Best-Selling Car Brands in the U.S.Methodology: To collect data for this article, we have referred to a number of sources, such as Best-Selling-Cars, Reuters, and above all – the car companies’ own respective websites, looking for the Most Popular Car Brands in the U.S.. The following brands have been ranked by their total number of units sold in the U.S. in 2022. If you’re interested in reading about automobiles that have fetched the biggest price tags in history, here are the Top 20 Most Expensive Cars of All Time. 15. VolkswagenUnits sold in the U.S. in 2022: 301,069Volkswagen had a dismal year in the U.S. with car and SUV sales down by 19.7% to only 301,069 vehicles – the company’s lowest sales volume in America in the last decade. VW blames the industry-wide supply chain disruptions to affect its ability to fully serve the high market demand. Volkswagen is currently the largest automaker in the world, with a reported revenue of approximately $300 billion last year. 14. BMWUnits sold in the U.S. in 2022: 332,388According to the automaker’s website, for the full year 2022, BMW brand sales in the U.S. market decreased slightly by 1.3% to 332,388, compared to the 336,644 vehicles sold in 2021. Plant Spartanburg in South Carolina built just over 60% of the BMW vehicles sold in America last year, and continues to be a main driver of the company’s success. Despite lingering production challenges, the plant achieved its second-highest annual output in 2022, while also adding the all-new BMW XM to its model lineup.BMW is the #1 best car brand in 2023, according to Consumer Reports.13. Mercedes-BenzUnits sold in the U.S. in 2022: 350,949Mercedes-Benz USA recorded sales of 286,764 passenger vehicles in calendar year 2022, a growth of 4% from 2021, and 64,185 Vans, an increase of 20% versus 2021. This brings MBUSA's total sales to 350,949 units last year, an overall increase of 6.5% from the previous year. According to Dimitris Psillakis, the President and CEO of MBUSA: ""Strong year-end results and exponential volume growth of our EV portfolio are a testament to the strong demand for Mercedes-Benz EQ, luxury and commercial vehicles in the U.S. market. With a full lineup of five EQ models and a renewed focus on Top-End Vehicles, we will continue to advance our strategy and offer the most desirable luxury cars, SUVs, and commercial vehicles.”Mercedes-Benz is counted among the Top-Selling Car Brands in the World. 12. TeslaUnits sold in the U.S. in 2022: 354,822Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is the best-selling electric vehicle manufacturer in the United States, with the automaker capturing over 50% of the U.S. EV market last year.  In 2022, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) sold a total of 354,822 vehicles in America, up from 234,000 in 2021 – a growth of 53%. The Tesla Model Y was the best-selling electric vehicle in the U.S. in 2022, with sales of 195,447 units. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares have risen by over 146% this year, bouncing back from a drop of 65% in 2018, driven by a rush for technology and growth stocks, with fears of recession easing. TSLA sits among the 12 Best Aggressive Growth Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. 11. RamUnits sold in the U.S. in 2022: 468,344Ram, a name well-known in the U.S. for its brawny pickup trucks and commercial vans, has long concentrated its sales in North America. Ram delivered 468,344 trucks in 2022, representing a decrease of 16% compared to the previous year, when the company sold over 569,000 units.In 2009, Dodge's parent company, Chrysler, decided to make Ram a standalone brand. But both Dodge and Ram are owned by the Chrysler group, which is itself a subsidiary of Stellantis.Ram ranks among America’s Top Car Brands.10. GMCUnits sold in the U.S. in 2022: 517,469GMC was the number one premium truck brand in the U.S. last year, with sales of 517,469 units, an increase of 7.3% from 2021. Sierra was the best-selling model of GMC in 2022, with 72,415 units sold, representing a YoY increase of 25.42%.9. SubaruUnits sold in the U.S. in 2022: 556,581With five consecutive months of sales increases, Subaru of America ended 2022 with 556,581 vehicle sales, a 4.7% decrease compared to 2021. These year-end results are reflective of the impact that the semiconductor shortage and supply chain disruptions continue to have on the automobile industry. Subaru’s success stems from focusing heavily on its 4×4 Unique Selling Point and producing a handful of cars that consumers really want, such as the Outback, Forester, and XV Crosstrek. Crosstrek was the company’s top performer last year, with 155,142 units sold in America.Subaru sits among the Top 10 Car Brands in America. 8. KiaUnits sold in the U.S. in 2022: 654,554Kia continued its impressive sales growth in the U.S. last year with 654,554 units sold – an increase of 1.7% compared to the previous retail record in 2021. Sales of the Kia’s SUVs and utility vehicles represented 66.8% of the brand’s overall sales last year, led by Sportage, Telluride, and Sorento.  Kia Corporation reported a 13.5% increase in profits in 2022, which can be attributed to its efficient supply chain management strategies and the successful launches of the all new Niro and the 2024 Seltos. 7. NissanUnits sold in the U.S. in 2022: 682,731Nissan Group’s U.S. market fortunes showed signs of recovery in 2021, but they have turned out to be short-lived. The brand had a rough year in 2022, when Nissan sold only 682,731 vehicles, a massive decline of 26% from 2021, as the industry grappled with tight inventories and faced a new threat of softening demand in a slowing economy. Rogue was Nissan's best-seller in the U.S. last year, when the company sold 186,480 of them, down 34.7% from 2021. Nissan ranks 7th in our list of Top Car Brands in the U.S.6. JeepUnits sold in the U.S. in 2022: 684,613Jeep is Chrysler group’s best-selling car brand in America, with sales of 684,613 vehicles last year. The brand witnessed a 10.94% drop in sales compared to 2021, however, there have been some recent highlights for Jeep. In 2022, the Jeep Wrangler 4xe, a plug-in hybrid version of the Wrangler SUV, was the best-selling plug-in hybrid vehicle in the US.Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best-Selling Car Brands in the U.S.Suggested Articles:25 Bestselling Cars, Trucks, and SUVs of 2022 and 202320 Most Affordable Cars to Buy in America in 202312 Countries that Produce the Most CarsDisclosure: None. 15 Best-Selling Car Brands in the U.S. is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: General Motors GM, Ford F and Stellantis STLA.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:UAW Ratchets Up Strike Tensions with Kentucky StandoffThe historic strike by the United Auto Workers (UAW) union against the Detroit 3 automakers — General Motors, Ford and Stellantis — entered its 29th day. In a surprise move this Wednesday, UAW initiated a strike at Ford’s largest factory, the Kentucky Truck Plant. This resulted in the walkout of an additional 8,700 workers, which now brings the total number of striking autoworkers to around 34,000, or 23% of the UAW's roughly 146,000 members. Ford labeled the decision as ""grossly irresponsible,"" attributing it to the union leadership's aim to inflict ""reputational damage"" on the Detroit 3 and cause ""industrial chaos.""The BackgroundThe strike, which began on Sep 15, had initially affected three plants—GM's Wentzville Assembly plant in Missouri, Ford's Michigan Assembly plant in Wayne and Stellantis' Toledo Assembly Complex in Ohio. A week later, on Sep 22, with no new labor contract in place, the UAW extended strikes to 38 parts and distribution centers across 20 states, primarily focusing on General Motors and Stellantis. On Sep 29, UAW president Shawn Fain further expanded the historic strike to include a GM facility in Lansing, MI (which manufactures the Chevrolet Traverse and Buick Enclave) and a Ford assembly plant in Chicago (where Explorer and Lincoln Aviator models are built).In the past few weeks, on Fridays, Fain has either advocated for additional walkouts or announced progress in talks. On Oct 6, the UAW decided against further strikes at Detroit Three auto plants, marking the first week without strike expansion since the work stoppages began on Sep 15. This pause in strikes came as General Motors agreed to include battery cell workers in the company's national agreement.Story continuesThe UAW is negotiating new labor contracts with Ford, General Motors and Stellantis. The UAW’s list of demands is extensive, including a 36% pay increase over four years, annual cost-of-living adjustments, pension benefits for all employees, enhanced job security measures, constraints on the use of temporary workers and a transition to a four-day workweek, among others. They also call for the elimination of the two-tiered wage system, which was adopted after the 2008 financial crisis.The automakers have acknowledged workers' concerns and expressed their willingness to negotiate further to resolve the issues at hand. However, they also argue that the UAW’s demands could potentially hamper their competitiveness in the global market.GM, Ford and Stellantis have all agreed to a 20-23% increase in base wages over a four-year deal. They are also negotiating with the UAW on issues like retiree benefits, potential options for future battery plant workers and cost-of-living adjustments amid high inflation. Per Fain’s Facebook Live session, Ford and Stellantis have agreed to reinstate COLA, and GM isn’t far behind.UAW's Strike Wave Hits Ford’s Kentucky PlantThe UAW union escalated tensions with Ford by calling a strike at the Kentucky Truck Plant after talks between the two parties collapsed. Ford's offer included a 23% wage increase over four years, wage adjustments in line with inflation and a reduced timeframe for new hires to attain top wages. The UAW entered the latest negotiation session, anticipating Ford to enhance its proposition. However, the differences between the two parties became evident quickly, leading Fain to instruct Kentucky plant workers to strike.This is a major escalation in the ongoing strike as the Kentucky Truck Plant, located in Louisville, is pivotal for Ford, producing $25 billion in annual revenues. It manufactures the Super Duty versions of Ford’s F-Series trucks, the Ford Expedition and the Lincoln Navigator SUVs. The plant accounts for about 16% of Ford's total revenues, with a new vehicle being produced every 37 seconds. Given its scale, any extended halt in its operations could cause a ripple across up to 13 other Ford plants, leading to potential disruptions in the production of engines, transmissions, and axles.Ford currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.UAW's decision to intensify the strike arose from Ford's perceived lack of flexibility in negotiations. Fain highlighted that the company merely reiterated its previous offer, neglecting to provide enhanced economic benefits. Ford, in response, emphasized its constraints, stating that any further increase in its current offer would jeopardize its capacity to invest in electric vehicles. Kumar Galhotra, president of Ford's combustion engine vehicles division, emphasized that they had reached their negotiation limit. Quoting Top of FormGalhotra,“We are very clear. We are at the limit. Any more will stretch our ability to invest in the business.”Automakers on Edge as Financial Strains IncreaseThe UAW's unexpected strike at Ford's pivotal factory has not only increased tensions for Ford but has amplified the pressure on Stellantis and General Motors as well. Recent indications from the UAW suggest that further strikes could be on the horizon, particularly targeting GM's assembly plant in Arlington, TX, which produces high-end SUVs like the Cadillac Escalade and Chevy Suburban. Such a move would significantly impact GM, given the profitability of these vehicles. Additionally, Stellantis might find itself in the crosshairs with its Ram pickup truck factories in Sterling Heights and Warren, MI, and two Jeep SUV factories in Detroit, which are high-profit centers.Sam Fiorani—vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions—has already raised alarms, suggesting that if GM and Stellantis do not present fresh offers soon, they are treading on thin ice.The financial implications of these strikes are staggering. Wells Fargo estimates Ford to incur weekly losses of around $150 million in core profit due to the ongoing strike at the Kentucky plant.Furthermore, the Anderson Economic Group's analysis reveals that the industry has been hit by a whopping $5.5 billion loss in just the initial three weeks of the strike, breaking down into lost wages and substantial losses for the Detroit 3 manufacturers, suppliers, and even dealers and customers.This financial toll encompasses $579 million in worker wages, $2.68 billion in losses incurred by the automakers, $1.60 billion for parts suppliers, and $1.26 billion in dealer and customer losses. Such a financial strain in an already competitive market puts a significant burden on the auto industry.While the automakers might have dodged a bullet last week with no strike expansion, the surprise strike at Ford’s Kentucky plant on Wednesday signals a potentially tumultuous narrative for the upcoming week. Fain's scheduled video address tonight might be the platform to announce the UAW's next strike targets in this high-stakes industrial showdown.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

However, the carrier guided for full-year earnings toward the low end of an earlier estimate due to an increase in fuel prices. United Airlines Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: UAL) and American Airlines Group (NASDAQ: AAL) are due to report their quarterly results this week.Third Quarter HighlightsFor the quarter that ended on September 30th, Delta made a revenue of $14.55 billion as sales rose 13% YoY but still coming a little short of the $14.56 billion expected. Trans-Atlantic travel particularly stood out among strong international travel demand but the airline did feel a pinch from the ongoing strikes in the automotive and entertainment industries.Net income rose 59% YoY $1.11 billion, or $1.72 per share while when adjusted earnings amounted to $2.03 as they excluded third-party refinery sales and other items, topping LSEG’s expectation by 8 cents.OutlookAs for the last three months of the year, Delta expects solid travel demand to continue and expand revenue from 9% to 12% YoY while guiding for per-share earnings in the range between $1.05 to $1.30, in line with estimates.With fuel prices pressures since July, Delta’s costs are in for a $400 million addition during the second half of the year. Delta now expects adjusted earnings between $6 and $6.25 per share this year, lowering its July’s forecast that was withing the range of $6 and $7 per share. Full year free cash flow estimate has also been cut from $3 billion to $2 billion.Delta Somewhat Eased ConcernsDelta CEO Ed Bastian claimed that the airline’s customers are in good financial health, easing concerns that consumers are cutting back on spending due to depletion of household savings, while also adding that the demand for overseas trips has stayed strong into autumn months, but it remains to be seen if this is the case both for United Airlines and American Airlines as last month, their ultra-low-cost peer Spirit Airlines Inc (NYSE: SAVE) cut its profit outlook for the third quarter due to intense promotional activity and steep discounting with Frontier Group Holdings (NASDAQ: ULCC) also offering very low fares in order to sell its flight tickets. Certainly, Delta raised the bar for United Airlines and American Airlines. Although Bastien acknowledged some discounting pressure, he does not categorize it as a ""material risk"" for Delta whose consumer is not the one purchasing the lower fares, just like the consumers of United Airlines and American Airlines who are 'traditional airlines'.Story continuesDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

Particularly,     personnel expenses of $1.77 billion declined 2% year over year due to lower variable compensation expenses, whereas other expenses dipped 1% to $788 million. Occupancy and equipment expenses increased 1%, respectively, to $244 million and $347 million year over year. As part of cost-containment measures, the company has undertaken a continuous improvement program to reduce cost reduction by $450 million in 2023.Moreover, in October 2023, PNC conducted an enterprise-wide review of the organizational structure to implement workforce reduction. The company has reduced its headcount by 4%, which will reduce personnel expenses by $325 million in 2024. Nonetheless, PNC will incur a one-time charge of $150 million in fourth-quarter 2023.Revenue Decline Dampens GrowthHowever, the bottom line reflects a 4.8% year-over-year dip on a revenue decline. Notably, total quarterly revenues were $5.23 billion, down 5.7% year over year. The top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.31 billion. Declines in net interest income (NII) and fee income affected the top line.Quarterly NII was $3.42 billion, which declined 1.6% from the year-ago quarter, whereas non-interest income fell 12.5% year over year to $1.82 billion. The fee income decline was due to a fall in almost all fee income components, except for card and cash management fees, lending and deposit services fees, and residential and commercial mortgage fees.Story continues4Q23 OutlookThe outlook is relative to the third quarter. The company expects average loans to be up 3% in the quarter. Management anticipates NII to decline 1-2%. Non-interest income is expected to rise 1%.

Let's bring in Gerard Cassidy, RBC Capital Markets analyst. And Gerard, one of the kind of magical words that we've been looking for, at least as has come up through some of our previous discussions as we were looking for what would be the tenor of this earnings season was cost discipline. Is there a kind of a magic word or a general theme that you expect to prevail over the course of this earnings season?GERARD CASSIDY: Yes. There is, in our opinion, and that's all going to do with credit quality. And as you know, the single most important issue for any bank is the trends in credit quality. Now there's also been, of course, topics such as the unrealized bond losses in their bond portfolios and margin pressure that's developed because deposit rates have moved higher.But in the long run, or when we look out over the next 12 to 18 months, I think it's all going to be focused on credit quality, which today is actually quite strong.- But Gerard, is that something that you think can stay intact? And also going back to what you just mentioned there about deposit rates. We talk about the fact that many of the larger banks, obviously, in a better position to weather some of that headwind right now, but how does that position some of the smaller, more regional players?Story continuesGERARD CASSIDY: It's a good question because when you take a look at credit quality, obviously, we all know about the downtown office space in big urban markets, that's a real troubled market. Most of the smaller regional banks are not exposed to that market. They generally have higher exposures to commercial real estate, but it's not in those downtown large office buildings in our big urban markets.And on the deposit side, the real key question what we have to focus on is when does the Federal Reserve reach its terminal rate for Fed funds? Because over the last four tightening cycles, around five to six months following the terminal rate for Fed funds, deposit rates stopped going up, and that's real positive for the banks because what happens is the cash flows coming off of the asset side of the balance sheet from securities and loans are reinvested at higher yields, helping their net interest margin expand.So the key question, again, is, when will the Fed reach its terminal rate? And in the past, that's been a real catalyst for bank stocks to do better.- For banks, especially as you were mentioning, some of the dynamic that they're going through right now where you do have some of the banks that are kind of carrying the most wealthy client base in the assets under management, and you think about what Goldman is potentially going to say, especially given the outflows that we've started to see, at least for some of those bank customers that have said, you know what? I want to sit on the sidelines outside of some of my typical investments now, and, perhaps, go into cash or go into other asset types. Where do you expect that to show up in some of the financial performance?GERARD CASSIDY: I think you put your finger on it because that old expression cash is king I think is coming back, when you can earn over 5% on your cash sitting in a money market mutual fund. So I think what you're going to hear from Goldman and others that have the wealth management business is that the inflows are still strong, but they're moving more into cash like products that have lower margins. The push into equities is kind of softened, and so assets are moving higher, but they're moving more into cash. And we would expect to hear not only Goldman talk about that, but Morgan Stanley as well when they release their numbers this week.]"

Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (ISRG), which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 5.47%.For the most recent quarter, Intuitive Surgical, Inc. Was expected to post earnings of $1.32 per share, but it reported $1.42 per share instead, representing a surprise of 7.58%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.19 per share, while it actually produced $1.23 per share, a surprise of 3.36%.With this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Intuitive Surgical, Inc.In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Intuitive Surgical, Inc. Has an Earnings ESP of +0.19% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on October 19, 2023.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

283,811bca26-b8b7-3897-a536-edd82864f2d8,RCL,2023-10-17,Time for CRUZ ETF as Cruise Industry's Prices Surge?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/time-cruz-etf-cruise-industrys-170000390.html,1697475600,STORY,['RCL'],"[As vacationers emerge into a post-pandemic travel world, cruises have made a spectacular comeback — and ticket prices are surging. Cruise operators such as Carnival CCL and Royal Caribbean RCL Cruises are setting some ticket prices higher than pre-pandemic levels and are indicating they may raise them further, even as they post pre-Covid profits. This trend puts the spotlight on Defiance Hotel, Airline, and Cruise ETF CRUZ.Ticket Prices on the RiseAccording to data from Cruise Critic, a cruise review site owned by Tripadvisor, the average price of a five-night cruise in the Caribbean for December of this year is $736, roughly 37% higher than the average price a year earlier. Compared to 2019, before the Covid-19 pandemic decimated the cruising industry, December ticket prices are up 43%, as quoted on CNBC.Cruise Companies Report Record HighsCarnival CEO Josh Weinstein said during a call with Wall Street analysts at the end of September that the company’s third-quarter net revenue per passenger per day reached a record high. The company’s booking volumes likewise hit an all-time high, pushing cruise occupancy and revenue beyond 2019 levels, he said.Especially as costs of labor, food and fuel continue to rise, Carnival executives noted on the call, the company, which owns multiple major cruise brands, is “well-positioned to drive 2024 pricing higher.” A Carnival spokesperson declined to comment on the company’s specific future pricing actions but said in a statement to CNBC that the company has been able to deliver a value of 25% to 50% over “comparable land-based vacation alternatives.” Carnival sees “ample headroom” to close that gap, the spokesperson said.Are High Prices Here to Stay?Aaron Saunders, a senior editor at Cruise Critic, said part of what’s driving the price surge is the comparison to high airfares. As inflation surges, airfare tickets have reached sky-high prices, with international airfare up 26% from 2019, according to an August estimate by fare-tracking company Hopper.Story continuesWith travelers facing higher costs across the broader sector, and considering cruises typically include additional amenities such as meals and entertainment, consumers are likely to gravitate in that direction, Saunders said.Industry's PerspectiveTruist Securities analyst Patrick Scholes said while rising oil prices are important to monitor for context for the cruise industry, there’s not enough of a correlation between that increase and the increase in cruise prices to explain the propped-up tickets.“They’re raising prices naturally — fuel or no fuel, the demand is there for them to be raising prices,” Scholes said.For now, the record-high ticket prices show no signs of slowing, according to Ashley Kosciolek, senior cruise writer at The Points Guy. Kosciolek noted that the industry is also seeing higher prices for beverage packages and add-on amenities that used to be included in fares, the CNBC article highlighted.CRUZ ETF in FocusThe underlying BlueStar Global Hotels, Airlines, and Cruises Index is a rules-based index that consists of globally-listed stocks of companies that derive at least 50% of their revenues from the passenger airline, hotel and resort, or cruise industries. Royal Caribbean (7.97%), Marriott (7.96%) and Hilton (7.54%) hold the top three spots in the fund.

This comparison sets the stage for a deeper exploration of the company's value.Unveiling Ross Stores (ROST)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideUnderstanding the GF ValueThe GF Value is a measure of a stock's intrinsic value, calculated based on historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line represents the fair value at which the stock should ideally trade. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued, and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST) appears to be fairly valued based on the GF Value calculation. With a market cap of $39.10 billion at its current price of $115.33 per share, the long-term return of Ross Stores' stock is likely to be close to the rate of its business growth.Unveiling Ross Stores (ROST)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right?

The Driehaus strategy applies the “buy high and sell higher"" theory, which is undoubtedly a successful investment approach that helped Richard Driehaus earn a place in Barron’s All-Century Team.To that end, stocks like Ross Stores, Chart Industries and REV Group have been selected as the momentum picks for the day using the Driehaus strategy.A Detailed Look Into the Driehaus StrategyRegarding the strategy, Driehaus once said: “I would much rather invest in a stock that’s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that’s already in decline and try to guess when it will turn around.” In line with this insight, the American Association of Individual Investors (“AAII”) considered the percentage 50-day moving average as one of the key criteria before creating a portfolio following Driehaus’ philosophy.It is calculated by dividing the numerator (month-end price minus 50-day moving average of month-end price) by the 50-day moving average of the month-end price. Another momentum indicator — positive relative strength — has also been included in this strategy. A positive percentage 50-day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50-day moving average level, indicating an uptrend.Moreover, AAII found that Driehaus primarily focuses on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers. Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy, which was made to provide better returns over the long term.Here are three of the 10 stocks:Story continuesRoss Stores operates as an off-price retailer of apparel and home accessories, primarily in the United States. It has a Momentum Score of B. The trailing four-quarter earnings surprise for ROST is 11.4%, on average.Chart Industries is a leading independent global manufacturer of highly engineered equipment servicing end-market applications.

New pharmaceutical drugs. Cutting-edge communication software. With so many disruptive technologies and innovations emerging every year, thousands of investor opportunities abound. These all present ways to capitalize upon potential future leaders in various niches. In 2022, investors saw the S&amp;P 500 growth index fall by 30%. While many growth companies suffered massive losses to that bear market, the advent of AI reignited several small and large-cap companies’ growth prospects. As the market continues to rebound, investors should keep an eye on these companies at the forefront of innovation. They stand poised to surge ahead of their competition in terms of revenue and earnings. Let’s explore the following seven companies that are developing solutions with the potential to deliver handsome returns.Adobe Inc. (ADBE)Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.Source: Tattoboo / ShutterstockAdobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is an American software company that develops software and services. Mainly known for flagship products of Creative Cloud and Photoshop, this market leader is currently priced at $530. It is expected to trade between a mean and high estimate of $602 and $660 by 27 Yahoo Finance analysts. Recently, Adobe has begun incorporating generative AI through Adobe Firefly and Adobe Sensei. This essentially automates monotonous tasks, helping artists speed up their creative process. It capitalizes on the AI market, which is expected to continue growing at a CAGR of 19.1% until 2032. ADBE’s strategy will further continue to strengthen its market dominance in the creative space.  Currently, Adobe’s P/E ratio is 47.36x, sitting at a relatively fair valuation compared to its 5-year average of 47.67x. However, this high ratio can largely be attributed to Adobe’s spike in price. That recently jumped by nearly 57% year to date (YTD). ADBE’s’ growth evidently continues, with year over year (YOY) quarterly earnings growing by  23.50%. Also, with net income holding at fair levels, the company remains a valuable addition to any investor’s portfolio looking to get a piece of the AI world.Story continuesInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY)Bristol-Myers Squib (BMY) logo displayed on a phone screenSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comBristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) is a biopharmaceutical company that has made strides in producing solutions relating to cardiovascular disease and immunology. Recently, BMY’s new lung cancer drug, Krazati, has helped it break further into the cancer drug industry. That sector is predicted to grow at a CAGR of 11.43% until 2023. In fact, the expansion will no doubt serve to help BMY maintain its growth prospects. Twenty Yahoo Finance analysts optimistically expect a 1-year price target of $55 to $90 with an average of $72.40.Recently, the biopharma company announced its acquisition of Mirati Therapeutics (MRTX), a company with an FDA-approved cancer drug that specifically targets lung cancer. This acquisition could help BMY step into a newly addressable market of upwards of 200,000 patients diagnosed with lung cancer every year.Looking at Bristol-Myers Squibb financials, EPS has been growing at an impressive 18.5% over the past year. Further, the company boasts an attractive P/E ratio of 15.08x, significantly discounted to its industry median of 28.09x. With BMY’s new acquisition only expected to help it maintain its high growth, BMY is an undervalued gem for investors looking to get ahead in the biotech industry. Nvidia Corporation (NVDA)Nvidia (NVDA) investment growth and profit trading concept.

290,13fe0987-e8d2-3265-940f-439def853723,RF,2023-10-17,Earnings Preview: Cadence (CADE) Q3 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-cadence-cade-q3-140016235.html,1697464816,STORY,['RF'],"[The market expects Cadence (CADE) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 23, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis bank is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.56 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -28.2%.Revenues are expected to be $460.81 million, down 4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.85% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Cadence?For Cadence, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.82%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Cadence will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Cadence would post earnings of $0.67 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.64, delivering a surprise of -4.48%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Cadence doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Banks - Southeast industry, Regions Financial (RF) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.59 per share for the quarter ended September 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +5.4%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $1.88 billion, up 0.9% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Regions Financial has remained unchanged. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.36%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that Regions Financial will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A new study finds that caregiving can increase the severity of menopause symptoms, Saudi Arabia is strengthening its women's soccer league, and Tapestry's chief didn't see herself as a CEO—until she redefined the job. Have a wonderful Monday!- New definition. Joanne Crevoiserat never saw herself as a CEO. “I’m not sure I’m the CEO type,” she recalls saying when, while serving as Abercrombie &amp; Fitch's CFO and then COO, she was asked why she didn't throw her hat in the ring for the retailer's open chief executive job.Today, Crevoiserat is the CEO of Tapestry, the company behind Coach and Kate Spade. Under her watch, Tapestry announced in August an $8.5 billion plan to acquire Capri Holdings, the parent of Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo. The deal would double Tapestry's revenue to $12 billion and is the largest fashion industry merger since the mid-2000s.So how did Crevoiserat go from publicity-shy C-suite exec to a CEO architecting an undeniably bold deal? She redefined her definition of ""CEO,"" she tells Fortune senior writer Phil Wahba in a new feature story.Joanne Crevoiserat, CEO of TapestryCrevoiserat came up as a finance exec, working at Walmart and Kohl's before Tapestry. She thought of CEOs as ""larger than life"" and didn't see herself that way. Rather than change who she was, she changed her perception of the top job.Crevoiserat is still not the loudest CEO in the room. She shies away from the flashy, even skipping flagship brand Coach's star-studded fashion show last month in favor of nosebleed seats at the U.S. Open. She sees her version of CEO not as a wallflower, but a ""behind-the-scenes player who provides direction and cohesion and comes up with the strategy around which the company will coalesce,"" Phil writes. That job description especially applies to a portfolio company like Tapestry, where other leaders and creatives are the faces of individual brands.Story continuesTapestry will need that steadying force as it seeks to pull off the integration of Capri, which analysts have said comes with a major ""execution risk."" Capri is in need of a turnaround, and its addition will make Tapestry a much more complex business.Read more about what lies ahead for Crevoiserat and Tapestry in Phil's feature.Emma Hinchliffeemma.hinchliffe@fortune.com@_emmahinchliffeThe Broadsheet is Fortune's newsletter for and about the world's most powerful women.

LRN, Deckers Outdoor Corp. DECK, Molina Healthcare, Inc. MOH and McKesson Corp. MCK.4 Stocks that Flaunt Impressive Interest Coverage RatiosGiven the current economic scenario, investors should gauge the changing market dynamics and accordingly chalk out a sturdy investment strategy. Well, you can simply arrive at a decision to buy or sell a particular stock by looking at its sales and earnings numbers. However, such a strategy does not always warrant superior returns when the market is facing myriad issues. A critical analysis of the company’s financial background is always required for a better investment decision.Well, a company should be sound enough to meet its financial obligations. This can be judged with coverage ratios — the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations. Here, we have discussed one such ratio called the interest coverage ratio.Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest &amp; Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.Stride, Inc., Deckers Outdoor Corp., Molina Healthcare, Inc. and McKesson Corp. are four stocks with an impressive interest coverage ratio.Why Interest Coverage Ratio?The interest coverage ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charged on its debt.Debt, which is crucial for most companies to finance operations, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profits of a company. The company’s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations. Therefore, the interest coverage ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.The interest coverage ratio suggests the number of times interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest.Story continuesAn interest coverage ratio lower than 1.0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardship. Definitely, one should also track the company’s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.Here are four of the 15 stocks that qualified the screening:Stride, a technology-based education company, carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a VGM Score of A.

324,20a38b83-f84f-34da-8cda-087cc078c61d,MCK,2023-10-17,4 Stocks That Flaunt an Impressive Interest Coverage Ratio,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-stocks-flaunt-impressive-interest-125100735.html,1697460660,STORY,"['MOH', 'MCK', 'DECK']","[Given the current economic scenario, investors should gauge the changing market dynamics and accordingly chalk out a sturdy investment strategy. Well, you can simply arrive at a decision to buy or sell a particular stock by looking at its sales and earnings numbers. However, such a strategy does not always warrant superior returns when the market is facing myriad issues. A critical analysis of the company’s financial background is always required for a better investment decision.Well, a company should be sound enough to meet its financial obligations. This can be judged with coverage ratios — the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations. Here, we have discussed one such ratio called the interest coverage ratio.Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest &amp; Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.Stride, Inc. LRN, Deckers Outdoor Corporation DECK, Molina Healthcare, Inc. MOH and McKesson Corporation MCK are four stocks with an impressive interest coverage ratio.Why Interest Coverage Ratio?The interest coverage ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charged on its debt.Debt, which is crucial for most companies to finance operations, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profits of a company. The company’s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations. Therefore, the interest coverage ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.The interest coverage ratio suggests the number of times interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than 1.0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardship. Definitely, one should also track the company’s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.Story continuesWhat’s the Strategy?Apart from having an interest coverage ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results.Interest coverage ratio greater than X-Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history.Projected EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years. This shows that the stock has near-term earnings growth potential.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.VGM Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are four of the 15 stocks that qualified the screening:Stride, a technology-based education company, carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a VGM Score of A.

325,114dee31-58f0-384c-9f65-e3165fe44332,APD,2023-10-17,It Pays to Be a Producer of Clean Hydrogen — and These Stocks Are Leading the Charge,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pays-producer-clean-hydrogen-stocks-234729012.html,1697500049,STORY,"['APD', 'LIN']","[We’re in the midst of a major economic transition, one that may eventually match the changes of the Industrial Revolution. The change, of course, is the advent of the green economy, and the switch from fossil fuel energy sources to renewable energy. While wind and solar power are soaking up the headlines, a more plausible long-term green power source is already near at hand: hydrogen.Hydrogen is the most abundant of all the chemical elements, and also the simplest by molecular structure. It is found everywhere; with carbon and oxygen, it forms the basis of the organic compounds that make life possible, and in the heart of the sun, its nuclear fusion generates the light and energy on which we all depend. Without hydrogen, we couldn’t exist.Hydrogen also offers high potential as fuel. It is highly reactive, and amenable to our technological control. As a fuel, it can be burned with oxygen to release both light and heat; as an element in fuel cells, it can generate clean electricity. Being so common, relatively simple technological processes – electrolysis powered from renewable sources and steam methane reforming associated with carbon capture and storage, to produce ‘green’ and ‘blue’ hydrogen respectively – can produce hydrogen at scale for industry and utilities.A recent report from Deutsche Bank’s David Begleiter points out that, due to recent initiatives of the Biden Administration, it pays for companies to produce clean hydrogen. The Department of Energy has announced $7 billion in funding for regional clean hydrogen hubs in the US, and the US government is working to promote demand for clean hydrogen.Begleiter, a 5-star analyst, has also been pointing out stocks that stand to gain as hydrogen use expands. We’ve used the TipRanks platform to look up the details on two of those picks, producers and distributors of industrial gasses, that are leaders in the sector – and that investors should watch them closely.Linde plc (LIN)Linde, the first company we’re looking at, was founded in Germany and traces its roots back to 1879. Today, the firm operates with a global footprint and has become the leading provider of atmospheric gases – argon, nitrogen, and oxygen – for industrial use, as well as other pure gases such as hydrogen, carbon monoxide, ammonia, and methanol. The company’s products have found uses in aquaculture, agriculture, chemistry, construction, electronics, healthcare; there is hardly a sector of our economy that does not make use of gases in some way.Story continuesAll of this isn’t just big business, it is huge. Linde has a market cap of $185 billion and generated over $33 billion in total revenues last year. Its gas business is supplemented by engineering services, in separating and pressurizing gases, developing and building systems for the liquefaction and storage of gases, thermal processes for recovering gases from industrial feedstocks, and developing the specialist equipment for the manufacture of industrial gases.When it comes to hydrogen, Linde has the long-term experience, the technical expertise, and the existing infrastructure to rapidly generate the gas in large quantities, to store it safely, and to ship it when and where it is needed. Linde already provides hydrogen for several industrial applications, including aviation, heavy industry, mobility, and power buffering.Linde’s oversized footprint in the industrial gas niche has been beneficial for both the company and its investors. Earnings are trending upward in recent quarters, and the firm’s stock is up 18% year-to-date. In its last quarterly financial release, for 2Q23, Linde showed an adjusted EPS of $3.57, beating the forecast by 9 cents and growing 15% from the prior-year quarter. The top-line result, however, was down ~5% year-over-year and missed the estimates by $500 million.For analyst Begleiter, all of this can be summed up in a simple list of achievements: “With Linde executing well on pricing and productivity, 18 consecutive earnings beats, a highly resilient business model, a $50B-plus and growing slate of clean energy investment opportunities and valuation a fair 27.0x ’23E EPS and 16.6x ’23E EBITDA, we reiterate our Buy rating.”That Buy rating comes along with a $450 price target suggesting ~19% one-year upside potential for the stock. (To watch Begleiter’s track record, click here)Overall, Linde gets a Strong Buy consensus rating from the Street’s analysts, supported by a decisive 13 to 1 Buy-over-Hold margin among the 14 analyst reviews on record. The shares are trading for $379.24, and the $434.86 average target price points toward ~15% upside on the one-year horizon. (See Linde stock forecast)Air Products and Chemicals (APD)Next up is Air Products and Chemicals, a Pennsylvania-based industrial gas firm. Like Linde above, Air Products provides a wide range of gases, including hydrogen, helium, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide, as well as the common atmospheric gases argon, nitrogen, and oxygen, along with the engineering and storage expertise to use them efficiently. The company’s products are found across the economy, in electronics, food and beverage, cement and lime, pulp and paper, rubber and plastics, food and medicine – the list is nearly endless.By the numbers, Air Products has an impressive footprint. The company operates in over 50 countries, employing more than 21,000 people to serve over 200,000 industrial customers. APD generates its products in a network of 750+ facilities and can transport gases through 1,800 miles of pipelines. The company posted $12.7 billion in sales for fiscal year 2022 and has ~$64 billion market cap.Earlier this year, Air Products announced that it had ‘closed the deal’ on an agreement with two partners, ACWA Power and NEOM Green Hydrogen, in the development of the world’s largest green hydrogen production facility. Air Products and NEOM concluded contracts worth $6.7 billion for engineering, procurement, and construction activities in the project.This announcement was only the latest in Air Products’ hydrogen activities. The company is deeply connected to the North American green hydrogen industry as part of its work to create a decarbonized economy.Air Products reported its results for Q3 of the fiscal year 2023 in early August, showing revenue of $3.03 billion. This was down 5% year-on-year and came in $260 million below expectations. However, the company’s bottom line was stronger. Earnings have been rising gradually over the past several quarters, and the fiscal Q3 2023 bottom line was $2.98, up 13.7% from fiscal Q3 2022 and 7 cents better than had been anticipated.Once again, we’re looking at a gas stock that Deutsche Bank’s David Begleiter sees in a generally bullish position. The analyst writes of Air Products, “With a large, green (blue/green hydrogen, carbon capture, SAF) and project backlog underpinning Air Products’ energy transition growth strategy and providing a line of sight to 10%-plus EPS growth over the next 5 years, a growing track record of large project execution and valuation a fair 22.3x ’24E EPS, we reiterate our Buy rating.”Looking ahead, Begleiter gives the shares a price target of $330 to go along with the Buy rating, implying a 15% potential gain in the coming year.Zooming out, we find that Air Products shares get a Moderate Buy consensus from the Street, based on 7 reviews that break down to 4 Buys and 3 Holds. The stock’s average price target of $328.71 suggests a gain of 14.5% from the current selling price of $287.12.

328,5e48a8e4-a1fe-3c20-be33-abc8f1ed1efc,FOX,2023-10-17,Are Fox Corporation's (NASDAQ:FOXA) Fundamentals Good Enough to Warrant Buying Given The Stock's Recent Weakness?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fox-corporations-nasdaq-foxa-fundamentals-184829085.html,1697482109,STORY,['FOXA'],"[Fox (NASDAQ:FOXA) has had a rough three months with its share price down 7.4%. However, the company's fundamentals look pretty decent, and long-term financials are usually aligned with future market price movements. In this article, we decided to focus on Fox's  ROE.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. View our latest analysis for Fox How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Fox is:12% = US$1.3b ÷ US$11b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.12 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.A Side By Side comparison of Fox's Earnings Growth And 12% ROEAt first glance, Fox seems to have a decent ROE. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 11%. As you might expect, the 8.6% net income decline reported by Fox is a bit of a surprise. So, there might be some other aspects that could explain this. These include low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital.Story continuesThat being said, we compared Fox's performance with the industry and were concerned when we found that while the company has shrunk its earnings, the industry has grown its earnings at a rate of 10% in the same 5-year period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is FOXA fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Fox Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Fox's low three-year median payout ratio of 19% (or a retention ratio of 81%) over the last three years should mean that the company is retaining most of its earnings to fuel its growth but the company's earnings have actually shrunk. This typically shouldn't be the case when a company is retaining most of its earnings. It looks like there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline.Moreover, Fox has been paying dividends for four years, which is a considerable amount of time, suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer consistent dividends even though earnings have been shrinking. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 18% of its profits over the next three years. As a result, Fox's ROE is not expected to change by much either, which we inferred from the analyst estimate of 13% for future ROE.ConclusionIn total, it does look like Fox has some positive aspects to its business. However, given the high ROE and high profit retention, we would expect the company to be delivering strong earnings growth, but that isn't the case here. This suggests that there might be some external threat to the business, that's hampering its growth.

Robinson (CHRW) Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-investors-avoid-c-121000506.html,1697458200,STORY,"['CHRW', 'FDX']","[C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. CHRW is currently mired in multiple headwinds, which we believe, have made it an unimpressive investment option.Let’s delve deeper.Southward Earnings Estimate Revisions: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings has been revised 5.7% downward over the past 60 days. For the current year, the consensus mark for earnings has moved 2.7% south in the same time frame. The unfavorable estimate revisions indicate brokers’ lack of confidence in the stock.Weak Zacks Rank and Style Score: C.H. Robinson currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Moreover, the company’s current Value Style Score of C shows its unattractiveness.Unimpressive Price Performance: CHRW has declined 12.8% over the past year against its industry’s 16.7% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOther Headwinds:  C.H. Robinson's second-quarter 2023 total revenues of $4421.9 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4646.5 million and plunged 35% year over year owing to lower pricing in the company’s ocean and truckload services. Also, quarterly earnings of 90 cents per share dipped 66.2% year over year.Quarterly results were impacted by soft freight markets globally. Weak demand, high inventories and excess capacity led to a more competitive marketplace and subdued transportation rates.Adjusted gross profit fell 35.5% year over year to $665.5 million in second-quarter 2023 due to lower adjusted gross profit per transaction in truckload and ocean. Adjusted operating margin of 19.9% contracted 2,560 basis points.Bearish Industry Rank: The industry, to which CHRW belongs, currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 235 (of 250 plus groups). Such an unfavorable rank places CHRW in the bottom 6% of the Zacks industries. Studies show that 50% of a stock price movement is directly related to the performance of the industry group it belongs to.A mediocre stock within a strong group is likely to outclass a robust stock in a weak industry. Therefore, reckoning the industry’s performance becomes imperative.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks for investors interested in the Zacks Transportation sector are FedEx Corporation FDX and Ryder System R.FDX’s consistent efforts to reward shareholders through dividends and buybacks are encouraging. It presently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).FedEx's liquidity position is also impressive. To navigate the weaker-than-expected business environment, FDX is cutting costs.Ryder, which currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is benefiting from its consistent efforts to reward shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings and revenues is pegged at 73 cents per share and $24.38 billion, respectively.The consensus mark for TSLA’s third-quarter earnings per share has moved south by 5 cents in the past seven days. The estimate for the bottom line, however, implies a year-over-year decline of 30.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues, however, suggests a year-over-year rise of 13.6%.Tesla surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the last reported quarter on record deliveries and revenues. Over the trailing four quarters, the electric vehicle (EV) king beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on all occasions, with the average being 7.94%. This is depicted in the graph below:Tesla, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseTesla, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseTesla, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Tesla, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayAfter reporting record deliveries for the first two quarters of 2023, Tesla witnessed a sequential fall in its deliveries for the September quarter. The company delivered 435,059 (15,985 Model S/X and 419,074 Model 3/Y) vehicles worldwide in the third quarter, topping our model estimate of 428,141 and increasing 26.5% increase from the year-ago levels. However, the deliveries marked a 6.6% sequential decline from 446,140 vehicles delivered in the second quarter of 2022.Tesla produced 430,488 (416,800 Model 3/Y, and 13,688 Model S/X) vehicles during the quarter, up 17.6% on a yearly basis but down from 479,700 units produced in the second quarter of 2023.The sequential decline in production and delivery volumes was due to planned factory shutdowns for an upgrade.Additionally, Tesla slashed prices on its inventory vehicles and existing models throughout the third quarter, which is expected to have put pressure on its gross margins. We expect gross profit from the automotive segment to decline 26.4%.Story continuesOperating margin is also likely to have been impacted by continued investments in capacity expansion of not just vehicle factories but also supercharging network service, internal applications and battery processes. We expect the metric to decline 170 basis points sequentially.Meanwhile, the company is benefiting from increasing energy generation and storage revenues, thanks to the positive reception of Megapack and Powerwall products. Tesla is ramping up production at a dedicated Megapack factory to meet rising demand. These factors are likely to contribute positively to the upcoming results.Our estimate for Services/Other unit is pegged at $2.35 billion, implying growth of 43% year over year and 9% quarter over quarter. We expect revenues from the Energy Generation/Storage segment at $1.57 billion, suggesting growth of 40.6% and 4% on a yearly and a sequential basis, respectively.What Does Our Model Say?Our proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Tesla this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. That is not the case here.Earnings ESP: Tesla has an Earnings ESP of -2.74%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate is pegged 2 cents lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

341,9ad37303-49b6-3bee-82b6-d30f8b13610a,DIS,2023-10-17,Disney turns 100. Here’s a look back at price changes over the years—including the $1 ticket when Disneyland opened in 1955,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/disney-turns-100-look-back-155027597.html,1697471427,STORY,['DIS'],"[One hundred years ago today, Walt Disney and his brother Roy signed an agreement to form Disney Bros. Studios, which would produce a live-action/animated film series called The Alice Comedies.Walt himself starred in the first of the shorts, but they would hardly be the sort of things an empire was built upon. The real turning point would come five years later with the release of Steamboat Willie and the introduction of Mickey Mouse to the world.A lot has changed since then, of course. Disney has become an entertainment giant, breaking new ground in animation, theme parks, and more. But with that success—and the rising cost of living—enjoying all that Disney has to offer costs a fair bit more than it used to.Here’s a look at how prices have changed for many popular Disney offerings since their start, many of which came into existence long, long after the company got its start.A ticket to DisneylandDisneyland opened in Anaheim, Calif., in 1955 and set the new standard for theme parks, despite a horrendous first day, when the asphalt on Main Street, U.S.A. melted under people’s feet. Also, fake tickets flooded the park, and the drinking fountains weren’t working. Park employees came to call it “Black Sunday” because of all the things that went wrong. They eventually got better, of course, and the park became a model for others around the world.The price of an opening day ticket was $1 ($11.53, when adjusted for inflation). At the time, though, parkgoers had to pay extra for each ride, with prices starting at 10 cents for kids and 23 cents for adults ($1.15 to $2.65 in today’s dollars).Today, a single park admission will get you on pretty much every ride, but you’ll pay a lot more. A single-day ticket will run anywhere from $104 to $194, depending on the day you choose. If you want to hop between Disneyland and Disney California Adventure on the same day, add $65 to that price.A ticket to Walt Disney WorldWalt Disney World didn’t open until 1971, five years after Walt Disney’s death. Opened on a weekday, it saw moderate crowds at first but has become an international destination for tourists.Story continuesAdmission to the park cost $3.50 ($27.07 after inflation adjustments), but like Disneyland, parkgoers needed to buy separate tickets for most rides.Today, a single-day ticket ranges from $144 to $189—and adding park hopping can increase that price as high as $272. (And prices of other incidentals at the park were increased just last week.)Parking at DisneylandFolks who drove to Disneyland in its early days were charged just 25 cents to park their cars. In 2023, the price is $35 per car or motorcycle—and $55 if you want a preferred space. (It will cost you $40 if you’ve got an oversize vehicle or motor home, with no preferred option available.)The cost of animationDisney spent a reported $200 million to create Elemental, its latest Pixar release.Steamboat Willie, per Roy Disney’s ledgers, cost $4,986.69, which also included the cost of prints for theaters.The cost of a movie ticketSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs, released in 1937, was Disney’s first feature-length film. It broke new ground in animation and storytelling, was nominated for an Academy Award and, at the time, was the highest-grossing film of all time.A ticket to see it would have cost you 25 cents ($5.58 in today’s dollars). A ticket to the upcoming Wish will run you as high as $22, depending on where you live and whether you choose the standard or 3D version of the film.Disney+It’s one of the newest forms of revenue for Disney, but prices have already increased substantially for the streaming service.The service initially cost just $6.99 per month. As of Oct. 12, the ad-free version now runs $14 per month.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com]"

This will lower cloud and data center operator's TCO and increase their general compute capacity by freeing up CPU cores for more user applications.Formed in 2022 by the Linux Foundation, OPI's mission is to foster a community-driven, standards-based open ecosystem for next-generation architectures and frameworks based on DPU technologies. OPI is designed to facilitate the simplification of network, storage and security APIs within applications to enable more portable and performant applications in the cloud and data center across DevOps, SecOps and NetOps.Specifically, the demo use case is an F5 NGINX container acting as a proxy for traffic destined to a workload running on either the DPU host or on separate hosts. The NGINX container is running in a single node OpenShift installation on the Arm® Neoverse™-based Marvell OCTEON 10 DPU.""The Open Programmable Infrastructure project is excited to showcase its first real-world use case for an OPI-enabled DPU, with a demonstration running on an Arm-based Marvell OCTEON 10 DPU,"" said Paul Pindell, chair of the OPI Outreach Working Group. ""OPI can now start using this use case within our testing lab infrastructure used for our Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery workflows against example DPUs from multiple OPI member vendors.""Story continues""Applications are increasingly important to our customers' ongoing digital transformation efforts. Along the way, the need to make them more reliable, cheaper, and secure to operate is critical to their future needs and their bottom line. F5 believes that DPU technologies hold the key to reaching all three of these outcomes for our customers,"" said Joel Moses, CTO of platforms &amp; systems at F5, and OPI board member. ""This OPI technology demonstration directly points out what Marvell's DPU can do towards achieving these aims, with notably increased web application security, performance, and reliability supplied by running our industry-leading NGINX. We are pleased to work with Marvell and Arm to demonstrate this first OPI use case.""""Marvell's participation in OPI is driven by our belief in enabling more use cases for DPUs to support high-speed network compute and network capabilities required by AI and 5G,"" said Cary Ussery, vice president, platforms and software, Compute and Custom Business Unit, at Marvell. ""Marvell is committed to collaborating with key players, like F5, to drive the ecosystem forward. In addition, this highlights the need for more processing in the DPU using the power of the Arm Neoverse N2 cores on the OCTEON 10 family of DPUs.""""Arm's collaboration with Marvell and F5 to showcase the first OPI use case on an Arm-based DPU demonstrates the flexibility and versatility of the Neoverse N2 platform, and the effectiveness of leveraging Arm's pervasive software ecosystem,"" said Eddie Ramirez, vice president of go-to-market, Infrastructure Line of Business, at Arm. ""OPI is an important project to drive the standardization and innovation of DPU technologies across the industry, and we are happy to be part of it.""The 2023 OCP Global Summit takes place October 17-19, 2023, at the San Jose Convention Center.

NDAQ is slated to report third-quarter 2023 earnings on Oct 18, before the opening bell. The company delivered an earnings surprise in each of the last two reported quarters of 2023.Factors to ConsiderSolid organic revenue growth, strong performance at Market Platforms businesses, data and listing services revenues and contributions from the Adenza acquisition are likely to have aided Nasdaq’s third-quarter performance.Improved performance at Market Technology, Market Data and Analytics businesses is expected to have benefited non-trading revenues.Data revenues are likely to have benefited from growth in recurring data revenues across its international footprint.Improved trade management services and market technology are likely to have aided theMarketplace Technology business.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $92 million.Expenses are likely to have increased owing to the development and diversification of its business, compensation and benefits, merger and strategic initiatives, restructuring charges, general, administrative and other expenses. These are expected to have weighed on margin expansion.Due to the timing of expected expenses, the company expects a greater sequential increase in expenses in the third quarter. We expect the metric to increase 8.9% to $453.9 million.The continued share buyback is anticipated to have provided an additional boost to the bottom line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at 67 cents, indicating a 1.5% decrease from the prior-year reported figure.Story continuesQ3 VolumesNasdaq reported soft volumes for third-quarter 2023.

NDAQ may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Nasdaq is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for NDAQ in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 68 cents per share for NDAQ, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 67 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for NDAQ, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.09% heading into earnings season.Nasdaq, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseNasdaq, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseNasdaq, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Nasdaq, Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that NDAQ has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Nasdaq, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

346,a9adff14-0ea7-3263-b476-c00673b29c4b,CL,2023-10-17,Don't Buy Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) For Its Next Dividend Without Doing These Checks,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dont-buy-colgate-palmolive-company-112836151.html,1697542116,STORY,['CL'],"[Some investors rely on dividends for growing their wealth, and if you're one of those dividend sleuths, you might be intrigued to know that Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) is about to go ex-dividend in just 2 days. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Thus, you can purchase Colgate-Palmolive's shares before the 20th of October in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 15th of November.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.48 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$1.92 to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Colgate-Palmolive has a trailing yield of approximately 2.7% on its current stock price of $72.15. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. View our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Colgate-Palmolive paid out 105% of its earnings, which is more than we're comfortable with, unless there are mitigating circumstances. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Over the last year it paid out 73% of its free cash flow as dividends, within the usual range for most companies.It's disappointing to see that the dividend was not covered by profits, but cash is more important from a dividend sustainability perspective, and Colgate-Palmolive fortunately did generate enough cash to fund its dividend. Still, if the company repeatedly paid a dividend greater than its profits, we'd be concerned. Very few companies are able to sustainably pay dividends larger than their reported earnings.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?When earnings decline, dividend companies become much harder to analyse and own safely. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. So we're not too excited that Colgate-Palmolive's earnings are down 4.6% a year over the past five years.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Colgate-Palmolive has lifted its dividend by approximately 4.5% a year on average. That's intriguing, but the combination of growing dividends despite declining earnings can typically only be achieved by paying out a larger percentage of profits. Colgate-Palmolive is already paying out 105% of its profits, and with shrinking earnings we think it's unlikely that this dividend will grow quickly in the future.The Bottom LineShould investors buy Colgate-Palmolive for the upcoming dividend? It's never fun to see a company's earnings per share in retreat. Worse, Colgate-Palmolive's paying out a majority of its earnings and more than half its free cash flow. Positive cash flows are good news but it's not a good combination. Overall it doesn't look like the most suitable dividend stock for a long-term buy and hold investor.With that being said, if you're still considering Colgate-Palmolive as an investment, you'll find it beneficial to know what risks this stock is facing. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 3 warning signs with Colgate-Palmolive and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see. Here's a curated list of interesting stocks that are strong dividend payers.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.Top 5 Upgrades: Loop Capital upgraded Wayfair (W) to Hold from Sell with a price target of $50, down from $60. The company's revenue trend is shifting into growth territory in the current quarter, and while growth should bounce around given the volatile comps, the overall trend should be positive, the firm argues.Jefferies upgraded Pfizer (PFE) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $39, up from $38., after the company updated its fiscal 2023 guide, citing COVID revenue by $9B, and announced a cost cut program. The firm says the guidance revision is largely driven by Paxlovid as Comirnaty performance was ahead of buy-side expectations.UBS upgraded UnitedHealth (UNH) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $640, up from $520. The firm believes the ""strong"" Q3 release from UnitedHealth is a ""clearing event that should pave the way for improved valuation for the stock.""Stifel upgraded Colgate-Palmolive (CL) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $81, down from $85. The upgrade of Colgate reflects modest multiple expansion on improving fundamentals coupled with an ""undemanding"" current valuation, the firm analyst tells investors in a research note.Morgan Stanley upgraded Check Point (CHKP) to Equal Weight from Underweight with a price target of $144, up from $118. The firm thinks consensus estimates are now achievable, while the stock's valuation is ""undemanding."" JD.com head office in Beijing. (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Top 5 Downgrades:Bernstein downgraded JD.com (JD) to Market Perform from Outperform with a price target of $31, down from $55. The firm notes JD.com's shares have been on a downward trajectory for most of this year, and fell sharply after the company signaled a much weaker trajectory for the remainder of 2023 than the Street had expected.Jefferies downgraded Verisk Analytics (VRSK) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $247, down from $265. The stock's valuation now appears full as Verisk's multiple has expanded to a record level above peers and further expansion is unlikely as growth moderates to more normal levels, says Jefferies.BMO Capital downgraded Enphase Energy (ENPH) to Market Perform from Outperform with a price target of $148, down from $175. The trough in U.S. residential solar demand appears to be deeper than anticipated and the timing of a recovery is uncertain, the firm says.Goldman Sachs downgraded KB Home (KBH) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $48, down from $54. The firm sees less upside to KB verses peers in the current operating environment.RBC Capital downgraded Crown Castle (CCI) to Sector Perform from Outperform with a price target of $100, down from $125. The downgrade reflects a lack of near-term catalysts for the stock, questions around the path of dividend growth relative to net leverage, and uncertainties around the pace of small cell/fiber growth, the firm says.Story continuesAn instacart delivery in Washington, DC on October 07, 2023. (Craig Hudson for The Washington Post via Getty Images) (The Washington Post via Getty Images)Top 5 Initiations: Citi initiated coverage of Instacart (CART) with a Buy rating and $34 price target. The firm says improving order efficiencies, growth of its higher-margin advertising business, and the launch of new ad products should lead to margin expansion for Instacart. Barclays, JPMorgan, JMP Securities, Oppenheimer, Baird, Stifel, Piper Sandler, and Goldman Sachs started the name with Buy-equivalent ratings. Meanwhile, BofA and Wedbush initiated Instacart with Neutral-equivalent ratings.Truist initiated coverage of Klaviyo (KVYO) with a Buy rating and $42 price target. The firm believes platform differentiation along with a proven go-to-market engine with emerging upside drivers could help the company maintain ""best-in-class"" sales growth ""while impressively scaling profits and cash flow."" Piper Sandler, Baird, William Blair, TD Cowen, Needham, Mizuho, and Canaccord started the name with Buy-equivalent ratings. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanely, Citi, Barclays, and Goldman Sachs initiated the stock with Neutral-equivalent ratings.Leerink initiated coverage of DexCom (DXCM) with an Outperform rating and $110 price target. Recent volatility in the shares has been largely driven by perceived headwinds to growth from broader GLP-1 adoption, but the firm's work suggests this will have limited impact on DexCom's ability to sustain double-digit growth over the intermediate term.Leerink initiated coverage of Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) with an Outperform rating and $342 price target. Leerink continues see an attractive setup for Intuitive Surgical's shares, with its analysis suggesting the total impact from declining bariatric procedure growth on Intuitive Surgical's total revenue is unlikely to surpass 5% even in the most extreme circumstances, while new market entrants on the horizon could ultimately help accelerate the overall growth of the surgical robotics market without capturing significant share from it. The firm also started coverage of Insulet (PODD), Vericel (VCEL), ShockWave (SWAV), Procept BioRobotics (PRCT), Axonics (AXNX), and AxoGen (AXGN) with Outperform ratings.Janney Montgomery Scott initiated coverage of Nextracker (NXT) with a Buy rating and $43 fair value estimate. Nextracker is the ""leading provider"" of tracking hardware for utility-scale PV developments and is well positioned within the U.S., where the firm expects the company to be a beneficiary of IRA tax credits both on an indirect and direct basis.]"
348,b7a99000-c546-3566-9a9d-9d6f509f6198,CL,2023-10-17,What Awaits Philip Morris (PM) as It Queues for Q3 Earnings?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/awaits-philip-morris-pm-queues-121900475.html,1697458740,STORY,"['PM', 'SAM', 'CL']","[Philip Morris International Inc. PM is likely to register top-and-bottom-line growth when it reports third-quarter 2023 earnings on Oct 19. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $9.2 billion, suggesting a rise of 14.3% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.The consensus mark for quarterly earnings has risen by 1.3% in the past seven days to $1.61 per share, implying growth of 5.2% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. Philip Morris has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 7.6%, on average.Factors to NotePhilip Morris has been benefiting from its strong pricing power. Though higher pricing might lead to a possible decline in cigarette consumption, it is seen that smokers tend to absorb price increases due to the addictive quality of cigarettes. Higher pricing variance was an upside to the company’s performance (mainly due to increased combustible tobacco pricing) in the second quarter of 2023. Pricing is likely to have remained a driver in the quarter under review as well.Philip Morris’ focus on a smoke-free future has been working well. The company is progressing well with its business transformation, with smoke-free products generating 35.4% of its net revenues in the second quarter of 2023. PM is well-placed to become a majority smoke-free company by 2025. Toward this end, the company’s IQOS, a heat-not-burn device, counts among one of the leading RRPs in the industry.In the second quarter of 2023, revenues from smoke-free products (excluding Wellness and Healthcare) jumped 35.3% to $3,101 million (up 18.3% organically). Total IQOS users at the end of the second quarter were estimated at roughly 27.2 million (including nearly 19.4 million who switched to IQOS and stopped smoking).For the third quarter, management expects heated tobacco unit (HTU) shipment volumes of 31-33 billion units. We expect smoke-free product revenues (excluding Wellness and Healthcare) to increase 26.1% in the third quarter. Further, our model suggests total HTU shipment volume growth of 17.9% to 32.4 billion units in the third quarter.Story continuesPhilip Morris International Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurprisePhilip Morris International Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Philip Morris International Inc. QuoteHowever, PM has been battling cost-related headwinds for a while now. In the second quarter of 2023, the adjusted operating income was somewhat affected by global inflationary headwinds associated with direct materials, tobacco leaf, energy and wages. On its last earnings call, management highlighted intentions to make additional growth-oriented investments, including the commercialization of ILUMA. These may have impacted margins in the quarter under review. Our model suggests an adjusted operating margin contraction of 90 basis points for the third quarter.Apart from this, soft cigarette shipment volumes have been a concern. Cigarette volumes, in general, have been affected by consumers’ rising health consciousness and a shift to low-risk tobacco alternatives. In the second quarter of 2023, cigarette shipment volumes dropped 0.4% to 157 billion units.  Our model suggests a 2.1% decline in cigarette shipment volumes for the third quarter.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Philip Morris this time. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is not the case here.Philip Morris carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and has an Earnings ESP of -0.31%.

The company is likely to register bottom-line growth when it reports third-quarter 2023 numbers.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for The Boston Beer Company’s quarterly revenues is pegged at $592.8 million, indicating a drop of 0.6% from the figure reported in the prior-year quarter.Colgate-Palmolive Company CL currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.37% and a Zacks Rank of 3. The company is likely to register increases in the top and bottom lines when it reports third-quarter 2023 results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Colgate-Palmolive’s quarterly revenues is pegged at $4.8 billion, suggesting growth of 8% from the figure reported in the prior-year quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings has remained unchanged in the last 30 days at 80 cents per share, which indicates 8.1% growth from the year-ago quarter's reported number. CL delivered an earnings surprise of 1.7%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.Hershey HSY currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.29% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is likely to register a top-and-bottom-line increase when it reports third-quarter 2023 numbers. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly earnings per share of $2.47 suggests a 13.8% rise from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Hershey’s quarterly revenues is pegged at about $3 billion, calling for growth of nearly 9% from the figure reported in the prior-year quarter.

The networking upgrades include the Juniper Networks EX Series and Wireless Access Points, Wired and Wi-Fi Assurance services, as well as Marvis™ Virtual Network Assistant driven by Mist AI, enhancing networking capabilities across PayNet’s campus sites and remote command center.As Malaysia’s national provider of financial market utilities, PayNet processed MYR$1 trillion in consumer, business and financial market transactions in 2022 alone. In addition to the growth of its cross-border international payment linkages, PayNet powers a comprehensive array of popular services that have entrenched themselves as indispensable to Malaysia’s digital-savvy population of over 33 million people, including cashless payments (DuitNow), bill payments (FPX), inter-bank transfers (IBG) and the nation-wide shared ATM network.With these volumes on an expected upward trajectory, the company recognized a need for a campus network refresh to provide its over 500 staff at its modern headquarters with a better in-office digital experience, especially as it embraced a hybrid work model. Juniper’s campus network solutions stood out during PayNet’s evaluation, offering a future-proof solution rich in automation and AIOps, providing performance, consistency, ease of management, and the ability to seamlessly scale as it grows.All powered by the Juniper Mist™ Cloud, Juniper’s AP32 and AP43 provide Wi-Fi 6 accessibility over an EVPN-VXLAN topology, providing consistency, longevity and scalability powered by EX3400 and EX4650 switches. The upgrades have allowed PayNet to do away with complicated command-line interface and on-premises setups while providing seamless connectivity across its two buildings. Furthermore, PayNet was able to integrate the buildings’ various IoT devices, such as CCTVs and smart TVs, into the new network.Story continuesIn addition, Wired and Wi-Fi Assurance services driven by Mist AI, have helped automate and streamline network operations for PayNet’s engineers. The Marvis Juniper Network Assistant, for example, helps determine the root cause of issues, offering proactive insights and prescriptive actions – beneficial as they operate out of a remote command center. This has allowed the team to see a significant decrease in tickets related to connectivity issues since implementing Juniper’s upgrades, ultimately driving better user experiences across the network.As PayNet gears up for local and regional expansion, they look forward to achieving further integration with Juniper’s Mist AI solutions. The strategic network refresh by Juniper has allowed PayNet to enhance the on-campus experience for both employees and guests, all while firmly positioning PayNet for future growth across local and regional payment infrastructures.Supporting Quotes:""It is always gratifying to support partners who enable essential services for the everyday lives of their customers. We are proud to play an important role in PayNet’s network infrastructure – just as their mission is to build an inclusive, accessible, and efficient payments and financial ecosystem for Malaysians; ours is to enable them with the best networking solutions that technology has to offer. It has been a privilege to witness their growth journey across the region and the world, and we look forward to deepening our collaboration as they continue to grow.""- Perry Sui, Area Vice President, ASEAN &amp; Taiwan, Juniper Networks""At PayNet, our objective is to provide the nation with an economical and agile payments platform that can respond swiftly to innovation while ensuring that demand for our services can be met in a timely and effective manner.

351,a8b6dcf0-b818-376c-9d3a-ae2e7b7f1abd,DVN,2023-10-17,Great week for Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) institutional investors after losing 24% over the previous year,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/great-week-devon-energy-corporation-140013580.html,1697464813,STORY,['DVN'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Devon Energy's stock price is sensitive to their trading actionsA total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 45% ownershipUsing data from analyst forecasts alongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a companyEvery investor in Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 70% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).After a year of 24% losses, last week’s 11% gain would be welcomed by institutional investors as a likely sign that returns might start trending higher.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Devon Energy. Check out our latest analysis for Devon Energy ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Devon Energy?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Devon Energy already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Devon Energy's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Devon Energy. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 12% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.1% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 6.5% of the company stock.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Devon EnergyThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that Devon Energy Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$191m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 30% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Devon Energy. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Devon Energy better, we need to consider many other factors. Be aware that  Devon Energy is showing  4 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 2 of those shouldn't be ignored...If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.On top of the Zacks Rank, investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will want to focus on the ""Value"" category. Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and ""A"" grades for Value will be some of the highest-quality value stocks on the market today.One stock to keep an eye on is Devon Energy (DVN). DVN is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and an A for Value. The stock holds a P/E ratio of 7.09, while its industry has an average P/E of 8.81. Over the past 52 weeks, DVN's Forward P/E has been as high as 9.20 and as low as 6.39, with a median of 7.59.Investors should also note that DVN holds a PEG ratio of 0.14. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. DVN's industry has an average PEG of 0.26 right now. Over the last 12 months, DVN's PEG has been as high as 0.18 and as low as 0.12, with a median of 0.15.Finally, our model also underscores that DVN has a P/CF ratio of 4.16. This data point considers a firm's operating cash flow and is frequently used to find companies that are undervalued when considering their solid cash outlook. DVN's P/CF compares to its industry's average P/CF of 4.85. Over the past 52 weeks, DVN's P/CF has been as high as 5.99 and as low as 3.60, with a median of 4.47.Story continuesAnother great Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States stock you could consider is Earthstone Energy (ESTE), which is a # 1 (Strong Buy) stock with a Value Score of A.Additionally, Earthstone Energy has a P/B ratio of 1.15 while its industry's price-to-book ratio sits at 2.62. For ESTE, this valuation metric has been as high as 1.19, as low as 0.70, with a median of 0.85 over the past year.Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that Devon Energy and Earthstone Energy are likely undervalued currently.

For one, if the latest war begins to spread beyond Israel and the Palestinians, oil prices could push even higher. For example, if Israel finds that Iran was behind the attack and launched retaliation, the Strait of Hormuz could be jeopardized.In fact, as noted by MarketWatch, “Iran remains a very big wild card and we will be watching how strongly [Israeli] Prime Minister Netanyahu blames Tehran for facilitating these attacks by providing Hamas with weapons and logistical support,” said Helima Croft, head of global commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets.Further, there are calls for U.S. sanctions against Iran with the latest situation — which could tighten Iranian oil exports. Lastly, the U.S. is dealing with tight oil supplies. That being said, investors may want to go long on energy stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsEnergy Stocks: Exxon Mobil (XOM)Exxon Mobil logo outside of a corporate buildingSource: Harry Green / Shutterstock.comAfter diving from about $120 to $106, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) is just starting to pivot higher. In fact, from its current price of $110.92, I’d like to see XOM initially refill its bearish gap at $116. Helping, analysts have been raising their price targets. TD Cowen, for example, raised its target to $110 from $107. Bank of America raised its target to $150 from $145. We also have to consider that potential U.S. sanctions on Iranian crude exports could jolt the market, too.Outside of the war, Exxon just said oil prices could boost its upstream earnings by $900 million to $1.3 billion in the third quarter. It also expects to see operating profits of between $8.3 billion and $ 11.4 billion, as compared to expectations for $9.2 billion. We also have to consider OPEC wants to stabilize crude around $90 a barrel – which should bode well for XOM as well.XOM also carries a dividend yield of 3.3% at the moment. In September, XOM paid out a 91-cent dividend. We should see a similar payout again soon.Story continuesDevon Energy (DVN)An image of a hand holding a smartphone displaying the Devon Energy Corporation logo in front of a computer screenSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comAnother wildly oversold oil stock just starting to rebound is Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN). After plunging from $52.50 to $42.50, DVN caught strong double-bottom support and is starting to move higher. Last trading at $46.10, I’d like to see DVN again challenge $52.50 initially.Bank of America just raised its price target on DVN to $58 from $54. Even Mizuho just raised its target price to $60 from $62. Also, with strong profits and capital returns, Devon Energy is severely undervalued, as compared to its competition. Better, DVN currently yields 10.85%.SPDR S&amp;P Oil &amp; Gas Exploration &amp; Production ETF (XOP)In the field, the oil pump in the evening, the evening silhouette of the pumping unit, the silhouette of the oil pump. Oil stocks and energy stocksSource: zhengzaishuru / Shutterstock.comIf you’d rather diversify – at less cost – there are ETFs such as the SPDR S&amp;P Oil &amp; Gas Exploration &amp; Production ETF (NYSEARCA:XOP). With an expense ratio of 0.35%, the ETF provides exposure to the oil and gas exploration and production segment of the market. At the moment, some of its key holdings include Callon Petroleum (NYSE:CPE), SM Energy Company (NYSE:SM), Devon Energy, EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG), and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP).After dropping from about $152.50 to $135, the XOP ETF caught strong support and is just starting to pivot higher. Last trading at $145.24, I’d like to see it again challenge overhead resistance around $152.50.

Please see our Notes and Definitions for further explanation.   Adjusted EBITDA. We use Adjusted EBITDA attributable to common stockholders/unitholders (""Adjusted EBITDA""), a non-GAAP financial measure, as a measure of our operating performance. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted EBITDA is net earnings.We calculate Adjusted EBITDA by beginning with consolidated net earnings attributable to common stockholders and removing the effect of: interest charges, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, impairment charges, gains or losses from the disposition of investments in real estate (excluding development properties and land), gains from the revaluation of equity investments upon acquisition of a controlling interest, gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt and derivative contracts (including cash charges), similar adjustments we make to our FFO measures (see definition below), and other items, such as, amortization of stock based compensation and unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency and derivatives. We also include a pro forma adjustment to reflect a full period of NOI on the operating properties we acquire or stabilize during the quarter and to remove NOI on properties we dispose of during the quarter, assuming all transactions occurred at the beginning of the quarter. The pro forma adjustment also includes economic ownership changes in our ventures to reflect the full quarter at the new ownership percentage.We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides investors relevant and useful information because it permits investors to view our operating performance, analyze our ability to meet interest payment obligations and make quarterly preferred stock dividends on an unleveraged basis before the effects of income tax, depreciation and amortization expense, gains and losses on the disposition of non-development properties and other items (outlined above), that affect comparability. While all items are not infrequent or unusual in nature, these items may result from market fluctuations that can have inconsistent effects on our results of operations. The economics underlying these items reflect market and financing conditions in the short-term but can obscure our performance and the value of our long-term investment decisions and strategies.We calculate our Adjusted EBITDA, based on our proportionate ownership share of both our unconsolidated and consolidated ventures.  We reflect our share of our Adjusted EBITDA measures for unconsolidated ventures by applying our average ownership percentage for the period to the applicable reconciling items on an entity by entity basis.  We reflect our share for consolidated ventures in which we do not own 100% of the equity by adjusting our Adjusted EBITDA measures to remove the noncontrolling interests share of the applicable reconciling items based on our average ownership percentage for the applicable periods.While we believe Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure, it should not be used alone because it excludes significant components of net earnings, such as our historical cash expenditures or future cash requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, distribution requirements, contractual commitments or interest and principal payments on our outstanding debt and is therefore limited as an analytical tool.Our computation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to EBITDA reported by other companies in both the real estate industry and other industries. We compensate for the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA by providing investors with financial statements prepared according to GAAP, along with this detailed discussion of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation to Adjusted EBITDA from consolidated net earnings attributable to common stockholders.Business Line Reporting is a non-GAAP financial measure. Core FFO and development gains are generated by our three lines of business: (i) real estate operations; (ii) strategic capital; and (iii) development.  The real estate operations line of business represents total Prologis Core FFO, less the amount allocated to the strategic capital line of business.  The amount of Core FFO allocated to the strategic capital line of business represents the third-party share of asset management fees and transactional fees that we earn from our consolidated and unconsolidated co-investment ventures less costs directly associated with our strategic capital group and Net Promote Income. Realized development gains include our share of gains on dispositions of development properties and land, net of taxes. To calculate the per share amount, the amount generated by each line of business is divided by the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding used in our Core FFO per share calculation. Management believes evaluating our results by line of business is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance because it helps the investing public compare the operating performance of Prologis' respective businesses to other companies' comparable businesses. Prologis' computation of FFO by line of business may not be comparable to that reported by other real estate companies as they may use different methodologies in computing such measures.Calculation of Per Share AmountsThree Months EndedNine Months EndedSept. 30,Sept. 30,in thousands, except per share amount2023202220232022Net earningsNet earnings attributable to common stockholders$746,174$1,013,933$2,423,897$2,773,042Noncontrolling interest attributable to exchangeable limited partnership units19,05428,79261,49778,648Adjusted net earnings attributable to common stockholders - Diluted                                                             $765,228$1,042,725$2,485,394$2,851,690Weighted average common shares outstanding - Basic924,395740,719924,228740,585Incremental weighted average effect on exchange of limited partnership units23,62721,23023,61521,246Incremental weighted average effect of equity awards3,8864,4233,8004,188Weighted average common shares outstanding - Diluted$951,908766,372951,643766,019Net earnings per share - Basic$0.81$1.37$2.62$3.74Net earnings per share - Diluted$0.80$1.36$2.61$3.72Three Months EndedNine Months EndedSept. 30,Sept. 30,in thousands, except per share amount2023202220232022Core FFOCore FFO attributable to common stockholders/unitholders$1,238,046$1,328,357$4,132,402$3,009,758Noncontrolling interest attributable to exchangeable limited partnership units239153592317Core FFO attributable to common stockholders/ unitholders - Diluted$1,238,285$1,328,510$4,132,994$3,010,075Net Promote Income(30,720)440,133505,345430,403Core FFO attributable to common stockholders/ unitholders,excluding Net Promote Income - Diluted$1,269,005$888,377$3,627,649$2,579,672Weighted average common shares outstanding - Basic924,395740,719924,228740,585Incremental weighted average effect on exchange of limited partnership units23,62721,23023,61521,246Incremental weighted average effect of equity awards3,8864,4233,8004,188Weighted average common shares outstanding - Diluted951,908766,372951,643766,019Core FFO per share - Diluted $1.30$1.73$4.34$3.93Core FFO per share, excluding Net Promote Income - Diluted $1.33$1.16$3.81$3.37 Development Portfolio includes industrial and non-industrial properties, yards and parking lots that are under development and properties that are developed but have not met Stabilization. At September 30, 2023, total TEI for yards, parking lots and non-industrial assets was $842.7 million and $811.8 million on an Owned and Managed and Prologis Share basis, respectively. We do not disclose square footage for yards and parking lots.Estimated Build Out (TEI and sq ft) represents the estimated TEI and finished square feet available for lease upon completion of an industrial building on existing parcels of land.Estimated Value Creation represents the value that we expect to create through our development and leasing activities. We calculate Estimated Value Creation by estimating the Stabilized NOI that the property will generate and applying a stabilized capitalization rate applicable to that property. Estimated Value Creation is calculated as the amount by which the value exceeds our TEI and does not include any fees or promotes we may earn.Estimated Weighted Average Margin is calculated on development properties as Estimated Value Creation, less estimated closing costs and taxes, if any, on properties expected to be sold or contributed, divided by TEI.Estimated Weighted Average Stabilized Yield is calculated on the properties in the Development Portfolio as Stabilized NOI divided by TEI.

FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure that is commonly used in the real estate industry. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to FFO is net earnings.The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (""NAREIT"") defines FFO as earnings computed under GAAP to exclude historical cost depreciation and gains and losses from sales net of any related tax, along with impairment charges, of previously depreciated properties. We also exclude the gains on revaluation of equity investments upon acquisition of a controlling interest and the gain recognized from a partial sale of our investment, as these are similar to gains from the sales of previously depreciated properties. We exclude similar adjustments from our unconsolidated entities and the third parties' share of our consolidated co-investment ventures.Our FFO MeasuresOur FFO measures begin with NAREIT's definition and we make certain adjustments to reflect our business and the way that management plans and executes our business strategy.  While not infrequent or unusual, the additional items we adjust for in calculating FFO, as modified by Prologis, Core FFO and AFFO, as defined below, are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period. Although these items may have a material impact on our operations and are reflected in our financial statements, the removal of the effects of these items allows us to better understand the core operating performance of our properties over the long term.  These items have both positive and negative short-term effects on our results of operations in inconsistent and unpredictable directions that are not relevant to our long-term outlook.We calculate our FFO measures, as defined below, based on our proportionate ownership share of both our unconsolidated and consolidated ventures.  We reflect our share of our FFO measures for unconsolidated ventures by applying our average ownership percentage for the period to the applicable reconciling items on an entity by entity basis.  We reflect our share for consolidated ventures in which we do not own 100% of the equity by adjusting our FFO measures to remove the noncontrolling interests share of the applicable reconciling items based on our average ownership percentage for the applicable periods.These FFO measures are used by management as supplemental financial measures of operating performance and we believe that it is important that stockholders, potential investors and financial analysts understand the measures management uses. We do not use our FFO measures as, nor should they be considered to be, alternatives to net earnings computed under GAAP, as indicators of our operating performance, as alternatives to cash from operating activities computed under GAAP or as indicators of our ability to fund our cash needs.We analyze our operating performance principally by the rental revenues of our real estate and the revenues from our strategic capital business, net of operating, administrative and financing expenses. This income stream is not directly impacted by fluctuations in the market value of our investments in real estate or debt securities.FFO, as modified by Prologis To arrive at FFO, as modified by Prologis, we adjust the NAREIT defined FFO measure to exclude the impact of foreign currency related items and deferred tax, specifically:(i)deferred income tax benefits and deferred income tax expenses recognized by our subsidiaries;(ii)current income tax expense related to acquired tax liabilities that were recorded as deferred tax liabilities in an acquisition, to the extent the expense is offset with a deferred income tax benefit in earnings that is excluded from our defined FFO measure;(iii)foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from (a) debt transactions between us and our foreign entities, (b) third-party debt that is used to hedge our investment in foreign entities, (c) derivative financial instruments related to any such debt transactions, and (d) mark-to-market adjustments associated with other derivative financial instruments.We use FFO, as modified by Prologis, so that management, analysts and investors are able to evaluate our performance against other REITs that do not have similar operations or operations in jurisdictions outside the U.S.Core FFO In addition to FFO, as modified by Prologis, we also use Core FFO. To arrive at Core FFO, we adjust FFO, as modified by Prologis, to exclude the following recurring and nonrecurring items that we recognize directly in FFO, as modified by Prologis:(i)gains or losses from the disposition of land and development properties that were developed with the intent to contribute or sell;(ii)income tax expense related to the sale of investments in real estate;(iii)impairment charges recognized related to our investments in real estate generally as a result of our change in intent to contribute or sell these properties;(iv)gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt and redemption and repurchase of preferred stock; and(v)expenses related to natural disasters.We use Core FFO, including by segment and region, to: (i) assess our operating performance as compared to other real estate companies; (ii) evaluate our performance and the performance of our properties in comparison with expected results and results of previous periods; (iii) evaluate the performance of our management; (iv) budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources; (v) provide guidance to the financial markets to understand our expected operating performance; and (vi) evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results.AFFOTo arrive at AFFO, we adjust Core FFO to include realized gains from the disposition of land and development properties, net of current tax expense, and recurring capital expenditures and exclude the following items that we recognize directly in Core FFO:(i)straight-line rents;(ii)amortization of above- and below-market lease intangibles;(iii)amortization of management contracts;(iv)amortization of debt premiums and discounts and financing costs, net of amounts capitalized, and;(v)stock compensation amortization expense.We use AFFO to (i) assess our operating performance as compared to other real estate companies; (ii) evaluate our performance and the performance of our properties in comparison with expected results and results of previous periods; (iii) evaluate the performance of our management; (iv) budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources; and (v) evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results.Limitations on the use of our FFO measuresWhile we believe our modified FFO measures are important supplemental measures, neither NAREIT's nor our measures of FFO should be used alone because they exclude significant economic components of net earnings computed under GAAP and are, therefore, limited as an analytical tool. Accordingly, these are only a few of the many measures we use when analyzing our business.  Some of the limitations are:The current income tax expenses that are excluded from our modified FFO measures represent the taxes that are payable.Depreciation and amortization of real estate assets are economic costs that are excluded from FFO. FFO is limited, as it does not reflect the cash requirements that may be necessary for future replacements of the real estate assets. Furthermore, the amortization of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of logistics facilities are not reflected in FFO.Gains or losses from property dispositions and impairment charges related to expected dispositions represent changes in value of the properties. By excluding these gains and losses, FFO does not capture realized changes in the value of disposed properties arising from changes in market conditions.The deferred income tax benefits and expenses that are excluded from our modified FFO measures result from the creation of a deferred income tax asset or liability that may have to be settled at some future point. Our modified FFO measures do not currently reflect any income or expense that may result from such settlement.The foreign currency exchange gains and losses that are excluded from our modified FFO measures are generally recognized based on movements in foreign currency exchange rates through a specific point in time. The ultimate settlement of our foreign currency-denominated net assets is indefinite as to timing and amount. Our FFO measures are limited in that they do not reflect the current period changes in these net assets that result from periodic foreign currency exchange rate movements.The gains and losses on extinguishment of debt or preferred stock that we exclude from our Core FFO, may provide a benefit or cost to us as we may be settling our obligation at less or more than our future obligation.The natural disaster expenses that we exclude from Core FFO are costs that we have incurred.We compensate for these limitations by using our FFO measures only in conjunction with net earnings computed under GAAP when making our decisions. This information should be read with our complete Consolidated Financial Statements prepared under GAAP. To assist investors in compensating for these limitations, we reconcile our modified FFO measures to our net earnings computed under GAAP.Guidance. The following is a reconciliation of our annual guided Net Earnings per share to our guided Core FFO per share:LowHighNet earnings attributable to common stockholders (a)$3.30$3.35Our share of:Depreciation and amortization2.862.88Net gains on real estate transactions, net of taxes(0.60)(0.65)Unrealized foreign currency losses (gains), losses (gains) on early extinguishment of debt and other, net0.020.02Core FFO attributable to common stockholders/unitholders$5.58$5.60(a)Earnings guidance includes potential future gains recognized from real estate transactions, but excludes future foreign currency or derivative gains or losses as these items are difficult to predict.Market Capitalization equals Market Equity, less liquidation preference of the preferred shares/units, plus our share of total debt.Market Equity equals outstanding shares of common stock and units multiplied by the closing stock price plus the liquidation preference of the preferred shares/units.Net Promote Income is promote revenue earned from third-party investors during the period, net of related cash and stock compensation expenses, and taxes and foreign currency derivative gains and losses, if applicable.Operating Portfolio represents industrial properties in our Owned and Managed portfolio that have reached Stabilization. Assets held for sale, Non-Strategic Assets and non-industrial assets are excluded from the portfolio. Prologis Share of NOI excludes termination fees and adjustments and includes NOI for the properties contributed to or acquired from co-investment ventures at our actual share prior to and subsequent to change in ownership.Owned and Managed represents the consolidated properties as well as properties owned by our unconsolidated co-investment ventures, which we manage.Prologis Share represents our proportionate economic ownership of each entity, or property included in our total Owned and Managed portfolio, whether consolidated or unconsolidated.Rent Change (Cash) represents the percentage change in starting rental rates per the lease agreement, on new and renewed leases, commenced during the period compared with the previous ending rental rates in that same space. This measure excludes any short-term leases of less than one-year, holdover payments, free rent periods and introductory (teaser rates) defined as 50% or less of the stabilized rate.Rent Change (Net Effective) represents the percentage change in net effective rental rates (average rate over the lease term), on new and renewed leases, commenced during the period compared with the previous net effective rental rates in that same space. This measure excludes any short-term leases of less than one year and holdover payments.Retention is the square footage of all leases commenced during the period that are rented by existing tenants divided by the square footage of all expiring and in-place leases during the reporting period. The square footage of tenants that default or buy-out prior to expiration of their lease and short-term leases of less than one year, are not included in the calculation.Same Store. Our same store metrics are non-GAAP financial measures, which are commonly used in the real estate industry and expected from the financial community, on both a net effective and cash basis. We evaluate the performance of the operating properties we own and manage using a ""same store"" analysis because the population of properties in this analysis is consistent from period to period, which allows us and investors to analyze our ongoing business operations. We determine our same store metrics on property NOI, which is calculated as rental revenue less rental expense for the applicable properties in the same store population for both consolidated and unconsolidated properties based on our ownership interest, as further defined below.We define our same store population for the three months ended September 30, 2023 as the properties in our Owned and Managed Operating Portfolio, including the property NOI for both consolidated properties and properties owned by the unconsolidated co-investment ventures at January 1, 2022 and owned throughout the same three-month period in both 2022 and 2023.We believe the drivers of property NOI for the consolidated portfolio are generally the same for the properties owned by the ventures in which we invest and therefore we evaluate the same store metrics of the Owned and Managed portfolio based on Prologis' ownership in the properties (""Prologis Share"").The same store population excludes properties held for sale to third parties, along with development properties that were not stabilized at the beginning of the period (January 1, 2022) and properties acquired or disposed of to third parties during the period. To derive an appropriate measure of period-to-period operating performance, we remove the effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements by using the reported period-end exchange rate to translate from local currency into the U.S. dollar, for both periods.As non-GAAP financial measures, the same store metrics have certain limitations as an analytical tool and may vary among real estate companies. As a result, we provide a reconciliation of Rental Revenues less Rental Expenses (""Property NOI"") (from our Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP) to our Same Store Property NOI measures, as follows:Three Months EndedSept. 30,dollars in thousands20232022Change (%)Reconciliation of Consolidated Property NOI to Same Store Property NOI measures:Rental revenues$1,777,359$1,151,846Rental expenses(416,076)(284,707)Consolidated Property NOI$1,361,283$867,139Adjustments to derive same store results:Property NOI from consolidated properties not included in same     store portfolio and other adjustments (a)(522,505)(105,111)Property NOI from unconsolidated co-investment ventures included     in same store portfolio (a)(b)707,194672,142Third parties' share of Property NOI from properties included in     same store portfolio (a)(b)(571,857)(543,091)Prologis Share of Same Store Property NOI – Net Effective (b)$974,115$891,0799.3%Consolidated properties straight-line rent and fair value lease     adjustments included in the same store portfolio (c)(20,068)(19,274)Unconsolidated co-investment ventures straight-line rent and fair     value lease adjustments included in the same store portfolio (c)(12,702)(13,087)Third parties' share of straight-line rent and fair value lease      adjustments included in the same store portfolio (b)(c)10,23810,299Prologis Share of Same Store Property NOI – Cash (b)(c)$951,583$869,0179.5%(a)We exclude properties held for sale to third parties, along with development properties that were not stabilized at the beginning of the period and properties acquired or disposed of to third parties during the period. We also exclude net termination and renegotiation fees to allow us to evaluate the growth or decline in each property's rental revenues without regard to one-time items that are not indicative of the property's recurring operating performance. Net termination and renegotiation fees represent the gross fee negotiated to allow a customer to terminate or renegotiate their lease, offset by the write-off of the asset recorded due to the adjustment to straight-line rents over the lease term. Same Store Property NOI is adjusted to include an allocation of property management expenses for our consolidated properties based on the property management services provided to each property (generally, based on a percentage of revenues). On consolidation, these amounts are eliminated and the actual costs of providing property management and leasing services are recognized as part of our consolidated rental expense.(b)We include the Property NOI for the same store portfolio for both consolidated properties and properties owned by the co-investment ventures based on our investment in the underlying properties. In order to calculate our share of Same Store Property NOI from the co-investment ventures in which we own less than 100%, we use the co-investment ventures' underlying Property NOI for the same store portfolio and apply our ownership percentage at September 30, 2023 to the Property NOI for both periods, including the properties contributed during the period. We adjust the total Property NOI from the same store portfolio of the co-investment ventures by subtracting the third parties' share of both consolidated and unconsolidated co-investment ventures.During the periods presented, certain wholly-owned properties were contributed to a co-investment venture and are included in the same store portfolio. Neither our consolidated results nor those of the co-investment ventures, when viewed individually, would be comparable on a same store basis because of the changes in composition of the respective portfolios from period to period (e.g. the results of a contributed property are included in our consolidated results through the contribution date and in the results of the venture subsequent to the contribution date based on our ownership interest at the end of the period). As a result, only line items labeled ""Prologis Share of Same Store Property NOI"" are comparable period over period.(c)We further remove certain noncash items (straight-line rent and amortization of fair value lease adjustments) included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP to reflect a Same Store Property NOI – Cash measure. We manage our business and compensate our executives based on the same store results of our Owned and Managed portfolio at 100% as we manage our portfolio on an ownership blind basis. We calculate those results by including 100% of the properties included in our same store portfolio.Stabilization is defined as the earlier of when a property that was developed has been completed for one year, is contributed to a co-investment venture following completion or is 90% occupied. Upon Stabilization, a property is moved into our Operating Portfolio.Weighted Average Interest Rate is based on the effective rate, which includes the amortization of related premiums and discounts and finance costs.Weighted Average Stabilized Capitalization (""Cap"") Rate is calculated as Stabilized NOI divided by the Acquisition Price.Prologis.

CCI is scheduled to release third-quarter 2023 results on Oct 18 after the closing bell. In anticipation of the announcement, industry analysts and investors are eager to assess the company's performance and prospects in the current economic climate.In the last reported quarter, this Houston, TX-based real estate investment trust’s (REIT) adjusted funds from operations (FFO) per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.02%. Results reflected better-than-anticipated revenues aided by robust site-rental revenue growth. However, the company lowered its outlook for 2023, citing that it expects a decline in tower activity for the remainder of the year due to reduced network spending by wireless carriers.Over the preceding four quarters, CCI’s FFO per share surpassed estimates on three occasions and missed once, the average beat being 0.91%. This is depicted in the graph below:Crown Castle Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseCrown Castle Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseCrown Castle Inc. price-eps-surprise | Crown Castle Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up before this announcement.Factors to NoteIn recent years, the advancement in mobile technology, such as 4G and 5G networks, and the proliferation of bandwidth-intensive applications have steered the growth in mobile data usage globally. Also, the rampant usage of network-intensive applications for video conferencing and cloud services and remote-working scenarios have fueled the rise. This has led to greater capital spending by wireless carriers due to incremental demand from global 4G and 5G deployment efforts, growing wireless penetration and spectrum auctions, aiding the demand for CCI’s wireless communication infrastructure.Further, CCI’s solid balance sheet position is likely to have supported its small cell deployment efforts required to increase the capacity and density of the wireless network for 5G deployment.However, according to management, the initial surge in tower activity related to the early stage of the 5G investment cycle has waned. As a result, management expected a decline in tower activity for the remainder of the year due to reduced network spending by wireless carriers. Moreover, the T-Mobile Sprint network rationalization is likely to weigh on the third quarter of 2023.Amid these, our estimate for quarterly site rental revenues stands at $1.57 billion, implying only 0.4% growth year over year. We estimate revenues from the network services and other segment to decline 10.9% year over year during the quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.71 billion, indicating a decrease of 2.28% from the year-ago reported number.Also, high interest expenses are likely to have been a spoilsport for CCI during the to-be-reported quarter. We expect third-quarter 2023 interest expenses and amortization of deferred financing costs to rise 20.8% year over year.Crown Castle’s activities in the quarter were inadequate to garner analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly FFO per share has been revised 1.1% downward over the past month to $1.78. The figure also suggests a 3.78% decrease from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.Story continuesHere Is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Our proven model predicts a surprise in terms of FFO per share for Crown Castle this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an FFO beat, which is the case here.Crown Castle currently has a Zacks Rank of 3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.70%.

In anticipation of the announcement, industry analysts and investors are eager to assess the company's performance and prospects in the current economic climate.In the last reported quarter, this REIT delivered a surprise of 8.93% in terms of core funds from operations (FFO) per share. Results reflected robust leasing activity and solid rent growth.Over the trailing four quarters, Prologis beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in terms of FFO per share on all occasions, the average beat being 3.96%. This is depicted in the graph below:Prologis, Inc. Price and EPS SurprisePrologis, Inc. Price and EPS SurprisePrologis, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Prologis, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up before this announcement.US Industrial Real Estate Market in Q3Per a Cushman &amp; Wakefield CWK report, the U.S. industrial real estate market experienced a softening of fundamentals in the third quarter of 2023. There were record construction deliveries, with 171.8 million square feet (msf) of new industrial space completed, an 18.7% increase from the previous quarter.However, the increasing supply, coupled with moderating demand and occupiers optimizing their space, has caused a rise in overall vacancy, standing at 4.7% in the third quarter. While this represents a 70-basis point increase from the previous quarter, it remains well below the 15-year average of 6.8%. 40 out of 83 markets boast vacancy rates at 4% or lower.The industrial sector is experiencing a shift in demand, primarily due to the waning effects of the pandemic-induced goods boom and the anticipation of slower economic conditions. Absorption totals continued to moderate in each of the last four quarters, though net growth is still taking place. Net absorption declined 12.7% sequentially in the third quarter to 46.2 (msf).Rent growth is also cooling off, with the average asking rental rate increasing only 0.9% sequentially to $9.73 per square foot. On a year-over-year basis, rent growth slowed for the fourth straight quarter to 12.3% in the third quarter of 2023.At the same time, the fresh influx of speculative inventory, commanding prices significantly higher than the market average, has persistently pushed up average rental rates in markets that have experienced robust delivery volumes. Amid the substantial influx of new deliveries, the nationwide under-construction pipeline contracted by 96.7 msf (-15.3%), reducing it to 537.6 msf.Story continuesFactors to NoteDespite the softening in the overall industrial real estate market, there is substantial demand for Class A logistics facilities. Given Prologis’ capacity to offer high-quality facilities in key markets, it is well-poised to capitalize on this trend. With its differentiated customer offerings and strategic investments in the to-be-reported quarter, the REIT is likely to experience healthy rent and occupancy levels.Prologis’ expansion efforts through acquisitions and developments in recent years are likely to have boosted the top line in the to-be-reported quarter. In June 2023, Prologis acquired nearly 14 million square feet of industrial properties from opportunistic real estate funds affiliated with Blackstone for a cash consideration of $3.1 billion.In October 2022, Prologis closed the acquisition of Duke Realty in an all-stock transaction valued at $23 billion, thereby boosting its presence in the key markets. In addition, PLD is likely to have gained from its industry-leading cost structure.Furthermore, Prologis possesses a robust balance sheet that empowers its expansion initiatives. As a dominant player in the industrial REIT sector, it can secure capital at advantageous rates. It is likely to have maintained financial strength with liquidity during the period in discussion.Projections for Q3 2023The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $1.71 billion, suggesting a nearly 48.36% year-over-year jump.We project a 45.5% increase in rental revenues in the third quarter to $1.67 million. Our estimate for development management and other revenues is presently pegged at $5 million for the quarter. Our estimate for third-quarter average occupancy is 97.3%, implying a 10-basis point decline from the prior quarter. Moreover, the same-store net operating income is expected to increase 7.5%.Prologis’ activities during the soon-to-be-reported quarter were not adequate to gain analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third-quarter FFO per share has been unrevised at $1.26 in the past month. However, it suggests a 27.17% decline year over year.Here Is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Our proven model predicts a surprise in terms of FFO per share for Prologis this season.

Together, members will define best practices for hosting online reviews and sharing methods of fake review detection, aiming to stop fake reviews at the source.(PRNewsfoto/Tripadvisor)Companies met in October 2022 in San Francisco at the first ever Fake Reviews Conference, organized by Tripadvisor. Attendees heard from experts in government, academia and the industry at large on common challenges and potential mitigation approaches related to the issue of fake reviews. This resulted in the establishment of a formal coalition to collaborate on public education and ongoing information sharing between members, in an effort to decrease review fraud.The group has agreed to engage in several key areas to protect consumers and partners from fake reviews, working to help ensure the public is not misled by fraudulent content, including:Industry Alignment. Developing common standards and definitions for use throughout the industry around what constitutes a fake review and other content moderation nomenclature and measurement.Best Practice Sharing. Defining best practices for hosting online reviews and sharing information on updated content moderation process and methods of fake review detection.Information Sharing. Sharing information relating to how fraudulent actors operate, such as companies selling fake reviews to businesses seeking to unfairly and improperly improve their reputations.Advocacy. Engaging with academics and public policy leaders to promote the benefits to consumers of review content and support industry efforts to combat fake reviews from being published.Story continuesThe coalition is dedicated to upholding the highest standards of integrity, transparency, and accountability.

GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NWL.Icahn currently owns 6.14% of the company, though the guru has been dialing down his stake after sustaining heavy losses. Another large value investor is fund manager Richard Pzena (Trades, Portfolio), whose fund owns 12.66% of the company. Pzena's fund is doing the opposite of Icahn and has been building up its stake.Is Newell Brands a Falling Knife or an Opportunity?Newell Brands has an Altman Z-Score of 0.59, indicating it is in the Distress Zone. This means there is the potential for bankruptcy in the next two years. The overall financial strength of 4 out of 10, however, does not look too too bad. Debt is quite high, so obviously we have to look at the debt structure carefully.Is Newell Brands a Falling Knife or an Opportunity?With operations around the world, Newell owns brands such as Sharpie, Rubbermaid, Yankee Candles, Oster, Mr. Coffee and Coleman.Is Newell Brands a Falling Knife or an Opportunity?Source: Newell websiteOn April 15, 2016, Newell Rubbermaid acquired and merged with Jarden, forming a $16 billion company called Newell Brands. Under the terms of the agreement, Jarden shareholders received, for each Jarden share, $21 in cash and 0.862 shares of Newell Rubbermaid stock at closing. Initially lauded as transformative and combining iconic brands like Yankee Candles, Crock-Pot, Sharpie, Marmot and Graco, the merger was viewed positively by the market. Newell exceeded earnings expectations in October 2016 with 3% organic sales growth, leading then-CEO Michael Polk to express confidence in the company's performance and transformation.However, the situation deteriorated rapidly. Sales trends worsened, falling below expectations in February 2017, leading to a drop in stock price from its peak of $50 per share to the low $40 range. The instability continued, and in February 2018, activist investor Starboard, working with former Jarden CEO Martin Franklin, who was on the board of directors, attempted to replace the entire board. The merger was criticized for ""critical missteps,"" and by May 2018, it became evident that mistrust between the former Jarden and new Newell leaders was a significant factor in the dispute at the board level.Story continuesIn March 2018, another activist billionaire investor muscled into Newell. Icahn expressed his belief that Newell is undervalued and revealed that he purchased the company's shares for around $25 per share. He stepped in as a white knight initially, supporting management and opposing Starboard. Martin Franklin, the former Jarden chairman, resigned as a director after failing to oust Polk. Starboard also exited its Newell investment in 2018.The following chart shows the destruction of value wrought by Newell's acquisition of Jarden. The company's market cap is one-third of where it was before the acquisition.Is Newell Brands a Falling Knife or an Opportunity?Under activist pressure, Newell went on to divest many brands, such as sports brand Rawlings, its connected home security business and storage brand Waddington's, among others. However, the stock continued to drop.A change of leadership then took place with Polk being replaced by Ravi Saligram, a turnaround specialist, in July 2019. Saligram pushed streamlining Newell's extensive business operations and intensifying product innovation for the company's most crucial brands, even in the face of the crippling impact of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. Between July 29, 2019 (the day before Saligram assumed his position) and May 3, 2021, the stock surged by approximately 107% as consumers increased their purchases of Newell's products while confined to their homes during the pandemic. However, the stock has since retreated to a level below when Saligram took office. This decline occurred as consumers started leaving their homes and rising raw material costs put pressure on Newell's profit margins. Saligram retired this year and was replaced by former Chief Financial Officer Chris Peterson, who had joined the company in 2018 after working for Polo Ralph Lauren and Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG). Peterson stated in a recent press release, ""In spite of the challenging market conditions, we see significant potential to achieve profitable growth by strengthening our core brands and implementing further strategic measures to enhance our operational efficiency.""Debt analysisDebt is comprised of the following at the dates indicated (in millions):4.00% senior notes due 20241964.875% senior notes due 20254973.90% senior notes due 2025474.20% senior notes due 20261,9796.375% senior notes due 20274796.625% senior notes due 20294795.375% senior notes due 20364175.50% senior notes due 2046658Revolving credit facility530Commercial paperReceivables facility66Other debt2Total debt5,350Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt(597)Long-term debt4,753On March 20, S&amp;P Global downgraded Newell's debt rating to BB+. In February, Fitch Ratings downgraded the company's debt rating to BB.Overall, the debt maturities are spread out, with the largest tranche maturing in 2026. According to GuruFocus calculations, the effective interest rate Newell is paying on its debt is 4.98%. It is obvious that as the various tranches of debt matures, the company will have to refinance it at much higher rates. This fact is likely scaring the market.On the other hand, I doubt the Federal Reserve will not be able to sustain current high interest rates beyond 2024, less it strangulates the economy. Therefore, I think interest rates will have to moderate sooner rather than later (and especially if inflation continues to moderate). This means investors' concern on the debt burden, though justified, may be overdone. Toward this end, Newell is already taking action as it cut its dividend to conserve cash. The dividend has been cut to 28 cents per quarter from 70 cents previously. According to a May statement, the company said it is ""deliberately resetting its capital allocation priorities and right-sizing the dividend to fund high-return internal supply chain consolidation investment opportunities, while enabling faster de-leveraging of the balance sheet and providing additional financial flexibility. Even after the cut, the dividend yield is a decent 4.12%.ValuationGuruFocus is tagging Newell as a possible value trap, given it is trading so far below historical norms.Is Newell Brands a Falling Knife or an Opportunity?It is a low predictability stock with low growth and momentum characteristics. However, profitability is mediocre. The saving grace is the very low price of the stock. It is definitely a contrarian pick.GF ValuationPossible Value Trap,Think TwiceGF Score60of 100Predictability Rank1of 5Growth Rank2of 10Financial Strength4of 10Valuation Rank10of 10Quality Rank4of 10Momentum Rank2of 10Profitability Rank6of 10One reasonable way of valuing Newell is by using the median price-sales ratio. Valuation using the ratio is a rough measure, but it can be useful in situations where undervaluation looks excessive and where the company has been through a lot of change, so earnings, cash flow and book value are not reliable. This valuation method assumes the stock valuation will revert to its historical (e.g., 10-year or longer) mean.The reason I use the price-sales ratio instead of the price-earnings ratio or price-book ratio is because it is independent of the profit margin and can be applied to a broader range of situations. However, the method implicitly assumes that over time the profit margin will return to historical levels. If the profit margin has permanently declined, this method may overestimate the company's value.Newell's 20-year median price-sales value is 1.12 while its current ratio is just 0.28. This denotes a wide margin of safety. The stock could more than triple to reach a price-sales fair value. I chose a 20-year period in this instance as it incorporates a variety of different economic environments, including two recessions.Is Newell Brands a Falling Knife or an Opportunity?ConclusionNewell as a company is badly battered and looks like it is on the ropes. However, it does not look like the company is headed for imminent bankruptcy. The dividend cut has also shaken out the investor base. It is a company only a contrarian would love.The Jarden acquisition was done at too high a price by an empire-building CEO, which destroyed value. This was followed by the Covid-19 pandemic, high inflation and now high interest rates. Newell has been through two CEOs since that flawed acquisition and is now headed by a third leader. However, the company has gone through one previous ""rough"" merger in 1999, when it acquired Rubbermaid. While it went through a tough few years integrating Rubbermaid due to a clash of cultures, the company came through it. It is now going through a similar trial by fire, coping with a high debt load and inflaton. However, the company has ""good bones,"" as represented by its well-known and trusted brands. It needs to get its operating margin back up and to pay down the accumulated debt. I think the chances are good that it can do that, though I am not looking for a quick turnaround. I think it is going to take three to five years of hard work and some luck. However, the stock can be a multi-bagger if management can execute competently and the economy does not get too bad. That being said, I think new investors should wait until some green shoots are evident and the stock begins to show some positive momentum.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Our proprietary system currently recommends Paccar (PCAR) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this truck maker a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Paccar is 7.6%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 48.7% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 20.4%.Impressive Asset Utilization RatioGrowth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio, also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio, but it is an important feature of a real growth stock. This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.Story continuesRight now, Paccar has an S/TA ratio of 0.96, which means that the company gets $0.96 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.4, it can be said that the company is more efficient.In addition to efficiency in generating sales, sales growth plays an important role. And Paccar is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too. The company's sales are expected to grow 19.2% this year versus the industry average of 2.7%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Paccar. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.2% over the past month.Bottom LinePaccar has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination positions Paccar well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with ""A"" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment.One company to watch right now is PACCAR (PCAR). PCAR is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A.Investors should also note that PCAR holds a PEG ratio of 1.17. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. PCAR's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 2.80. Over the past 52 weeks, PCAR's PEG has been as high as 1.32 and as low as 0.94, with a median of 1.16.We should also highlight that PCAR has a P/B ratio of 2.96. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks solid versus its industry's average P/B of 4.74. PCAR's P/B has been as high as 3.11 and as low as 2.36, with a median of 2.85, over the past year.Value investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. PCAR has a P/S ratio of 1.35. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 2.02.Story continuesFinally, we should also recognize that PCAR has a P/CF ratio of 9.95. This data point considers a firm's operating cash flow and is frequently used to find companies that are undervalued when considering their solid cash outlook. PCAR's P/CF compares to its industry's average P/CF of 18.78. PCAR's P/CF has been as high as 11.24 and as low as 8.97, with a median of 9.96, all within the past year.These figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at, but they help show that PACCAR is likely being undervalued right now. Considering this, as well as the strength of its earnings outlook, PCAR feels like a great value stock at the moment.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

371,b391f36a-a415-394e-83ed-117b780eacf6,UPS,2023-10-17,UPS’ 2024 rate changes look similar to FedEx’s,FreightWaves,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ups-2024-rate-changes-look-173231392.html,1697481691,STORY,"['FDX', 'UPS']","[Yes, Virginia, the 2024 rate increases look similar (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)Anyone who thought that UPS Inc.’s 2024 rate and surcharge adjustments would be distorted by the significant labor cost increases in the first year of its contract with the Teamsters union will be disappointed by next year’s rate table.UPS’ (NYSE: UPS) 2024 rate breakdown, which the shipping giant made public late Friday, looks comparable to those published by rival FedEx Corp. (NYSE: FDX) more than a month ago. The carriers’ rate increases on ground commercial shipments are identical across the board, according to an analysis from consultancy Shipware LLC (see graphic below). The carriers’ minimum charge for a ground commercial shipment, which all shippers will pay regardless of any rate discounts they negotiate, is the same at $10.70 per shipment. UPS’ minimum charge increases range from 4.52% for its three-day delivery service to 7.91% for its next-day air service.Of 40 delivery surcharges identified by Shipware, 24 are identical between the two carriers. Of the 16 surcharge items that contain price differentials between the two, only four have differentials of $5 or more per shipment.The carriers will also go to market with similar increases on shorter-haul traffic, shipments 600 miles or less that are priced based on seven delivery zones. Rates for both carriers will be at or below the 5.9% general rate increases (GRIs) both have already announced. Rate increases will be particularly muted for short-haul ground commercial traffic. Rate hikes will be roughly equivalent to the GRI for shorter-haul ground residential traffic that has become the majority of all parcel carriers’ traffic mix.The lower rates on shorter-haul moves are likely a nod to the increasing competition from regional delivery carriers as well as Amazon.com Inc., (NASDAQ: AMZN) which has morphed its delivery operations from a national hub-and-spoke network to eight regions.By contrast, rates on longer-haul shipments moving under UPS’ second-day air and three-day services will climb as much as 8%, based on Shipware’s analysis. In fact, most rates, regardless of the type of service, weight and distance, will either meet or exceed the 5.9% GRI.Story continuesPaul Yaussy, the Shipware executive who prepared the analysis, said FedEx and UPS will continue to demonstrate their “oligopolistic” pricing behavior they’ve exhibited over at least the past decade. Yaussy wrote that “there are very few differences between the two carriers’ most common services and surcharges.”UPS’ five-year contract with the Teamsters union calls for 9% to 10% rate increases in its first year. That will be the steepest year-over-year hike over the contract’s duration. Given the timing of the rank-and-file’s ratification — which took place in late August — there was speculation that UPS would go to market with higher-than-normal rate increases for 2024 to offset its increased operating costs. The speculation was further fueled by the 25 business days that elapsed between FedEx’s published rate breakdown and UPS’, though FedEx did publish its increases earlier than usual.Mixed meaningsUPS’ challenge in building its 2024 rate-setting strategy is to balance the need to boost yields with the desire to not alienate shippers whose volumes it is trying to recapture in the wake of the contract negotiations. About 1.1 million daily parcels were diverted to rivals in the weeks and months of often-volatile negotiations. UPS may have been willing to give up some yield on 2024 business in exchange for improving its chances to win back diverted parcels, according to Yaussy.The impact of GRIs, even those with detailed breakdowns, is decidedly mixed. On the surface, GRIs mean little because they apply to noncontractual traffic that represents a fraction of all parcel business. However, they do serve as a benchmark of sorts for negotiations between shippers and carriers that are commonplace in the industry.Yaussy cautioned shippers to focus on the bevy of costly surcharges imposed by both carriers. The combined cost of surcharges can collectively comprise as much as 40% of a shipper’s total annual parcel spend, according to industry data. At UPS, for example, only two of 37 surcharges listed by Shipware will increase by less than the GRI. Surcharges for Collect on Delivery (COD) and Residential Air delivery services will increase by 5.56% and 5.41%, respectively.By contrast, shippers of large packages that require additional handling will face surcharge increases ranging from 18% to 21% depending on the service, according to Shipware’s analysis. Including rate and surcharge adjustments, shippers will face double-digit rate increases unless they succeed in negotiating the increases down or away, Yaussy said.Yaussy also advised UPS shippers to be on the lookout for “hidden cost increases” from the carrier’s announcement of changes to the number of ZIP codes that could be hit by delivery surcharges, as well as any shrinkage in the number of ZIP codes aligned to Zones 2 and 3. The latter action could result in more deliveries falling into the Zone 3 bracket, thus resulting in higher rates, he said.Yaussy said UPS shippers will not have visibility into the impact of these steps until the 2024 rates take effect. “Most shippers will not have the immediate ability to analyze these ZIP code changes, which has the potential to be a sneaky way for UPS to increase yield,” he said.Yaussy said he was unaware if FedEx was making similar moves, but that it would be too early to tell until its new rates take effect. UPS 2024 rates take effect Dec. 26. FedEx’s rates go into effect Jan. 1.The post UPS’ 2024 rate changes look similar to FedEx’s appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

United Parcel Service (UPS), which belongs to the Zacks Transportation - Air Freight and Cargo industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This package delivery service has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 0.83%.For the last reported quarter, UPS came out with earnings of $2.54 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.51 per share, representing a surprise of 1.20%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $2.19 per share and it actually produced earnings of $2.20 per share, delivering a surprise of 0.46%.For UPS, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.UPS currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.41%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on October 26, 2023.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

374,ea73b05e-4e13-35cf-bd13-07b033acd851,AXP,2023-10-17,Can AmEx (AXP) Q3 Earnings Beat on Network Volumes Boost?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amex-axp-q3-earnings-beat-153800462.html,1697470680,STORY,"['AXP', 'OMF']","[American Express Company AXP is set to beat on earnings for the third quarter of 2023, the results for which are scheduled to be released on Oct 20, before the opening bell.What Do the Estimates Say?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings per share of $2.96 has witnessed one upward revision in the past week against one movement in the opposite direction. The estimate is indicative of a 19.8% increase from the year-ago quarter’s reported earnings of $2.47 per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $15.4 billion, suggesting a rise of 13.7% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.American Express’ earnings beat estimates in two of the trailing four quarters and missed twice. This is depicted in the graph below.American Express Company Price and EPS SurpriseAmerican Express Company Price and EPS SurpriseAmerican Express Company price-eps-surprise | American Express Company QuoteWhat the Quantitative Model SuggestsOur proven model predicts a likely earnings beat for American Express this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat, which is precisely the case here. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Earnings ESP: American Express has anEarnings ESP of +0.60%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate is currently pegged at $2.98 per share, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.96. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: American Express currently has a Zacks Rank #3.Before we get into what to expect for the to-be-reported quarter in detail, it’s worth taking a look at AXP’s previous-quarter performance first.Q2 Earnings RewindIn the last reported quarter, the globally integrated payments company’s adjusted earnings per share of $2.89 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.2%, thanks to continued business momentum, better volumes and higher card member spending. Increased compensation costs and higher operating and customer engagement costs partially offset the positives.Story continuesNow, let’s see how things have shaped up prior to the third-quarter earnings announcement.Factors Driving Q3 PerformanceAmEx is expected to have experienced enhanced network volumes in the third quarter, continuing a trend observed over the past several quarters. This increase is likely attributable to higher total billed business and processed volumes. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter total network volumes indicates 9.5% year-over-year growth from $394.4 billion, whereas our estimate suggests a 12.7% increase.Discount revenues, a significant revenue driver for American Express, are likely to have been supported by a relatively stable consumer spending level. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter Discount revenues indicates nearly 10% year-over-year growth, whereas our estimate predicts an 11% rise.In the third quarter, Travel and Entertainment (T&amp;E) is anticipated to have sustained its growth trend, resulting in increased T&amp;E-related spending. Additionally, fees, commissions, and other revenues are expected to have improved, driven by an upturn in travel-related income. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter International Card Services revenues suggests an almost 16% increase from the year-ago period’s $2.3 billion, whereas our model’s estimate is pegged at nearly $2.7 billion.Cards-in-force is likely to have witnessed an uptick in the quarter under review. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter total cards-in-force indicates a more than 7% year-over-year increase, whereas our estimate suggests a nearly 9% year-over-year increase. Both the consensus mark and our estimate for the average fee per card indicate 13.2% year-over-year growth in the third quarter. Our estimate for total Worldwide Card Member Loans also implies continuous growth in this period.American Express’ interest income, the second-largest revenue contributor, is likely to have risen on higher loan disbursements. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AXP’s interest income suggests an upside of almost 47% from the year-ago reported figure of $3.4 billion, whereas our model predicts a nearly 48% increase. Further, our estimate for Global Merchant and Network Services’ pre-tax income indicates a 15.6% year-over-year increase.The factors mentioned above are expected to position American Express for both year-over-year growth and a potential earnings beat. However, an increase in expenses, card member rewards, marketing and business development costs are likely to have dampened profit margins, somewhat offsetting the positive aspects.Our estimate suggests total expenses to have witnessed a nearly 12% year-over-year increase in the quarter. Also, a hefty provision for credit losses is likely to have impacted the results. We expect rainy-day funds to have increased around 40% year over year in the third quarter.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other companies worth considering from the broader Finance space, as our model shows that these, too, have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around:Credit Acceptance Corporation CACC has an Earnings ESP of +18.15% and is a Zacks #3 Ranked player.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Credit Acceptance’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $7.03 per share, indicating 8.3% year-over-year growth. It has witnessed one upward estimate revision in the past 30 days against none in the opposite direction. The consensus estimate for CACC’s revenues is pegged at $486.8 million, suggesting a 5.8% increase from a year ago.OneMain Holdings, Inc. OMF has an Earnings ESP of +2.37% and a Zacks Rank of 3.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for OneMain’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $1.50 per share. The consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $908.4 million, indicating a 1.5% increase from a year ago. OMF beat earnings estimates in two of the past four quarters and missed twice.Enova International, Inc. ENVA has an Earnings ESP of +2.26% and a Zacks Rank of 3.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Enova International’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $2 per share, suggesting a 14.9% year-over-year increase. The estimate remained stable over the past week. ENVA beat earnings estimates in all the past four quarters, with an average surprise of 7.6%.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company is benefiting from strong demand for its creative products. Adobe’s Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Adobe Experience Cloud products are driving the top-line growth. Rising subscription revenues and solid momentum across the mobile apps are major positives.Additionally, growth in emerging markets and robust online video creation demand remain tailwinds. Solid demand for Adobe’s commerce offerings and growing adoption of Acrobat. The Zacks analyst remains optimistic about Adobe’s market position, compelling product lines and continued innovation.However, the ongoing tensions between Russia and Ukraine remain major headwinds for its Digital Media segment.

The company is witnessing solid growth in order levels, which is expected to aid its top-line performance in the forthcoming quarters.

This is Rhode Island's largest-ever RFP for renewable energy.The company released the request only a week after Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). This MoU might enable a coordinated multi-state selection of offshore wind opportunities as each state seeks its own procurements in a similar time frame.Rhode Island Energy believes in the urgency to get additional renewables online. The next RFP will provide developers with a fresh, exceptional chance to imagine how they may satisfy the state's clean energy and economic development goals, while balancing the customers' affordability demands.In accordance with the state's Affordable Clean Energy Security Act, Rhode Island Energy is looking for proposals from prospective developers to negotiate long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) for energy and renewable energy certificates from the recently completed offshore wind projects.Responding offers will be accepted through Jan 31, 2024, and successful bidders will be revealed in the summer of 2024, as stated in the RFP. The Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission will assess and approve any upcoming PPAs that Rhode Island Energy enters into.Growth ProspectsUtilities in the United States are gradually shifting focus and concentrating more on clean energy sources like renewable energy to generate electricity. Wind and solar are the predominant sources of power generation that will help achieve the target of net zero emissions by 2050.Offshore wind projects are expected to grow rapidly in the coming years as the turbines at sea make use of stronger winds. According to a report by the U.S. Department of Energy, the capacity of the currently operating and under construction U.S. offshore wind energy projects increased 15% from the previous year’s level to 52,687 MW. When fully developed, these projects would be enough to power more than 18 million American homes.Per a Precedence Research report, the global offshore wind energy market size was valued at $33 billion in 2022 and is expected to hit $179.41 billion by 2032. It is poised to witness a CAGR of 18.50% during 2023-2032.Story continuesUtilities’ Focus on Renewable EnergyAlong with PPL, other electric power companies like Dominion Energy D, Xcel Energy, Inc. XEL and Avangrid Inc. AGR are also set to benefit from the growing need for renewable energy.Dominion’s long-term objective is expected to add 24 gigawatt (GW) of battery storage, solar, hydro and wind (offshore as well as onshore) projects by 2036 and increase the renewable energy capacity by more than 15% per year, on average, over the next 15 years. The company plans to develop the 2,640-MW offshore wind project, located 27 miles off the coast of Virginia Beach, VA, which will further expand the state’s renewable footprint.D’s long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate is 4%. It delivered an average earnings surprise of 4.3% in the last four quarters.After completing six wind projects with 1,500 MW capacities in 2020, XEL completed four wind farms, adding another 800 MW of clean energy generation capacity to its portfolio. Xcel Energy's total wind capacity is 11,000 MW, out of which 4,500 MW is from its own wind farms.XEL’s long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate is 6.49%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 EPS indicates a year-over-year improvement of 6%.AGR plans renewable construction of 806 MW of offshore wind, 408 MW of solar and 106 MWs of onshore wind projects. The company has increased the presence of sustainable energy in Texas, where it currently produces more than 1,250 MW through six wind farms and has a pipeline of 1,300-MW projects.AGR’s long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate is 4.05%.

380,401ddf08-e341-39a4-bcd3-bbd9e4daa7fd,OXY,2023-10-17,7 Beaten-Down Blue Chips Ready to Rebound in October,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-beaten-down-blue-chips-202431128.html,1696969471,STORY,"['BEP', 'PEP', 'MO', 'OXY', 'RTX', 'NKE', 'SMG']","[Blue-chip stocks are beaten down. While the tech stock onslaught continues, economic pressure and uncertainty come after some of the business’s biggest, most stable names. Blue-chip and value stocks are typically a haven. But even these juggernauts haven’t been spared as we face interest rate risk, geopolitical pressure, and mounting recession fears.For long-term, buy-and-hold investors, finding blue-chip stocks to buy today is easy. As downward pressure decreases stock prices, many of the top names previously too pricy are on sale. If you’re bargain-hunting for the perfect blue-chip stocks to add to your portfolio, these seven stocks are definite buys in today’s market. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsRTX (RTX)Raytheon (RTX) defense company logo hanging from glass buildingSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comAerospace and defense company RTX (NYSE:RTX) (formerly Raytheon) is priced lower than it has been since 2020, making this blue-chip stock a definite buy. While war, conflict, and other geopolitical disasters are never desirable, defense companies like RTX are primed to break out as the U.S. carves out greater defense-aid packages to countries like Ukraine and Israel. RTX is a partner manufacturer for Israel’s “iron dome” rocket interception system, and even before the current conflict broke out, the company began expanding its manufacturing footprint to match demand.    But beyond short-term boosts that awful circumstances and catastrophes bring to RTX, its fundamentals are strong enough to anchor a well-rounded blue-chip portfolio. Morningstar assigns RTX’s two primary operational categories — defense and aerospace — a wide moat based on their current product offerings and mutually-supported integrations. Likewise, Morningstar pegs RTX’s fair price at $111 per share, representing a nearly 50% upside opportunity despite a recent bump. Nike (NKE)Nike (NKE) store in a shopping mall in Penang, Malaysia. robinhood stocksSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.comNike (NYSE:NKE) is a perennial blue-chip favorite, but even a recent earnings beat and margin growth haven’t been enough to save the athletic shoe stock. Story continuesShares are down nearly 20% since January, making for an attractive discount. Insiders seem to agree, as company board members bought a whopping 6.6 million shares over the past three months. Following the “smart money” is usually advisable. There are few better to judge Nike’s upside potential than those with a front-row seat to the game. In a recent earnings call, company CFO Matthew Friend affirmed the insiders’ bull thesis. He told investors, “We continue to see consumer demand for our brands and for our products to be very, very strong” despite macroeconomic concerns.We’re headed into an interesting holiday season as tightened household budgets butt up against historical seasonal shopping trends. Whether Nike will see sales in line with past winter periods remains to be seen, but at today’s price, Nike is a blue-chip stock you shouldn’t skip. Scotts Miracle-Gro (SMG)Scotts Miracle-Gro logo displayed on a web browser and magnified by a magnifying glassSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comScotts Miracle-Gro (NYSE:SMG) is one blue-chip stock that could see a boost from cannabis rescheduling, but that isn’t the only tailwind driving this stock upward in October. Ongoing new-home sales could drive the company’s landscaping division to new heights and bring the stock back to prior highs. Analysts, in fact, think that the housing industry will be a driving factor for SMG’s near-term performance. Morningstar, in a note, said “Future demand for gardening products will depend on growth in the housing industry.” After falling sharply, new starts are steadily rising and hit 1.28 million in August. We’re still waiting for September data to show whether the trend continued, but a surge in permit requests last month points to good things ahead for SMG.  Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEP)Brookfield Renewable logo on a phone screen. BEPC stock. BEP stock.Source: IgorGolovniov / ShutterstockBrookfield Renewable Partners (NYSE:BEP) is a speculative blue-chip play, but one that could pay off big-time for investors interested in capturing sustainable investing opportunities. BEP is a diversified owner of many sustainable, green, and clean energy assets. Its holdings include solar, hydroelectric and wind facilities globally — all of which are primed to expand considering the push for renewable energy initiatives. At the same time, today’s constrained economic climate puts BEP in a unique position. The firm focuses on buying external assets to generate returns. Today. many smaller renewable energy firms and assets are on sale. For smaller companies, interest rate risk puts downward pressure on their operations and increases business costs. BEP’s robust acquisition arm and $1 billion cash reserves are enough to snag some good deals in the green energy market. To that end, BEP targets a 12% – 15% total return by growing existing assets and grabbing deals on the open market. A double-digit return in today’s market is nearly unheard of. That potential makes this blue-chip stock a great alternative to fossil fuel-based value stock picks.  PepsiCo (PEP)Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.Source: FotograFFF / ShutterstockPepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) is down about 10% since January, but Tuesday’s earnings might shoot the food and drink stock back toward past highs. Reported early this morning, Pepsi beat consensus estimates and increased revenue and income by a solid margin across all consumer segments. Pepsi is also targeting 4% to 6% revenue growth for the remainder of the year, meaning there’s still upside if management can meet its goals — though they’re already on track to do so. If the stock does stay flat, blue-chip and value investors can take solace in the firm’s dividend. The yield itself is just below 3%. Still, the company grew its dividend by nearly 60% over the past five years. Dividend growth of that magnitude, considering the economy, is noteworthy. Ultimately, both Pepsi’s earnings report and commitment to shareholder value make it one of the best blue-chip stocks to buy today.  Occidental Petroleum (OXY)Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comIf you want some legacy energy firms for your “blue-chip stocks to buy” list, then Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) is perfect. Warren Buffett loves the stock, which is enough for many value investors. If you need a little more due diligence before pulling the trigger, though, recent news considerably boosts OXY’s October prospects. In September, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) unveiled a new partnership with a subsidiary of OXY to leverage emerging carbon capture tech. Analysts anticipate this collaboration could put as much as  $150 million in OXY’s pocket by reducing Amazon’s carbon footprint via a new direct air capture plant. This facility is one of the first of its kind, thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law’s $3.5 billion plant development allocation. It enables OXY to diversify its revenue streams as more corporate entities seek ways to offset their carbon emissions. As the demand for sustainability continues to grow, traditional oil and gas companies must adapt. OXY stands out as one of the first blue-chip stocks in the sector to proactively embracing this trend.OXY’s overall trailing yield stands at an impressive 7.39%. Warren Buffett’s love for the blue-chip stock is a positive signal for investors, and the company’s prospects for 2024 are equally promising.Altria (MO)Altria Group, Inc. (MO) logo of US producer and marketer of tobacco and cigarettes is seen on a mobile phone screen.Source: viewimage / Shutterstock.comAltria (NYSE:MO) is at its lowest share price since 2020, but its hefty dividend yield and prospects are a blue-chip investor’s dream. The company’s current dividend yield is 9%, which is irresistible considering high bond yields are making fixed-income investing attractive again.    Recent earnings also indicate that the company is on strong financial footing, ensuring upside potential while it can maintain its hefty dividend distribution. Altria’s revenue grew 2% over the quarter despite smoking rates falling. At the same time, Altria is aggressively exploring smokeless alternatives. Adaptation is critical for any company but magnified for a firm like Altria that lives and dies on the strength of tobacco sales. If Altria successfully pivots fully into the smokeless nicotine market, they’ll likely cement their position as the foremost blue-chip stock in the industry. On the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

BSX recently received FDA approval for an expanded indication of the WaveWriter Alpha Spinal Cord Stimulator (“SCS”) Systems. With this approval, the system will be available for the treatment of painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) — a complication of diabetes that can affect the lower extremities of the body.The recent approval is set to boost the company’s Neuromodulation business, which develops and manufactures devices to treat various neurological movement disorders and manage chronic pain.Significance of the NewsDiabetic neuropathy is a type of nerve damage that can occur in people living with diabetes. With time, high blood sugar (glucose) can injure nerves throughout the body, often impacting nerves in the legs and feet. Depending on the affected nerves, diabetic neuropathy symptoms include pain and numbness in the legs, feet and hands. Per a published estimate, of the 37.3 million Americans who live with diabetes (11.3% of the U.S. population), diabetic neuropathy will affect nearly 50% of adults living with diabetes during their lifetime.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe WaveWriter Alpha SCS Systems include a unified portfolio of four MRI conditional, Bluetooth-enabled rechargeable and non-rechargeable implantable pulse generators to provide uncompromised personalization. The company’s proprietary FAST (Fast-Acting Sub-perception Therapy) included in SCS is designed to deliver profound paresthesia-free pain relief in a minute.News in DetailThe WaveWriter Alpha SCS Systems were previously approved by the FDA in December 2020 for the management of chronic intractable pain of the trunk and/or limbs, including unilateral or bilateral pain associated with failed back surgery syndrome, complex regional pain syndrome types I and II intractable low back pain and leg pain. The latest approval expands the indications to include DPN of the lower extremities for paresthesia-based stimulation.Story continuesAs a non-opioid treatment option, the system provides therapy for pain relief by sending mild electric pulses to the spinal cord to interrupt pain signals traveling to the brain. The use of SCS is an important advancement for Boston Scientific, which intends to support a subset of the diabetes population for one of the fastest-growing chronic conditions in the world.According to Boston Scientific’s representative, the expanded indication underscores the company’s commitment to delivering a robust portfolio of interventional pain solutions that provide physicians with more treatment choices to help their patients find relief.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Precedence Research, the global neuromodulation market was valued at $6.43 billion in 2022 and is expected to witness a CAGR of 12.2% by 2032.Recent Highlights of the Neuromodulation UnitIn the last reported second quarter of 2023, BSX’s operational net sales growth across the Neuromodulation business was primarily driven by growth within the deep brain stimulation franchise, having seen continued momentum from new product launches in the United States and procedure recovery in Europe. Throughout the first half of the year, sales were driven by improved procedural volume growth within the SCS franchise, led by the WaveWriter Alpha SCS System, as well as growth within the deep brain stimulation franchise.In July 2023, BSX received FDA approval for the Vercise Neural Navigator 5 software, which, combined with Vercise Genus Deep Brain Stimulation Systems, can help provide clinicians with data for efficient programming in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Further, the company anticipates sales in the SCS franchise to improve in the second half of the year, with strong trialing in the second quarter, backed by the company’s recent presentation of clinical evidence at Aspen.Price PerformanceIn the past six months, Boston Scientific shares have decreased 4.3% compared with the industry’s fall of 18.3%.Zacks Rank and Other Key PicksBoston Scientific currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Cardinal Health CAH, Haemonetics HAE and Align Technology ALGN, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2.

See our latest analysis for Ulta Beauty While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational.

That could be a factor affecting demand,"" TD Cowen analyst Cai von Rumohr said. ""It is a cyclical business after all.""Marquee names such as Bombardier, Textron, Embraer and Boeing are expected to showcase their latest models at the show, according to the NBAA.Textron took the wraps off its newest Cessna Citation CJ3 Gen2 business jet on Monday, while Embraer unveiled its Phenom 100EX business jet, its latest aircraft in the Phenom 100 series, last week.""We're happy with the conversations we're having with our customers and are looking forward to a great show,"" a Textron Aviation spokesperson said in an emailed statement.Bombardier also said on Monday it will detail flight testing progress for its Global 8000 aircraft, which it says will be the world's fastest business jet.""We continue to see growing demand globally for our BBJ (Boeing Business Jets) family of airplanes,"" Boeing said.Story continuesOn Sunday, engine maker Honeywell estimated a 10% growth in new business jet deliveries in 2024 and joined several planemakers in emphasizing the strength of global demand for new business jets.As a pure-play business jet provider with financial leverage, Bombardier is most exposed to any weakness in demand, followed by Textron, J.P.Morgan analyst Seth Seifman said in a note.Manufacturers are expected to continue reporting robust backlogs and book-to-bill ratios above 1.00, though likely not as strong as those seen 12 to 18 months ago, said Adam Cowburn, managing director at Alton Aviation Consultancy.The book-to-bill ratio is an indication of future demand and a ratio of over 1 is considered healthy.Cowburn said he expects the market will eventually settle at levels that are structurally around 15% higher than pre-COVID levels.Meanwhile, industry watchers expect new jet orders to be announced at the NBAA event. Private jet company Flexjet is expected to place a large order and analysts expect Bombardier will be the likely winner.""Textron, Dassault Falcon and Bombardier are most likely to announce fleet orders given their relatively strong positions with fractional program customers,"" said Rolland Vincent, a consultant and founder of business aviation forecasting service JetNet.Fractional ownership is an arrangement in which multiple owners share the use and costs of purchasing and operating a private aircraft.However, General Dynamics' Gulfstream Aerospace, a major business jet manufacturer, said on Monday that it is not participating in the event.(Reporting by Mehr Bedi in Bengaluru; Editing by Pooja Desai)]"

Is the stock significantly undervalued? This article aims to provide a comprehensive valuation analysis to answer this question. Read on to gain valuable insights into Norfolk Southern's financial performance and intrinsic value.A Snapshot of Norfolk Southern Corp (NYSE:NSC)Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with PFE.Operating in the Eastern United States, Norfolk Southern Corp is a Class-I railroad company with over 20,000 miles of track. The firm's diverse portfolio includes shipments of coal, intermodal traffic, automobile, agriculture, metal, chemical, and forest products. Despite a current stock price of $207.79, the GF Value, an estimation of fair value, stands at $307.56. This discrepancy suggests that Norfolk Southern may be significantly undervalued. The following sections will delve deeper into this valuation, integrating financial assessment with essential company details.Norfolk Southern (NSC): A Significantly Undervalued Gem in the Transportation Industry?Understanding the GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary measure that represents the current intrinsic value of a stock. This measure considers historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line provides an overview of the stock's fair trading value. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued, and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Based on our calculation, Norfolk Southern's stock is significantly undervalued with a market cap of $47.20 billion and a price of $207.79 per share. This undervaluation suggests that the long-term return of its stock is likely to be much higher than its business growth.Norfolk Southern (NSC): A Significantly Undervalued Gem in the Transportation Industry?Link: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Assessing Norfolk Southern's Financial StrengthInvesting in companies with poor financial strength can pose a high risk of permanent capital loss. To avoid this, it's crucial to review a company's financial strength before purchasing shares. Norfolk Southern's cash-to-debt ratio is 0.04, ranking worse than 93.22% of 944 companies in the Transportation industry. This ratio, coupled with an overall financial strength of 4 out of 10, indicates that Norfolk Southern's financial strength is poor.Story continuesNorfolk Southern (NSC): A Significantly Undervalued Gem in the Transportation Industry?Evaluating Profitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies, particularly those with consistent profitability over the long term, is less risky. Norfolk Southern has been profitable 10 over the past 10 years, with an operating margin of 37.32% that ranks better than 92.77% of 954 companies in the Transportation industry. This strong profitability, ranked 8 out of 10, makes Norfolk Southern a safer investment.Growth is a crucial factor in a company's valuation. Norfolk Southern's growth ranks better than 51.95% of 822 companies in the Transportation industry, with a 3-year average annual revenue growth rate of 8.3% and a 3-year average EBITDA growth rate of 9.2%.ROIC vs WACCComparing a company's return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted average cost of capital (WACC) can provide insights into its profitability. Norfolk Southern's ROIC is 10.07, exceeding its WACC of 9.98. This indicates that the company is likely creating value for its shareholders.Norfolk Southern (NSC): A Significantly Undervalued Gem in the Transportation Industry?ConclusionIn summary, Norfolk Southern's stock appears to be significantly undervalued.

However, times interest earned for the company is 5.7%, a massive increase from the first quarter’s 1.2%.DownsidesConcerns Denting Profit Margin: Insulet is incurring higher costs associated with Omnipod 5 production.

402,e481c100-e5cb-3283-b18b-564f056fcfbd,IR,2023-10-17,Why Ingersoll Rand Inc. (NYSE:IR) Could Be Worth Watching,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-ingersoll-rand-inc-nyse-120314475.html,1697457794,STORY,"['IR', 'TT']","[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Ingersoll Rand Inc. (NYSE:IR). The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$70.01 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$62.79. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Ingersoll Rand's current trading price of US$64.22 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Ingersoll Rand’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for Ingersoll Rand What Is Ingersoll Rand Worth?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 19% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Ingersoll Rand today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $79.45, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Ingersoll Rand’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What does the future of Ingersoll Rand look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 72% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Ingersoll Rand. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? IR’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on IR, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Since timing is quite important when it comes to individual stock picking, it's worth taking a look at what those latest analysts forecasts are.

However, the company's fundamentals look pretty decent, and long-term financials are usually aligned with future market price movements. Specifically, we decided to study LyondellBasell Industries'  ROE in this article.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. See our latest analysis for LyondellBasell Industries How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for LyondellBasell Industries is:16% = US$2.1b ÷ US$13b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.16 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.LyondellBasell Industries' Earnings Growth And 16% ROETo begin with, LyondellBasell Industries seems to have a respectable ROE. Even when compared to the industry average of 14% the company's ROE looks quite decent. As you might expect, the 3.2% net income decline reported by LyondellBasell Industries is a bit of a surprise. So, there might be some other aspects that could explain this. For example, it could be that the company has a high payout ratio or the business has allocated capital poorly, for instance.Story continuesHowever, when we compared LyondellBasell Industries' growth with the industry we found that while the company's earnings have been shrinking, the industry has seen an earnings growth of 14% in the same period. This is quite worrisome.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for LYB? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is LyondellBasell Industries Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Looking at its three-year median payout ratio of 40% (or a retention ratio of 60%) which is pretty normal, LyondellBasell Industries' declining earnings is rather baffling as one would expect to see a fair bit of growth when a company is retaining a good portion of its profits. So there could be some other explanations in that regard. For instance, the company's business may be deteriorating.Moreover, LyondellBasell Industries has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Looking at the current analyst consensus data, we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 50% over the next three years. However, LyondellBasell Industries' future ROE is expected to rise to 24% despite the expected increase in the company's payout ratio. We infer that there could be other factors that could be driving the anticipated growth in the company's ROE.ConclusionOn the whole, we do feel that LyondellBasell Industries has some positive attributes. Although, we are disappointed to see a lack of growth in earnings even in spite of a high ROE and and a high reinvestment rate. We believe that there might be some outside factors that could be having a negative impact on the business. That being so, the latest industry analyst forecasts show that the analysts are expecting to see a huge improvement in the company's earnings growth rate.

For example,  New York state is getting $2.76 billion for the current fiscal year, Vermont is receiving $329 million, and Oregon is obtaining $757 million. Most of these funds will be used to bankroll traditional transportation projects, such as roads, bridges, and tunnels.Meanwhile, the Department of Transportation is devoting  $1.4 billion to improving the nation’s “rail infrastructure.” U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell announced on Sept. 25. that the funds would be spent on “70 projects across the nation to improve rail safety, strengthen supply chains and passenger rail service.”And just last week, the Environmental Protection Agency allocated $7.5 billion for “low-interest loans” which will finance the development of  “infrastructure for drinking water, wastewater and stormwater projects.” Here are seven infrastructure stocks that should get big boosts from all of this government spending.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsVulcan Materials Company (VMC)The Vulcan Materials (VMC) website is displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: madamF / Shutterstock.comVulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC) provides various materials used in construction, including asphalt, concrete, sand, and gravel. The company is poised to  get a big boost from the many extra tens of billions of dollars that will be spent by American states on building highways, bridges, streets and tunnels over the next year.Likely partially driven by state governments’ huge spending on infrastructure last year, VMC’s “mix adjusted sales price” climbed 15% last quarter versus the same period a year earlier, and the firm reported that it expected strong price increases to boost its “profitability” going forward.VMC added that the “cash gross profit” of its asphalt business “nearly tripled (year-over-year)…to $66 million.” Governments’ elevated spending on traditional infrastructure had a major impact on the profits of VMC’s asphalt unit.Story continuesOverall, VMC’s EBITDA, excluding certain items, soared to $595 million last quarter from $450 million during the same period a year earlier.Given VMC’s strong growth and excellent prospects, the company’s forward price-earnings ratio of 26 is quite attractive.Given these points, it is one of the best infrastructure stocks to buy.Greenbrier (GBX)The Greenbrier Companies (GBX)logo on the website homepageSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comA leading provider of equipment for trains, Greenbrier (NYSE:GBX) can benefit in two ways from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. First, as I mentioned in the introduction, Washington is going to spend $1.4 billion on measures to  “improve rail safety…and passenger rail service.”  A portion of those funds should find their way into GBX’s accounts.Secondly,  because “railroads haul components used in construction,” Greenbrier should get more orders as a result of Washington’s spending on roads, bridges, and tunnels.Aside from government funds, GBX is also likely getting a boost from the onshoring trend, which has resulted in record spending on factory construction.Greenbrier recently announced that it had received an impressive total of $1.9 billion in orders last quarter.Quanta Services (PWR)An image of a man charging an electric car with icons for renewable energy sources in the background; renewable energy gridSource: petovarga/ShutterstockAs I noted in a previous column, “Quanta (NYSE:PWR) builds…electrical power stations, (and) facilities for renewable energy and natural gas transmission.” It also provides “infrastructure” for electric utilities.PWR should get a significant portion of the $14 billion allocated by the Infrastructure Law “for enhancing the reliability, resilience, and efficiency of the electric grid.”And as I noted in my prior article, PWR is also benefiting tremendously from the energy transition. For example, it was chosen to play a major role in two multi-billion dollar renewable energy projects in the Western U.S.: SunZia Wind  and SunZia Transmission.Last quarter, the company’s net income jumped to $165.9 million from $88 million during the same period a year earlier.Given the company’s rapid profit growth, its forward price-earnings ratio of 20 times is quite low.Sterling Infrastructure (STRL)Cars on an urban highway driving into the sunsetSource: Anna Kraynova / ShutterstockTexas-based Sterling (NASDAQ:STRL) carries out “infrastructure and rehabilitation projects for highways, roads, bridges, airports, ports, light rail, water, wastewater, and storm drainage systems” on behalf of various governments.As a result, the company is well-positioned to benefit from multiple parts of the Infrastructure Law, including the funds that will be spent by states on roads and highways, the $7.5 billion that Washington will provide to enhance water infrastructure, and the $1.4 billion that it’s spending on improving “rail infrastructure.”Last quarter, Sterling’s top line jumped 13% year-over-year to $522 million, while its net income soared 40% YOY to $49.5 million.On July 21, Sterling announced that it had been awarded a large portion of a $216 million “design-build contract….by the Utah Department of Transportation.”I believe that Sterling will also get a boost from Texas’ rapid population growth and resulting need for new and wider roads.Xylemxylem appSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comXylem (NYSE:XYL) “engages in the design, manufacture, and servicing of engineered products and solutions for the water and wastewater applications.”  As a result, the company should get a lift from the $7.5 billion that Washington will provide to bankroll improved “infrastructure for drinking water, wastewater and stormwater projects.”Earlier this year, Xylem acquired Evoqua, another company in the water infrastructure sector which I wrote about in an August 2022 column. On Evoqua’s Q3 earnings call, its CEO predicted that the firm would start to obtain revenue from the Infrastructure Law in the second half of 2023. Consequently, I expect Xylem to get a major boost from the legislation in upcoming quarters.In the wake of Xylem’s acquisition of Evoqua, investment bank Robert Baird upgraded the stock to “outperform.” The bank believes that XYL can “outperform” in any sort of economy while it is well-positioned to increase its profits.Granite Construction (GVA)Railroad tracks with a junctionSource: ShutterstockGranite (NYSE:GVA) carries out the construction of roads, bridges, and rail lines. It also provides materials, such as asphalt, used in construction and implements water improvement projects.Of course, GVA is very well-positioned to benefit from multiple portions of the Infrastructure Law,  including Washington’s investments in roads, bridges, railroads, and water infrastructure.In August, Granite announced that it had been selected to carry out a $73 million water improvement project in Utah.Last quarter, the company’s top line jumped 17% year-over-year to $899 million, while its earnings per share, excluding certain one-time items, gained  $12 million versus Q2 of 2022  to $46 million.Caterpillar (CAT)Image of a yellow construction vehicle with the Caterpillar (CAT) logo on itSource: astudio / Shutterstock.comCaterpillar (NYSE:CAT) sells construction equipment such as excavators, haulers, backhoes, and bulldozers.As a result, the company should get a lift from Washington’s huge spending on building roads, bridges, and tunnels. Additionally, the firm should be helped by the current record spending on building factories amid the onshoring trend.Moreover, CAT sells equipment used to search for and extract oil, so the company should get a lift from the current high oil prices.In the second quarter, CAT’s revenue jumped 22% year-over-year to $17.3 billion, while its earnings per share soared to $5.67 from $3.13 during the same period a year earlier.Given the company’s strong growth and excellent prospects, its forward price-earnings ratio of 13 is quite low.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(NYSE:GE) appears to be working wonders on the companys prospects as it is currently outperforming the benchmark index.After several years of languishing financial and market performances, in 2021, the Boston-based industrial conglomerate announced that in an effort to bolster its business, it planned to split into three publicly traded companies. They are GE HealthCare, GE Vernova and GE Aerospace. While the health care business was spun off in January of this year, the breakup is expected to wrap up in the first few months of 2024.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 9 Warning Sign with GE.So far, the companys efforts appear to be paying off. Not only did General Electric record strong results for the second quarter, but the stock has climbed around 65% year to date. This compares to the S&amp;P 500 Index's gain of nearly 14% over the same period.General Electric: Showing Signs of Promising ProgressGeneral Electrics evolving business structureFounded in 1892 by a group headed by famed inventor Thomas Edison, the company has seen a number of changes through periods of both turbulence and strength. Following the recent divestment of its health care segment, General Electric now consists of three businesses: aerospace, power and renewable energy.General Electric: Showing Signs of Promising ProgressThe GE Vernova business, which is scheduled to be spun off early next year, is a global energy company that encompasses the conglomerates current power, wind and electrification segments. Only the aerospace division, which is its largest unit by revenue, will remain under the original companys umbrella, focusing on manufacturing aircraft engines, systems and avionics.Earnings reviewGeneral Electric reported its second-quarter financial results on July 25.For the three months ended June 30, the company posted earnings of 68 cents per share on $16.7 billion in revenue. Both figures were up from the prior-year quarter. Further, GE recorded its fifth consecutive quarter of accelerating growth over the year-ago periods.Story continuesNet income came in at $35 million, which was a significant improvement from the $882 million loss it saw last year.General Electric: Showing Signs of Promising ProgressIn a statement, Chairman and CEO H. Lawrence Culp Jr. noted the companys performance was built off of the strong momentum seen in its first quarter. He attributed the double-digit increase in orders and revenue to robust services growth across our portfolio, increased demand at GE Aerospace and record Renewable Energy orders.""GE Aerospace is growing rapidly, executing on the ramp for customers and building services strength, while GE Vernova advances toward its spin-off as Renewable Energy improves and Power continues to deliver, he said. Each business has its own critical mission and focus.Looking ahead, General Electric raised its guidance for the year. It now anticipates low double-digit revenue growth, adjusted earnings per share of between $2.10 and $2.30 and free cash flow of $4.10 billion to $4.60 billion.DividendOn Sept. 6, General Electrics board of directors authorized a quarterly dividend of 8 cents per share. It will be distributed on Oct. 25 to shareholders of record as of Sept. 26.While the company lost its status as a Dividend Aristocrat in 2009, it currently has a dividend yield of 0.29% and a payout ratio of 0.03.ValuationGeneral Electric has a $118.74 billion market cap; its shares were trading around $109.10 on Monday with a price-earnings ratio of 13.57, a price-book ratio of 3.81 and a price-sales ratio of 1.67.The GF Value Line suggests the stock is significantly overvalued currently based on its historical ratios, past financial performance and analysts future earnings projections.General Electric: Showing Signs of Promising ProgressAt 57 out of 100, the GF Score indicates the company has poor performance potential. While General Electric received moderate ratings for profitability, financial strength and momentum, the growth and value ranks are low.General Electric: Showing Signs of Promising ProgressGeneral Electric also has a predictability rank of one out of five stars. According to GuruFocus research companies with this rank return an average of 1.10% annually over a 10-year period.Guru interestWhile gurus have been more bearish toward the stock in recent quarters, there are still several who appear to be betting on General Electric going forward as it carries out its transformation.General Electric: Showing Signs of Promising ProgressOf the gurus invested in the stock, Dodge &amp; Cox has the largest stake with 2.24% of its outstanding shares. Andreas Halvorsen (Trades, Portfolio), Richard Pzena (Trades, Portfolio), Hotchkis &amp; Wiley, Nelson Peltz (Trades, Portfolio), the T Rowe Price Equity Income Fund (Trades, Portfolio) and Jim Simons (Trades, Portfolio) Renaissance Technologies also have significant positions. However, only one of these investors added to their holdings in the most recent quarter, while the rest either cut back or left it unchanged.During the second quarter, Jeremy Grantham (Trades, Portfolio), Stanley Druckenmiller (Trades, Portfolio), Paul Tudor Jones (Trades, Portfolio), Jefferies Group (Trades, Portfolio), Lee Ainslie (Trades, Portfolio) and Jeff Auxier (Trades, Portfolio) entered new investments in the stock.Final thoughtsWhile it may still be too early to tell whether or not General Electrics business transformation will work out for all involved, it appears to be on the right track so far with strong earnings results and a stock performance that is topping the benchmark index.As such, investors may want to take a closer look at the industrial giant.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

For the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s revenues indicates a 17.5% increase from the year-ago reported figure.Strength in GE Gas Power’s heavy-duty gas turbine transactional services and GE gas turbine business are likely to drive the performance of the company’s Power segment. The acquisition of Nexus Controls (April 2023), which allows the creation of a single, full-service controls business line for further development of GE’s proprietary Mark Vle controls systems platform, is anticipated to aid the segment’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.The acquisition of Greenbird Integration Technology AS, which facilitates GE’s GridOS by the addition of new capabilities for connecting systems and integrating data across the grid smoothly, is expected to support the company’s performance in the third quarter. For the quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted earnings indicates a 60% jump from the year-ago reported number.However, raw material cost inflation is likely to dent GE’s bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter.

Earnings and revenues breezed past the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company lifted the lower end of its full-year earnings guidance. UNH shares rose 2.6% on the day.Investors can tap the opportunity by investing in ETFs having the largest allocation to this health insurance giant. These include iShares U.S. Healthcare Providers ETF IHF, Harbor Health Care ETF MEDI, Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund XLV, iShares U.S. Healthcare ETF IYH and Vanguard Health Care ETF VHT.Earnings in FocusEarnings per share came in at $6.56, topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.33 and increasing 13.3% from the year-ago quarter. Revenues grew 14.2% year over year to $92.4 billion and were above the estimated $91.4 billion. The growth marks the company's seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue increase. Solid results were again powered by double-digit growth in Optum and UnitedHealthcare.Medical ratio (a measure of the percentage of premiums paid out for medical services) rose to 82.3% from 81.6% in the year-ago quarter due to an increase in outpatient care, primarily serving seniors, and business mix (read: Cash-Cow ETFs for Long-Term Growth &amp; Income).UNH added 55,000 Medicare Advantage members from Q2, while the number of people served under Medicaid fell by 290,000 to 8.065 million amid eligibility redeterminations. Domestic commercial customers rose by 75,000.The health insurer raised the lower end of its 2023 adjusted earnings per share guidance from $24.70-$25.00 to $24.85-$25.00.

The company's revenue trend is shifting into growth territory in the current quarter, and while growth should bounce around given the volatile comps, the overall trend should be positive, the firm argues.Jefferies upgraded Pfizer (PFE) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $39, up from $38., after the company updated its fiscal 2023 guide, citing COVID revenue by $9B, and announced a cost cut program. The firm says the guidance revision is largely driven by Paxlovid as Comirnaty performance was ahead of buy-side expectations.UBS upgraded UnitedHealth (UNH) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $640, up from $520. The firm believes the ""strong"" Q3 release from UnitedHealth is a ""clearing event that should pave the way for improved valuation for the stock.""Stifel upgraded Colgate-Palmolive (CL) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $81, down from $85. The upgrade of Colgate reflects modest multiple expansion on improving fundamentals coupled with an ""undemanding"" current valuation, the firm analyst tells investors in a research note.Morgan Stanley upgraded Check Point (CHKP) to Equal Weight from Underweight with a price target of $144, up from $118.

The firm notes JD.com's shares have been on a downward trajectory for most of this year, and fell sharply after the company signaled a much weaker trajectory for the remainder of 2023 than the Street had expected.Jefferies downgraded Verisk Analytics (VRSK) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $247, down from $265. The stock's valuation now appears full as Verisk's multiple has expanded to a record level above peers and further expansion is unlikely as growth moderates to more normal levels, says Jefferies.BMO Capital downgraded Enphase Energy (ENPH) to Market Perform from Outperform with a price target of $148, down from $175. The trough in U.S. residential solar demand appears to be deeper than anticipated and the timing of a recovery is uncertain, the firm says.Goldman Sachs downgraded KB Home (KBH) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $48, down from $54. The firm sees less upside to KB verses peers in the current operating environment.RBC Capital downgraded Crown Castle (CCI) to Sector Perform from Outperform with a price target of $100, down from $125. The downgrade reflects a lack of near-term catalysts for the stock, questions around the path of dividend growth relative to net leverage, and uncertainties around the pace of small cell/fiber growth, the firm says.Story continuesAn instacart delivery in Washington, DC on October 07, 2023.

A senior healthcare professional giving advice to a patient in a clinic.Andrew Witty: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. The third quarter results we reported today reflect well-balanced and durable growth, supported by disciplined execution, and a steadfast commitment to ensure high quality comprehensive care is well within reach for every person we're privileged to serve. Evolution in our marketplace, including regulatory changes, means agility and adaptability must continue to be defining characteristics of our company. The people of Optum and UnitedHealthcare continuously strive to find new ways to innovate, serve, and grow. As a direct result of their mission-driven focus, this year we'll serve even more people more comprehensively than anticipated in the outlook we offered at the end of 2022.Story continuesBy the close of this year, we will serve nearly 900,000 additional patients under value-based care arrangements at OptumHealth, almost 1 million new consumers across UnitedHealthcare’s Medicare Advantage offerings, and a total more than 1.5 billion scripts to the people who rely on OptumRx. Based on this performance, we're strengthening our 2023 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $24.85 to $25 per share. The confidence we have in our sustained long-term growth outlook is exemplified by the 14% third quarter revenue increase we reported this morning, more than $11 billion above last year. The sources of this growth will drive many more years of strong performance. Value-based care is the centerpiece of our long-term strategy, precisely because it delivers on the promise of high-quality clinical outcomes and experiences at lower cost than traditional models.This year, we expect OptumHealth will serve more than 4 million people in fully accountable relationships, almost twice as many people as we served just two years ago. Many of these patients have serious health challenges, few economic resources, and until now often had limited access to care or the type of care they truly need. Ramping up to engage these patients requires significant upfront investment and high touch reach. These early efforts ensure we can address patients’ unique needs and design personalized care plans that drive better health outcomes, increase quality of life, and deliver cost savings throughout the health system. Making investments to serve people, who have endured far too many barriers to care is an easy choice for us all.See also Top 50 Coldest Countries In The World and 16 Best Vacations for Seniors with Limited Mobility.Q&amp;A SessionIn 2023, you have seen both our commitment and financial capacity to invest to further enable our ability to serve and to grow far into the future. In recent years, we've invested significant resources in building our capabilities to care for people most effectively for the life or health stage they find themselves in, whether they need preventative or palliative care or are best served in a clinic at home or virtually. In particular, we're advancing our ability to care for people in their homes and integrating that physical care with our pharmacy and behavioral offerings. This work means developing an even more versatile clinical workforce to serve consumers in more ways through clinic-based Optum care delivery capabilities and extending our reach to consumers, who may not have ready access to physical clinics.Medicare Advantage continues to be a powerful force in driving superior health outcomes for consumers and in helping to lower costs at the system level. Today, about half of all seniors in the U.S. have chosen Medicare Advantage over traditional Medicare, and that number will continue to expand for very good reasons. The results are well documented. Medicare Advantage outperforms traditional fee-for-service for seniors on many measures, including lower rates of hospitalization. And they spend up to 45% less out of pocket, compared to those in Medicare fee-for-service. Importantly, this high value for consumers is delivered at a lower cost to the health system. UnitedHealthcare serves more people in high quality, four-star and higher Medicare Advantage plans than any other organization.Looking to the 2024 enrollment period, which begins Sunday, we're confident our offerings will again resonate with consumers as they prioritize high-quality care and stable benefits. In the reduced funding environment health plans face, I credit our teams for investing in the areas consumers value most, including zero-dollar premium plans, no copays for primary, virtual, and preventative care, and no copays for 100s of the most commonly prescribed drugs. I want to highlight one more aspect of our growth story, the consistently strong performance of our pharmacy businesses. Pharmacy, as you know, is the most common consumer touch point in healthcare. What consumers and employers want more than anything is access to the most effective treatments in the moment they need them for the lowest possible cost.OptumRx is delivering on those expectations. This most recent selling season is on track to be among our strongest, reflecting a combination of new clients and retention rates in the very high-90s. And as the coming season for 2025 develops, we're expecting another year of robust growth. Our clients tell us they value the enhancements we are making to our pharmacy offerings, providing them transparency and choice, while also integrating new tools and capabilities. Notably, our pharmacy service offerings go far beyond the foundational benefit management capabilities and now account for about half of all OptumRx revenues. We continue to expand the reach of our community pharmacies and our diverse specialty and infusion offerings are growing double-digits.Driving this expanding market demand is the enormous pressure facing employers, health plans, governments and others to manage and respond to manufacturer list pricing. The services offered by OptumRx and others are the only counterbalance to drug company pricing. The foundational business objectives for PBMs is to lower costs and make medicines more affordable and accessible for individuals and families. PBMs are the only entities in the drug supply chain with that exclusive focus and incentive, and we're honored to play this critical role. These pillars of our growth, value-based care, pharmacy, and our innovative benefits businesses, alongside our health technology and financial service capabilities, underpin our ability to develop ever stronger value propositions for the people, who receive and those who pay for care and support our confidence in a future of growth.And with that, I'll pass it to Dirk McMahon, our President and COO.Dirk McMahon: Thanks, Andrew. I recently hosted UnitedHealthcare's National Accounts Forum, where we bring together client leaders twice a year to share ideas and gather feedback. These are some of the biggest and most sophisticated companies in America that collectively employ and sponsor coverage for millions of people. And to no surprise, healthcare costs top their list of concerns, especially the rising cost of drugs. In addition, they want innovation, new tools to help their employees take full advantage of their benefits, achieve better health outcomes, and save money. And of course, it has to be digital. Let me offer a few examples of innovation that have fueled our growth outlook, starting with our mobile platform, the primary access point for millions of UHC members.Each year, we had new capabilities to provide consumers with increased on-demand care access, highly personalized information about their benefits, real-time support, cost estimation tools, integrated pharmacy capabilities, and enhanced rewards. Another example, our newest and fastest growing commercial offerings, which feature no annual deductibles and incentivize people to make good healthcare choices by offering an unprecedented view into quality and cost. When seeking care options, consumers see potential care providers' latest reviews and quality designations, and they see what they will actually pay for their care, which will help them make the most informed decisions. UnitedHealthcare members in these offerings are receiving more preventative care, while paying about 50% less out of pocket, compared to people enrolled in traditional offerings.And their employers can reduce the total cost of care with an average savings of 11%. These results are why such new offerings are among our fastest growing. Beyond these consumer-facing innovations, we're leveraging the latest technologies to create greater operational capacity and productivity, so we can better serve consumers and focus on the highest value work. Our teams are significantly improving how quickly we respond to the millions of benefit questions we receive each year. We are using AI and natural language processing to expedite call documentation, to rapidly generate accurate summaries of consumer interactions with our contact centers, saving millions of dollars in administrative work and freeing up capacity for our people to prioritize engagement.We're also utilizing these technologies to translate and interpret unstructured data, such as physician notes, which will help, for example, provide deeper insights for life sciences customers, so they can better assess the efficacy of their treatments. Of course, these are just a few of the 100s of AI applications powered by OptumInsight we are actively developing, testing, and deploying today to further elevate the consumer and care provider experience, while driving increased quality and lower costs. And with that, I'll turn it over to our CFO, John Rex.John Rex: Thank you, Dirk. The growth we reported today is a direct result of investments made over many years to develop and connect the diverse health capabilities needed to serve the people, who rely on us each day, while also creating the foundational capacity to serve millions more in the years ahead. This capability development has long been in the making, and it's still very much underway as the opportunities to serve more people, more deeply continue to expand. Before reviewing our business results, I'll offer a few brief comments on care activity. Care patterns remain consistent with the view we shared during the second quarter, with activity levels still led by outpatient care for seniors, and still most notably in the orthopedic and cardiac procedure categories.These trends remain stable at the levels we previously described. As we've noted, our outlook assumes these activity levels persist throughout next year. We continuously monitor a broad spectrum of patient acuity levels and have yet to see any other notable changes. For example, within oncology, the average stage at which we are first seeing cancer diagnosis remains consistent with historical patterns. As always, we remain diligent in looking for changes to the underlying health of patients. With that, let's turn to our third quarter results. Revenues of $92.4 billion grew by 14% over the prior year, with double-digit growth again at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare. Optum Health revenues grew by 29% approaching $24 billion, driven by an increase in the number of care services we offer and patients we serve, especially for those with complex care needs.Operating margins continue to reflect the initial clinical engagement activities that support the strong growth in patients we have realized this year, as well as the higher care activity patterns we have discussed. OptumRx revenues grew by 14%, approaching $29 billion, driven by the strength in our pharmacy care services offerings, as well as new customer wins. Script growth of nearly 7% reflects customer response to our innovative solutions, which focus on choice and lowest net cost. OptumInsight revenues grew by 35% to $5 billion. Revenue backlog of over $31 billion increased by more than $7 billion, in part due to the change healthcare combination. In addition, we recently announced a partnership to provide revenue cycle, analytics, and information technology services to a health system serving more than 400,000 people in the Midwest.Turning to UnitedHealthcare, our commercial business added nearly 700,000 people through the third quarter. Further, selling season indications are tracking favorably, particularly in national accounts. So as ‘24 begins, we expect to grow to serve an additional 1 million people with commercial benefits. Within our public sector programs, we expect growth of nearly 1 million Medicare Advantage members this year. And looking to the year ahead, we're encouraged by the consumer value, stability, and breadth of our offerings. And as always, we start with an expectation that we will outpace overall market growth. Our Medicaid performance remains strong as we support people and families through the redeterminations process. Our teams are really leaning in, speaking with 1,000s of consumers each day.Through a comprehensive Outreach Program, we are helping people navigate the process and connecting them with the resources they need to retain or reinstate their health benefits or to help them find other affordable coverages. A significant majority of the people we engage with are able to retain or reinstate their coverage. Our capital capacities remain strong. For the first nine months of the year, adjusted cash flows from operations were at $22.4 billion or 1.3 times net income. And in that same timeframe, we returned over $11.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As noted, given the strength of our business performance, this morning we have updated our ‘23 outlook for adjusted earnings to $24.85 to $25 per share.And as we finish strongly in ‘23 and look forward to ‘24, we're intensely focused on execution, while further expanding our capacity to serve more people, more deeply, and building the foundations to support our growth objectives for years to come. Now I'll turn it back to Andrew.Andrew Witty: Thanks John. Before opening up for questions, I'll offer some preliminary observations about next year, while reserving most of this conversation for our investor conference on November 29th. Our businesses continue to build momentum, while maintaining flexibility and adaptability for an ever-changing landscape, even as we invest for the future. We're focused on our strategic growth pillars and driving efficiencies throughout the enterprise at an accelerated pace. At this distance, analyst earnings estimates for 2024 reasonably reflect the performance view we expect to offer in November, with consensus near the upper end of our likely initial outlook range. Importantly, the growth we're realizing today and our expanding capacity serve to further reinforce the confidence we have in our long-term 13% to 16% growth objective. And with that, I'll now ask the operator to open up for questions.Operator: The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.Lisa Gill: Good morning, and thanks for the comments. I wanted to start with GLP-1s and really understand from two sides. One, when we think about rates for 2024, can you talk about what you've incorporated in rates around GLP-1s, especially around weight loss as we have new products coming to the market? And how do I think about that from the PBM side when we think about the services that you can wrap around that and sell from a PBM perspective?Andrew Witty: Lisa, thanks so much for the question. In a second, I'll ask Brian Thompson from UHC and Dr. Patrick Conway to respond to your comments in a little more detail. But let me just preface all of that. You know, the thing we're most overall focused on in GLP-1 space is honestly the pricing. You know, we're very positive about the potential for another tool in the toolbox to help folks manage their weight. We recognize that has potential benefits, but we're struggling and frankly our clients are struggling with the list prices, which have been demanded of these products in the U.S., which are running at about 10 times the level of price which have been paid in Western Europe. So, overall, I'd say that is our focus, is to try and find a way to make this a sustainable and affordable space for our clients to support. With that said, let me ask Brian to give you a perspective from UHC and how they've incorporated this in their forward view?Brian Thompson: Sure. Thanks for the question there, Lisa. First, to put in context GLP-1 is over 80% on the diabetic side. So as we think about weight loss, up to maybe 20% of our total spend and it's largely performing in line with what we had planned as we went into ‘23. And we feel very confident and comfortable about how we're looking at that going forward into ‘24. As you think about it, keep in mind, the vast majority of the coverage here is in our fee-based business, that's our self-employed customers and that's still at less than a third, around 30% of our book. As we look forward, are our customers considering to cover more or less? I would say it's a mixed bag, some are seeking coverage albeit dissatisfied with the price points.Some are backing off given the cost, but I wouldn't really be directional one way or the other on whether or not we're seeing more or less coverage on the weightless side as we look forward. But again, to Andrew's point, beyond just getting to the obvious lower price points, we're really trying to work with manufacturers to get to some aligned value-based constructs, getting pricing to a point where it's based on outcomes and adherence levels, all the way to outright risk on utilization levels, and pairing those with therapies and programs that can put less reliance on lifelong adherence requirements like these drugs currently have. We're not there yet. We're optimistic, but we can get there, but clearly price point is a key barrier.Andrew Witty: Brian, thanks so much. And Patrick, maybe from the -- from OptumRx perspective, you could talk a little bit about the broader approaches we take?Patrick Conway: Thank you. As Andrew said, our customers, payers, employers, people we serve are concerned about the prices of GLP-1s as set by manufacturers. OptumRx will continue to negotiate lower prices through discounts over time, be transparent with our customers, and implement clinical evidence-based guidelines so the right people get appropriate medicines. And as you alluded to, Lisa, obesity and cardiometabolic disease is a major public issue -- health issue in the U.S. and across all of [Oxfam] (ph), we are developing and implementing comprehensive solutions of which medicines are only a part of on behalf of our clients and people we serve to drive better health outcomes for all and value to the health system.Andrew Witty: Thanks, Patrick. And Lisa, thanks so much for the question. Next question, please, Jennifer.Operator: Yes, we'll go next to A.J. Rice with [UBS] (ph).Unidentified Analyst: Hi, everybody. Thanks for the question. You know, it's similar to last quarter, the trend in margin and OptumHealth and OptumInsight has been down year-to-year, you know, you've called out change, particularly with OptumInsight, but I wondered if there's any ability to discuss unusual items, non-recurring items. I know you said you had some cost reduction programs you were implementing this quarter in OptumHealth. Did those impact the results? And is there any change as you look ahead to ‘24 in your margin expectations or targets for those two businesses?Andrew Witty: A.J., thanks so much for the question, appreciate it. So let me just make a few comments, particularly as it speaks to the OptumHealth part of the question that you raised. So as you look at 2023, essentially what we've seen, and we refer to this in Q2, greater growth in the number of people, patients, that we've been privileged to serve this year, particularly the more complex patients. So very strong, and you heard in our opening commentary, very strong growth in the number of fully accountable lives running at about 900,000, substantial fraction of that coming in the more complex cases. As I said back in the last call, we're very, very pleased to have that growth. We believe that is really foundational or key foundation for future long-term growth of the business.However, within that, the mix of that population is a little different to what we expected. That takes time to then build the engagement capabilities that we need to be able to work with those people and their care providers to ensure the very best care is delivered in the most efficient and effective way. And that's really the bulk of the investment that we're talking about. It's really taking the time, looking after those folks in the way they need to be looked after right now in advance of those being able to engage with them fully and deliver then the various interventions and advices that we can provide that we're really building throughout Optum to ensure that not just in one year, but over multiple years, those folks get increasingly better care delivery and better outcomes.And recall that these patients in many cases have really been somewhat, you know, not necessarily looked after, as well as they could have been by the system, because of their very complexity. In some cases, they're not able to get to clinics, which is why we've been building up our home care capabilities and other wraparound services to the classic clinic approach. That's really the driving force. Now, as that speaks to the future, two things really, A.J., one is we're super confident around our ability to continue to grow the number of patients, who are able to look after. Number two, as those capabilities that have been accelerated during this year begin to affect both the quality positively and the cost of how these patients' care is delivered, you're going to see that shine through an improved economic performance of OptumHealth.And as we look forward, we're very confident about continued strengthening of that business. Make no mistake, OptumHealth is having a very strong growth year and we're taking the opportunity this year to really ready ourselves and build strength for the next many years of that business. AJ, thanks so much for the question. Next question?Operator: Yes, we'll go next to Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.Josh Raskin: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Understanding that you expect Medicare Advantage to grow at a healthy pace, I think you said above market again in 2024. Could you speak to that progress expected at OptumHealth? I know we'll get details at the Investor Day, but how are you thinking about the transition of patients from sort of fee for service to these fully risk engagements and then maybe general levels of investment for growth in light of the risk model and reimbursement model changes?Andrew Witty: So Josh, thanks so much for the question. I mean, obviously we'll leave very much the detail of the elements of the growth model for when we meet with you all in November. Having said that, we would no reason not to expect a continued healthy momentum in our move toward value-based care next year with continued high expectations for our ability to deliver that. To your broader question, maybe just reflect a little bit again on 2023. So this has been a year which essentially has been obviously very heavily influenced by the change in the funding environment that was announced earlier in the year for Medicare Advantage. And we're very appreciative of the three-year phasing of the changes, which CMS ultimately decided to make.But obviously, those changes are essentially the equivalent to a price cut phased in over three years for the Medicare Advantage program. We are appreciative of the fact that we have had essentially seven, eight, nine months warning of that in terms of when that was announced before we go into the ‘24 year. And that’s allowed us and we have taken full advantage of it to really focus on how we ready ourselves, not just for 2024, but for the next 36 months. So 2023 has all for us been about ensuring that we re-engineer our cost base, that we refocused our benefit strategies to those things that matter most to patients, that we strengthen and invest in our ability to manage affordability of care going forward into the system, and that we're taking full advantage of building the capabilities we have already begun to construct around our consumer engagement, our technology, digital first capabilities, and ultimately doubling down on our commitment to value-based care.That has really been the story behind the investments of 2023 in response to the changes that have been signaled by CMS, so that we go into ‘24, ‘25, ‘26, ‘27 feeling strong, feeling that we've taken advantage of these last several months to ensure that we've adjusted and adapted our strategy and business in readiness for the change in the funding environment, which gives us strong confidence for next year and underpins our commitment to the signal I just gave you in terms of our potential for 2024. Next question, please?Operator: We’ll go next to Justin Lake with Wolf Research.Justin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to ask about UHC performance. First, your MLR was better than our expectations, but curious how it compared to your internal estimates? And maybe you could share how that might have come across -- come in across the three main business segments? And then quickly, on the third quarter UHC margins, I found it interesting that while the MLR deteriorated by 50 basis points year-over-year in the quarter, overall UHC margins actually improved by 50 basis points. So, curious what might have grown with that? Thanks.Andrew Witty: Justin, thanks so much for the question. Let me ask John Rex to respond to the first part and then Brian Thompson, the second.John Rex: Good morning, Justin. So, overall, I'd call it broadly consistent with our expectations in terms of the third quarter. So a few things I'd like to highlight though. So care patterns were, as we discussed, focused again on outpatients, outpatient activity with seniors, those continue at the levels we described during the second quarter. And that's what really drove a lot of kind of the activity throughout the quarter. It's still in those categories that we have been focused on. The sequential move that you see from second quarter to third quarter is largely a seasonal factor. As you know well, there's always less care activity in a third quarter, that has to do just with vacations, a lot of the elements that go in there in terms of certain types of discretionary care, seasonal illnesses, so typical patterns, and also Part-D patterns that you see on a regular basis.In fact, if you go back to the years prior to 2020, 3Q would typically be the lowest care ratio quarter. So I'd say it's probably more typical than not, just getting back to periods that were more normalized in terms of the activities that we saw going on there. We continue to expect our full-year medical care ratio to be toward the upper end of our initial 82.6 plus minus 50 basis point range. So very consistent with the level that we set out there back again in the two quarter that would be toward the upper end of that outlook. So -- and then the seasonal factors in the 3Q, that some of those things influencing where you'd expect to be in that fourth quarter, the final quarter of the calendar year. Certainly utilization, Part-D impacts, they move the other direction in a fourth quarter.So typical in that. That's amplified, of course, very much by the deductible wear off features that you see in a fourth quarter, influenza, RSV, all those patterns that come in. So we'd expect that to move the other direction here as we go into the 4Q.Andrew Witty: Great. Thanks, John. And Brian?Brian Thompson: Yes, John, I think you did a good job of explaining, sort of, the sequencing of the medical cost ratio. What I don't want to lose sight of is I think the key point is all of our businesses in UnitedHealthcare right now are really demonstrating innovation and market success at the same time. And you're seeing that come through in these margins, whether that's our complex care and health equity strategy in Medicaid, how we're showing up with broader service offerings and conveniences like UCard and URide, NMA to complement strong, stable core benefits or some of the innovations you heard around the commercial benefits in Dirk’s opening remarks. This is really translating the type of growth and performance that I think you've come to expect from UnitedHealthCare, and I think it sets up a really nice baseline that I remain optimistic about as we look forward to 2024.Andrew Witty: Thanks so much, Brian and John. Next question, please?Operator: We'll go next to Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.Stephen Baxter: Yes, hi, thanks. I wanted to ask about the PBM business, obviously interest in alternative or maybe even experimental models has been a big area to-date, you know, the past quarter or so. I guess what are you hearing from your health plan employer clients on their degree of interest in doing something totally transformational in terms of how they manage those benefits? Thanks.Andrew Witty: Hi, Stephen, thanks so much. Let me ask Patrick Conway to respond to that.Patrick Conway: Yes, so as we interact with our clients, employers, payers, and others, on this, first I'll note, a recent survey came out, approximately 90% of those clients are satisfied with their PBM. They're also satisfied with the level of transparency. Specifically for OptumRx, we will continue to innovate and provide additional solutions to our clients that are comprehensive, integrated and transparent. I'll call out one other area, transparency to the consumer. This has been a journey for us that we continue to drive transparency to the consumer. To call out one example with Price Edge, a product recently launched, that's providing consumers the most affordable medicine at the point of care. We are seeing millions of consumers access, use this tool as we provide it to them. And so you'll continue to see us to drive consumer transparency and innovative solutions to our clients.Andrew Witty: Right, Patrick, thanks so much. Next question?Operator: We'll go next to Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs.Nathan Rich: Great, good morning. Thanks for the question. I wanted to go back to the GLP-1 Class and I guess, you know, as we're starting to see more outcomes data for these drugs, do you see that changing, you know, employers willingness to cover this class given the potential long-term benefits and, you know, how you helping them think about potential ways to design the benefit to be able to manage that cost, which you guys talked about earlier being so much in focus for employers?Andrew Witty: Yes, Nathan, thanks so much for the question. I mean, there's an old adage, which I quite like in this context, which is the innovation that is not affordable is not innovative. And that's really the key to all of this. Though I have no argument, I don't think anybody at UnitedHealth Group has any argument with the prospects and possibility for the future of this drug class. We recognize the need and nothing would make us happier, honestly, to be able to lean forward and see more and more folks take advantage of these sorts of opportunities. But ultimately it has to be affordable. And what we're hearing from our clients is they just -- they are really struggling to see how they embark on that journey of what they regard as a kind of open-ended financial risk.Now that's exactly why Brian earlier made the comments he did about we're trying to put forward to various manufacturers a variety of different options, but we need the manufacturers to move. It's as simple as that. And we remain extremely open-minded to any model that works. We're working with our clients to ensure that they understand the various options. But they are giving us very, very clear signals. They need our help to make this a more affordable proposition for their employees and their members. And we'll continue to lean into that. Thanks for the question, Nathan. Next question?Operator: We’ll go next to Scott Fidel with Stephens.Scott Fidel: Hi, thanks. Good morning. [Indiscernible] if you can give us your updated thoughts on from this vantage point, what you're thinking about the trajectory of just overall wage inflation in healthcare? And how you're sort of planning for that? We have been seeing sort of moderation from the COVID peaks, but there certainly seems to be some pro-inflationary risks out there when thinking about some of the federal policy proposals, state proposals, and then obviously some of these Union actions too. So just curious on how you're thinking about wage inflation and health care moving forward and risks to that inflecting back upwards? Thanks.Andrew Witty: Yes, absolutely. Thanks so much for the question. Let me ask Dirk to give you a few comments on that.Dirk McMahon: Yes, well, to start, what I would say is as we go out and we negotiate with various health systems for prices as we move forward, you know, one of the key things involved in those discussions is, you know, what wage inflation is and how it's impacting their costs. You know, as we sit here today, it's lucky that we sort of have three-year contracts, so it's muted a little bit. But what I would also say is, you know, we see a little bit of upward pressure on unit costs related to wages, but as I sit here today, it's not something that we haven't planning for and priced about. As I think about our own business, we haven't had trouble recruiting people such as nurses, clinicians. We've actually, you know, people really want to work for us and from a capacity perspective, one of the things as we've talked about our growth so far, we have to make sure we have the appropriate labor capacity to manage all the risks that we take.And as a consequence, we do spend a lot of time looking at the market. And as I said, people want to come to work for us. They like the mission. They like the ability to transform healthcare. And we're pretty pleased with our ability to hire and manage our operations going forward.Andrew Witty: Thanks, Dirk. Thank you very much for the question. Next question please?Operator: We'll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.Kevin Fischbeck: Great, thanks. I wanted to ask about OptumHealth, I understand the commentary about membership coming in better, which creates a margin drag, but it feels like a couple of hundred thousand people, maybe low to mid-single-digit, more membership than you expected, causing margins to drop from 8% to 7% or 12%, essentially. Seems like a pretty big delta. So I assume there's other things going on in there beyond just digesting new membership growth. If not, then I guess we would know what the margin is on those new members. But is there anything else you would spike out there and how do we think about building back from where we are today to that 8% to 10% margin target? Is it simply about getting today's membership to target margins or is there a cost side? It seems like you're adjusting the labor force to some degree. Is there an MLR side? Is there a rate side? Any other color to kind of help us give visibility into the 8% to 10% over time? Thanks.Andrew Witty: Kevin, thanks so much for the question. So listen, by far and away the most important phenomena here are the things we've talked about to you already. So just to reiterate a little bit what we said to you back in Q2. So we've seen obviously the elevation in MLR which has stabilized, hasn't really come down, isn't accelerating up, but definitely is a phenomena year-over-year, number one, number two, increased behavioral care costs. Remember that within OptumHealth, our behavioral business is, that's where our behavioral business sits, and that has also seen significant increase year-over-year. We're very positive about that, because it's a signal that people are engaging in seeking help for their behavioral conditions.And we know that, that entwines very importantly with their ongoing medical costs. But nonetheless, it's an element of elevation. And then as you rightly reiterate, a piece of it is the growth in our value-based lives and the mix of those lives. And by mix, that means complexity mix, as well as geographic mix. And it takes, as I said already today, takes a little bit of time to build up the capabilities to allow us to engage properly with those folks at the level we want to. And we have really have -- we have not held back on doing that, Kevin, and that's really the bulk of the investment during this cycle where we've really lent into building those capabilities in readiness for the next, we hope, many years of serving these individuals higher and higher capability.You know, of course, and I made a comment earlier about re-engineering our cost base. Of course there are changes going on in our cost base across the whole organization, including OptumHealth in response to the change in pricing signals from CMS. But I would put those very much, kind of, secondary to the core elements I've just described. We're in a position obviously where we know exactly what these populations are that we're now looking after. That's been very much the basis of our forward views in terms of how we're starting to lay out for ‘24, ‘25, ‘26. And we feel very confident about our ability not only to grow as an organization, but to continue to strengthen margins back into the zone that you've historically been used to. Thanks so much, Kevin, for that and next question?Operator: We’ll go next to Sarah James with Cantor Fitzgerald.Sarah James: Thank you. I wanted to circle back to your comments on the strength in commercial growth and national accounts for next year. Can you give us a little bit of color on the pricing environment, given all the comments you've made on the moving pieces and cost trends, and then help us put into context that, and the broader economy with how your clients are thinking about product selection, either in breath or the type of products that they're purchasing from you in ’24?Andrew Witty: Sarah, thanks so much for the question. Let me ask Dan Kueter, who looks after our commercial insurance business to answer that.Dan Kueter: Yes, thanks, Andrew. Hi, Sarah. Thanks for the question. The growth that John mentioned in his comments is settled business in our national accounts fee-based segment. So we're very happy with how that's completed. We're pricing and negotiating our fully insured business for January right now, and we're comfortable with how that's materializing as well. Employers continue to focus on both affordability and innovation, and our innovative products continue to resonate significantly in the market, as Dirk highlighted in his comments. Thanks, Sarah.Andrew Witty: Thanks so much, Don. Next question, please?Operator: We’ll, the next two David Windley with Jefferies.David Windley: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to pivot to OptumInsight, you had commented in previous calls about a fairly heavy level of spending to integrate change and invest in that platform. I wondered if you could update us on any ongoing spend in that regard? What we should expect in terms of implementation on pro-health and kind of trajectory of margin in OptumInsight? Thank you.Andrew Witty: Hey, David, thanks so much for the question. Let me ask Roger Connor, who's our new CEO of OptumInsight to respond, Roger?Roger Connor: Thank you, and David, thank you for the question. First of all, just to say I'm delighted to be taking over the leadership of Insight. This is a pretty unique and special business. And getting to know the people, the products, and the offerings, I think we're going to make a real difference to healthcare. So excited about that future. Just specifically, David, on your question, the change integration’s gone really well, to be honest. You'll see in the Q3 margin that we had the tail end of some of that spend to integrate, but the Q3 margin is in line with our expectations. I think it is worth understanding the longer term outlook for OptumInsight margin. We still believe that's in the region of 18% to 22%, that's really driven by the mix of the businesses.As you know, we're a business that has software, we have services, so there are different margins in there. But when you take what we've created with change and you look at the overall portfolio that we have, we have this incredible portfolio that is addressing everything from clinical decision support, we've got products for admin efficiency, we've got other products for payment optimization. You have that growth engine plus our innovation, plus that margin profile, we're very confident about the future performance of Insight.Andrew Witty: That's great. And I wonder whether Dan Schumacher, who's been very heavily involved in our various health systems partnerships, might just want to reflect a little bit on the question obviously was around pro-health, but rather than talking specifically, maybe just share a few thoughts about the overall evolution of those health system profiles and how they play out over the first couple of years.Dan Schumacher: Sure, thanks Andrew. David, appreciate the question. Certainly our health system partnerships, you mentioned one that we've announced recently, it's a growing portfolio for us. Obviously, at the health system level, there's a lot of pressures. We've talked in earlier questions about wage inflation and so forth. And we have a unique opportunity to really be able to address some of those near-term challenges, while at the same time provide some capacity for future evolution of the system as they think about more digital capacities, greater outpatient catchment, as well as further engagement. So those are some of the things that we can help unlock for them and their migration to value-based care. So we're encouraged by the portfolio. It continues to grow. Actually, from the initial scope nine out of 10 have expanded from their initial scope. So continuing to grow, we're in the early days, and we see a lot of opportunity ahead of us.Andrew Witty: Dan, appreciate it and thanks so much for the question. Next question, please.Operator: We'll go next to Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities.Ann Hynes: Hi, good morning. I would like to ask a GLP question more on the medical side. It sounds like right now price appears to be the greatest barrier for widespread adoption, assuming the outcome data continues to be positive. If pricing gets to a point that you view and your clients view as affordable. What do you think would be the long-term impact on care on the medical side? Are you seeing any near-term effects right now on MLR? I should say an MLR benefit. And do you think it would be reasonable to assume overall MLRs should decline with greater adoption of these drugs? And maybe what categories of health spend do you think or do you view would be the biggest opportunity going forward? Thanks.Andrew Witty: Ann, thanks so much for the question. I mean, I think honestly it’s just way too early for us to be able to see anything like that, just in terms of, you know, obviously the weight loss indications are only just really coming into play. We haven't really been able to see, I'd say, anything from that perspective yet. And as I said earlier, the real focus for us right now is to try and figure out a way in which we can get to a position where the affordability of this class puts it in a zone where, you know, the people who need it can get it and can afford it. Nothing more to say on that, honestly. Next question, please?Operator: We’ll go next to John Ransom with Raymond James.John Ransom: Hey, good morning. On your fully accountable lives, what's the expectation where you'll end up in the year with a number of medicare fully advantage lives? And just looking at the eliminations, is it fair to assume that a lot of those fully accountable lives are coming out of the UHC book? Thanks.Andrew Witty: So thanks very much for the question. I'll ask Dr. Amar Desai, who leads our OptumHealth Organization, just to comment a little bit on the, kind of, shape of the folks we look after there, and the degree to which they come from both UHC and obviously many of our external partners, Amar?Amar Desai: John, thanks very much for the question. We've had great growth in fully accountable membership as we mentioned earlier, adding over 900,000 patients for the year. That growth is diverse across a number of payers. We have over 100 payer partners spanning both national and regional payers. And as we think about that growth, of course, UnitedHealthcare is a core partner to us, but we continue to have the strength of our medical groups and physician networks being incredibly attractive to other payers regionally and nationally to be able to grow in their own value-based arrangements to drive outcomes and total cost of care. So we look forward to continued growth in a broad-based, diverse way. Thank you very much.Andrew Witty: Amar, thank you. And thank you for the question. Jennifer, I’d say the last question now please.Operator: Okay, we'll go last to Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.Lance Wilkes: Great. Thanks for taking the question. On Medicaid and Medicaid Redetermination, could you comment a little bit on the margin and implications of the members that are getting redetermined off? We've already seen a lot of double coverage or zero MOR on that? And then just in general, are enrollment -- disenrollment trends kind of consistent with your expectations and do you see where those members are going to as far as individual, employer, or uninsured? Thanks.Andrew Witty: Hey, Lance. Thanks so much for the question. I'm going to ask Tim Spilker, who leads our Community and State business to respond to that, Tim?Tim Spilker: Yes. Thank you, Lance, for the question. And maybe I'll start with just the enrollment trends, because I think that really informs a whole number of factors. So first off, what we're seeing, I think, consistent with what states have reported is significant disenrollment for procedural reasons. And what's more, a lot of variability, frankly, across states in terms of the pacing and re-enrollment and even states now that are suspending terminations or re-enrolling members based on guidance. So those stops and starts certainly have an impact, you know, on our membership, as well as membership mix. But frankly, that's why we continue to develop even more ways to engage members and support our states. You know, our goal really is to help individuals find coverage and so a couple points on that.Our reach rate for the programs that we've implemented exceeds that of our traditional programs, and we're seeing strong re-enrollment rates between 15% and 20% depending on the state. And so as a result, as John mentioned in his comments, we're retaining a significant majority of the members we engage with, certainly more to do. And second, in terms of your question around just kind of outlook, again, I think the factors around the re-enrollment has an impact on just how we think about mix. But I think it's also important that to consider the rate environment. You know, states are taking into account a thoughtful, taking a thoughtful and data-driven approach to rate setting. And with visibility now into around 45% of our revenue for ‘24, really appreciative of the approach that states are taking.So all in all, I would say both membership, as well as our outlook is in line with what we expected at this point with a lot of variability. I think our membership looks good in terms of the outlook that we set at the beginning of the year. And at this point, I feel all of this is manageable.Andrew Witty: Tim, thanks so much. And thank all of you for your time this morning. I hope what you heard during today's call only reinforces what you've come to expect from UnitedHealth Group, an organization that's just as nimble and agile as it is focused and disciplined, always growing, always innovating, ceaselessly committed to our mission and deeply devoted to those we share. Thank you for your attention today and we appreciate it.Operator: This does concludes today's conference. We thank you for your participation.]"

Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with ADP.As of 2023-10-16, Automatic Data Processing Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $166.85. It's currently trading at a price of $247.5. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -48.34%. The company is modestly overvalued.Beyond Market Price: Uncovering Automatic Data Processing Inc's Intrinsic ValueThe modelThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Automatic Data Processing Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.AssumptionsTermValueExplanationEPS without NRI$8.2GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.Discount Rate11%An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.69%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.Growth StageGrowth rate (g1) = 13.60% Years of Growth Stage = 10We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.Terminal StageGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.CalculationGrowth Stage=EPS without NRI*[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)*(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=93.34Terminal Stage=EPS without NRI*(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10*[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)+(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=73.51Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)=Growth Stage+Terminal Stage=166.85Discounted Free Cash Flow ModelGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $148.75. This valuation indicates that the Automatic Data Processing Inc is modestly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -66.39%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.Story continuesThe Bottom LinePlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation.  Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:Future Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.Navigating with GuruFocus:Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

The Zacks analyst believes that strong growth from artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance computing and accelerated computing is boosting its Compute &amp; Networking revenues. Large language models using GPUs based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures, rising demand for generative AI and surge in Hyperscale demand also aid its growth.Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings have driven the top-line growth.However, the company’s near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by weakening demand for chips used in the professional visualization end market.(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Procter &amp; Gamble shares have outperformed the Zacks Consumer Staples – Soap and Cleaning Materials industry over the past year (+13.6% vs. +10.2%). The Zacks analyst believes that the company is benefitting from a growth in its organic sales, driven by robust pricing and a favorable mix, along with strength across segments. Focus on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins have also helped.Rapid adoption of cloud-based solutions, continued deal wins in international markets, and acquisition of Slack have positioned the company as a market leader.Yet, supply-chain issues, higher SG&amp;A costs, higher transportation costs, geopolitical challenges, currency headwinds and rising inflation have plagued the company.

At American Airlines AAL, fuel costs accounted for roughly 29% of the company’s total operating expenses incurred in 2022.Oil price has been moving northward recently mainly due to Saudi Arabia and Russia extending voluntary supply cuts. The upward movement in oil prices is not a welcome development for AAL and is likely to hurt its bottom line.Declining Fuel Costs Aid Q2 EarningsIn second-quarter 2023, oil price declined 6.6% in the April-June period. This boosted the bottom-line performance of airlines including AAL. In the second quarter, total operating costs (on a reported basis) declined 4.1% year over year to $11,892 million.Aircraft fuel expenses and related taxes decreased to $2,723 million from $4,020 million a year ago. Average fuel price per gallon (including related taxes) declined to $2.62 from $4.03 a year ago.Picture Changes in Q3As mentioned above, oil price has been rising (up 28.5% in the July-September period) due to extension of production cut by Saudi Arabia and Russia through the end of the current year. The sharp hike in one of the primary input costs is likely to have dented AAL’s bottom-line performance in the third quarter.In September, management stated, “fuel prices have increased considerably since the company’s initial third-quarter guidance issued on Jul 20, 2023”. American Airlines now expects fuel cost per gallon (including taxes) in the $2.90-$3.00 band (the earlier guidance was in the $2.55-$2.65 range). This metric is likely to have been high in the quarter under review due to the northward movement in oil prices, thus hurting this Fort Worth, TX-based carrier’s overall quarterly results, which will be announced on Oct 19.Overall Top &amp; Bottom-Line ProjectionsDue to high fuel costs, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter bottom line is currently pegged at 26 cents per share. This indicates a 62.32% decline from third-quarter 2022 actuals. For quarterly sales, the consensus mark is pegged at $13.52 billion, suggesting a 0.42% increase from third-quarter 2022 levels.Story continuesAAL is currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Southwest Airlines now expects the fuel cost per gallon in the $2.7-$2.8 band (the earlier guidance was in the $2.55-$2.65 range).

However, the carrier guided for full-year earnings toward the low end of an earlier estimate due to an increase in fuel prices. United Airlines Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: UAL) and American Airlines Group (NASDAQ: AAL) are due to report their quarterly results this week.Third Quarter HighlightsFor the quarter that ended on September 30th, Delta made a revenue of $14.55 billion as sales rose 13% YoY but still coming a little short of the $14.56 billion expected. Trans-Atlantic travel particularly stood out among strong international travel demand but the airline did feel a pinch from the ongoing strikes in the automotive and entertainment industries.Net income rose 59% YoY $1.11 billion, or $1.72 per share while when adjusted earnings amounted to $2.03 as they excluded third-party refinery sales and other items, topping LSEG’s expectation by 8 cents.OutlookAs for the last three months of the year, Delta expects solid travel demand to continue and expand revenue from 9% to 12% YoY while guiding for per-share earnings in the range between $1.05 to $1.30, in line with estimates.With fuel prices pressures since July, Delta’s costs are in for a $400 million addition during the second half of the year. Delta now expects adjusted earnings between $6 and $6.25 per share this year, lowering its July’s forecast that was withing the range of $6 and $7 per share. Full year free cash flow estimate has also been cut from $3 billion to $2 billion.Delta Somewhat Eased ConcernsDelta CEO Ed Bastian claimed that the airline’s customers are in good financial health, easing concerns that consumers are cutting back on spending due to depletion of household savings, while also adding that the demand for overseas trips has stayed strong into autumn months, but it remains to be seen if this is the case both for United Airlines and American Airlines as last month, their ultra-low-cost peer Spirit Airlines Inc (NYSE: SAVE) cut its profit outlook for the third quarter due to intense promotional activity and steep discounting with Frontier Group Holdings (NASDAQ: ULCC) also offering very low fares in order to sell its flight tickets. Certainly, Delta raised the bar for United Airlines and American Airlines. Although Bastien acknowledged some discounting pressure, he does not categorize it as a ""material risk"" for Delta whose consumer is not the one purchasing the lower fares, just like the consumers of United Airlines and American Airlines who are 'traditional airlines'.Story continuesDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

In its place, small businesses with a minimum of five employees can apply to become members of the AAdvantage Business program. Employees taking the trips will also earn points to increase their AAdvantage member status.How the AAdvantage Business program works: Eligible business travel includes travel booked on aa.com or the American Airlines app, with the American Reservations or Meeting Services Desk. For every $1 spent, businesses earn 1 AAdvantage mile to redeem on travel. For that same $1 spent, company employees can earn 1 loyalty point that counts toward their cumulative status as an AAdvantage member.“If an employee goes to a conference – instead of the smaller business having to pay for travel – they can redeem miles for the employee’s flight, hotel, car rental, and an Admirals Club day pass too,” said an AA spokesperson. “AAdvantage Business will be a much simpler program to manage travel with, now that it’s tied to the AAdvantage program. Business Extra was on a points currency, meaning customers had to convert points to miles to redeem on flights and other rewards.”There is no minimum spending requirement in place for the program. However, AAdvantage Business is only available to businesses in the U.S. and Canada, with Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru coming soon. Business Extra had a much broader international access base, including the UK and Spain, which will have to work with AA airline partners in those regions, according to the airline.Business Extra members can continue redeeming any of the awards until December 15. The following day, Business Extra points can only be converted to AAdvantage miles or donated to charity, the airline said.The new AA small business loyalty program launches with a CitiBusiness credit card partnership. Companies can earn two miles for every $1 spent on their business card, while employees will earn an additional loyalty point to add to their AAdvantage membership points.Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.Aflac in FocusAflac (AFL) is headquartered in Columbus, and is in the Finance sector. The stock has seen a price change of 11.55% since the start of the year. Currently paying a dividend of $0.42 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 2.09%. In comparison, the Insurance - Accident and Health industry's yield is 2.65%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.71%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.68 is up 5% from last year. Over the last 5 years, Aflac has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 12.68%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Aflac's current payout ratio is 30%, meaning it paid out 30% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.AFL is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $6.02 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 12.95%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.Story continuesFor instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that AFL is not only an attractive dividend play, but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This takes the annual payment to 3.6% of the current stock price, which unfortunately is below what the industry is paying. Check out our latest analysis for Alliant Energy Alliant Energy's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageIf it is predictable over a long period, even low dividend yields can be attractive. Before making this announcement, Alliant Energy was earning enough to cover the dividend, but it wasn't generating any free cash flows. No cash flows could definitely make returning cash to shareholders difficult, or at least mean the balance sheet will come under pressure.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 29.0% over the next year. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 57% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendAlliant Energy Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $0.94 total annually to $1.81. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 6.8% a year over that time. Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period, and without any major cuts in the payment over time, we think this is an attractive combination as it provides a nice boost to shareholder returns.The Dividend's Growth Prospects Are LimitedInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. Earnings per share has been crawling upwards at 4.5% per year. The company has been growing at a pretty soft 4.5% per annum, and is paying out quite a lot of its earnings to shareholders. This could mean the dividend doesn't have the growth potential we look for going into the future.Our Thoughts On Alliant Energy's DividendOverall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think Alliant Energy will make a great income stock. With cash flows lacking, it is difficult to see how the company can sustain a dividend payment. Overall, we don't think this company has the makings of a good income stock.Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. For example, we've identified 2 warning signs for Alliant Energy (1 is a bit unpleasant!) that you should be aware of before investing.

The latest catalyst for volatile trading is the tumbling U.S. consumer sentiment. On Oct 13, the University of Michigan reported that the preliminary index for Consumer Sentiment in October came in at 63, missing the consensus estimate of 67.4. The final reading of the index for September was 68.1. October marked the third consecutive month of the index’s decline and the largest monthly decline since May.The Present Situation Index — based on consumers’ assessment of current business and labor market conditions — fell to 66.7 in October from 71.4 in September. The Expectations Index — based on consumers’ short-term outlook for income, business, and labor market conditions — declined to 60.7 in October from 66 last month. Both indexes were the lowest in five months.Expectations for the one-year inflation rate rose to 3.8% in October from 3.2% in September, marking its highest reading since May. Long-run (5 years) inflation expectations edged up from 2.8% last month to 3.0% in October.According to Joanne Hsu, the Director of the Survey, ""Assessments of personal finances declined about 15%, primarily on a substantial increase in concerns over inflation, and one-year expected business conditions plunged about 19%. However, long-run expected business conditions are little changed, suggesting that consumers believe the current worsening in economic conditions will not persist.""In a similar kind of study, on Sep 26, the Conference Board reported that the Index for U.S. Consumer Confidence in September came in at 103, missing the consensus estimate of 105.5. The metric for August was revised upward to 108.7 from 106.1 reported earlier.At this stage, investment in low-beta stocks with a high dividend yield and a favorable Zacks Rank may be the best option. If markets regain momentum, the favorable Zacks Rank of these stocks will capture the upside potential. However, if the downtrend continues, low-beta stocks will minimize portfolio losses and dividend payments will act as a regular income stream.Story continuesOur Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five large-cap (market capital &gt; $10 billion) low-beta (beta &gt;0 &lt;1) stocks with a solid dividend yield.

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One stock to keep an eye on is The Gap (GPS). GPS is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A.Another notable valuation metric for GPS is its P/B ratio of 1.84. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. GPS's current P/B looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/B of 3.45. GPS's P/B has been as high as 2.49 and as low as 1.25, with a median of 1.66, over the past year.Value investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement, so they are often considered a better performance indicator. GPS has a P/S ratio of 0.28. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.4.Finally, our model also underscores that GPS has a P/CF ratio of 6.38. This data point considers a firm's operating cash flow and is frequently used to find companies that are undervalued when considering their solid cash outlook. This company's current P/CF looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 13.40. Over the past 52 weeks, GPS's P/CF has been as high as 26.99 and as low as 5.38, with a median of 7.22.Story continuesInvestors could also keep in mind Urban Outfitters (URBN), an Retail - Apparel and Shoes stock with a Zacks Rank of # 1 (Strong Buy) and Value grade of A.Urban Outfitters is trading at a forward earnings multiple of 9.65 at the moment, with a PEG ratio of 0.41. This compares to its industry's average P/E of 13.82 and average PEG ratio of 0.83.Over the past year, URBN's P/E has been as high as 16.59, as low as 9.46, with a median of 11.51; its PEG ratio has been as high as 0.92, as low as 0.40, with a median of 1.22 during the same time period.Furthermore, Urban Outfitters holds a P/B ratio of 1.51 and its industry's price-to-book ratio is 3.45. URBN's P/B has been as high as 1.79, as low as 1.18, with a median of 1.45 over the past 12 months.These are only a few of the key metrics included in The Gap and Urban Outfitters strong Value grade, but they help show that the stocks are likely undervalued right now.

After falling in four of the last seven weeks, CSCO is down 2.8% over the last month. Last seen up 1.2% at $54.41, however, Cisco Systems stock is flashing a bullish signal that could help it recover from these recent losses.Digging deeper, Cisco Systems stock recently came within one standard deviation of its 80-day moving average. According to data from Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, comparable moves occurred six times in the past three years, with CSCO enjoying a positive one-month return 80% of the time, averaging a 6.4% rise. A similar move from its current perch would put the equity just shy of the $58 mark.CSCO Chart October 162023An unwinding of pessimism in the options pits could blow additional tailwinds for CSCO. At the International Securities Exchange (ISE), Cboe Options Exchange (CBOE), and NASDAQ OMX PHLX (PHLX), the security's 50-day put/call volume ratio stands higher than 95% of readings from the past year.

As Service Year Alliance sees it, every youth in America should have that chance, and every community deserves youth service as a resource for combating climate challenges. Since its launch in 2016, Service Year Alliance has embarked on a mission ""to make a year of paid, full-time service - a service year - a common expectation and opportunity for all young Americans"" to serve communities across the nation.Key to realizing the organization's mission is ServiceYear.org, an online platform where individuals looking for service year opportunities can connect with organizations and programs offering them. Since 2013, Cisco has provided the organization vital technical and financial support, starting with the platform. Later, when events triggered by climate change became more frequent and severe, Service Year Alliance expanded its focus to include climate-related service, which qualified it to receive additional funding from the Cisco Foundation's $100 million USD portfolio, earmarked for supporting non-profit organizations working towards a more regenerative and resilient future climate.In the following Q&amp;A, Kristen Bennett, Service Year Alliance's Chief Executive Officer, discusses its unique mission and how it's changing the landscape of service years.Q: What drew you to the national service space, and how did you become CEO?A: I graduated from college in 2008, as the recession hit. I was already considering a mission-oriented career and found a service year opportunity through AmeriCorps VISTA with the WE Connect initiative, spearheaded by First Lady of California, Maria Shriver. During my service year, I built critical community partnerships and helped to connect low-income families to programs and resources to become more financially stable. I received a modest stipend and health care benefits while other recent graduates around me competed for a few unpaid internships and hourly service-industry jobs. The experience was transformational, placing me on a career path in service that I might not have otherwise reached on my own.Story continuesI wanted to make an impact beyond my service year, so after it was over, I accepted a position as a program officer at California Volunteers, California's state service commission overseeing service and volunteerism in California. While working there, I learned the ins and outs of the service sector while building my professional network, which included Shirley Sagawa, one of AmeriCorps' founders. I eventually joined her at the National Conference on Citizenship in Washington, D.C. to lead the development of ServiceYear.org, the first technology platform dedicated to connecting the next generation of youth to service years. Over the next nine years, my role evolved into Service Year Alliance's Chief Strategy Officer, Interim Co-Chief Executive Officer, and finally Chief Executive Officer, my current position.Q: How has collaboration with Cisco and the Cisco Foundation been instrumental in advancing and expanding national service programs?A: Cisco's been with us since the beginning - first, in the early days before our organization even existed, offering $2.1M in philanthropic support through the Silicon Valley Community Foundation to launch Service Year Alliance and to create ServiceYear.org, the first technology platform to act as a marketplace matching young people and service year positions. We built the platform from scratch, and we couldn't have done it without a philanthropic partner who had both technology expertise and resources to help us get the work started.Over the years, Cisco has supported everything from our efforts to reach young people, to pandemic and public health response, and now the Climate Project. Our long partnership around helping young people become aware of, learn about, and find the right opportunity for themselves has allowed us to optimize very effectively for specific needs - like how to help young people find the right climate-related service year position.As a result, throughout 2023 our conversion rate from registering on the site to actually submitting an application increased from 23 percent to 36 percent. Climate organizations saw even bigger shifts - Grid Alternatives, which advances resiliency programming, saw a dramatic 360 percent increase in enrollments and a 165 percent rise in applications this past year, reflecting the growing interest young people have in doing climate-focused service years.Q: What does a typical service year look like?A: There is no ""typical"" service year since opportunities can vary widely. They range from delivering high-dosage literacy tutoring to bring students up to grade level, helping rural non-profit organizations develop strategies for recruiting volunteers, giving tax preparation assistance to low-income families, assisting individuals at a community health center, or installing solar panels in under-resourced neighborhoods.Q: What is the Climate Project, and how does a partnership between Service Year Alliance and the Cisco Foundation power the initiative?A: A poll led by Data for Progress, an American think tank, shows climate change is a major concern for 91 percent of youth, but two-thirds of them aren't sure how to make a tangible difference. In 2022, Service Year Alliance kicked off the Climate Project in a multi-year partnership supported by the Cisco Foundation to specifically address climate-related issues by recruiting the next generation's youth into climate-related service to assist communities in becoming more resilient to climate change and empower them with opportunities to help tackle this daunting crisis.To develop the project, we first hosted targeted conversations with national service programs, green sector employer associations, workforce development partners, and other organizations and agencies working to address problems brought on by climate change. We also formed a cohort made up of eight standout service year programs to take a deeper dive into effective strategies for leveraging service to both further address the impacts of climate change, as well as equip young people with the skills, certifications, and experience they will need to enter into green sector careers.Taking what we learned, we published a suite of three guides for partners to use as ""roadmaps"" to best leverage human capital in three distinct areas related to climate and environmental resilience: community capacity building, rural resilience, and energy efficiency. They spotlight a diverse assortment of program models throughout the U.S., offering organizations guidance for choosing the best model for developing their own programs and pathways.Q: What are your most valuable partnerships, and how do they further your mission?A: Besides Cisco, the Cisco Foundation, and AmeriCorps, as part of the Climate Project we have worked with a broad spectrum of organizations committed to solving climate issues in under-resourced communities. In January 2023, we launched The Partnership for the Civilian Climate Corps (PCCC), a non-partisan partnership of over 100 national, state, and local cross-sector organizations representing service, workforce, labor, environmental justice, conservation, and youth - all organizations aligned behind shared principles for engaging youth in climate-focused service and workforce development opportunities. The PCCC includes The Corps ­Network, American Clean Power, Jobs for the Future, Evergreen Action, and America‘s Service Commissions, among many others.Additionally, the Interstate Renewable Energy Council was an important link to additional networks such as the National Community Action Partnership, the National Association for State Community Service Programs, and the Building Performance Association. Our relationships with these organizations allow us greater access to national conversations and information essential to promoting national service as a talent pipeline to meet our nation's ambitious climate goals.Q: What are some of the benefits for corps members, including post service?A: At a basic level, service corps members receive a living stipend, health care coverage, and skills training. After completing a service year, corps members are eligible for a Segal AmeriCorps Education Award, which they can use to pay for higher education or pay off student loans. Additionally, those who participate in service year programs without a bachelor's degree are over twice as likely to go on to earn their degree compared to their peers.Following service, we support service year alums by keeping them connected to one another and informed about a variety of career pathways available to them. Among those with bachelor's degrees, 38 percent enter into service-oriented career areas - education, community and social services, and health care - compared to 13 percent of their peers. For climate-focused alums, we are committed to ensuring they are connected to green sector career opportunities and informed about their post-service options during and after their term of service.Q: What are some ways climate-related service benefits communities?A: Corps members dedicated to tackling climate hurdles in local communities have a direct and tangible impact. We selected the focus areas for our roadmaps based in part on a landscape assessment of the impacts of programs.For example, one of the programs we worked with on our Energy Efficiency roadmap, the Mile High Youth Corps' Energy &amp; Water Conservation Program, saved over 101,500 low-income families 620,799 kilowatt hours of energy across Colorado in 2021 - a total savings of $160,000 USD. We are excited to continue to work with service year programs and employer partners advancing energy efficiency to help expand programming and create additional pathways for service year alumni to enter into weatherization and clean energy careers.And in developing the Rural Resilience roadmap, we saw how AmeriCorps programs like Resource Assistance for Rural Environments (RARE) are not only demonstrating how service year corps members can infuse the additional capacity that is needed for more rural communities to participate in the growing green economy, but are also equipping these young adults to serve as the next generation of climate leaders in the communities in which they serve - with multiple corps members from the 2022/23 graduating class obtaining staff positions at the local nonprofits that hosted them during their service years. To help expand these types of results, Service Year Alliance is directly supporting several organizations as they seek to create and expand service year programming in rural communities throughout the Southeast.Finally, we can already see how our Community Capacity Building roadmap is helping to fuel the development of state-based climate corps programming. In North Carolina and elsewhere, we are very pleased to see state-based initiatives really leaning into the belonging and inclusion elements of our resources and placing equity at the center of their program development efforts. By adopting practices that not only support diverse corps members, but also bring corps member host sites and supervisors along on the journey, new opportunities are being created for underrepresented populations to become involved in climate action. 2024 is going to be a big year for expansion of state-based climate corps programming, and Service Year Alliance is ready to help those initiatives grow in a way that will create opportunity for all.Q: Can you share a story about a corps member whose life changed dramatically after a service year?A: While in her early twenties, Geri Lopez, a member of the White Earth Tribe in central Minnesota, was working to bring solar and wind power to her community when governmental funding for it dried up. However, she wanted to continue working in the renewable energy sector.That's when she applied for a service year with Ampact AmeriCorps under the Climate Impact Corps Home Energy Initiative. Geri served alongside an energy-efficiency professional to make homes in low-income communities safer and more energy efficient. She learned how to test and analyze building envelopes, and just about everything else related to home weatherization. Equally important, Geri developed new problem-solving and communication skills, which, along with her training and experience, helped her land a job as a weatherization auditor and inspector at MAHUBE-OTWA Community Action Partnership, hence enabling her to join the green economy.Because of her inspiring service year story, Geri was invited to attend the White House's Summit on Building Climate Resilient Communities, to be held on September 28, 2023.Watch this video to hear Geri speak about her service year experience at the Aspen Institute's Aspen Ideas: Climate 2023 conference in Miami Beach, Florida, on March 8, 2023 - International Women's Day.Visit ServiceYear.org to learn more about how youth can connect to climate-related service year opportunities.View original content here.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/793384/cisco-empowering-youth-to-combat-climate-change-through-service-years]"
