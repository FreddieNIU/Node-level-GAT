Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Specifically, we decided to study Unum Group's  ROE in this article.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. Check out our latest analysis for Unum Group How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Unum Group is:16% = US$1.5b ÷ US$9.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.16.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Unum Group's Earnings Growth And 16% ROEAt first glance, Unum Group seems to have a decent ROE. Especially when compared to the industry average of 10% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. This certainly adds some context to Unum Group's decent 13% net income growth seen over the past five years.Next, on comparing Unum Group's net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 11% over the last few years.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is Unum Group fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.Is Unum Group Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?In Unum Group's case, its respectable earnings growth can probably be explained by its low three-year median payout ratio of 24% (or a retention ratio of 76%), which suggests that the company is investing most of its profits to grow its business.Moreover, Unum Group is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 21% of its profits over the next three years. However, Unum Group's future ROE is expected to decline to 11% despite there being not much change anticipated in the company's payout ratio.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that Unum Group's performance has been quite good. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

Meanwhile, driving revenue growth has been deprioritized compared to 2021 when it was a top priority for finance leaders.""CFOs have positioned themselves decisively in defense mode. With the end of the low-cost capital era and inflation still uncomfortably high in some parts of the economy, finance leaders are taking control by driving efficiencies in their organizations,"" said Stephen Philipson, head of Global Markets and Specialized Finance at U.S. Bank.""As we work with CFO clients on how to position their balance sheets for a potentially more challenging economic environment, the focus is on prudent capital-allocation decisions. We talk about how to weigh cost-control efforts against focused investments that could drive future growth. As our survey results show, this balance is challenging CFOs,"" Philipson added.KEY SURVEY FINDINGS:Top risksRising interest rates, while still not a top risk, jumped from the least concerning risk last year to middle of the pack this year (23%). Similarly, regulatory changes (25%) moved up in the risk rankings this year.Finance leaders ranked talent shortage (43%), pace of technology change/digital disruption (40%) and high inflation (38%) as the top risks facing their businesses. California finance leaders said high inflation is their top business risk, much higher than finance leaders across the country.Only 33% of finance leaders are more than somewhat confident in their company’s ability to manage inflation risks; Only 6% are highly confident.Story continuesCuts vs. growthCost cutting and driving efficiencies within the finance function is the top priority (38%), compared with 30% in 2022 and a mere 23% in 2021; cost cutting and driving efficiencies across the business is the second highest priority (33%).Driving revenue growth was the fifth-highest priority (23%), up slightly from 2022 but down from the second-highest priority (35%) in 2021.56% of finance leaders currently struggle to balance cost cutting and building resiliency with investment in future growth, up from 46% in 2021.Areas for efficienciesDespite the increasing need to control costs, CFOs are not turning to layoffs, as the competition for talent remains tight. Only 19% plan to reduce headcount, compared with 40% in 2021.Instead, CFOs ranked investing in technology in order to cut costs first, followed by restructuring their workforce and outsourcing business functions and processes. Data analytics (53%), artificial intelligence (52%) and cloud computing (48%) are the top priorities for technology investments.Within the healthcare sector, about six in 10 believe AI could completely redefine how the finance function is operated. In other sectors, it was only about half of finance leaders.Increased appetite for digital payments68% of respondents intend to use instant payments (RTP® Network, FedNow Service) two years from now. The survey found that 42% currently use real-time payments, up from 38% in 2022.Respondents from consumer and retail (56%) and hospitality and leisure (54%) were more likely to say they used instant payments today than industries such as oil and gas (34%) and aerospace and defense (30%).Improved working capital (46%) resulting from faster payments processing, and improved customer and supplier experiences (43%) are the two primary drivers for adoption of instant payments.View the full 2023 CFO Insights Report.About the researchThe results of this research are based on a survey conducted by FT Longitude on behalf of U.S. Bank. The 1,420 senior finance leaders surveyed work at U.S. businesses across multiple sectors. Half of the survey participants are group, regional or divisional CFOs. The remainder are senior managers within the finance function. Every surveyed finance leader works for a business that generates at least $100 million in annual revenue, and 39% for a business that generates more than $1 billion.About U.S. BankU.S. Bancorp, with approximately 77,000 employees and $681 billion in assets as of June 30, 2023, is the parent company of U.S. Bank National Association.

2,50f8af9d-d186-34b3-a5d0-4dde72868caa,EW,2023-10-02,"With 84% ownership of the shares, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:EW) is heavily dominated by institutional owners",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/84-ownership-shares-edwards-lifesciences-110016973.html,1696244416,STORY,['EW'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Edwards Lifesciences' stock price is sensitive to their trading actionsThe top 21 shareholders own 50% of the company Insiders have sold recently Every investor in Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:EW) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 84% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Edwards Lifesciences, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Edwards Lifesciences ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Edwards Lifesciences?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Edwards Lifesciences does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Edwards Lifesciences' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Edwards Lifesciences is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.4% of shares outstanding. With 8.4% and 4.7% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and Capital Research and Management Company are the second and third largest shareholders.A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 21 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Edwards LifesciencesThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that Edwards Lifesciences Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$370m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 15% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.I always like to check for a history of revenue growth. You can too, by accessing this free chart of historic revenue and earnings in this detailed graph.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated. This may not be consistent with full year annual report figures.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

The Fed’s depiction was largely positive, though the anticipation of one more rate hike before year-end provides food for thought.It might be prudent for investors to brace for a prolonged high interest rate atmosphere, potentially lasting through 2024. This conservative stance ensures that should the Fed navigate to a “soft landing” and simultaneously mitigate inflation, the outcome would exceed expectations.Further, gravitating towards stocks that are favorably poised in the face of rising interest rates often implies a tilt towards inherently robust companies. So even if rates were to retreat, these stocks, bolstered by their inherent stability, could shield investors from drastic downturns.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsKeeping the Fed interest rate decision in perspective, here are some compelling stocks to buy.Stocks to Buy: Costco (COST)A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.Source: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.comQuite frankly, warehouse-style retailer Costco (NASDAQ:COST) makes for a relatively easy case for stocks to buy on the Fed interest rate decision. As policymakers have stated previously, while disinflationary trends may be encouraging, consumer prices remain stubbornly elevated. Therefore, households will still be looking to secure discounts, which bodes well for COST.Of course, what makes Costco stand out even more is that it’s a membership-only enterprise. As well, Costco caters to a higher income segment compared to other big-box retailers. Thus, COST should be relatively insulated from various economic pressures.To be fair, COST does come at a forward earnings premium of 36.45x, which is steep. However, with that price, you get a predictable business and a relatively robust balance sheet. Analysts peg COST as a strong buy with a $588.39 price target, implying a bit over 5% upside potential. The high-side target is $651, suggesting almost 17% growth.Story continuesAres Capital (ARCC)Ares Capital (ARCC) logo on its webpageSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comA leading specialty finance firm, Ares Capital (NASDAQ:ARCC) is a business development company (BDC). This is a type of investment vehicle that aims to facilitate capital access for small and mid-sized businesses. Enterprises that take up the services of BDCs generally are too small to receive capital from larger financial institutions.Now, with that said, Ares presents a significant risk for stocks to buy on the Fed interest rate decision. Should the central bank continue to lift rates in 2024, a soft landing might not materialize. Instead, the metaphorical airplane might scare some passengers before they finally disembark.Still, it’s also possible that if the economy still trudges forward somewhat, small businesses will have little choice but to use BDCs like Ares. Thus, speculative investors should keep ARCC on their radar. Lastly, analysts peg ARCC as a consensus moderate buy with a $20.75 average price target, implying nearly 8% upside.Stocks to Buy: Procter &amp; Gamble (PG)Procter &amp; Gamble Union Distribution Center. P&amp;G is an American Multinational Consumer Goods CompanySource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comA consumer goods giant, Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) is a classic case for stocks to buy on the Fed interest rate decision. Basically, no matter what happens in the economy, people will need to buy P&amp;G products. Therefore, the business enjoys a level of predictability that other enterprises can only dream about.To be sure, there’s no such thing as a free lunch. By targeting predictability, investors end up giving away potentiality. Still, if the Fed raises interest rates again before year’s end and if unforeseen circumstances materialize in 2024, investors will be happy to have P&amp;G in their portfolios.Looking at its financials, few would mistake it as a remarkable profile. Still, true to form, the consumer goods firm is consistently profitable, in part thanks to its robust net margin of nearly 18%. In closing, analysts peg PG as a consensus moderate buy with a $169.50 price target, implying nearly 12% upside potential.Sempra Energy (SRE)The logo for Sempra (SRE) is seen at the top of an office building.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comWhile I’ve been hammering home the idea of Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) as one of the stocks to buy, the reality is that few utilities offer as compelling an opportunity. For one thing, we must consider location, location, location. Headquartered in San Diego, California, Sempra couldn’t ask for a more economically viable and desirable market to serve.Sure, political editorials love to wax poetic about people leaving California for “freedom” and whatnot. However, the desirability of the Golden State makes SRE a strong wager for the Fed interest rate decision. Basically, no matter where monetary policy goes, people still have to pay their utility bills. With Sempra, you have the knowledge that this user base is relatively well off.As you’d expect from a utility, SRE doesn’t really enjoy sterling financials. However, the main takeaway is that it’s consistently profitable. Finally, analysts peg SRE as a moderate buy with an $82.15 target, implying over 14% growth.Stocks to Buy: Mastercard (MA)Close up of a pile of mastercard credit load debit bank cards.Source: David Cardinez / Shutterstock.comI’m not going to lie: Mastercard (NYSE:MA) is a tough idea to stomach for stocks to buy on the Fed interest rate decision. At first glance, the narrative makes plenty of sense. With economic conditions worsening, consumers may be forced to use plastic to make ends meet. Further, higher interest rates translate to greater profitability for lenders.However, you can only push this thesis so much before it becomes very questionable. Much of the viability of Mastercard will depend on whether the central bank truly engineers a soft landing. Otherwise, MA could be problematic.Then again, the underlying company enjoys relatively solid financials if you ignore its rich earnings premium. Commanding solid revenue growth and robust profit margins, Mastercard just might be able to offer an enticing idea for investors.Analysts certainly like it, rating MA a consensus strong buy. Their average price target comes in at $466.18, implying 16% upside potential.MetLife (MET)Man in suit with hands over paper cutouts of family, car and home. Represents insurance.Source: thodonal88 / Shutterstock.comOne of the largest global providers of insurance, MetLife (NYSE:MET) is a fundamentally boring enterprise. Nevertheless, if you’re looking for stocks to buy based on the Fed interest rate decision, boring is good. As with the other ideas on this list, MetLife offers a relatively predictable business. Also, the Covid-19 crisis may have sparked a cynical tailwind.Basically, we now know that anything can happen, even in the developed world. Therefore, the pandemic reinforced the idea of future planning. In addition to insurance products, MetLife specializes in annuities and employee benefit programs, with over 90 million customers in over 60 countries.To be fair, MetLife doesn’t exactly offer the best financial profile. However, prospective investors should note that MET trades at a forward multiple of 7.02x, below the sector median of 9.73x. Most conspicuously, analysts peg MET as a unanimous strong buy among 10 expert voices. The average price target lands at $78.60, implying 22% upside potential.Five Below (FIVE)storefront of a five belowSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comWhile the underlying narrative for discount retailer Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE) is compelling for easily discernible reasons, it’s also risky. Since the beginning of the year, FIVE has given up 14% of its equity value. What’s more worrying, FIVE slipped 21% just in the trailing month alone. So, what happened to these no-brainer entities for tricky economic situations?Five Below isn’t the only name in the discount retail space that’s hurting. Most notably, Dollar General (NYSE:DG) has been in free fall, losing 56% since the January opener. For the pure-play dollar store, the gross margin erosion paints an ironic picture: the discounts are hurting the discount retailer.However, in Five Below’s case, its gross margins are improving (albeit slightly) while seeing increased revenue growth. It’s in a much better financial situation, which isn’t surprising given the more appealing reputation of the brand. On a final note, analysts peg FIVE a strong buy with a $212.87 target, implying 44% upside.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

The updated euro zone September PMI data - seen as a key indicator of economic health - showed manufacturing activity remains in a broad-based downturn.It was enough to nudge the euro back into the red for the day. It, like many of the major global currencies, had fallen over 3% in the third quarter, unable to fend off irresistible U.S. dollar strength built on ongoing Federal Reserve interest rate rises.Markets in China, Hong Kong and India were closed for holidays but Tokyo's open-for-business Nikkei jumped as much as 1.7% as the yen dribbled back towards 150-per-dollar, a weakness viewed as a boon for Japan's exporters.""We have had two big risk-off months and you have a risk-on event with the (U.S. government) shutdown being postponed but the 10-year Treasury is at 4.62% and the yen is near 150 so nothing has really changed,"" said Societe Generale analyst Kit Juckes.Marginally higher oil prices and debt pressures meant benchmark European government bond yields were also edging higher again, with Germany's 10-year Bund level within striking distance of a 12-year high of 2.86% hit late last week.The eleventh-hour deal to avoid a U.S. government shutdown, struck over the weekend, lifted U.S. stock futures in Asia overnight but they skulked back to almost flat in Europe.Story continuesThe stopgap funding bill allows the government to keep operating through Nov. 17, and means key data releases including Friday's monthly payrolls report can go ahead on time.""The shutdown risks are only delayed, not eliminated,"" TD Securities strategists wrote.""A sense of reduced uncertainty is likely to drive a small relief in markets,"" but ""market volatility is likely to remain elevated as investors wait for the next catalyst, which is likely to be top-tier data.""Japanese stocks were also boosted by the Bank of Japan's quarterly Tankan survey overnight, which showed an improvement in business sentiment, although the World Bank became the latest to trim its forecast for China's economy next year.Chinese data released over the weekend also delivered mixed messages.Beijing's official PMI figures on Saturday reported the first pick-up in activity in the key manufacturing sector in six months.

Ten-year yields were up five basis points to 4.62% - just shy of last week's 16-year peak of 4.69%.Story continuesThe dollar was higher too, with the dollar/yen exchange rate probing just under the 150 level many suspect will sound intervention alarm bells at the Bank of Japan.Aggravating bond yields have buoyed U.S. crude oil prices, which remained above $91 per barrel on Monday with gains back running at more than 10% year-on-year.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries with Russia and other allies, or OPEC+, holds a Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee meeting on Wednesday, although four OPEC+ sources told Reuters it's unlikely to tweak its current oil output policy this week.Another aspect of the averted government shutdown for markets is this week's September U.S. employment report will be released after all - a mixed blessing for bonds given the traditional volatility surrounding the release and the fact ongoing labor market tightness is keeping the Fed hawkish.Consensus forecasts are for another 163,000 rise in non-farm payrolls last month, down from the 187,000 gain in August and with an expected downtick in the unemployment rate to 3.7%. It's a big labor week all round, with August job openings data due on Tuesday and private sector payroll numbers from ADP out too.On labor relations more generally, the third week of autoworkers' strikes escalated on Friday as unions expanded the action again to the ire of auto company executives.On the data slate on Monday were a series of September survey readings from the manufacturing sector.Closely-watched business survey equivalents from China out earlier showed activity deteriorated again in both manufacturing and services last month and again questioned hopes for a rapid rebound of the giant ailing economy.Chinese markets are closed for most of the week for a holiday.European manufacturing readouts for last month were similarly downbeat, though the situation was better in France, Italy and Spain than in the region's biggest economy, Germany.Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Monday:* US Sept manufacturing surveys by ISM and S&amp;P Global. US Aug construction spending* Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell participates in roundtable with workers, small business owners in York; Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester and New York Fed chief John Williams all speak* U.S. Treasury auctions 3 and 6-month bills(Editing by Nick Macfie)]"

The Federal Reserve has held the target range for interest rates between 5.25%-5.50%. It also signaled that Americans should expect an additional rate hike this year. Meanwhile, the Fed has also signaled that 2024 rates are going to be kept higher for longer. For investors, one of the more useful assertions is that growth stocks are becoming more attractive. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsRising interest rates tend to de-incentivize growth firms because they require borrowing to fund growth-seeking behavior. Rates are potentially as high as they will go. Thus, it’s reasonable to expect that growth firms will improve. Arcos Dorados (ARCO) A McDonald's (MCD) burger box and fries rest on a flat surface.Source: 8th.creator / Shutterstock.comArcos Dorados (NYSE:ARCO) is a holding company that franchises McDonald’s restaurants throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. The stock is similar to MCD shares in many ways. Both derive their strength McDonald’s franchises while paying dividends at similar levels. However, Arcos Dorados is growing much faster than its American counterpart. Arcos Dorados’ system-wide comparable sales grew at 31.5% in Q2 whereas McDonald’s reached 11.7%. It wouldn’t be fair to list MCD among growth stocks, but the moniker very much fits Arcos Dorados’ case. System-wide comparable sales includes both franchised and company-operated restaurants. Total revenues increased by 17.2% during the second quarter which suggests that Arcos Dorados franchisees are doing particularly well. Arcos Dorados is doing especially well in regard to overall operations. Its EBITDA increased by 0.3% to 10.6% in Q2. That led to a doubling of income for the firm. Meanwhile, the company expects that all the openings it scheduled earlier in the year will come on line suggesting that no unexpected shocks will present themselves. Planet Fitness (PLNT)A Planet Fitness (PLNT) exterior in Roseville, Minnesota.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comIn the world of gyms, Planet Fitness (NYSE:PLNT) doesn’t have the greatest reputation. Story continuesHard core athletes don’t go there because it lacks the equipment they demand. However, for the average gym-goer seeking inexpensive memberships as low as $10 per month, it makes sense. I think that offering is only going to become more appealing over the next year. Let’s face it, the economy is caught in an uneasy status quo: Interest rates and inflation are going to remain elevated and there’s no realistic chance of that changing drastically without something breaking. That implies that consumers will continue to seek value overall which will spur Planet Fitness on. The firm grew by nearly 9% in the second quarter and expects 12% expansion in 2023 overall. It’s a strong but not an exceptional number. However, where Planet Fitness shines is its EPS should grow by 34% this year. The company has enacted repurchases that will benefit investors who hold PLNT shares throughout. It is one of the growth stocks to buy while you can. Nvidia (NVDA) Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of nvidia corporation on computer keyboard. NVDA stock.Source: ShutterstockInvesting in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) at this point is straightforward. The markets are undertaking something of a tech selloff at the moment that is affecting Nvidia negatively. Rates are expected to stay higher for longer and that implies that the tech sector, led by Nvidia and its AI prowess, will be beset by continued turbulence. I don’t buy it. There’s very little chance that Nvidia slips back much further from here. It’s already trading below the low target price on Wall Street and remains more than $200 below the average target price. If you buy now there’s a strong chance that it increases by 45% or more in the next year and a half. The market is upset that rates will remain at current rates. That’s fine and understandable. However, Nvidia has done nothing wrong. Q2 revenues of $13.5 billion were better than anyone could have reasonably expected. Further, the company continues to have a stranglehold on AI chips. AI isn’t going anywhere. Sure, the company is facing competition, but there are no clear signs that any other chip makers can erode its dominance soon. This is one of those growth stocks you can depend on. Tesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) on phone screen stock image.Source: sdx15 / Shutterstock.comTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has had an incredible run in 2023 as one of the most important stocks overall. However, it too, is suffering as the markets digest the latest news regarding rate hikes. That said, positions established now will not lose value if held for the next year. The firm’s growth trajectory suggests it will grow by 22.45% this year and by 23.9% in 2024. It’s going to be difficult for bearish investors to gain much traction because of that simple fact. Combine that with the idea that rates could decline in 2024 and Tesla’s prospects only improve. Further, also consider that Tesla is pushing hard to sell more of its vehicles by lowering prices in order to gain market share. It has competition but those manufacturers are much younger and more inexperienced. Thus, build quality is likely to be lower giving Tesla an advantage. Tesla also has an emerging opportunity to boost relations with Saudi Arabia and may bring a factory to the nation in the future. That could be a huge boon to the manufacturer given how eager Saudi Arabia is to diversify its revenue streams overall. Beyond that, it’s a clear winner in the ongoing UAW strikes affecting the Big Three automakers in Detroit. Among EV growth stocks, it’s hard to do better. Salesforce (CRM) lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco. Salesforce layoffsSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comSalesforce (NYSE:CRM) stock is probably going to move a bit lower on the rate hike news. That is your opportunity to buy shares because it won’t stay down for very long. Overall, investors are upset that the economy isn’t improving as rapidly as they hoped. They’re angry that inflation is proving very stubborn. And that truth is doing what it always does to tech firms. However, Salesforce is a behemoth in the customer relationship management space and its recent performance was strong. Thus, its scale and results means that CRM shares will head up from here. The company controls roughly 30% of its market. Its competition is a fractured group of much smaller firms which speaks to the idea that Salesforce isn’t likely to cede much ground. More importantly, Salesforce is performing well as earnings and revenues for Q2 and expectations for Q3 came in better than expected. Management points to AI as one of the primary reasons to anticipate its continued strength. I don’t see why not. It has the resources to invest and that leads me to believe that AI can propel it to a greater market share in CRM overall. MercadoLibre (MELI) MercadoLibre (MELI) homepage on a smartphoneSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comMercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) stock sits at the confluence of several megatrends and shouldn’t be overlooked by investors. The Ecommerce giant serving Latin America benefits from growth forecasts in that sector and from growth expectations in fintech, where it is also rapidly improving. Let’s start with the fintech argument. The overall numbers are very clear: The fintech market should grow at 20% annually through 2030. Meanwhile, the Ecommerce market may grow at rates in the lower double digits. Add in the emergence of Latin America and it all suggests that MercadoLibre is in a great position. Revenues grew by more than 57% during the second quarter. As impressive as that figure is, it’s MercadoLibre’s payments progress that is really worth considering. Total payment volume nearly doubled during the same period reaching $42.2 billion. The company is a huge player in the payments space. It is connecting a region that has traditionally remained underserved. That is setting it up for strong continued growth overall. Wingstop (WING)Source: ShutterstockThere are currently more than 2,000 Wingstop (NASDAQ:WING) locations globally, 1,750 of which are in the U.S. The growth of its locations has been rapid which is an indication of the stock’s overall strength. One of the strongest pieces of evidence in favor of that is store growth this year. Domestic same store sales growth increased by 16.8% in Q2 ‘23. It fell by 3.3% a year earlier. The economy weakened between Q2 ‘21 and Q2 ‘22 as the effects of quantitative easing became clear. Rate hikes began in March of 2022 which halted growth across the economy. Rates have been more stable and predictable over the last year and that clarity has resulted in growth at Wingstop. Revenue and income figures are well above 20% and the franchise is catching on in a way that isn’t dissimilar to what Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) did in the recent past. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

There has been great enthusiasm around the potential of SMRs, which could be built faster and at a much lower cost than a traditional nuclear reactor. This month, Microsoft posted a job opportunity for a “Principal Program Manager Nuclear Technology,” suggesting its interest in using SMRs in the future, to support its energy-intensive operations. As companies begin to use a vast range of digital technologies in their day-to-day operations, their energy consumption could increase substantially, making the use of low-carbon nuclear power increasingly attractive.SMRs are advanced nuclear reactors that have a power capacity of up to 300 MW(e) per unit, equivalent to around one-third the generating capacity of a traditional nuclear reactor. SMRs are much smaller than traditional reactors and are modular, making it simpler for them to be assembled in factories and transported to site. Because of their smaller size, it is possible to install an SMR on sites that are not suitable for bigger reactors. They are also significantly cheaper and faster to build than conventional nuclear reactors and can be constructed incrementally to meet the growing energy demand of a site.There are strong safety margins included in SMR production, meaning that the potential for the unsafe release of radioactivity to the environment is significantly reduced. These systems can be shut down automatically, without human assistance, in the case of a malfunction. At present, there are over 80 commercial SMR designs under development worldwide, aimed at responding to a range of needs. Although companies are still trepidatious about investing in SMRs as their economic competitiveness in use has yet to be proven. As energy companies begin to roll out SMRs within the next decade there will be a greater understanding of their applicability and the costs involved.Story continuesDespite still being in the development stage, Microsoft appears to be one of the first companies to demonstrate its interest in SMRs. As companies continue to digitalise operations and conduct high-energy operations, they will need an increasing amount of energy to power their activities. For example, AI researchers suggest that training a “single large language deep learning model” such as OpenAI’s GPT-4 creates around 300 tonnes of CO2. The average person is responsible for creating around 5 tonnes of CO2 a year, showing just how significant this is.Microsoft now appears to be drawing up a roadmap for the use of SMR to power its computation needs. This month, the company posted a job description to hire a nuclear technology expert to lead the company’s technical assessment for integrating small modular nuclear reactors and microreactors “to power the datacentres that the Microsoft Cloud and AI reside on.” The post reads that Microsoft is seeking a “principal program manager for nuclear technology”, who “will be responsible for maturing and implementing a global Small Modular Reactor (SMR) and microreactor energy strategy.”This is not the first time the tech giant has shown interest in nuclear power. In May, Microsoft signed a power purchase agreement with Helion, a nuclear fusion start-up, to purchase electricity from it starting in 2028. And Bill Gates, Microsoft’s co-founder, is the chairman of the board of Terrapower, a company that is currently developing SMR technology. Although there has been no suggestion that Terrapower will provide Microsoft with any nuclear reactors.Microsoft is showing an early interest in integrating nuclear power into operations. But, as more companies are using energy-intensive technologies, they will require vast amounts of energy to power their activities. Meanwhile, governments worldwide are putting increasing pressure on companies to decarbonise operations, with some introducing carbon taxes and others encouraging the use of clean energy sources through financial incentives. Renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, can take years to develop, and acquiring a stable clean energy source also means investment in battery technology. However, as the use of SMRs becomes more commonplace, their fast manufacturing time and small land footprint will likely appeal to companies looking for alternative clean energy sources.Despite the optimism around SMR technology, a commercial rollout is likely still a long way off due to recent difficulties in acquiring the materials needed to develop these reactors. Many SMRs under production at present will run on uranium at enrichments as high as 15 to 19.75 percent, known as high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU). However, this is currently only commercially available from Russia, with which many governments and private companies have cut ties following the Russian invasion of Ukraine last year. Chris Levesque, the CEO of TerraPower, explained “It has become clear that domestic and allied HALEU manufacturing options will not reach commercial capacity in time to meet the proposed 2028 in-service date for the Natrium demonstration plant.”There has been a rise in the popularity of SMR technology, thanks to its small size and relatively low-cost and fast manufacturing potential. While the commercial rollout of SMRs is still far off, it could provide the vast amounts of low-carbon energy required to meet the world’s growing electricity needs. And tech companies, such as Microsoft, will likely be some of the first to invest in SMR technology as they look to meet their rising computation needs while striving to decarbonise operations.By Felicity Bradstock for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:India's Advantage In The Global Energy SqueezeBreakthrough Research Revolutionizes Hydrogen GenerationBRICS Nations Surge Ahead In Nuclear Energy CommitmentRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

These failings continued even after the firm had received clear warnings on the need to improve its systems,"" Therese Chambers, FCA joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight, said in a statement.ADM, whose services covering energy, base metals, foreign exchange and cocoa facilitate over 180 million derivatives contracts a year, said it recognised that its systems to mitigate risks fell short of expected standards between September 2014 and October 2016, though no actual harm was identified.""ADMISI is pleased that the issue has been resolved and is confident in the actions put in place to meet all regulatory requirements,"" the company said in a statement.The FCA said ADM did not dispute the FCA's findings, which meant it qualified for 30% discount on the fine, reducing it from 9.2 million pounds.($1 = 0.8207 pounds) (Reporting by Huw Jones; Editing by Louise Heavens, Mark Potter and Emelia Sithole-Matarise)]"

GEF and Karat Packaging KRT.Industry: PackagingLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2157611/4-packaging-stocks-poised-to-counter-industry-challengesThe Zacks Containers -  Paper and Packaging industry has been facing weak demand due to lower consumer spending amid an inflationary backdrop and high interest rates. Nevertheless, the industry will get support from rising e-commerce activities, and solid demand for sustainable and eco-friendly packaging options due to increasing environmental concerns. Pricing actions implemented by the industry players will help offset the impacts of the ongoing supply-chain disruptions and elevated costs.Despite the odds, Packaging Corporation of America, AptarGroup, Greif, Inc. and Karat Packaging are set to gain from these trends.About the IndustryThe Zacks Containers - Paper and Packaging industry comprises companies that manufacture paper and plastic packaging products. The packaging solutions provided by the industry help protect and preserve products, extend the shelf life, and cut down on wastage and loss across the wide and lengthy range of distribution channels. The products range from containerboard and corrugated packaging to flexible and rigid plastic packaging.Some companies manufacture dispensing pumps, closures, aerosol valves and applicators for the beauty, personal, home care and healthcare markets. The industry serves a wide array of markets, including food, beverage, food services and other consumer products, such as beauty, personal care and home care. They also cater to the chemical, agribusiness, medical, pharmaceutical, electronics and industrial markets, to name a few.What's Shaping the Future of the Containers - Paper and Packaging IndustryHigh Costs &amp; Supply-Chain Woes Remain Challenging: Industry participants continue encountering supply-chain disruptions and higher raw material costs from factors like general inflationary pressure, limited availability of certain raw materials and global transportation disruptions. Higher labor, transportation and chemical costs aggravated their woes. The shortage of labor impacted production levels and impaired their ability to meet high demand.Story continuesThe companies have been implementing cost-reduction actions for a while, which are likely to sustain margins. Industry players focus on streamlining their operations and realigning with high-growth key markets to bolster their performances. Some companies recently witnessed declines in volumes due to lower consumer spending on goods, given the inflationary scenario. However, this is a temporary setback as volumes will eventually pick up as these pressures subside. Also, supply-chain issues are gradually showing signs of easing.E-commerce Acts as a Key Catalyst: With rising e-commerce activities over the past few years and the pandemic accelerating it further, the importance of packaging has increased manifold as it maintains the integrity and durability of a product. Packaging also helps withstand the complex product delivery process. Per Statista, revenues in the eCommerce market are projected to reach $3.64 trillion in 2023. Revenues are expected to grow, seeing a CAGR of 11.2% to $5.56 trillion by 2027.In 2021, e-commerce accounted for nearly 19% of global retail sales. By 2026, online sales is anticipated to be 25% of the total global retail sales. This, in turn, will fuel the Containers - Paper and Packaging industry. The industry has significant exposure (more than 60%) to consumer-oriented end markets, such as food and beverages and healthcare, keeping the demand for packaging applications fairly stable across economic cycles.Demand for Eco-Friendly Packaging to Aid Industry: The preference for environmentally friendly biodegradable packaging materials is witnessing a steady rise globally, courtesy of customers’ increasing awareness of environmental issues. The industry is constantly striving to meet the same by adopting the latest technology and bringing innovative products. Industry players have begun incorporating recycled content into production methods. By maximizing recycling, the industry can implement environmentally and economically sustainable production methods.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks Containers - Paper and Packaging industry is a 10-stock group within the broader Zacks Industrial Products sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #187, which places it at the bottom 24% of the 251 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates weak prospects in the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group's earnings growth potential. Year to date, the industry's earnings estimates for 2023 have moved down 7%, and the same for 2024 has declined 10%.Despite the dim near-term prospects of the industry, we will present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio. But it is worth taking a look at the industry’s shareholder returns and current valuation first.Industry Versus Broader MarketThe Containers - Paper and Packaging industry has underperformed the S&amp;P 500 and the sector over the past year. The industry has gained 8.2% compared with the S&amp;P 500’s growth of 20.3%. The Industrial Products sector has meanwhile gained 25.7%.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio, a commonly used multiple for valuing Containers - Paper and Packaging companies, we see that the industry is currently trading at 17.26X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 10.79X and the Industrial Products sector’s forward 12-month EV/EBITDA of 13.68X.Over the last five years, the industry traded as high as 30.07X and as low as 10.95X, the median being 18.38X.4 Containers - Paper and Packaging Stocks to Keep an Eye OnKarat Packaging: The company will gain from its efforts to increase its market share, and robust demand for its eco-friendly products and other offerings. With growing pressure on countries across the globe to implement regulations to ban Styrofoam and single-use plastic, the company is poised to capitalize on increased demand for compostable products. KRT is implementing initiatives to significantly boost online sales. It is also expanding its distribution network. Shift to higher-margin products, such as environmentally friendly products, will boost its margins. The growing preference for food delivery, take-out and at-home dining is another key catalyst. The company’s shares have gained 37% in a year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Karat Packaging’s 2023 earnings suggests growth of 40.8% from last year’s reported figure. The estimate has moved up 28% over the past 30 days. KRT has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 48.8%, on average. The Chino, CA-based company has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.AptarGroup: The company’s Beauty segment will continue to gain from increased demand for beauty and personal care markets. The Pharma segment is witnessing steady demand growth for prescription and consumer healthcare. Given the ongoing sales momentum in elastomer components and active material solutions, AptarGroup is expanding its capacity to produce elastomer components for injected medicines and active material science solutions, which will drive near-term growth.The company has embarked on a business transformation plan that will drive top-line growth, boost operational excellence, enhance its approach to innovation and improve organizational effectiveness. Backed by its efforts to bring products into the market, the company remains the preferred choice for renowned brands worldwide. Focus on acquisitions to expand the scope of technologies, geographic presence and product offerings will also aid growth.

The figure indicates year-over-year growth of 20.1%. This Crystal Lake, IL-based company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 8.6%, on average. The stock estimated a long-term growth rate of 7% and has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.Packaging Corp: The company’s packaging business, which accounts for around 91% of its revenues, is poised to gain from strong demand in e-commerce and stable demand for the packaging of meat, fruit and vegetables, processed food, beverages, and medicines. The conversion of the No. 3 paper machine at its Jackson, AL-based mill to linerboard in a phased manner over the next three years will help it meet the strong packaging demand. The company maintains a balanced approach toward capital allocation to boost growth and maximize returns for shareholders. PKG shares have gained 37% in a year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Packaging Corp’s ongoing year’s earnings has been revised upward by 1.5% in the past 60 days. PKG has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 5.1%, on average. The Lake Forest, IL-based company has an estimated long-term earnings growth rate of 5%. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Greif: The company recently acquired a 51% ownership interest in ColePak, a manufacturer of bulk and specialty partitions made from containerboard and uncoated recycled board serving a broad range of applications in food, beverage and other markets. This provides a unique and margin-accretive converting capability to Greif’s Paper Packaging &amp; Services segment. It also offers incremental integration benefits to its containerboard and uncoated recycled board mills.The company will continue to deploy capital toward value-accretive targets in the coming quarters. Greif has been implementing cost rationalization measures within its system, which have been aiding its earnings performance. GEF shares have gained 14% in the past year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Greif’s 2023 earnings has been revised 1% upward over the past 60 days. Greif has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 6%, on average.

31,d03a1264-4b58-3d4d-bde7-b26099b52bed,APTV,2023-10-02,UAW Unrest: 3 Auto Stocks to Avoid as the Labor Strike Drags On,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/uaw-unrest-3-auto-stocks-110037450.html,1695726037,STORY,"['GM', 'MS', 'F', 'STLAM.MI', 'APTV']","[The United Auto Workers (UAW) strike is expanding in a move that will surely hurt the U.S. economy and auto stocks as a whole. Investment bank Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) recently estimated that a full month of lost automotive production would cost General Motors (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) and Stellantis (NYSE:STLA) combined $7 billion to $8 billion in lost profits. A protracted work stoppage at the automakers will also impact the U.S. economy. Anderson Economic Group, for example, estimates that a UAW strike will cost the U.S. economy about $5 billion every 10 days. That hit to the economy includes reduced consumer spending and a loss of tax revenue across all levels of government.Clearly, the strike by the UAW, which has more than 150,000 members, is a bad outcome. However, with the union demanding pay raises of 40% and to reinstate traditional pension plans for all unionized workers, it looks like the strike could continue for some time yet. Here is a look at three auto stocks to avoid as the labor strike drags on.General Motors (GM)Cadillac car and SUV dealership. Cadillac offers a full line of gas and electric EV vehicles. GM stockSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comGeneral Motors is arguably the most vulnerable of the auto stocks because of the UAW strike. Not only is the union now targeting 18 of the company’s manufacturing plants and parts distribution centers across 13 states, but the UAW has also rejected GM’s contract offers, calling a proposed 16% pay increase “insulting.” This sets the stage for what could be a protracted work stoppage at General Motors, including a general strike where all production at the automaker is shut down.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFor GM, the strike actions by the UAW come at a particularly sensitive time for the company. General Motors is already behind in its stated goal to produce one million electric vehicles in North America by 2025. Analysts peg the actual number at more likely to be 600,000 EVs annually. Plus, the company is increasing its cost cutting measures as it plows $35 billion into its electric vehicle development. GM recently announced its plans to eliminate $3 billion in expenditures, up from $2 billion of cuts previously announced.Story continuesA prolonged work stoppage at General Motors could have disastrous consequences, both in the short and long-term. GM stock is down 5.65% over the last 12 months, and down 1.81% over five years, making it a prime example of auto stocks to avoid.Stellantis (STLA)A flag with the logo for Stellantis waves outside a building with the logos for some of its car brands, including Abarth, Lancia, Fiat, Alfa Romeo and Jeep.Source: Antonello Marangi / Shutterstock.comStellantis and its stock were doing well before the current strike by the UAW. Over the last 12 months, STLA stock has increased 57.19%, far outpacing the auto stocks of GM and Ford. The stock’s appreciation has been due to the parent, Fiat Chrysler’s, ability to ramp up international sales outside of North America, particularly in Europe where it has bestselling nameplates such as Fiat and Peugeot. Stellantis has also expanded its production to more low-cost manufacturing centers outside of North America, recently announcing a new plant in Rio de Janeiro.However, much of the progress that’s been made could be thrown for a loop if the UAW strike expands further or drags on. After all, the UAW is now targeting more Stellantis locations than either GM or Ford. Striking auto workers are now off the job at 20 Stellantis facilities in 14 states. The most recent contract offer from Stellantis includes a 21% wage increase that would see current hourly workers earning as much as $96,000 a year by the end of the new contract in four years time. But the UAW continues to balk at the company’s offers.STLA stock has risen 11% over the last five years.Aptiv (APTV)An Aptiv (APTV) office building in Poland.Source: shutterstock.comBeyond the automakers, it is the vehicle parts manufacturers and suppliers that are likely to be most impacted by the current UAW strike. Chief among them is Aptiv (NYSE:APTV), a parts manufacturer that was spun out of General Motors in 1994 and today has annual revenues of nearly $18 billion. The company makes critically important automotive components related to voltage, data connectivity and various safety features. Aptiv lost an estimated $200 million in sales during a 40-day strike at GM back in 2019.APTV stock is up 5% so far in 2023 and has gained 17% through five years. As with the automakers, the UAW strike comes at a sensitive time for Aptiv, which has seen declining sales in recent years. The company has projected annual revenue for this year of $19.70 billion, which would be a year-over-year increase of 2.26%. However, that forecast could be in jeopardy if the UAW’s job action carries on for a prolonged period. There are also reports that institutional investors have been offloading APTV stock since the autoworkers’ strike began.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Joel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

Where a forward-looking statement expresses or implies an expectation or belief as to future events or results, such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis. However, such statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from future results expressed, projected or implied by the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements often address our expected future business and financial performance and financial condition; and often contain words such as ""anticipate,"" ""intend,"" ""plan,"" ""will,"" ""would,"" ""estimate,"" ""expect,"" ""pending,"" ""proposed"" or ""potential."" Forward-looking statements may include, without limitation, statements relating to (i) the pending transaction to acquire the share capital of Newcrest, timing and closing of the pending transaction, including receipt of required approvals and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions; (ii) estimates of expected synergies; (iii) estimates of expected incremental cash flow generation and portfolio optimization opportunities; and (iv) other expectations regarding the combined business.Estimates or expectations of future events or results are based upon certain assumptions, which may prove to be incorrect. Risks relating to forward looking statements in regard to the combined business and future performance may include, but are not limited to, gold and other metals price volatility, currency fluctuations, operational risks, increased production costs and variances in ore grade or recovery rates from those assumed in mining plans, political risk, community relations, conflict resolution, governmental regulation and judicial outcomes and other risks. In addition, material risks that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements include: the inherent uncertainty associated with financial or other projections; the prompt and effective integration of Newmont’s and Newcrest’s businesses and the ability to achieve the anticipated synergies and value-creation contemplated by the pending transaction; the risk associated with Newmont’s and Newcrest’s ability to obtain the approval of the pending transaction by their shareholders required to consummate the pending transaction and the timing of the closing of the pending transaction, including the risk that the conditions to the pending transaction are not satisfied on a timely basis or at all and the failure of the pending transaction to close for any other reason; the risk that a consent or authorization that may be required for the pending transaction is not obtained or is obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated; the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against the parties and others related to the Scheme Implementation Deed; unanticipated difficulties or expenditures relating to the pending transaction, the response of business partners and retention as a result of the announcement and pendency of the transaction; risks relating to the value of the scheme consideration to be issued in connection with the pending transaction; the anticipated size of the markets and continued demand for Newmont’s and Newcrest’s resources and the impact of competitive responses to the announcement of the transaction; and the diversion of management time on pending transaction-related issues.

The Federal Reserve’s steely determination to rein in inflation might intuitively spell trouble for precious metals. Yet, beneath the surface, multiple factors suggest that the glitter of gold could shine brightly in the near future.The growing unease and uncertainty in the global markets have reinvigorated the ‘fear trade.’ Investors, wary of market volatility, are turning back to the time-tested reliability of gold. Its intrinsic value and history as a hedge against inflation and economic downturns make it an attractive proposition, especially when financial waters get choppy.Compounding this shift in sentiment is a noticeable rotation away from high-risk assets, such as cryptocurrencies. As the glitz and glamour of digital gold wane, the allure of tangible gold appears to be on the rise. For those looking to recalibrate their portfolios in these unpredictable times, these specific gold mining stocks may offer a lucrative blend of stability and potential upside.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsNewmont (NEM)Newmont logo on a mobile phone screenSource: Piotr Swat/ShutterstockHeadquartered in Denver, Colorado, Newmont (NYSE:NEM) is a powerhouse among gold mining stocks. Per its public profile, Newmont is the world’s largest precious metals mining corporation. Along with the yellow metal, the stalwart mines copper, silver, zinc, and lead. As of this writing, the company carries a market capitalization of $32.38 billion, offering relative stability.To be sure, stability by itself doesn’t guarantee upside. Since the beginning of this year, NEM fell almost 18%. However, in the trailing one-year period, NEM is down a bit more than 1%, which may egg on the contrarian bulls.For full disclosure, NEM options expiring in January of next year incur an overwhelmingly bearish tilt. Thus, anything could happen. Still, with so much negative intent, a spark of contrarianism could make Newmont truly fly. What’s important here is that analysts see an upside for NEM, pegging it a moderate buy. Also, the average price target of $52.81 implies nearly 30% growth potential.Story continuesWheaton Precious Metals (WPM)Wheaton Precious Metals logo close-up on website page. WPM stock.Source: Postmodern Studio / ShutterstockAn incredibly popular idea among gold mining stocks, Wheaton Precious Metals (NYSE:WPM) deserves a bit of clarification. Before you fire off a letter to the editor, I don’t literally mean that Wheaton is a mining enterprise. Rather, it’s a precious metals streaming company, providing upfront financing to miners in exchange for the right to purchase future metals production at a predetermined price.Under such an arrangement, Wheaton offers a greater degree of predictability that you simply don’t find among many pure-play gold mining stocks. However, if I’m being perfectly honest with you, no one’s searching for gold streaming stocks; hence the usage of the slightly inaccurate SEO term.Now, what isn’t inaccurate is that according to Fintel, the three most recent options flow transactions were for bought calls that expire next June at various strike prices. Because these were big block trades – resulting in the payment of significant premiums – it’s likely that they stemmed from institutional investors.Analysts also appreciate WPM, pegging it a moderate buy with a $58.89 target, implying 36% upside.Sibanye Stillwater (SBSW)Person holding smartphone with logo of South African mining company Sibanye Stillwater Limited on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comA multinational mining and metals processing firm, Sibanye Stillwater (NYSE:SBSW) is easily the riskiest idea here among gold mining stocks. One of the key reasons of course centers on its volatility. Since the start of the year, SBSW fell 40%. And in the trailing one-year period, it split the difference. But it’s still a heavy dose of red ink at over 20% down.If that wasn’t bad enough, Sibanye also suffers from labor disputes, which can obviously stymie operations. At the same time, the company is based in resource-rich South Africa. As certain countries become politically unpalatable, South Africa could rise and take center stage. If so, that might bode well for SBSW stock.Interestingly, although options flow data shows a contested environment among big block traders, the overall sentiment appears net bullish. Specifically. A trader paid a premium of $210,105 to buy Jan. 17, 2025 7.50 calls, which may reflect burgeoning optimism. Lastly, analysts peg SBSW as a moderate buy with a $9.71 price target, implying over 49% upside.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

It estimated Brazil's 2024/25 (April-March) sugarcane crop at 629 million tons, and sugar production at 41.1 million tons. (Reporting by Marcelo Teixeira; editing by Grant McCool)]"

This may put these commodities in an area of value for traders. Meanwhile, traders might also want to opt for sugar if they're looking for current commodities strength.Russia's occupation of the Black Sea is no longer pushing prices upward as agricultural commodity prices have been trending lower for most of the year. Keeping them afloat has been harsh weather conditions from El Nino climate patterns, which has been creating droughts in certain parts of the globe.""Competitive Black Sea supplies weighed on prices, though concern over dry weather in Australia and Argentina limited losses,"" said U.K.'s Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board analysts, mentioning that a strong U.S. dollar also was a factor for corn and soybean prices.For plays on corn, traders can consider the Teucrium Corn Fund (CORN). The fund tracks three futures contracts for corn traded on the Chicago Board of Trade. It includes 35% second to expire contracts, 30% third to expire contracts, and 35% December following the third to expire. The various contract exposures help the fund limit the negative effects of rolling contracts, especially during a market in contango.For traders looking for opportunities in soybeans, consider the Teucrium Soybean Fund (SOYB). It can essentially provide similar exposure to what investors could obtain by trading in soybean futures contracts themselves. This offers short-term traders or longer-term buy-and-hold investors easy ingress regarding soybean price exposure.Corn, Soybean Prices Lower, But Sugar Likely to Stay HighCommodities traders looking for bullish plays may want to continue sticking with sugar. Supply and demand forces should result in higher prices, which is likely to stay elevated as the world's top sugar producer, India, will lower its output.Story continuesAdditionally, with Halloween just around the corner, consumer demand for candy should also provide an additional catalyst for higher sugar prices. According to a Reuters report, French trading group Sucden forecasted that sugar could trade between 22 and 30 cents per pound in in the next year.""Prices are probably going to stay strong,"" said Jeremy Austin, general director of Sucden Brazil.ETF investors looking to add sugar to their portfolios may want to look at the Teucrium Sugar ETF (CANE). It is the only sugar ETF option available on the market. The fund seeks to have the daily changes in the NAV of the fund’s shares reflect the daily changes in the market for future delivery.CANE uses a weighted average of the closing settlement prices for three futures contracts for No. 11 Sugar. All three of these trade on the ICE Futures US. The fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing under normal market conditions in Benchmark Component Futures Contracts.For more news, information, and analysis, visit the Commodities Channel.POPULAR ARTICLES AND RESOURCES FROM ETFTRENDS.COMSPY ETF QuoteVOO ETF QuoteQQQ ETF QuoteVTI ETF QuoteJNUG ETF QuoteTop 34 Gold ETFs Top 34 Oil ETFs Top 57 Financials ETFs BlackRock Lists Active Equity Premium Income ETFCapital Group Lists 5 New Active ETFsCapital Group Provides Advisors Ability to Manage Risk ToleranceDimensional Launches Ultrashort Fixed Income and World Equity ETFsChart of the Week: Making Tactical Moves With ETFsREAD MORE AT ETFTRENDS.COM &gt;]"

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for General Dynamics Step By Step Through The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.11bUS$4.35bUS$4.53bUS$4.88bUS$5.10bUS$5.30bUS$5.47bUS$5.64bUS$5.79bUS$5.94bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x11Analyst x9Analyst x4Analyst x2Est @ 4.55%Est @ 3.83%Est @ 3.33%Est @ 2.97%Est @ 2.73%Est @ 2.55% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.5% US$3.9kUS$3.8kUS$3.7kUS$3.8kUS$3.7kUS$3.6kUS$3.5kUS$3.4kUS$3.3kUS$3.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$36bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$5.9b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.5%– 2.2%) = US$140bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$140b÷ ( 1 + 6.5%)10= US$74bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$110b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$221, the company appears quite good value at a 45% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at General Dynamics as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.868. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for General DynamicsStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Aerospace &amp; Defense market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

The updated euro zone September PMI data - seen as a key indicator of economic health - showed manufacturing activity remains in a broad-based downturn.It was enough to nudge the euro back into the red for the day. It, like many of the major global currencies, had fallen over 3% in the third quarter, unable to fend off irresistible U.S. dollar strength built on ongoing Federal Reserve interest rate rises.Markets in China, Hong Kong and India were closed for holidays but Tokyo's open-for-business Nikkei jumped as much as 1.7% as the yen dribbled back towards 150-per-dollar, a weakness viewed as a boon for Japan's exporters.""We have had two big risk-off months and you have a risk-on event with the (U.S. government) shutdown being postponed but the 10-year Treasury is at 4.62% and the yen is near 150 so nothing has really changed,"" said Societe Generale analyst Kit Juckes.Marginally higher oil prices and debt pressures meant benchmark European government bond yields were also edging higher again, with Germany's 10-year Bund level within striking distance of a 12-year high of 2.86% hit late last week.The eleventh-hour deal to avoid a U.S. government shutdown, struck over the weekend, lifted U.S. stock futures in Asia overnight but they skulked back to almost flat in Europe.Story continuesThe stopgap funding bill allows the government to keep operating through Nov. 17, and means key data releases including Friday's monthly payrolls report can go ahead on time.""The shutdown risks are only delayed, not eliminated,"" TD Securities strategists wrote.""A sense of reduced uncertainty is likely to drive a small relief in markets,"" but ""market volatility is likely to remain elevated as investors wait for the next catalyst, which is likely to be top-tier data.""Japanese stocks were also boosted by the Bank of Japan's quarterly Tankan survey overnight, which showed an improvement in business sentiment, although the World Bank became the latest to trim its forecast for China's economy next year.Chinese data released over the weekend also delivered mixed messages.Beijing's official PMI figures on Saturday reported the first pick-up in activity in the key manufacturing sector in six months. Sunday's Caixin/S&amp;P Global PMI survey, however, shown the pace of growth slowing again.DOLLAR RESILIENCEBond and foreign exchange trade remains driven by an anticipation of U.S. interest rates staying high and selling of the yen and Japanese bonds on Monday drew a response.""We are closely watching market moves with a strong sense of urgency,"" Japanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki told Reuters, referring to the currency nearing the 150 per dollar threshold.The finance minister has jurisdiction over currency intervention, but he declined to comment on whether it was a possibility at this point.Ten-year Japanese government bond yields rose by a basis point to their highest for a decade at 0.775%. The Bank of Japan also said it would buy bonds with 5-10 years to maturity on Wednesday, with the size of purchases to be announced then. Futures bounced on the news.In the U.S. Treasury market, 10-year yields rose to 4.62% and the two-year yield rose to $5.10%.The dollar was still standing strong in currency markets, though was stopped short of last week's milestone highs save for against the yen, where it hit its highest since last October at 149.74 yen.""Relative U.S. growth resilience and (a) hawkish Fed are factors that continue to underpin support for the dollar, until U.S. data starts to show more material signs of softening,"" said OCBC currency strategist Christopher Wong.Mixed Chinese factory surveys and an expectation of no changes to rates settings at central bank meetings in the coming days kept pressure on the Australian and New Zealand dollars.The Aussie fell as much 0.5% to $0.6400 and the kiwi slipped 0.2% to $0.5986. The euro was a touch weaker at $1.0535, as was sterling at $1.2161.Crude oil steadied after late-week fallsBrent December crude futures rose 27 cents, or 0.3%, to $92.50 a barrel.

Ten-year yields were up five basis points to 4.62% - just shy of last week's 16-year peak of 4.69%.Story continuesThe dollar was higher too, with the dollar/yen exchange rate probing just under the 150 level many suspect will sound intervention alarm bells at the Bank of Japan.Aggravating bond yields have buoyed U.S. crude oil prices, which remained above $91 per barrel on Monday with gains back running at more than 10% year-on-year.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries with Russia and other allies, or OPEC+, holds a Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee meeting on Wednesday, although four OPEC+ sources told Reuters it's unlikely to tweak its current oil output policy this week.Another aspect of the averted government shutdown for markets is this week's September U.S. employment report will be released after all - a mixed blessing for bonds given the traditional volatility surrounding the release and the fact ongoing labor market tightness is keeping the Fed hawkish.Consensus forecasts are for another 163,000 rise in non-farm payrolls last month, down from the 187,000 gain in August and with an expected downtick in the unemployment rate to 3.7%. It's a big labor week all round, with August job openings data due on Tuesday and private sector payroll numbers from ADP out too.On labor relations more generally, the third week of autoworkers' strikes escalated on Friday as unions expanded the action again to the ire of auto company executives.On the data slate on Monday were a series of September survey readings from the manufacturing sector.Closely-watched business survey equivalents from China out earlier showed activity deteriorated again in both manufacturing and services last month and again questioned hopes for a rapid rebound of the giant ailing economy.Chinese markets are closed for most of the week for a holiday.European manufacturing readouts for last month were similarly downbeat, though the situation was better in France, Italy and Spain than in the region's biggest economy, Germany.Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Monday:* US Sept manufacturing surveys by ISM and S&amp;P Global. US Aug construction spending* Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell participates in roundtable with workers, small business owners in York; Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester and New York Fed chief John Williams all speak* U.S. Treasury auctions 3 and 6-month bills(Editing by Nick Macfie)]"

He Plans to Fix It.Severe Crash Is Coming for US Office Properties, Investors SayOnce Unthinkable Bond Yields Now the New Normal for MarketsStocks Lose Footing as Treasury Yields Surge: Markets WrapDisappointing harvests from some of the world’s biggest producers have pushed wholesale prices near the highest in more than 12 years in September. While that’s adding to unrelenting inflation pressures across the globe, African nations are particularly vulnerable amid a heavy reliance on sugar imports and a shortage of US dollars.Consumers in Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania are paying some of the highest prices for sugar in decades, made worse by tariffs on imports, according to data by Nairobi-based commodities research group Kulea. With energy prices also elevated and unemployment rising, the surging costs are causing headaches for families trying to feed themselves.“The pain of higher prices isn’t being felt equally across the region — it’s falling most on poorer countries,” said Kulea’s head of research Willis Agwingi.The staple ingredient forms an important part of local food customs, and is also used in the pastries and sweets that surround Muslim celebrations. For many African households, “sugar remains one of the most affordable sources of calories,” according to Kona Haque, head of commodities research at ED&amp;F Man.But surging prices are forcing consumers to spend less on soft drinks and forgo sugar that’s typically added to chai and other beverages, Agwingi said. Companies are also cutting back on purchases due to lackluster demand.“It’s been almost three months since I bought sugar for breakfast. We now consume rice in the mornings because the price of sugar can be used to purchase other condiments,” said Fatoumata Conde, a mother in Guinea, who used to put sugar in rice porridge and coffee.Story continuesThe cost of making puff puff — a popular West African snack made of fried dough — has also soared, pushing some vendors to reduce the amount of sugar added to the spongy snack. A restaurant in Cameroon has switched serving tea and coffee with honey in a bid to reduce costs.The combined raw sugar imports of the top four importing countries — Nigeria, Algeria, Morocco and Egypt — fell by 1% for the eight months through August compared to last year, and 8% from 2021 levels, according to preliminary data by Green Pool Commodity Specialists.Key Market for SugarCommodity traders normally view the continent as a major driver for sugar demand. Africa has the highest rate of population growth among major areas, and its share of middle-income households is rising. However, only five countries manage to barely produce enough sugar to meet demand, making it an attractive export destination for other producers.The cost of sugar varies by country depending on its refining capacity and the variety of sugar it imports, leaving some more exposed to price swings than others. For instance, North African nations like Algeria and Morocco typically consume more white sugar, and have more refiners compared to the rest of the continent, allowing them to import cheaper raw sugar in bulk and refine locally.Sub-Saharan regions mainly import bags of brown sugar and low-quality whites, which are shipped at a higher cost than bulk.Governments across the continent have scrambled to provide support. Kenyan policy makers opened a duty-free window to import sugar to plug the shortfall and tame prices. Ivory Coast has restricted exports of sugar until the end of December to ensure domestic supplies, and Ugandan officials are also facing pressure from manufacturers to lower import duties.The problems are being exacerbated by the twin forces of a strengthening dollar and a shortage of the currency that’s used to price most raw materials including sugar. That’s diminished the ability of some countries to increase imports, according Haque from ED&amp;F Man.“Most countries used their dollar reserves to buy grains and fertilizers when prices were high in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine,” she said. “Now, some are struggling to ramp up sugar imports and drawing down stocks — but they’ll need to replenish at some point.”--With assistance from David Herbling, Pius Lukong and Baudelaire Mieu.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWith Banks Offering 5% Returns, Financial Advisers Fight IrrelevanceGot Plastic With a No. 2 Recycling Symbol?

More than 450 Danish and allied government, military and industry leaders gathered to commemorate the milestone, and over 10,000 local citizens participated in the Royal Danish Air Force's public open house. During the open house the public learned more about the F-35's mission for Denmark, industry suppliers and witnessed the F-35 and F-16 on flying display.""Arrival of the first F-35 combat aircraft in Denmark is a historic event for the Danish Defence and the Royal Danish Air Force. It is thanks to close and professional cooperation between Lockheed Martin, the F-35 partnership and the Danish Defence, that Danish Defence now cross the threshold into the future of air defence,"" said Danish Minister of Defence, Troels Lund Poulsen.Denmark has played a critical role on the F-35 program, joining in 2002 as a partner during the System Development and Demonstration phase, strategically influencing technical elements of the program. The Royal Danish Air Force also contributed a Danish F-16 to the Joint Strike Fighter 461st Flight Test Squadron at Edwards Air Force Base, California where it served as a chase plane for the F-35 Development, Test &amp; Evaluation program. Danish industry has also contributed to F-35 production, development and sustainment activities and today, is building parts and components for each of the projected 3,100+ aircraft to be manufactured.""This milestone event is the realization of the vision, foresight and strategic investment Denmark made more than a decade ago. We expect that the F-35 will play a crucial role in 21st century security missions for Denmark, delivering unmatched 5th Generation capability, connectivity and interoperability,"" said Greg Ulmer, executive vice president, Lockheed Martin Aeronautics. ""The F-35 integrates joint forces, providing an unparalleled network effect across allied forces and significantly strengthening alliance-based deterrence across all domains.""Story continuesDenmark has taken delivery of 10 F-35s to date, four of which are now at Skrydstrup Air Base and six of which are stationed at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona, where Danish pilots and maintainers are conducting training. Denmark has plans to purchase 27 F-35 aircraft in total.Denmark's F-35 fleet will play a pivotal role in bolstering NATO's collective resilience in the Baltics and strengthening the alliance's ability to deter and defend against all threats across all domains. Denmark is the 10th country and fifth European NATO nation to operate the F-35 from its home soil. The F-35's growing presence in Europe increases collaboration with trusted allies and partners through a multilateral, multinational approach, ensuring an effective deterrent against near-peer competitors.By the mid-2030s, more than 600 F-35s will be stationed on the European continent across NATO member bases and Switzerland. NATO members in the F-35 program of record include Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, the United States and the United Kingdom.With the addition of Skrydstrup Air Base, F-35s are now operating from 31 bases worldwide.

This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). We'll use ROE to examine Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), by way of a worked example.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. View our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Lockheed Martin is:76% = US$7.1b ÷ US$9.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.76.Does Lockheed Martin Have A Good ROE?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Lockheed Martin has a higher ROE than the average (12%) in the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry.roeThat's clearly a positive. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROEVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesLockheed Martin's Debt And Its 76% ROEIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Lockheed Martin, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.90. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive, but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.ConclusionReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.If you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.Have feedback on this article?

Granted, 2023 didn’t begin as strongly for the sector with prices cooling. However, the pendulum is swinging back in the energy sector’s favor as oil prices again rise. High-yield energy shares – in this case, defined by being greater than 4.5% with the exception of two firms – are thus moving into a period of strength. In fact, here are seven high-yield energy stocks you may want to buy and hold immediately.Williams Cos. (WMB)The Williams Companies (WMB) logo displayed on a smartphone.Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.comOne of the high-yield energy stocks to consider is Williams Cos. (NYSE:WMB), which operates natural gas infrastructure. Thus, rising oil prices would seemingly not matter in relation to its prospects. However, there is a noted positive correlation between the two. That means rising oil prices are still pertinent. Further, evidence suggests that natural gas prices will also rise. In addition, Williams’ dividend yields 5.3%, and was last reduced in 2017. It’s highly unlikely to be reduced again soon given that the company’s net income nearly doubled through the first half of this year. Net income grew by 36% in the second quarter, which is still very strong despite the sequential decline. With prices set to increase, there’s little reason to fear any reduction soon. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDevon Energy (DVN)An image of a hand holding a smartphone displaying the Devon Energy Corporation logo in front of a computer screenSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comAnalysts believe, on average, that Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) should run at least 28% higher, without the inclusion of its dividend. Add that in and the returns could be substantially greater. However, it’s difficult to estimate how much that dividend will be because Devon Energy pays a fixed-plus-variable dividend to shareholders. In 2022, each of those quarterly dividends was greater than $1 due to surging oil prices. This year, those dividends have fallen from $0.89 to $0.72, and then to $0.49. Yet, oil prices are headed up again, which could lead to dividend hikes.Story continuesDevon Energy offers a feast-or-famine proposition to its shareholders that differentiates it from other energy firms. In general, major oil firms pay steady, dependable dividends whether times are good or bad. Devon Energy rewards shareholders in an outsized manner when the getting is good. That’s what makes it especially exciting at the moment. Pembina Pipeline (PBA) In the field, the oil pump in the evening, the evening silhouette of the pumping unit, the silhouette of the oil pump. Oil stocks and energy stocksSource: zhengzaishuru / Shutterstock.comPembina Pipeline (NYSE:PBA) is a midstream oil and natural gas stock in Alberta. The company deals with crude oil, tar sands oil, and the transmission thereof. The prospect of higher prices will prompt more drilling which in turn should lead to greater throughput for midstream firms including Pembina Pipeline. I think what’s especially attractive about Pembina Pipelines is the fact that its dividend yields a high 6.7%. That said, the payout ratio is 0.54 which is very healthy and the firm hasn’t reduced the dividend since 1998. It’s fair to say that investors can rely on PBA shares for relatively high, sustainable income production. Pembina has performed pretty much as you might have expected it to in 2023. Revenues have fallen by roughly a third. As a result, it has had to cut expenses in order to try and maintain earnings and pay for things like dividends. Same story here: Its prospects are getting brighter quickly because top-line results are set to improve. Comstock Resources (CRK) Large tanker ship carrying natural gas at dusk in harborSource: shutterstock.com/Wojciech WrzesienComstock Resources (NYSE:CRK) is an east Texas upstream natural gas and oil firm and stock that yields 4.5%. The bet here is that natural gas and oil prices rebound moving forward. That is the primary catalyst for the firm. Natural gas prices have fallen through the first half of the year and were especially weak in the second quarter. The result was that Comstock Resources’ revenues fell by 56% in H1 and more than 73% in Q2. Earnings dropped from $1.60 to -$0.17 in Q2. However, natural gas and oil prices are showing signs of reversal. The company continues to drill wells in the Haynesville basin and completed  The company has proven that it is very good at the upstream business. It gets wells online and produces oil. The other half of that equation is prices which are largely out of its control. Luckily, the other half of the equation is turning in its favor. Suncor Energy (SU) Suncor Energy logo displayed on a modern smartphoneSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.comSuncor Energy (NYSE:SU) continues to increase production while suffering from lower prices. Second quarter total upstream production increased by 3% in the second quarter. However, earnings plummeted by 53% during the period.  Expectations regarding energy prices are the clearest bright spot for investors at the moment. However, the company also managed to reduce its debt load by more than $1.3 billion between Q2 ‘22 and Q2 ‘23. The company sold its UK E&amp;P assets for $607 million and focused on leaner operations during Q2. Suncor Energy is a leading tar sands producer which is where the firm gets the majority of its revenues.  Oil sands have a relatively high return on an energy basis. It requires roughly 1 barrel of oil to produce 4 barrels of oil in return from the sands which is higher than shale, for example. BP (BP)BP stock: the BP company logo on a buildingSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock.comBP (NYSE:BP) is primarily known as an Oil Major stock with a progressive carbon reduction strategy relative to its U.S. counterparts. The firm is headquartered in London and by association, European in its thinking. That means it has been quicker to respond to carbon reduction initiatives than its U.S. competitors. The company is ultimately an oil firm. It will continue to implement carbon reduction strategies more quickly than U.S. firms but it still depends on oil for the time being. Oil production accounts for the majority of BP’s profits. It’s also massive and capable of taking advantage of rising prices. As oil and gas prices increase capital will flow into BP shares as demand rises. Yet, at the same time, BP is firmly focused on the future. That means its strategy includes a greater reliance on natural gas and carbon reduction. Lower energy prices in the first half of 2023 were a boon to BP’s gas &amp; low carbon segment which picked up the slack and produced surging profits. The company strikes a nice balance overall that smooths the difficulty of volatile energy prices. Chevron (CVX)Chevron (CVX) logo on gas station sign with ""diesel"" and ""food mart"" written underneathSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comChevron (NYSE:CVX) stock is essentially the antithesis of BP. The company’s results are dependent on oil production and prices first while it only nominally focuses on carbon reduction. Chevron is investing in future-forward energy production. However, it hasn’t resulted in earnings. All earnings come from upstream and downstream production while it loses money by investing in future-forward technology. That truth has played out again and again and is evidenced in its cash flow summary. Chevron shares have been flat overall for the past 4 months. They may fall slightly in the very near term because of economic worries due to interest rates but shares are going to rise. With Chevron, a lot of the appeal in investing is in the steady dividend. However, it’s logical to also expect energy stocks to rise moving forward: Tech stocks are facing a sell-off so investors are pivoting. Energy stocks are a logical destination as oil and gas prices rise. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

This week’s list includes Nike NKE, FedEx FDX, Adobe ADBE, Constellation Brands STZ and ConAgra CAG.Tech Earnings Impress in the Face of Economic HeadwindsQ3 Earnings Season Gets UnderwayRising treasury bond yields have become a major headwind for stocks. This issue took center stage following the latest Fed dot plot that appeared to push back the starting point of the central bank’s eventual unwinding of its monetary policy tightening.As we have noted here before, we see the seemingly hawkish Fed posture as nothing more than an insurance policy for the central bank that will come in handy should the recent favorable momentum on the inflation front start stalling.It is prudent on the Fed’s part to have complete confidence on the inflation question before changing course, though we remain of the view that the enduring trend on the inflation front remains favorable even as the macroeconomic backdrop remains far more resilient relative to earlier expectations.The economy’s resilience has been showing up in the positive turn in the earnings outlook that we have been flagging in recent months. Specifically, the earnings estimates revisions trend notably stabilized in early April this year after steadily coming down for almost a year.Had it not been for the Energy sector weakness, whose estimates had been steadily coming down this year before reversing course in recent days and going back up, aggregate earnings estimates would be modestly up since early April 2023.Sectors enjoying positive estimate revisions in this time period include Tech, Construction, Autos, Consumer Discretionary, Industrial Products, and Retail.We are seeing a similar revisions trend at play concerning estimates for 2023 Q3, whose advanced results have started coming out already.The expectation currently is of S&amp;P 500 earnings declining by -1.9% in Q3 from the same period last year on +0.9% higher revenues. This would follow the -7.1% decline on +1.1% higher revenues in 2023 Q2.Story continues2023 Q3 is expected to be the last period of declining earnings for the index, with positive growth resuming from 2023 Q4 onwards. In fact, had it not been for the Energy sector drag, earnings growth in 2023 Q3 would already be positive.Excluding the Energy sector, however, net margins would be modestly up from the year-earlier period.One sector that has made significant progress on the margins front is the Tech sector, whose year-over-year comparison turned positive in the preceding period and is expected to expand further this quarter.Look at current expectations for next year and the year after to understand the disconnect between the reality of current bottom-up aggregate earnings estimates and the seemingly never-ending worries about an impending economic downturn. That said, most economic analysts have been steadily lowering their recessionary odds in recent months.This Week’s Notable Earnings ReleasesThe Q3 earnings season will really get going when the big banks start coming out with their quarterly numbers in mid-October. But the reporting cycle has actually gotten underway already, with results from 16 S&amp;P 500 members out as of Friday, September 29th.These 16 S&amp;P 500 members include bellwethers like Nike, FedEx, Adobe and others. We have another 4 S&amp;P 500 members on deck to report results this week, including Constellation Brands, ConAgra and others.FedEx, Adobe, Nike, and all of these other early reporters are coming out with their fiscal August-quarter results, which we and other research organizations count as part of the Q3 tally. We will have seen roughly two dozen such August-quarter results by the time JPMorgan comes out with its quarterly results on October 13th.For the 16 S&amp;P 500 members that have reported already, total earnings and revenues are up +0.7% and +4.5% from the same period last year, with 87.5% beating EPS estimates and 75% beating revenue estimates.For a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What Can We Expect from Q3 Earnings?  Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

He Plans to Fix It.Severe Crash Is Coming for US Office Properties, Investors SayBond Selloff Batters Stocks, But Spares Big Tech: Markets WrapJPMorgan’s Dimon Predicts 3.5-Day Work Week for Next Generation Thanks to AI Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman’s work helped pioneer the technology that enabled Moderna Inc. and the Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE partnership to swiftly develop shots. The vaccines have been given to hundreds of millions of people around the world, a key step toward easing the coronavirus pandemic.Kariko and Weissman will share the 11 million-krona ($1 million) award, the Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm said in a statement Monday.The scientists showed how to solve one of the major problems of mRNA by tweaking it to avoid causing inflammation. Their research, published in 2005, was one of the building blocks that allowed it to be introduced into the body.“Through their groundbreaking findings, which have fundamentally changed our understanding of how mRNA interacts with our immune system, the laureates contributed to the unprecedented rate of vaccine development during one of the greatest threats to human health in modern times,” the Nobel Assembly said.Their work became the basis for a new type of inoculation. Instead of introducing a weakened or dead virus into the body to teach the immune system to recognize an infection, mRNA is used to prompt cells to produce what’s needed for a vaccine themselves. The approach is much quicker, and enabled Moderna and the Pfizer-BioNTech team to develop shots against Covid in less than 11 months.Kariko, born in Hungary, and Weissman, an American, labored in relative obscurity for years with an approach that many other scientists had written off as too difficult to use.Story continuesXerox MachineThe daughter of a butcher, Kariko was born in 1955 and grew up in a small town in the eastern part of the country. She earned her doctorate in biochemistry at the University of Szeged, working with RNA for the first time in 1978. In 1985, she moved to the US for a job at Temple University in Philadephia, then later became a research assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania. For years, she struggled to get academic recognition for her work. After failing to get grant funding, she was demoted in 1995.Kariko, reached by the secretary of the Nobel Assembly, said she was “overwhelmed and also put it in context with her situation as a scientist.” Thomas Perlmann, the secretary, told reporters gathered in Stockholm that the prize marks “a dramatic change in her circumstances.”“It is absolutely right that the ground-breaking work on RNA led by Kariko and Weissman should be recognized by a Nobel Prize in view of the extraordinary advance that their scientific endeavors have made for vaccine development and for the impact of that work on human health in the pandemic,” said Andrew Pollard, who worked on a rival shot as the director of the Oxford vaccine group at the University of Oxford.Weissman earned his medical doctorate in immunology and microbiology at Boston University in 1987, joining UPenn in 1997 after a fellowship at Anthony Fauci’s lab at the National Institutes of Health.In a story that seems destined to become part of medical history, Kariko and Weissman met over a Xerox machine. Both were avid readers of medical journals, and as they copied hundreds of pages, they began to talk about their research. Weissman was interested in dendritic cells, which help the immune system adapt to fight intruders. Kariko thought mRNA could help.In 2005, the team published a breakthrough paper solving one of the major problems with using mRNA. Up to that point, introducing the molecule into a cell would cause inflammation, and sometimes the cell — or the lab mouse — would die. Kariko and Weissman made a slight modification in uridine, one of the building blocks that make up mRNA, mimicking a process that occurs naturally in the body. When they did, the inflammation no longer happened.Annual prizes for achievements in physics, chemistry, medicine, literature and peace were established in the will of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish inventor of dynamite, who died in 1896. A prize in economic sciences was added by Sweden’s central bank in 1968.The laureates are announced through Oct. 9 in Stockholm, with the exception of the peace prize, whose recipients are selected by the Norwegian Nobel Committee in Oslo.--With assistance from Anton Wilen and Christopher Jungstedt.(Updates with comment from UK scientist who also worked on a coronavirus shot in 10th paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWith Banks Offering 5% Returns, Financial Advisers Fight IrrelevanceA Nobel Laureate Offers a Biting Critique of EconomicsGot Plastic With a No. 2 Recycling Symbol?

Source: Marriott International.Marriott last Wednesday gave a multi-hour, 144-slide presentation to investment analysts, providing insights into strategy at the world’s largest hotelier. Executives outlined their financial model through 2025.Here are some key takeaways.1. Marriott aims to grow its footprint.Marriott plans to add about 230,000 to 270,000 net rooms over three years. This would represent a three-year compound average growth rate of 5% to 5.5%.Net room expansion at that pace would represent a post-pandemic return to the company’s decade-long average for net room expansion.The company also plans to spend as much as $870 million through 2025 to “support room growth.” I interpret “support rooms growth” to mean three things: It may acquire more small hotel groups, such as its recent acquisition of City Express; ;ike its recent MGM deal, it may do more co-marketing and licensing deals; and it may also create more hotel brands and collections.marriott investor day 2023 slide competitive perspective international hotel group brands system size and construction pipeline2. Marriott intends to become more global.It has nearly doubled its presence in international markets since 2008.Close to 40% of its rooms today are outside the U.S. and Canada.By 2025, the U.S. and Canada may represent only a slim majority of the company’s total fees through franchise and management contracts worldwide.chart marriott cagr for net rooms growth 2023 baser marriott investor day 20233. Non-room revenue is increasingly significant.The company forecasted average global growth in revenue per available room at between 3% and 6% between now and 2025.But Marriott wants to grow its revenue from non-room sources, such as fees from its co-branded credit cards, timeshare royalty fees, and residential branding fees.Today, nearly 20% of Marriott’s total fee revenue is derived from sources apart from traditional room bookings.A decade-and-a-half ago, that share was only 5%.Already in 2022, it generated $547 million in credit card fees, and that number will only grow.4. Marriott sees luxury as an important part of its portfolio.It has 497 luxury hotels open today.It has 225 in its pipeline.“We are leading in luxury distribution globally with 17% of the market — nearly one-and-a-half times the size of the next largest competitor,” said Tina Edmundson, president of luxury.It said it had a 30% market share of open and under-construction rooms in the luxury segment in the U.S. and Canada.Story continues5. The era of hotel discounting may not return for quite some time.Marriott has enjoyed strong pricing power even though occupancy levels haven’t returned to pre-pandemic levels worldwide on average.In one chart (shown below), Pinto highlighted how Marriott’s systemwide comparable average daily rate as of June 30, exceeded the comparable figure as of June 30, 2019.“In general, our philosophy is to avoid chasing occupancy and to be willing to trade some occupancy for average daily rate to drive overall hotel profitability,” said Drew Pinto, executive vice president and chief revenue and technology officer.Instead of cutting room rates to woo customers, Marriott has been tending to drive short-term leisure demand through packages and promotions featuring benefits, such as credits for on-property amenities, like food and beverage or spa.These campaigns produced $1.8 billion in revenue for its hotels year-to-date through August.marriot average daily rate growth in 2023 versus 2019What do you think?

103,6b7cff8e-e5aa-33fe-bfbe-02708f917d7e,DIS,2023-10-02,A Look At The Fair Value Of The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-fair-value-walt-disney-120015736.html,1696248015,STORY,['DIS'],"[Key InsightsThe projected fair value for Walt Disney is US$87.23 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityWith US$81.05 share price, Walt Disney appears to be trading close to its estimated fair valueOur fair value estimate is 19% lower than Walt Disney's analyst price target of US$107Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) as an investment opportunity by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Walt Disney The MethodWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$7.12bUS$9.14bUS$10.6bUS$14.9bUS$12.8bUS$11.6bUS$11.0bUS$10.6bUS$10.4bUS$10.4bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x14Analyst x13Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ -9.16%Est @ -5.76%Est @ -3.39%Est @ -1.73%Est @ -0.56% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.9% US$6.6kUS$7.9kUS$8.5kUS$11.0kUS$8.8kUS$7.4kUS$6.5kUS$5.8kUS$5.3kUS$4.9k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$73bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$10b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.9%– 2.2%) = US$185bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$185b÷ ( 1 + 7.9%)10= US$87bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$160b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$81.1, the company appears about fair value at a 7.1% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Walt Disney as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.141. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Walt DisneyStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

(NYSE:OKE) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for ONEOK What's The Estimated Valuation?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period.

For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 9.0%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.4b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (9.0%– 2.2%) = US$65bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$65b÷ ( 1 + 9.0%)10= US$27bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$51b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$63.4, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 28% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at ONEOK as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.375. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for ONEOKStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividend is in the top 25% of dividend payers in the market.WeaknessShareholders have been diluted in the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatDividends are not covered by cash flow.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

He has been a stalwart in the Team Europe dressing room, sharing his experience with a young team and leading by example by contributing key momentum building points when it mattered. On day one, Rose holed the decisive putt on the 18th to secure a tie, and his immediate reaction was to turn and acknowledge his teammates who stood beside the green – showcasing his belief that the team should always come first.Rose was paired with Ryder Cup rookie Robert MacIntyre on day one and used his vast Ryder Cup experience to help guide the young Scotsman during his first Ryder Cup match, in what proved to be a tough battle against Max Homa and Wyndham Clark. On day two, Rose continued his partnership with MacIntyre and they secured a decisive 3&amp;2 victory against Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth, with Rose's red-hot putter proving crucial. MacIntyre would go on to have an exceptional debut, collecting 2 ½ points.Just as the efforts of Jack Nicklaus and Tony Jacklin did in 1969, Rose exemplified the true values of this great game, cementing his place in Ryder Cup history at Marco Simone Golf &amp; Country Club. Rose has become the third player to receive this honor, following Dustin Johnson from the U.S. Team and Sergio Garcia from the European Team, who won the Award at Whistling Straits two years ago.Inspired by the historic 1969 Concession when Jack Nicklaus conceded a 2-foot putt to Tony Jacklin for a halved match resulting in the first tie in Ryder Cup history, the Award honors two icons in the game and is given to the player who best embodies the true spirit of the Ryder Cup – the individual who sees the bigger picture and makes better decisions on and off the course.Story continuesSpeaking about winning the Nicklaus-Jacklin Award presented by Aon, Rose said: ""Winning this Award is a huge compliment. This event really pushes you to the limit because it has so much passion. You have to find that line and get close to it, but always stay on the right side and be respectful towards your opponent. The Americans played their heart out today and deserve a lot of respect. Novak Djokovic gave the team some advice earlier this week and really emphasized how you need to embrace a pressurized situation and use it as inspiration. The putt on the 18th on day one was a good example of where I tried to embrace the moment – I didn't want to blemish such a great start by the team, and my immediate reaction was to embrace my teammates who had all performed so well as a group.""The Ryder Cup is all about teamwork and I managed to put together a strong partnership with Bob. I made some putts at the right time on the first two days that made me look heroic, but he chipped away constantly and made a big contribution just when we needed to keep the momentum going. A big thank you to Aon - winning this Award will make today's victory even sweeter for me.""At this year's Ryder Cup in Rome, Team Europe took victory by 16 ½ -11 ½, after three days filled with iconic pairings, intense rivalry and selfless performances. Team Europe raced to a dominant 6 ½ to 1 ½ lead after day one and preserved their five-point advantage to lead 10 ½ to 5 ½ heading into the final day of singles. A close and hard-fought final day went down to the final few holes, with England's Tommy Fleetwood delivering the clinching moment in style on the short par-4 16th hole.""As the 44th Ryder Cup comes to an end, we are reminded that golf is a game shaped by respect, integrity and decision making under pressure,"" said Andy Weitz, Chief Marketing Officer of Aon. ""This event represents the best of golf, and this Award represents the best of the Ryder Cup. As its presenting partner, we are proud to honor Justin as the recipient of this year's Nicklaus-Jacklin Award presented by Aon. His display of character and skill throughout an intense match embodied the spirit of this event, and why we love this game.""Learn more about the Nicklaus-Jacklin Award presented by Aon here.About AonAon plc (NYSE: AON) exists to shape decisions for the better — to protect and enrich the lives of people around the world.

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 85% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Seagate Technology Holdings, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Seagate Technology Holdings ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Seagate Technology Holdings?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Seagate Technology Holdings. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Seagate Technology Holdings' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Seagate Technology Holdings. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 11% of shares outstanding. The second and third largest shareholders are Sanders Capital, LLC and BlackRock, Inc., with an equal amount of shares to their name at 7.2%.We did some more digging and found that 10 of the top shareholders account for roughly 52% of the register, implying that along with larger shareholders, there are a few smaller shareholders, thereby balancing out each others interests somewhat.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Seagate Technology HoldingsThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Seagate Technology Holdings plc. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$67m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 14% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Seagate Technology Holdings. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

(Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)Domestic flight activity for express air parcel companies, led by FedEx, inched up in August, with the group performing better than normal for the time of year, according to research by transport analysts at Morgan Stanley. But the express carriers are still flying less than they were a year ago because of weak shipping demand.Market reporting agency WorldACD said on Saturday that express shipments were down 17% from January to August versus the same period in 2022.The reports underscore how private air fleets of express delivery companies are coping with a yearlong downturn in parcel volumes amid a broader freight recession that is also hurting airlines that carry general cargo. The decline in flights appears to be near the bottom of the cycle after dropping 30% at FedEx (NYSE: FDX) and 20% at UPS (NYSE: UPS) at the start of the year.FedEx flight utilization, on a sequential basis, jumped 17% in August following a 9% drop the prior month, while the year-over-year comparison improved to minus 7% versus down 14% in July, according to Morgan Stanley’s Parcel Tracker report. FedEx reported that a decline in domestic parcel volumes flattened out in the first quarter of the 2024 fiscal year ended Aug. 31, suggesting a potentially greater need for flights than in recent months. The carrier also appears to have benefited from UPS freight diverted by shippers that feared a potential strike by drivers and warehouse workers leading up to an agreement on a new labor contract.The summer is generally a slower period for air cargo traffic.UPS flight counts increased 12% month over month in August, a noticeable improvement from minus 14% in July from June. It was the first time in months that UPS recorded a sequential increase in flights. Compared to August 2022, UPS flight activity fell 14% — one point worse than the July comparison.“If September flight activity were to follow typical seasonality, UPS would have the lowest quarterly flight count since Q1 2019,” the report said.Story continuesMeanwhile, Amazon Air’s (NASDAQ: AMZN) flight count sequentially ticked up 1% versus a 2% decline last month. While FedEx and UPS have been in negative territory all year, Amazon has continued to expand airline operations — but at a much slower pace than in recent years. FedEx and UPS have sharply reduced domestic and international flight hours since last fall by flying less frequently on certain routes, parking a portion of their fleets, retiring older aircraft and pushing more packages to cheaper ground transportation. UPS has also offered early retirement to senior pilots in an effort to cut costs.Amazon’s fleet took to the skies 3% more in August than the prior year following a 16% year-over-year gain in July. August represented the slowest growth in flight activity for Amazon since the second quarter of 2018, Morgan Stanley said.It’s worth noting that Amazon has a much smaller fleet and airport network than FedEx and UPS.Meanwhile, the integrated logistics companies, including DHL, had 36% more global air capacity for the first half of the year than the same period in 2019, but 3% less than a year, according to data presented by Accenture on IAG Cargo’s latest video presentation on LinkedIn.Click here for more FreightWaves/American Shipper stories by Eric Kulisch.Twitter: @ericreports / LinkedIn: Eric Kulisch / ekulisch@freightwaves.comRELATED NEWS:FedEx, UPS pull back July cargo flights amid weak volumesThe post FedEx air fleet flies more in August appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

Despite the wave of selling in a historically weak month for stocks, the overall bullish backdrop remains, and some indicators appear to be flashing buy signals to investors who can handle more volatility and the possibility of near-term selling.The three highly-ranked Zacks stocks we explore today are Textron, NXP Semiconductors and Construction Partners.The S&amp;P 500 popped on Thursday to prevent it from having to test its 200-day moving average for the first time since March. It’s possible the bears ramp up the selling to start the fourth quarter and the benchmark is forced to test its 200-day, or even its 50-week or 200-week moving averages. But there is no denying that the S&amp;P 500 appears to be rather oversold at the moment—at levels it last hit when the market bottomed at the end of Q3 2022.The bears keep waiting for earnings revisions to fall off a cliff. Yet, the earnings outlook is improving and the most recent Zacks data showcases that the S&amp;P 500 is projected to return to growth in Q4 and then roar back in a big way in 2024 (+12.0%) and 2025 (+11.4%), which hardly signals a major U.S. recession is right around the corner.On top of that, the Fed is near the end of its rate hiking efforts, even if it has to turn up the temperature a bit more as the U.S. labor market and economy remain sturdy. It is also worth remembering that many investors are the most excited to buy stocks at what will be the near-term highs and nervous to buy at the eventual near-term lows.First up is Aerospace–Defense industry standout Textron, which also operates commercial segments. Textron’s Arctic Cat is a leader in the small off-road vehicle space, while Cessna is a major player in private aviation. TXT’s portfolio also includes Bell, which landed a potentially massive contract with the U.S. Army in late 2022 to make its next-generation helicopters.Story continuesTextron posted an impressive beat-and-raise quarter over the summer and its upbeat EPS outlook helps it land a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. Zacks estimates call for TXT to post 8% revenue growth this year and another 6% next year to help boost its adjusted earnings by 32% and 7%, respectively.TXT stock is up 190% in the last 10 years to blow away its industry’s 7% and top the S&amp;P 500’s 162%, including a 33% climb over the past 12 months and a 17% jump in Q3. Textron is attempting to hit new highs and break out of its current range. On the valuation front, Textron trades at a 24% discount to its industry and 33% below its own 10-year highs at 14.2X forward 12-month earnings.Next up is Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) NXP Semiconductors. NXP Semiconductors is a leading chip maker with huge exposure to the automotive industry, as well as industrial segments, IoT, mobile devices, wearables, energy infrastructure, and more. On top of that, Wall Street is starting to pay attention to NXP’s ability to benefit from the wider AI and machine learning revolution within self-driving vehicles and beyond.Zacks estimates call for the company to return to top and bottom line growth next year after it faces a slight downturn in 2023, with it up against a monster stretch of growth. NXPI trades at 14.8X forward 12-month earnings. This represents 45% value vs. its own highs, as well as a 16% discount to its industry and 34% value vs. the Zacks Tech sector despite its long-term outperformance of both. Plus, NXP Semiconductors’ dividend yields 2.1% at the moment, which is a nice bonus for a chip stock.NXPI shares have climbed roughly 400% in the last decade vs. the Zacks Tech sector’s 225% and its Semiconductor-Analog and Mixed industry’s 380%. The stock is up 60% during the past three years to blow away Tech’s 22%. And NXP Semiconductors is currently finding support at its long-term 21-week moving average. Last up is vertically integrated civil infrastructure firm Construction Partners, Inc., which specializes in road construction and maintenance across six states including Florida, North Carolina, and Georgia. Its core business is centered around publicly funded projects such as local and state highways, bridges, and more. ROAD also has a private sector, and it is one of the fastest-growing civil contractors in a booming region of the country.ROAD topped our Q3 FY23 estimates and raised its guidance to help it land a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at the moment. Construction Partners is projected to post 20% sales growth this year and 8% higher next year to help boost its adjusted earnings by 105% and 39%, respectively—which comes up against an impressive stretch. And the U.S. is finally focused on infrastructure spending after decades of neglect.ROAD shares have climbed around 200% since the company’s 2018 IPO vs. the S&amp;P 500’s 60% and its industry’s 53%. The stock is up 34% YTD and it is trading above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Construction Partners also trades roughly in line with its own five-year median of 31.5X forward earnings and at a 53% discount to its highs.(Disclosure: Ben Rains owns NXPI in Zacks Alternative Energy Innovators service). Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

Why not get a value stock even cheaper if you can?And while you’re looking for cheap stocks, many are also paying dividends. The yields on some value stocks have become even more attractive in 2023.Screening for Cheap Stocks with Big Dividend YieldsIt’s pretty easy to screen for cheap stocks. This screen looked for companies with a forward P/E under 15 and a P/S ratio under 1.0. A P/S ratio under 1.0 indicates a company is on sale as investors are paying less for each sale. For instance, a P/S ratio of 0.2 means investors are paying $0.20 for each $1 of sales.To get the income portion, you can add a dividend over 3%. It’s not as high as many money markets are paying right now, which are 5% and above, but it’s still an attractive yield.Additionally, an added bonus would be to add the Zacks Ranks of #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy). Hopefully, the addition of the Rank will produce companies with rising earnings estimates.This screen returned 29 stocks.Story continues5 Value Stocks that Pay Out Real Cash1.       ManpowerGroup MANManpowerGroup is a global staffing company with operations and clients in 75 countries.

130,0d42a52d-e88e-3661-9f99-6b43627c7086,SRE,2023-10-02,7 Stocks That Could Soar Following the Fed’s Latest Decision,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-could-soar-following-001929404.html,1695687569,STORY,"['COST', 'MA', 'MET', 'ARCC', 'FIVE', 'SRE', 'PG']","[In the wake of the Federal Reserve unveiling its monetary policy roadmap, investors are keenly examining which stocks to buy that stand to benefit. The Fed’s depiction was largely positive, though the anticipation of one more rate hike before year-end provides food for thought.It might be prudent for investors to brace for a prolonged high interest rate atmosphere, potentially lasting through 2024. This conservative stance ensures that should the Fed navigate to a “soft landing” and simultaneously mitigate inflation, the outcome would exceed expectations.Further, gravitating towards stocks that are favorably poised in the face of rising interest rates often implies a tilt towards inherently robust companies. So even if rates were to retreat, these stocks, bolstered by their inherent stability, could shield investors from drastic downturns.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsKeeping the Fed interest rate decision in perspective, here are some compelling stocks to buy.Stocks to Buy: Costco (COST)A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.Source: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.comQuite frankly, warehouse-style retailer Costco (NASDAQ:COST) makes for a relatively easy case for stocks to buy on the Fed interest rate decision. As policymakers have stated previously, while disinflationary trends may be encouraging, consumer prices remain stubbornly elevated. Therefore, households will still be looking to secure discounts, which bodes well for COST.Of course, what makes Costco stand out even more is that it’s a membership-only enterprise. As well, Costco caters to a higher income segment compared to other big-box retailers. Thus, COST should be relatively insulated from various economic pressures.To be fair, COST does come at a forward earnings premium of 36.45x, which is steep. However, with that price, you get a predictable business and a relatively robust balance sheet. Analysts peg COST as a strong buy with a $588.39 price target, implying a bit over 5% upside potential. The high-side target is $651, suggesting almost 17% growth.Story continuesAres Capital (ARCC)Ares Capital (ARCC) logo on its webpageSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comA leading specialty finance firm, Ares Capital (NASDAQ:ARCC) is a business development company (BDC). This is a type of investment vehicle that aims to facilitate capital access for small and mid-sized businesses. Enterprises that take up the services of BDCs generally are too small to receive capital from larger financial institutions.Now, with that said, Ares presents a significant risk for stocks to buy on the Fed interest rate decision. Should the central bank continue to lift rates in 2024, a soft landing might not materialize. Instead, the metaphorical airplane might scare some passengers before they finally disembark.Still, it’s also possible that if the economy still trudges forward somewhat, small businesses will have little choice but to use BDCs like Ares. Thus, speculative investors should keep ARCC on their radar. Lastly, analysts peg ARCC as a consensus moderate buy with a $20.75 average price target, implying nearly 8% upside.Stocks to Buy: Procter &amp; Gamble (PG)Procter &amp; Gamble Union Distribution Center. P&amp;G is an American Multinational Consumer Goods CompanySource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comA consumer goods giant, Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) is a classic case for stocks to buy on the Fed interest rate decision. Basically, no matter what happens in the economy, people will need to buy P&amp;G products. Therefore, the business enjoys a level of predictability that other enterprises can only dream about.To be sure, there’s no such thing as a free lunch. By targeting predictability, investors end up giving away potentiality. Still, if the Fed raises interest rates again before year’s end and if unforeseen circumstances materialize in 2024, investors will be happy to have P&amp;G in their portfolios.Looking at its financials, few would mistake it as a remarkable profile. Still, true to form, the consumer goods firm is consistently profitable, in part thanks to its robust net margin of nearly 18%. In closing, analysts peg PG as a consensus moderate buy with a $169.50 price target, implying nearly 12% upside potential.Sempra Energy (SRE)The logo for Sempra (SRE) is seen at the top of an office building.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comWhile I’ve been hammering home the idea of Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) as one of the stocks to buy, the reality is that few utilities offer as compelling an opportunity. For one thing, we must consider location, location, location. Headquartered in San Diego, California, Sempra couldn’t ask for a more economically viable and desirable market to serve.Sure, political editorials love to wax poetic about people leaving California for “freedom” and whatnot. However, the desirability of the Golden State makes SRE a strong wager for the Fed interest rate decision. Basically, no matter where monetary policy goes, people still have to pay their utility bills. With Sempra, you have the knowledge that this user base is relatively well off.As you’d expect from a utility, SRE doesn’t really enjoy sterling financials. However, the main takeaway is that it’s consistently profitable. Finally, analysts peg SRE as a moderate buy with an $82.15 target, implying over 14% growth.Stocks to Buy: Mastercard (MA)Close up of a pile of mastercard credit load debit bank cards.Source: David Cardinez / Shutterstock.comI’m not going to lie: Mastercard (NYSE:MA) is a tough idea to stomach for stocks to buy on the Fed interest rate decision. At first glance, the narrative makes plenty of sense. With economic conditions worsening, consumers may be forced to use plastic to make ends meet. Further, higher interest rates translate to greater profitability for lenders.However, you can only push this thesis so much before it becomes very questionable. Much of the viability of Mastercard will depend on whether the central bank truly engineers a soft landing. Otherwise, MA could be problematic.Then again, the underlying company enjoys relatively solid financials if you ignore its rich earnings premium. Commanding solid revenue growth and robust profit margins, Mastercard just might be able to offer an enticing idea for investors.Analysts certainly like it, rating MA a consensus strong buy. Their average price target comes in at $466.18, implying 16% upside potential.MetLife (MET)Man in suit with hands over paper cutouts of family, car and home. Represents insurance.Source: thodonal88 / Shutterstock.comOne of the largest global providers of insurance, MetLife (NYSE:MET) is a fundamentally boring enterprise. Nevertheless, if you’re looking for stocks to buy based on the Fed interest rate decision, boring is good. As with the other ideas on this list, MetLife offers a relatively predictable business. Also, the Covid-19 crisis may have sparked a cynical tailwind.Basically, we now know that anything can happen, even in the developed world. Therefore, the pandemic reinforced the idea of future planning. In addition to insurance products, MetLife specializes in annuities and employee benefit programs, with over 90 million customers in over 60 countries.To be fair, MetLife doesn’t exactly offer the best financial profile. However, prospective investors should note that MET trades at a forward multiple of 7.02x, below the sector median of 9.73x. Most conspicuously, analysts peg MET as a unanimous strong buy among 10 expert voices. The average price target lands at $78.60, implying 22% upside potential.Five Below (FIVE)storefront of a five belowSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comWhile the underlying narrative for discount retailer Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE) is compelling for easily discernible reasons, it’s also risky. Since the beginning of the year, FIVE has given up 14% of its equity value. What’s more worrying, FIVE slipped 21% just in the trailing month alone. So, what happened to these no-brainer entities for tricky economic situations?Five Below isn’t the only name in the discount retail space that’s hurting. Most notably, Dollar General (NYSE:DG) has been in free fall, losing 56% since the January opener. For the pure-play dollar store, the gross margin erosion paints an ironic picture: the discounts are hurting the discount retailer.However, in Five Below’s case, its gross margins are improving (albeit slightly) while seeing increased revenue growth. It’s in a much better financial situation, which isn’t surprising given the more appealing reputation of the brand. On a final note, analysts peg FIVE a strong buy with a $212.87 target, implying 44% upside.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Autoworkers are on strike. Unionized pilots just got record pay raises out of all the major airlines. The Teamsters union wrung concessions from United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS). And union drives continue at American companies as diverse as Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). At the same time, the federal government is spending $1.25 trillion on infrastructure projects across the country to improve roads, bridges, railway corridors, and more. Governments at the state and municipal levels are also investing heavily in construction projects. The Brookings Institution is calling this “America’s Infrastructure Decade.”  It’s all contributing to a blue-collar bull market.Ford Motor (F)Ford dealership sign against a blue sky.Source: D K Grove / Shutterstock.comFord Motor (NYSE:F) seems to be doing better than its rivals when it comes to negotiating with the autoworker unions.For one, Ford reached a new labor pact with more than 5,000 autoworkers in Canada, narrowly averting a strike that could have impacted its vehicle production. Then, the United Auto Workers (UAW) union in the U.S. announced that it would not expand its strike action against Ford. While a collective agreement between the two has not yet been reached, the union says progress is being made.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIn addition, the resolution of bargaining in Canada comes as a relief. Without that, Ford would have had to contend with labor issues on both sides of the border. Plus, a strike in Canada would have impacted the production of the Ford Edge and Lincoln Nautilus crossover vehicles.FedEx (FDX)A FedEx employee loads a FedEx Express truck in Manhattan.Source: Antonio Gravante / Shutterstock.comShares of FedEx (NYSE:FDX) are rallying, with UPS finding itself embroiled in labor negotiations.Helping, FedEx just reported better-than-expected financial results and raised its full-year guidance. For its latest quarter, FedEx reported earnings per share (EPS) of $4.55 on revenue of $21.7 billion. Analysts forecast EPS of $3.71 from sales of $21.7 billion. The company also said earnings were given a big lift by internal cost-cutting, as well as events such as the UPS labor negotiations and the bankruptcy of Yellow Corp. Looking ahead, FedEx said it expects to earn between $17 and $18.50 a share for its full 2024 fiscal year.Story continuesBoeing (BA)BA stock: a blue and white Boeing 787 flying in the sky above the cloudsSource: vaalaa / ShutterstockBoeing (NYSE:BA) is a major American manufacturer, employing more than 150,000 blue-collar workers. It’s also one of only two commercial aircraft manufacturers in the world along with France’s Airbus SE. Given its competitive strength and its global duopoly in the manufacture of commercial aircraft, Boeing could be a good long-term holding for investors with time and patience.Granted, Boeing has had its share of problems. Its stock was knocked lower after the company warned that a new manufacturing flaw in its 737 Max aircraft is likely to delay deliveries to its airline customers worldwide. It also found fastener holes on the aft pressure bulkhead on some 737 Max aircraft were improperly drilled, which needs repair. However, Boeing stressed that the bulkhead problem is not a safety issue. Despite the hiccup, Boeing has raised its monthly production to 38 aircraft from 31 previously.McDonald’s (MCD)McDonald's golden archesSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / ShutterstockMcDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) just said it would raise the royalty fees it charges new U.S. restaurant franchises. Specifically, McDonald’s said that it is raising the fee that new franchise operators must pay to license the McDonald’s brand to 5% from 4% as of Jan. 1. The company said the increased royalty fee will help it to maintain its “competitive edge.”That royalty fee hike also comes after McDonald’s beat Wall Street expectations with second-quarter financial results. Better, a growing number of analysts are turning bullish on McDonald’s, which they feel is a good bet if the economy falls into a recession.Caterpillar (CAT)Image of the Wall Street Bull.Source: photo.ua / Shutterstock.comAfter struggling during the pandemic, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is on a tear once again. At the moment, the company is riding high on renewed infrastructure spending by governments at all levels. That’s in addition to rising demand for its mining machinery.Moving forward, Caterpillar is well-positioned for continued growth given that most of its business remains in North America. Also, while construction and mining activity in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico remains strong, activity and demand are beginning to wane in other areas, notably China and Europe, where the economies are cooling much faster under the weight of high-interest rates. Caterpillar’s positioning in North America insulates it from international headwinds.Walmart (WMT)Walmart (WMT) logo on a store frontSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comUBS analyst just upgraded Walmart (NYSE:WMT) to a “buy” rating, with a $190 price target. All thanks to growing strength in its online sales channel and increasing dominance in groceries. Helping, Walmart is the largest grocery retailer in America, outpacing both Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and Kroger (NYSE:KR).In addition, Walmart’s earnings continue to be impressive. The company recently raised its full-year guidance after beating Wall Street expectations for its second-quarter results. In fact, same-store sales increased 6.4% year over year, with e-commerce sales up 24%. In addition, the company now expects full-year sales to increase between 4% and 4.5% which is ahead of previous guidance of sales gains of 3.50%.General Electric (GE)Company breakups: The General Electric GE logo on a buildingSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comGeneral Electric (NYSE:GE) is in the process of splitting into separate entities, which will include GE Aerospace, GE Vernova (the power generation business), and GE HealthCare Technologies. GE executives have said they want all the businesses to have investment-grade credit ratings when they become independent companies with strong franchises in their respective industries. To that end, GE is allocating its free cash flow to the new companies. Wall Street expects GE’s cash flow in Q3 of this year to total about $900 million.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Joel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

132,e7a7dfa0-7751-369c-be2a-6164dd7300f3,LKQ,2023-10-02,UAW Strike 2023: 7 Stocks That Could Actually Benefit From the Disruption,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/uaw-strike-2023-7-stocks-105019707.html,1695725419,STORY,"['F', 'GM', 'HMC', 'STLAM.MI', 'TSLA', 'TM', 'RIVN', 'LKQ']","[Ford Motor (NYSE:F) may be making some progress in its negotiations with the United Auto Workers labor union, yet for the automaker and its two “Detroit Three” peers, General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Chrysler parent Stellantis (NYSE:STLA), the ongoing UAW strike remains a serious headwind.Beyond just causing operational disruptions in the near-term, this labor action could have a lasting negative effect on each of these companies.Not only could increases in pay and benefits weigh on the legacy automaker’s margins. Decreased profitability could hinder their EV pivot efforts as well.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSo, what does this mean for investors in automotive stocks? As the strike continues, many non-unionized auto manufacturers, both incumbent as well as EV-only, could benefit.There are also a few non-automakers in the sector for which the strike may be a favorable development as well.Longer-term, the final negotiated labor contracts could end up being not just favorable for the UAW rank-and-file, but for the non-union automotive companies as well. With this in mind, take a look at these seven stocks.Honda Motor (HMC)honda logo on a sign outside a honda dealershipSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comHonda Motor (NYSE:HMC) is one of several foreign-based automakers with an extensive U.S. presence that could benefit from the aforementioned auto strike. The Japan-based company has a unionized labor force in its home market, but stateside Honda’s facilities are non-union.The UAW’s labor action may bode well for HMC stock, in two ways.First, if Honda’s unionized competition ends up having to agree to higher-than-expected wage/benefit increases, this may cause a further rise in their respective vehicle prices.This could make Honda a stronger competitor in the U.S. market, where it currently has 7.4% market share.Second, if increased labor costs force Ford, GM, and Stellantis to scale back vehicle electrification efforts, this could be the benefit of Honda’s own efforts in this area. Already moving higher thanks to a U.S. sales rebound, this strike could end up giving HMC shares another boost.Story continuesLKQ Corporation (LKQ)7 Autonomous Vehicle Stocks to Drive You to the FutureSource: ShutterstockIt’s not only non-union automakers that could benefit from the UAW strike. For LKQ Corporation (NASDAQ:LKQ), a Chicago-based aftermarket auto parts distributor, this development may also end up being a catalyst.As a TipRanks commentator pointed out, when discussing possible strike-related tailwinds for LKQ stock, Stiffel analyst Michael Hoffman has argued that, just like how this company benefited from the pandemic supply chain disruptions, disruption in auto parts production related to the strike may have a similar impact.The caveat to this, though, is that this will only happen if this strike (for now limited to targeted work stoppages) increases, or if the strikes goes on longer-than-expected.Although some have argued this strike may persist, Ford’s aforementioned progress could signal a fast resolution. We should also note that LKQ has pulled back in recent months, after the company walked back full-year guidance.O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY)The front of an O'Reilly Auto Parts (ORLY) store.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comO’Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ:ORLY) is another non-automaker that could benefit from the UAW strike 2023.It all has to do with the possibility of ratified labor agreements between the union and legacy automakers resulting in higher vehicle prices.The spike in auto prices post-pandemic has already led to Americans holding onto their vehicles longer than ever. Another round of price increases resulting from the strike may mean this trend continues, with vehicles staying on the road for much longer compared to the past.In turn, this of course means greater demand for aftermarket auto parts.Hence, a tailwind is on the table for ORLY stock. As I’ve argued previously, ORLY is pricey, and could tumble if growth comes in short of expectations.However, factoring in this possible strike-related catalyst, O’Reilly may be able to sustain a level of growth necessarily to drive additional gains for the stock.Rivian Automotive (RIVN)rivn stock sign outside the company's HQ in Silicon ValleySource: Michael Vi / ShutterstockYou don’t have to dive too deeply to figure out why the UAW strike could help Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN).As you likely recall, the early-stage electric truck and van maker’s chief competitor is Ford (NYSE:F), which interestingly enough was an early investor in the company, but broke ties in order to pursue truck/van electrification on its own.Rising competition (including from Ford) has been a major concern among RIVN stock investors, yet said concern has eased more recently, following the release of a solid quarterly earnings report in August.Investor confidence could keep rising, if the near and long-term impact of the strike hinders Ford’s ability to grab a large share of the electric truck/van market.Although Rivian still has a lot to prove, the strike could enable it to ramp up production, tap into growing demand for electric trucks, scaling to profitability.Toyota Motor (TM)Toyota (TM) logo on the building of a dealership during daylightSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.comIf you’re looking for stocks to buy that may benefit from the auto strike, add Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM) to your watchlist. Like Honda, this Japanese automotive giant’s U.S. plants are non-union.The same possible benefits from this arrangement for Toyota’s long-time competitor in the U.S. market are also on tap.Perhaps, even more so. Toyota is the second largest automaker by U.S. market share, but GM has been gaining share at its expense recently. This could change if UAW negotiations lead to higher prices for GM, Ford, and Stellantis, enabling Toyota to better compete on price.As Goldman Sachs analyst Kota Yuzawa argued last month, Toyota’s EV potential is underappreciated by the market.This may now be especially the case, if the strikes hinder EV progress from the “Big Three.” A greater-than-expected EV ramp-up could drive a big boost down the road for TM stock.Tesla (TSLA)Tesla (TSLA) supercharging station during the day.Source: Arina P Habich / Shutterstock.comAmong non-union automakers, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) may benefit the most from the UAW strike.As the incumbent automakers have ramped-up their move to become primarily builders of EVs rather than gas-powered vehicles, the resultant rising competition has forced the EV market leader to cut prices, putting the squeeze on margins.Falling margins have made even some TSLA stock fans skeptical about its potential to sustain both the company’s rate of growth, as well as its share price. Trading for around 71 times earnings, which is a multiple leaps and about above that of incumbent automakers. Each of them trade for less than 10 times earnings.Still, if the strike sets back the “Detroit Three” in terms of labor costs/EV progress, while Tesla successfully brings down its manufacturing costs further, the company could remain the “king of EVs,” and TSLA could sustain its substantial valuation premium.Volkswagen (VWAGY)A Volkswagen (VWAGY) logo on a sign in Turkey.Source: multitel / Shutterstock.comThe UAW may have leverage over the Detroit automakers, but it has been unsuccessful in its organizing efforts at Volkswagen’s (OTCMKTS:VWAGY) U.S. production facility. A lack of U.S. labor troubles may not help the company gain more market share immediately.Yet when it comes to strike-related EV setbacks among Ford, GM, and Stellantis, there may be a potential benefit for this German-based automaker, and for VWAGY stock. Per current consensus, Volkswagen is falling behind both Tesla and China-based EV makers.However, while the jury’s still out as to whether VW can gain back lost ground in China, if the strike hinders the EV transformations of the unionized U.S. automakers, there may be opportunity for Volkswagen to capture a larger share of the American EV market. The European Union’s crackdown on Chinese-made EVs could also help Volkswagen sustain high market share in its home continent.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Thomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.More From InvestorPlaceMusk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

(NASDAQ:ADP) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. See our latest analysis for Automatic Data Processing The MethodWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$5.76bUS$5.97bUS$6.66bUS$6.49bUS$6.96bUS$7.21bUS$7.44bUS$7.66bUS$7.86bUS$8.06bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x3Analyst x3Analyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 3.65%Est @ 3.20%Est @ 2.88%Est @ 2.66%Est @ 2.51% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.6% US$5.4kUS$5.3kUS$5.5kUS$5.0kUS$5.1kUS$4.9kUS$4.8kUS$4.6kUS$4.4kUS$4.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$49bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$8.1b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.6%– 2.2%) = US$184bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$184b÷ ( 1 + 6.6%)10= US$97bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$146b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$241, the company appears quite undervalued at a 32% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Automatic Data Processing as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.894. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Automatic Data ProcessingStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Professional Services market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

(NASDAQ:PEP) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for PepsiCo PepsiCo Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Independent Director, Robert Pohlad, sold US$13m worth of shares at a price of US$174 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$169. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.Insiders in PepsiCo didn't buy any shares in the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeI will like PepsiCo better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insider OwnershipFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. PepsiCo insiders own 0.1% of the company, currently worth about US$311m based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The PepsiCo Insider Transactions Indicate?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded PepsiCo shares in the last quarter. While we feel good about high insider ownership of PepsiCo, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing PepsiCo.

141,c8769beb-f45d-329e-a201-34209f500d65,GPS,2023-10-02,"The Gap, Inc.'s (NYSE:GPS) On An Uptrend But Financial Prospects Look Pretty Weak: Is The Stock Overpriced?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gap-inc-nyse-gps-uptrend-121536199.html,1696162536,STORY,['GPS'],"[Gap (NYSE:GPS) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 20% over the last three months. However, in this article, we decided to focus on its weak fundamentals, as long-term financial performance of a business is what ultimately dictates market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on Gap's  ROE.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for Gap How To Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Gap is:4.8% = US$108m ÷ US$2.3b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.05 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Gap's Earnings Growth And 4.8% ROEOn the face of it, Gap's ROE is not much to talk about. A quick further study shows that the company's ROE doesn't compare favorably to the industry average of 19% either. For this reason, Gap's five year net income decline of 33% is not surprising given its lower ROE. However, there could also be other factors causing the earnings to decline. For example, it is possible that the business has allocated capital poorly or that the company has a very high payout ratio.Story continuesThat being said, we compared Gap's performance with the industry and were concerned when we found that while the company has shrunk its earnings, the industry has grown its earnings at a rate of 26% in the same 5-year period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is Gap fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.Is Gap Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?With a LTM (or last twelve month) payout ratio as high as 204%,Gap's shrinking earnings don't come as a surprise as the company is paying a dividend which is beyond its means. Its usually very hard to sustain dividend payments that are higher than reported profits.Additionally, Gap has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 45% over the next three years. The fact that the company's ROE is expected to rise to 24% over the same period is explained by the drop in the payout ratio.ConclusionIn total, we would have a hard think before deciding on any investment action concerning Gap. The low ROE, combined with the fact that the company is paying out almost if not all, of its profits as dividends, has resulted in the lack or absence of growth in its earnings. With that said, we studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that while the company has shrunk its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to grow in the future.
