The stock peaked in early 2022, right before the Federal Reserve began raising rates in a bid to get inflation back under control. Since then, shares have declined 31%.', ""The investment services firm has struggled with a deposit outflow, which it has historically utilized as a low-cost funding source for its business. More recently, deposit outflows have slowed, and the prospect of falling interest rates would be a welcome development for Charles Schwab. However, is that enough to make the stock a buy? Here's what you should consider first."", 'Charles Schwab provides various financial services for customers, including banking, asset and wealth management, and brokerage services. The company focuses on a low-cost, customer-centric approach to doing business. It has historically been a strong-performing financial stock thanks to its prudent approach to credit and efficient operations.', ""One essential part of its efficient business model is its deposits. These deposits have served as a low-cost funding base for the company and have been crucial to its longer-term success. However, rapidly rising interest rates, like those we experienced throughout 2022, have weighed heavily on Schwab's business."", ""Many of Schwab's deposits are in clients' savings accounts and are balances they have yet to invest. However, rising interest rates have led its clients to move deposits from lower-yielding accounts into higher-yielding alternatives, such as high-yield savings or money market funds."", 'From August 2022 to March 2023, Schwab lost $45.2 billion in deposits, averaging a pace of $5.6 billion per month. This ""client cash-sorting"" phenomenon resulted in a double-downgrade by analysts at Bank of America in early 2022, and this occurred well before any banking turmoil stemming from the failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB Financial\'s subsidiary) and other regional banks.', ""One positive sign for investors is that the pace of Schwab's deposit outflows is moderating. From June through December, the company's deposits continue to decline, although at a slower pace of $1.1 billion per month."", ""Despite falling deposits, Schwab continues to do well in accumulating client assets and incorporating its acquisition of TD Ameritrade. In 2023, the company added $306 billion in core net new assets, including $43 billion in December alone. Total client assets are now $8.5 trillion, up from $7 trillion the year before, thanks to inflows and positive market returns. This growing asset base is vital to Schwab's long-term growth and increasing its management and administration fees, which were raised 12.8% during the year."", 'Schwab will likely continue dealing with client cash-sorting until the Federal Reserve decreases its benchmark interest rate. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, the market is pricing in four interest rate cuts for the year.Schwab would welcome these rate cuts. Higher rates have weighed on its net interest revenue, which fell 11.7% year over year.', ""According to management, lower interest rates could alleviate cash-sorting woes and help it improve its net interest margin to 3% by the end of 2025. However, that assumes that inflation continues to get closer to the Federal Reserve's 2% target."", ""Charles Schwab stock presents an attractive investment opportunity for value investors. Its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 25.3 is right at its 10-year average. However, its forward P/E ratio, based on next year's earnings, is 18.6 and reflects that analysts expect earnings growth from the financial services company over the next year."", ""Charles Schwab stock could continue to experience volatility as interest rates stay elevated. Markets had priced in March rate cuts for several months, but continuing hot economic data has pushed those expectations back to June. However, Schwab's cheap valuation and potential tailwinds from falling interest rates make it a solid stock to buy today and add to as the year progresses."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Charles Schwab right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Charles Schwab, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Charles Schwab wasn’t one of them.

Here are three stocks that are set to increase their cash payouts in the coming years.', ""Persistent inflation is driving consumers to seek bargains wherever they can. Increasingly, they're turning to Walmart (NYSE: WMT) for groceries and other everyday essentials. The discount retailer's reputation for low prices is allowing it to capture more market share from its higher-cost rivals."", 'Walmart is the 800-pound gorilla in the $850 billion U.S. grocery industry, with a market share of roughly 25%. Its entrenched position as a leading provider of value-priced food and other household staples drives strong, repeat traffic to its stores.', ""Despite the ubiquity of Walmart's stores -- 90% of the U.S. population resides within 10 miles of one of them -- management sees room for further expansion. The company plans to open over 150 big-box locations during the next five years."", 'Importantly, Walmart has also become a formidable force in online retail. Rising demand for curbside pickup and delivery services drove its e-commerce sales up by 23% in the fourth quarter and above $100 billion in 2023.', ""Advertising is another promising growth driver. Walmart's high-margin global ad sales leaped 28% to $3.4 billion in 2023. The retailer's pending acquisition of TV maker Vizio should help broaden its offerings to advertisers by expanding its connected-TV services."", ""With multiple paths to profit growth, Walmart should have little trouble extending its impressive 51-year streak of annual dividend increases. The retail Goliath's shares currently yield a solid 1.4%."", 'Steadily growing cash payouts are also the domain of Waste Management (NYSE: WM), which does business these days as WM. The company is the leading provider of garbage collection and recycling services in North America. Yet a large portion of its future profits will be derived from a business you might not expect.', ""WM's landfill network stretches across the U.S. and parts of Canada. Strict regulation, together with opposition from homeowners, makes it difficult to build new waste facilities. These obstacles form a wide competitive moat around WM's business. They also enable the garbage king to steadily raise prices."", ""In addition to profits, the company's waste sites produce an increasingly valuable form of energy. Gases are produced as organic matter decomposes in landfills. WM is investing in technology that converts this biogas into renewable natural gas (RNG). It's easy to see why. Switching from diesel to RNG can help WM cost-effectively fuel its garbage trucks while slashing fleet emissions by up to 80%. Better still, adding an RNG plant can boost a disposal site's profitability by as much as 75%."", 'Additionally, with governments and businesses intensifying their decarbonization efforts, demand for RNG is projected to outpace supply until at least 2030. WM, in turn, expects to generate $450 million in annual free cash flow from its RNG operations by 2026. For context, the company produced a total of $1.9 billion in free cash flow in 2023.', ""With renewable energy set to power WM's expansion, investors can expect the company to further its 21-year streak of annual dividend raises well into the future. The trash titan's well-funded cash payout places its yield at a dependable 1.5%."", ""If you'd like to earn even more dividend income, take a look at Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) and its nearly 5% yield. The venerable automaker has an under-the-radar profit driver that many investors are overlooking. Their mistake could be your opportunity."", 'Ford is preparing for an electrified future. Its all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup was named the 2023 North American Truck of the Year, based on its innovative design, safety features, performance metrics, and relative value. The F-150 Lightning was also the best-selling electric truck in the U.S. last year.', ""While Ford's EV business is promising for its growth potential, gas-powered vehicles remain a key source of profits. Ford Blue, the division that houses the company's traditional combustible engine and hybrid vehicles, generated an operating profit of $7.5 billion in 2023."", ""Yet it's Ford Pro that could soon become the auto giant's most valuable business. The fast-growing segment contains Ford's commercial and government fleet operations, along with its software and services offerings. Ford Pro's operating profits more than doubled to $7.2 billion last year. Management sees that figure climbing as high as $9 billion in 2024."", ""CEO Jim Farley thinks investors are undervaluing Ford Pro and, by extension, Ford's stock. Buy today, and you can claim some of the auto leader's shares while they're still trading for a bargain price."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Ford Motor Company right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Ford Motor Company, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Ford Motor Company wasn’t one of them.

The plunge began when Walmart announced it was buying Roku competitor Vizio, and then it continued after Roku released its earnings report last week. It's now down 30% since the year started, erasing much of its 2023 gains."", ""Ever the contrarian, Ark Invest's Cathie Wood has been taking advantage of the plunging price to scoop up shares of Roku stock. Should investors follow her lead?"", 'Roku is known for its streaming devices, but it makes most of its money from its platform segment, which is mostly ad revenue. It features ads on its free channels, and platform revenue accounted for 87% of the total in 2023.', ""In all, Roku's revenue increased 14% year over year, with strong performance in both segments. It added 10 million new active accounts in 2023 for a total of 80 million, and streaming hours increased sequentially as well as 21% more than last year."", ""There are many reasons to believe this is the future of content viewing and streaming, and the advertising model could unlock high revenue and profits in the coming year. According to Nielsen, traditional TV viewing hours fell 16% from last year in the 2023 fourth quarter, while Roku's viewing hours increased 21%. This includes all hours on Roku's operating system."", ""Roku features hundreds of channels available to watch on its devices, and it has partnerships with most of the major streaming networks. Viewing hours on its free Roku channel increased 63% year over year in the fourth quarter, and that's important because it can fill the ad slots for all of these hours through deals with advertisers that are looking to catch viewers."", ""There are more indications that Roku still has a large, under-tapped opportunity. Roku's average viewing hours per active account increased from 3.8 last year to 4.1 this year, and the average for traditional TV is 7.5 hours. Viewers are still switching over, and Roku is well-positioned to capture a lot of this market."", ""However, in the current environment, advertisers are still curtailing their budgets. That's hurting Roku's business right now, and average revenue per user (ARPU) is declining because active accounts are increasing at a faster pace than ad spending. But if inflation moderates and interest rates are cut as expected, it should eventually catch up."", ""As for the Walmart/Vizio acquisition, investors could be scared of Roku facing stiff competition from a name like Walmart. Vizio is a small player compared with Roku, with 2% of streaming hours vs. 8% for Roku. But Walmart's brand and scale could level the playing field. However, Roku has faced competition from other big names, notably Amazon, and it remains the top player."", 'Cathie Wood loves disruptive technology, which is the theme behind her investment firm. ARK Invest offers several exchange-traded funds (ETF) that focus on different areas. ARK has been buying Roku stock for the Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSEMKT: ARKW) and the Fintech Innovation ETF (NYSEMKT: ARKF). Both of these ETFs have outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year, almost doubling its gain.', 'At its current price, Roku stock trades at a price-to-sales ratio of 2.6, which is a bargain if you believe that Roku has a massive opportunity.', ""Cathie Wood's ETF's underwhelmed over the past few years when the market switched to safer stocks, but now that it's embracing growth stocks again in this bull market, her picks are outperforming."", ""There's risk with Roku as it fends off competition and tries to become more efficient and profitable. But it has a long growth runway and has been profitable at scale, and that's likely to continue when macroeconomic conditions are more favorable. If you have some tolerance for risk, Roku looks like a bargain that should reward patient shareholders over time."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Roku right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Roku, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Roku wasn’t one of them.

The warehouse automation company's shares started trading at $10.54, rallied over the following year, and closed at a record high of $63.54 on July 31, 2023."", 'The bull case for Symbotic was easy to understand. Its autonomous robots processed pallets and cases more efficiently than human workers, and it claimed that a $50 million investment in just one of its modules (which bundle together its robots and software) could generate $250 million in lifetime savings\xa0over 25 years.', ""Symbotic was also backed by the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank (OTC: SFTB.Y), which owned the SPAC it merged with, and Walmart (NYSE: WMT), which took an 11% stake\xa0in the company. From fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2023 (which ended last September), the company's revenue rose at a stunning compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 116%\xa0-- and analysts expect it to continue growing at a CAGR of 44% from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026."", ""Symbotic's stock has pulled back to about $40 as of this writing, but it's still notched a gain of roughly 280% in less than two years. It might still have room to run, but investors should keep these three things in mind before joining the bulls."", ""In fiscal 2023, Symbotic generated 88% of its revenue from its Master Automation Agreement (MAA) with Walmart. That deal will last until 2034 and aims to automate all 42 of Walmart's U.S. regional distribution centers."", 'Walmart\'s stake in Symbotic also gives it a lot of power over the company\'s decisions. Walmart can designate one of its senior employees to attend all of Symbotic\'s board meetings in a nonvoting capacity, while Symbotic is obligated to notify Walmart if it explores any deals that impact more than 25% of its total voting power. Walmart\'s partnership also bars Symbotic from ever providing its services to an unnamed ""specified company"" -- which sounds a lot like its top competitor, Amazon.', ""Symbotic serves other customers, like Target, Albertsons, and C&S Wholesale, but its overwhelming dependence on Walmart can't be ignored. If it doesn't meaningfully expand its customer base beyond Walmart before it finishes automating all its domestic warehouses, its sales growth will abruptly stall out."", ""Last year, Symbotic formed a warehouse-as-a-service joint venture with SoftBank called GreenBox. Symbotic owns 35% of GreenBox, while SoftBank's subsidiary owns the remaining 65%. GreenBox will exclusively purchase its systems from Symbotic through a $7.5 billion contract that started in fiscal 2024 and will last six years."", ""Symbotic believes GreenBox's modules could generate more than $500 million in annual recurring revenue once fully installed. That would be equivalent to about 14% of its projected revenue for fiscal 2026."", ""That sounds like a promising step toward diversifying its top line away from Walmart, but Symbotic is still relying on SoftBank -- its other top investor -- to accomplish that. Symbotic's own exposure to GreenBox as an investment could also backfire if the joint venture fails to carve a meaningful niche with its automated warehouse services."", ""At first glance, Symbotic's enterprise value of $2.97 billion looks cheap at 1.7 times this year's sales. However, its dual-class structure -- which grants founder Rick Cohen\xa0a 75% stake -- inflates its actual market cap to $22.9 billion."", ""Based on that market cap, Symbotic's stock doesn't look like a bargain at 13 times this year's sales. But it also isn't too expensive if you believe more companies will automate their warehouses with Symbotic's modules. Precedence Research expects the global warehouse automation market to expand at a CAGR of 16% from 2023 to 2032."", ""Symbotic's customer concentration issues, lack of profits on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, and high valuation make it a risky stock to own. That's probably why its insiders sold about 7 times as many shares as they bought over the past three months and why 10% of its outstanding shares were still being shorted at the end of January."", ""That said, Symbotic could eventually evolve into a more diversified warehouse automation company and generate stable long-term growth if it expands its customer base beyond Walmart and SoftBank. As economies of scale kick in, its profitability could improve, making it a more reliable growth stock. In other words, Symbotic's stock is still a decent speculative play -- but investors shouldn't be too surprised if it gets cut in half before it doubles."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Symbotic right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Symbotic, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Symbotic wasn’t one of them.

Despite their modest sizes, small businesses have added over 12.9 million jobs in the past 25 years.\xa0', 'Since entrepreneurship relies heavily on establishing trust with customers, a study by the Better Business Bureau found that 82% of American consumers consider trust fundamental for a successful business. To delve deeper into this, ZenBusiness conducted research using data from the Better Business Bureau, mapping out the trustworthiness of businesses across major cities and states in the USA.', 'According to the study, smaller states tend to have higher percentages of trusted businesses. States like North Dakota, Minnesota, Maine, and Alaska ranked among the top due to their smaller populations fostering strong community bonds. This close-knit environment encourages businesses to uphold their promises and prioritize customer satisfaction, as word-of-mouth travels fast in these areas. To read about small cities with similar culture, see 20 Best Small Cities to Live in the US.', ""Conversely, states like Nevada, Utah, California, and New York exhibited lower percentages of trusted businesses. Factors such as Nevada's gambling-centric industry and other regional nuances contribute to this trend. Moreover, industries like car dealerships often struggle with low trust ratings, while sectors such as banking thrive in states like North Dakota, New Mexico, and Hawaii, where they enjoy perfect trust scores, highlighting the significance of trust in consumer-business relationships."", 'Moreover, in 2014, Honest Tea conducted a countrywide social experiment to evaluate honesty in drink purchases which revealed intriguing statistics.

This suggests that while shoppers may have spent a little less per visit, they continued to patronize Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) frequently, showcasing a sustained level of trust and reliance on the company for their shopping needs. Additionally, Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT)’s online sales saw sizable growth, with a 17% increase in US online sales and a 23% jump in global online sales, surpassing $100 billion.

If that deal goes through, it turns one of Roku's biggest retail partners into a deep-pocketed competitor. Advertising makes up a major share of Roku's platform segment, which now accounts for more than 85% of the company's top line. Walmart wants in on that advertising opportunity."", ""However, the Needham analyst thinks the dynamics of the Walmart-Vizio deal would actually result in a net positive outcome for Roku. Martin cited Roku's market-leading position as an advantage as the company would face less competition overall for connected-TV advertising dollars. She also noted increased exposure for Roku and less competition from Vizio at other major retailers as a result of the deal."", ""Per Warren Buffett's famous advice, this appears to be a situation where fearful investors have created a buying opportunity. Roku's free cash flow generation increased steadily in the second half of 2023, and the company says that will continue in 2024 -- the same goes for its revenue growth.

It would certainly build confidence if the company’s chief executive is also a shareholder. Even beyond that, the INTC stock outlook indicates improvement, albeit not perfection, so a small-sized allocation isn’t a terrible idea.', 'We’ve caught wind of discussion about whether Intel\xa0is the “next” Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). There’s no need to obsess over comparisons like this, though. Intel can make strides in 2024 even if it’s not in the same league as a juggernaut like Nvidia. All in all, Intel stock probably shouldn’t be everyone’s first-choice chip stock, but it still earns a respectable “B” grade.', 'Some investors were disappointed with Intel after the company released its current-quarter guidance. Wall Street called for revenue of $14.2 billion, but Intel’s guidance range of $12.2 billion to $13.2 billion fell short of the consensus estimate.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Yet, CEO Pat Gelsinger remains confident in Intel’s growth prospects. In fact, Gelsinger reportedly bought 2,800 INTC stock shares through a trust for $119,700 on Feb. 1.', 'Perhaps, Gelsinger envisions Intel making strides in the highly competitive AI-chip market. Currently, some analysts remain unconvinced. For example, Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer feels that Intel’s AI offering is still in “prove-it” mode, while Needham analyst Hans Mosesmann warned, “AI everywhere seems like everywhere except Intel.”', 'But at least we can say that Gelsinger is putting his money where his mouth is. There are no guarantees, but it’s at least possible that Intel\xa0will show progress against its rivals in advancing the company’s AI-enabled chips.', 'In early 2024, we can already see Intel facing challenges. Frustratingly, Intel is delaying the construction of its Ohio-based chip-manufacturing facilities. Whereas Intel’s previous timetable specified late 2025, now it appears that the construction won’t be completed until late 2026.', 'Not all the news is negative, however. Research firm Gartner envisions a potential catalyst for Intel\\ as rapid AI personal computer industry growth.', 'Amazingly, Gartner estimates that smartphone manufacturers will ship out 240 million generative-AI smartphones in 2024. The research firm expects vendors to ship out 54.5 million AI-enabled PCs this year.', 'This phenomenon could alter the PC landscape and revitalize the industry. Gartner Senior Director Analyst Ranjit Atwal explained, “The rapid adoption of on-device GenAI capabilities and AI processors will eventually become a standard requirement for technology vendors.”', 'This presents Intel with an opportunity to capitalize on a burgeoning niche market. Prospective investors should keep tabs on Intel for signs of progress in advancing and commercializing AI-PC chips. The company doesn’t need to be the “next Nvidia,” but Intel can at least capture market share wherever it’s possible.', 'Our INTC stock outlook doesn’t call for the same magnitude of gains that you should expect from a juggernaut like Nvidia. Investors should have realistic expectations and just look for signs of improvement with Intel.', 'For what it’s worth, Intel’s chief executive is also a shareholder. Plus, if there’s a revival in the PC market because of the AI-PC trend, Intel may capture some market share. Therefore, while it doesn’t deserve the same confidence level as Nvidia stock, we’re willing to give Intel stock a “B” grade.', 'On the date of publication, neither Louis\xa0Navellier nor the InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article held (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.', 'ChatGPT IPO Could Shock the World, Make This Move Before the Announcement', 'Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

If you want to skip our overview of Fisher, his investment firm, and the broader U.S. stock market and macroeconomic environment, then you can take a look at Ken Fisher Portfolio: 5 Biggest Positions. "", ""Ken Fisher is one of the richest people in the world courtesy of his hedge fund Fisher Asset Management. The fund had $203 billion in investments spread across its portfolio according to filings with the SEC. Fisher set up his hedge fund nearly five decades ago in 1979 and served as its CEO until 2016 before relinquishing the role. Right now, he's the Executive Chairman of Fisher Investments and holds the title of co-chief investment officer along with Jeff Silk."", ""A $203 billion investment portfolio is no small achievement, even if the highly risky nature of the hedge fund industry sees the biggest players such as Ken Griffin's Citadel and Seth Klarman's Baupost often take leverage to fund their bets and double their returns. Investment portfolios of this size mean that not only do Fisher Investment's clients have to trust the firm, but also that the hedge fund has to demonstrate that it is able to outperform either the market or the economy or at least serve as a buffer against sharp capital depreciation during times of economic turmoil."", 'The start of the year is the tone setting mood for stock markets, and for Fisher Investments, the year did not miss out on a beat after the firm had to jump in to release an unusual press release. This press release countered a report by the Wall Street Journal that had stated that Ken Fisher\'s firm, over which he holds 100% control through a trust that he shares with his wife, was being sold to the Boston, Massachusetts based private equity firm Advent International. The WSJ was not the only publication that cited anonymous sources for its report, as Bloomberg also published a similar piece which outlined that Advent had had talks to\xa0 ""acquire billionaire Ken Fisher\'s eponymous Fisher Investments, according to a person with knowledge of the matter"" but also went on to quote Fisher Investment\'s response that bluntly denied any such speculation.', ""In fact Fisher's firm, which is quite widely covered in the press and is known for its founder's ability to generate buzz, was quite hard hitting its response. Its press release bluntly stated:"", 'Fisher Investments is not being bought by Advent International, or anyone else—plain and simple.', ""The story also had numerous other inaccuracies. Had The Wall Street Journal's reporters bothered to verify the facts, we would have corrected their reporting. Instead, The Wall Street Journal printed the rumors first and followed up with us last."", ""The WSJ's coverage had speculated that not only was Advent having 'talks' to acquire Fisher Investments, but that the hedge fund might see other partners emerge for a deal. Reading Fisher's press release, while it did deny that a transaction was not officially underway, the text nevertheless missed out on sharing any details of potential 'talks' - leading to the assumption that since there were no talks for a potential sale, there was no need to deny them in the press release."", ""Moving forward to other news in 2024, the year has started off by providing investors with the latest data set to read the tea leaves and see where the Federal Reserve's current interest rate hiking cycle will be at the year's close. This data set is the retail sales for January which showed an 0.8% annual drop that came as part of a release that saw the Commerce Department also revise down the data for December."", 'On the surface, this data paints a softer picture of the economy that shows that as consumers face the pinch of high interest rates, they are starting to cut down their spending. However, economists also preached caution after the release, as they speculated that while it is possible that a spending, and by extension economic, slump had led to the sales falling, the contribution of cold temperatures across the U.S. could not be completely ignored in the aftermath of the release.', ""However, and as has been the case for more than a year now, the optimistic data set was followed by the exact opposite just a day later. On Friday, data from the Labor Department revealed that import prices jumped by 0.8% in January, which was the high reading since the first quarter of 2022. In short, nearly a two year old record of an inflationary indicator was broken, and perhaps unsurprisingly, when paired by the producer price index (PPI)'s 0.3% jump in January, futures linked to the S&P 500 and other indexes dropped."", 'With the fourth quarter hedge fund filing season well on its way, we decided to see which stocks Fisher Investments is piling into as the year gets off to a roaring start.

Initially, investors anticipated multiple interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve over the year, with expectations of the first cut occurring in March. However, in light of a string of favorable economic indicators, the Fed has signaled that a rate cut in March is unlikely. As a result, investors are recalibrating their assessments of stocks and bonds, anticipating fewer rate cuts to commence at a later date than previously anticipated.', ""The Commerce Department's report on economic growth reveals a 3.1% year-over-year expansion in the fourth quarter of 2023, fueled by robust consumer spending in sectors like healthcare, dining, and automobiles.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on establishing a retirement living overseas, you may go to 5 Safest Places to Retire Abroad for Less Than $3,000 a Month.', 'Upwards of $10,000. That’s not the cost of a year at college or a year’s worth of rent. According to BuzzFeed Inc. (NASDAQ:BZFD) owned Huffpost, it’s the estimated cost of moving abroad. The BuzzFeed Inc. (NASDAQ:BZFD) backed publication details this figure to include the cost of overseas shipping, securing visas, setting up your documents and finances - such as your driver’s license and money wires from the US - housing, insurance, air travel, and a whole host of other things.\xa0', 'With a $10,000 - or larger - investment on the line, you might think that the number of Americans moving abroad is in the smaller pools. However, these one-time costs don’t seem to have deterred US citizens, presumably as they pale in contrast to the benefits of some of the best countries to relocate to. The Association of American Residents Overseas estimates that a minimum of 5.4 million Americans live beyond the States as of 2023. A good portion of them are retirees.\xa0', 'While a vacation abroad may seem magical, permanently moving to another country can certainly be daunting. So then why do so many American citizens - the Wall Street Journal, a division of News Corp (NASDAQ:NWS), reported that as many as 450,000 retirees received their social security benefits in foreign countries - retire abroad? With this News Corp (NASDAQ:NWS) number already presumed to have grown, the reasons are multi fold.\xa0', 'Generally speaking, retirees are keen on peaceful, safe living. In many cases, they’re also one for living life on a budget, often finding cheap things to do in retirement. While patriots may point out the many wonderful things that the US has to offer, making an argument over how safe it is easily falls short. In a safe countries survey conducted by U.S. News and World Report, the US missed the top 10 - and 20 and 30 - mark, coming in at number 46 out of a total of 87 countries. Instead, it was mainly the European continent that triumphed. Similarly, the US received a disappointing 131st position on the recent Global Peace Index, reported the Miami Herald.\xa0', 'Things are not much better on the financial side either. For retirees spending their days living on Social Security check to Social Security check, their monthly budget comes out to a mere $1,909 based on the Social Security Administration’s Social Security payout for 2024. With average rental numbers at $1,568 for one-bedroom apartments in the US according to Zillow Inc (NASDAQ:Z), this doesn’t leave much behind for utilities, groceries, healthcare, travel, and the like. Of course, Zillow Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) also lists cheaper rental options - such as average one-bedroom rent being $850 for Iowa City and $725 for West Virginia - these cheaper options often come with problems of their own and are not accessible to everyone.\xa0', ""As such, the thought process behind the retiree's decision to spend their Golden Years abroad suddenly becomes clear.\xa0"", 'To assist senior citizens in the move abroad, we have compiled the following list of the safest places to retire abroad for less than $3,000 a month.\xa0', 'Malgorzata Drewniak/Shutterstock.com', 'To compile this list of the 17 safest places to retire abroad for less than $3,000 a month, we consulted several sources including our lists of 15 Cheapest and Safest Countries to Retire In and 25 Best Cities Where You Can Retire On $3,000 A Month, and Nomad Capitalist, Live and Invest Overseas, U.S. News and World Report, and Global Citizen Solutions. Once a list of countries was shortlisted using these sources, we then ranked them across multiple factors, namely, the Institute for Economics and Peace’s Global Peace Index, the Environmental Performance Index, their average cost of living, and their average monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment. For the cost of living and rent, multiple sources were consulted, including expat opinions on forums such as Reddit and Quora. Whereas for the Global Peace Index, countries with a rank of below 80 were removed.\xa0', 'As the safety of a country is determined both by how peaceful it is and by how healthy its environment is, we have included the Environmental Performance Index to provide a holistic picture. For this index, a score of 100 depicts a perfect score. Each country was then awarded a cumulative score, with the highest-scoring country being awarded the number one rank. For countries that gained an equal score, their Global Peace Index ranking was used as a tie-breaker. Since we based research on a country basis due to many indices only being available at the country level, we then selected a specific city or town for each of our finalized 17 countries. The selection process for each city included consulting several sources, such as articles, public forums, and ranking lists, with the criteria of ‘safe’ and ‘affordable’ being used. The resulting list is presented in ascending order, with the highest-ranked place being presented last.\xa0 It is important to remember that personal preference plays a big part. The best course of action is to visit the place you plan to move to, converse with locals, take advice from a financial consultant, and only then make your final decision.\xa0', 'By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

', ""The start of 2024 for the stock market is more of the same. The first month of the year saw investors turn their attention to the Federal Reserve as usual in order to set expectations for the remainder of 2024. The Fed, if you're unaware, has been rapidly raising interest rates to combat inflation. Now that inflation has started to drop, Wall Street is eager to know when rates will start to drop, and on this front, ironically, the economy is proving to be the biggest hurdle in forcing the Fed's hand."", ""Higher interest rates increase the cost of doing business and restrict consumer access to capital. This means that firms have a tougher time posting both revenue and earnings growth, and when their figures don't grow, neither does the economy. However, since the American economy continues to outshine peers, the Fed has more leeway to keep rates higher and deflate Wall Street's balloon that had become accustomed to easy money after the 2008 Great Recession and the more recent coronavirus pandemic."", ""At the same time, even as rates are high, the stock market is still continuing to impress. In fact, bears have been left rather red faced as major indexes such as the NASDAQ Composite and the S&P 500 have continued to soar despite the depressing effects that high interest rates have on stock valuation. In fact, despite the tepid interest rate environment, it's the S&P 500 that has once again proven that no matter how shrewd analysts are, they can still miss out on major trends."", 'This is because the flagship Wall Street stock index which contains the crown jewels of the American stock market set a new all time record in February 2024 when it soared above 5,000 points for the first time in its history.

Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, and NVIDIA's shares are up by 7.64%, 35%, 13%, and 49.7%, year to date, respectively. This shows that even though small cap stocks that are often touted for their ability to deliver double digit and higher percentage returns, major stocks the likes of some of the magnificent seven that we've talked about above can also stun everyone given the market and economic contexts align in their favor."", 'Before we head on to the best major stocks to buy, another big news for these stocks this year has come from Meta.

If you want to skip our overview of Fisher, his investment firm, and the broader U.S. stock market and macroeconomic environment, then you can take a look at Ken Fisher Portfolio: 5 Biggest Positions. "", ""Ken Fisher is one of the richest people in the world courtesy of his hedge fund Fisher Asset Management. The fund had $203 billion in investments spread across its portfolio according to filings with the SEC. Fisher set up his hedge fund nearly five decades ago in 1979 and served as its CEO until 2016 before relinquishing the role. Right now, he's the Executive Chairman of Fisher Investments and holds the title of co-chief investment officer along with Jeff Silk."", ""A $203 billion investment portfolio is no small achievement, even if the highly risky nature of the hedge fund industry sees the biggest players such as Ken Griffin's Citadel and Seth Klarman's Baupost often take leverage to fund their bets and double their returns. Investment portfolios of this size mean that not only do Fisher Investment's clients have to trust the firm, but also that the hedge fund has to demonstrate that it is able to outperform either the market or the economy or at least serve as a buffer against sharp capital depreciation during times of economic turmoil."", 'The start of the year is the tone setting mood for stock markets, and for Fisher Investments, the year did not miss out on a beat after the firm had to jump in to release an unusual press release. This press release countered a report by the Wall Street Journal that had stated that Ken Fisher\'s firm, over which he holds 100% control through a trust that he shares with his wife, was being sold to the Boston, Massachusetts based private equity firm Advent International. The WSJ was not the only publication that cited anonymous sources for its report, as Bloomberg also published a similar piece which outlined that Advent had had talks to\xa0 ""acquire billionaire Ken Fisher\'s eponymous Fisher Investments, according to a person with knowledge of the matter"" but also went on to quote Fisher Investment\'s response that bluntly denied any such speculation.', ""In fact Fisher's firm, which is quite widely covered in the press and is known for its founder's ability to generate buzz, was quite hard hitting its response. Its press release bluntly stated:"", 'Fisher Investments is not being bought by Advent International, or anyone else—plain and simple.', ""The story also had numerous other inaccuracies. Had The Wall Street Journal's reporters bothered to verify the facts, we would have corrected their reporting. Instead, The Wall Street Journal printed the rumors first and followed up with us last."", ""The WSJ's coverage had speculated that not only was Advent having 'talks' to acquire Fisher Investments, but that the hedge fund might see other partners emerge for a deal. Reading Fisher's press release, while it did deny that a transaction was not officially underway, the text nevertheless missed out on sharing any details of potential 'talks' - leading to the assumption that since there were no talks for a potential sale, there was no need to deny them in the press release."", ""Moving forward to other news in 2024, the year has started off by providing investors with the latest data set to read the tea leaves and see where the Federal Reserve's current interest rate hiking cycle will be at the year's close. This data set is the retail sales for January which showed an 0.8% annual drop that came as part of a release that saw the Commerce Department also revise down the data for December."", 'On the surface, this data paints a softer picture of the economy that shows that as consumers face the pinch of high interest rates, they are starting to cut down their spending. However, economists also preached caution after the release, as they speculated that while it is possible that a spending, and by extension economic, slump had led to the sales falling, the contribution of cold temperatures across the U.S. could not be completely ignored in the aftermath of the release.', ""However, and as has been the case for more than a year now, the optimistic data set was followed by the exact opposite just a day later. On Friday, data from the Labor Department revealed that import prices jumped by 0.8% in January, which was the high reading since the first quarter of 2022. In short, nearly a two year old record of an inflationary indicator was broken, and perhaps unsurprisingly, when paired by the producer price index (PPI)'s 0.3% jump in January, futures linked to the S&P 500 and other indexes dropped."", 'With the fourth quarter hedge fund filing season well on its way, we decided to see which stocks Fisher Investments is piling into as the year gets off to a roaring start. Some notable names are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon.com, Inc.

Shares of the productivity software and cloud computing specialist have gained 63% over the past year, more than twice the 27% gains of the S&P 500. To kick off 2024, Microsoft's market cap has soared above $3 trillion, making it the most valuable company in the world (as of this writing)."", ""What makes this all the more remarkable is that much of the gains were the result of Microsoft's decision to embrace generative artificial intelligence (AI) early on. Yet some investors are leery of joining the rally that has come so far so fast -- especially given the increased volatility that seemingly comes with AI stocks."", ""What does this mean for investors who sat out Microsoft's current sprint higher? Should they buy now in hopes of additional gains or ignore the stock because of its somewhat pricey valuation? Let's see what the evidence reveals."", ""It's hard to deny the impact of AI thus far, as many of the world's biggest companies are jumping in with both feet. There's no way to know for sure how far AI could go, but it's clear there's a massive opportunity for businesses with the know-how and resources to deploy it -- and Microsoft is leading the charge."", 'Soon after taking a hefty stake in ChatGPT parent OpenAI, Microsoft stunned the tech world with the debut of Copilot -- a suite of AI assistants deeply integrated into Microsoft Office products and designed to make users more productive. Copilot can summarize emails and draft responses in Outlook, create presentations from existing data in PowerPoint, quickly create pivot tables in Excel, and draft, edit, and review documents in Word. Beyond Office, there are Copilots designed for developers, sales departments, medical professionals, cybersecurity, and much more. Furthermore, the uptick in productivity noted by users has been dramatic.', 'It\'s still early days, but the estimates are staggering. CFO Amy Hood said, ""The next-generation AI business will be the fastest-growing $10 billion business in our history."" Dan Loeb, founder of hedge fund Third Point, estimates that Copilot could ""increase [Microsoft\'s] revenue by as much as $25 billion or more."" Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne is even more bullish, suggesting that generative AI could generate incremental revenue of $100 billion for Microsoft by 2027.', 'Let\'s not forget Microsoft Azure, its cloud computing business. Being the world\'s second-largest cloud infrastructure provider puts Microsoft in the perfect position to sell cloud-based AI services to its users. During its fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Dec. 31), Azure grew 30% year over year, outpacing both Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Alphabet\'s Google Cloud, which grew 13% and 26%, respectively. Microsoft noted Azure\'s growth included ""six points of growth from AI services.""', ""Once upon a time, Microsoft's more personal computing segment represented roughly one-third of the company's revenue.

The stock is currently selling for 35 times forward earnings, compared to the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of roughly 28 for the S&P 500. While that might seem pricey to some, I'd suggest it's remarkably reasonable, given the company's growth prospects.

The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Microsoft as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.016. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model.

Over the last five years, there's been epic sales growth -- up nearly 2,000% to nearly $1.15 billion over the last 12-month reported stretch."", 'For all the knowledge we possess today about liquid chemical concoctions perhaps not being so good for us, the global energy drink market is still a growth market anticipated to outpace economic expansion by a wide margin. Constant ""innovation"" in flavors and ingredients is to blame. (Right now, I\'m sipping a Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) ""made with AI"" -- such are the times we live in!) We young consumers like our variety and change.', ""And yet, energy drinks are a fiercely competitive field, dominated by big players Red Bull and Monster Beverage (NASDAQ: MNST). Celsius has some oddities in its history, and there have been plenty of doubts its epic rise was even possible. Despite some of my own doubts that it will continue, I recently bought a small starter position. Here's why."", ""Besides the whole secular growth trend favoring energy drinks and caffeinated beverages, there's another simple reason I decided to buy a little Celsius. After holding Disney (NYSE: DIS) for well over a decade (around the time a younger and just-as-nerdy version of me was excited about the company launching a new era of Star Wars), it was high time to part ways."", ""I recently sold all my Disney stock. For a holding that old in my portfolio, it was an egregious underperformer. This was an exit I've been planning for over a year, and Celsius is but one consumer-facing stock I decided to buy as a replacement."", 'Consumer goods don\'t exactly dominate my attention these days -- semiconductors and accelerated computing do, thus the choice of a ""Coke AI"" as an afternoon pick-me-up. So, it was time to brush up on Celsius\' history again.', 'The last time I took a hard look was in 2022, when PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) was investing in Celsius in exchange for becoming a distribution partner in the U.S. Pepsi scored a $550 million investment in brand-new convertible preferred stock that pays out a 5% annual dividend. We ordinary shareholders get no such dividend from Celsius. At the time, it seemed like Pepsi was landing a deal to scoop up most of the profitability from any future Celsius growth.', 'Now, what I do know is that marketing a hot consumer brand is key, but the food and beverage industry is also largely dominated by big distributors. After all, part of Monster\'s wildly successful run (including a name change from ""Hansen Natural"" to Monster back in 2012) has been at least partly attributable to its distribution partnership with titan Coca-Cola. But Celsius signing on with Pepsi in exchange for a big equity slice didn\'t excite me. I was wrong.', ""Plugging into PepsiCo's distribution has worked wonders for Celsius -- Pepsi has accounted for nearly 61% of Celsius' distribution through the first nine months of 2023 (versus 12% in the comparable period in 2022). Revenue soared, and profits have begun to rise as well. Earnings per share and free cash flow per share muted -- at best -- since the Pepsi agreement might be starting to turn higher."", 'Additionally, Celsius is only just beginning to tap into the global energy drink market as it signs new distribution deals overseas. To be sure, managing this expansion will be expensive. But if management (including a new CFO installed in 2022 after some accounting question marks in prior years) executes well, Celsius could be on the cusp of lots more sales growth in the coming years.', ""GAAP net income was $143 million through the first nine months of 2023, up from a loss of $171 million the year prior. I'd like to see more of that profitable growth continue, and if it does, I'll buy more Celsius stock."", 'Granted, this is an ""expensive"" stock at over 40 times one-year forward expected earnings per share. A lot is riding on Celsius continuing to expand at a voracious pace. (Wall Street analysts have nearly 40% sales growth penciled in for 2024, building on the expected doubling in revenue in 2023.)', 'This is why I started with a small position and plan on building it larger over time if the story stays energized. But after watching from the sidelines for some time, Celsius seemed like a decent place to stash some long-term money in the consumer brands space. Time will tell.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Celsius right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Celsius, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Celsius wasn’t one of them.

This performance fell below market expectations due to destocking activity in Brazil and some production ramp-up issues for its new Patriot sprayer. We believe the production issues are temporary while the destocking actions will better position the business for the midterm. Pricing power remains quite strong and increased by roughly 7%, and precision agricultural sales grew by 21%. While the market was overly focused on near-term demand and sales growth, the agriculture equipment division produced its highest quarterly margin ever at 16.8%—an encouraging development that supports our view of the company’s long-term profitability. Further, the much smaller construction business delivered strong results, including its own quarterly margin record.

', ""The start of 2024 for the stock market is more of the same. The first month of the year saw investors turn their attention to the Federal Reserve as usual in order to set expectations for the remainder of 2024. The Fed, if you're unaware, has been rapidly raising interest rates to combat inflation. Now that inflation has started to drop, Wall Street is eager to know when rates will start to drop, and on this front, ironically, the economy is proving to be the biggest hurdle in forcing the Fed's hand."", ""Higher interest rates increase the cost of doing business and restrict consumer access to capital. This means that firms have a tougher time posting both revenue and earnings growth, and when their figures don't grow, neither does the economy. However, since the American economy continues to outshine peers, the Fed has more leeway to keep rates higher and deflate Wall Street's balloon that had become accustomed to easy money after the 2008 Great Recession and the more recent coronavirus pandemic."", ""At the same time, even as rates are high, the stock market is still continuing to impress. In fact, bears have been left rather red faced as major indexes such as the NASDAQ Composite and the S&P 500 have continued to soar despite the depressing effects that high interest rates have on stock valuation. In fact, despite the tepid interest rate environment, it's the S&P 500 that has once again proven that no matter how shrewd analysts are, they can still miss out on major trends."", 'This is because the flagship Wall Street stock index which contains the crown jewels of the American stock market set a new all time record in February 2024 when it soared above 5,000 points for the first time in its history. Quite a sharp turnaround from the tail end of 2022 had seen speculation far and wide that a recession was incoming and that everyone should batten down their hatches.', ""Just like 2023 saw the NASDAQ 100 soar to new highs on the back of major stocks such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). 2024's record setting index levels are also influenced by such companies. The start of the year ushered in all important earnings season that saw major stocks the likes of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) take the lead on the artificial intelligence front. A.I. was the biggest theme on the stock market last year, and the mega stock earnings calls saw their management share strategies about costs, future plans, and other data that investors parsed over with eagle eyes to see whether the hype in A.I. is really worth investing in."", ""And as we've seen through major stock performance in 2024, seems like investors are impressed. Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, and NVIDIA's shares are up by 7.64%, 35%, 13%, and 49.7%, year to date, respectively. This shows that even though small cap stocks that are often touted for their ability to deliver double digit and higher percentage returns, major stocks the likes of some of the magnificent seven that we've talked about above can also stun everyone given the market and economic contexts align in their favor."", 'Before we head on to the best major stocks to buy, another big news for these stocks this year has come from Meta.

If you want to skip our discussion on the copper industry, head over to 5 Best Copper Stocks To Invest In According To Analysts.\xa0', 'Due to the explosive growth in the electrical and electronics, construction, industrial machinery manufacturing, automotive manufacturing, and infrastructure sectors, the copper market is expected to grow from $166.25 billion in 2023 to $179.84 billion in 2024, exhibiting a compound annual growth rate of 8.2%. Similarly, the copper market is projected to reach $240.52 billion in 2028, indicating a CAGR of 7.5% throughout the forecast period of 2024-28.\xa0', ""Global copper producers experienced strong demand from China in the first half of the year due to decarbonization efforts, countering a weak property market. However, the future outlook depends on Beijing's stimulus measures. The copper market may shift into a modest, multiyear surplus until 2025, driven by increased mined supply. Similarly, South America's challenging regulatory and political environments may support the market in the midterm. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, near-term copper prices could dip below $8,000 a ton, with marginal cost support around $7,400. Miners anticipate a significant output increase in the second half of this year, with 2024 showing a potential 4-4.5% growth in mined supply. However, Bloomberg suggests that the benefits of greenfield and brownfield projects may start to diminish from 2027. Regulatory approvals could become more protracted, potentially causing a slowdown in mined copper supply growth by the middle of the decade, leading to market deficits by the end of the decade unless development speeds up."", 'According to a January 2024 CNBC report, copper prices are projected to surge by over 75% in the next two years due to disruptions in mining supply and increased demand for the metal, particularly driven by the global push for renewable energy. The rise in demand, fueled by the green energy transition, coupled with an expected decline in the US dollar in the latter half of 2024, is expected to contribute to the upward trend in copper prices. Market expectations of potential rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve this year, leading to a weaker dollar, are seen as a factor making US dollar-priced copper more appealing to foreign buyers.', 'Over 60 countries endorsed a plan at the recent COP28 climate change conference to triple global renewable energy capacity by 2030. Citibank sees this development as highly positive for copper. In a December report, the bank predicted that the increased targets for renewable energy would lead to an additional demand for 4.2 million tons of copper by 2030. This surge in demand could potentially drive copper prices to $15,000 per ton in 2025, surpassing the previous record peak of $10,730 per ton reached in March 2023. Citi analysts project a positive scenario for copper prices, contingent on a very soft economic landing in the US and Europe, an earlier rebound in global growth, and substantial easing measures in China.

So, for example, the average cost for pet insurance for a dog is about $53 a month.

Well, a quarter of people would do just that to get life saving medical care for their pets.

But there are ways you can keep both your pet and wallet healthy. To break it down for us, Kimberly Palmer, NerdWallet personal finance expert is here."", 'Good to have you on the show here. It does seem like a lot of people underestimate just how much some of these health related costs for pets can really run you at a time when people can barely afford to prepare for a $250 emergency. What do people need to know about this?', ""KIMBERLY PALMER: What's really hard about pet care is that you really don't know what to expect, you don't whether your pet will become sick or injured. And the time to buy pet insurance, which can help you manage those costs is well before your pet needs it."", ""And so it's really important for people to consider, what do you expect? Do you want to be able to turn to pet insurance, if your pet does need some medical care or do you want to pay for that yourself? And in some cases, risk even putting your own financial situation at risk. As you mentioned people are willing to do a lot for their pets, including go into debt. And that can be really challenging for pet owners."", ""RACHELLE AKUFFO: But you think if people are willing to go into debt, why they're not take the insurance. Compare some of the costs that people could be looking at monthly if they do have insurance versus some of the costs, I know anecdotally for me my dog ate a piece of chewing gum and was allergic to it. 9,000 later, but if you don't have pet insurance, that's an upfront cost you have to bear."", ""KIMBERLY PALMER: That is such a great example of the unexpected expenses that can really come up for pet owners. What's important to know is that you can often buy pet insurance at a relatively affordable price. So for example, the average cost for pet insurance for a dog is about $53 a month. It's important to know though and this is something that surprises a lot of pet owners."", ""The price of your pet insurance actually goes up as your pet ages and at the same time because of inflation, we're seeing the price of pet insurance go up anyway. And so pet insurance is not cheap, but it is definitely more affordable than if you suddenly have to pay for these unexpected medical bills because your pet does either get injured or need some medical care."", ""RACHELLE AKUFFO: As you look at some of the more expensive things that some of this pet insurance does and doesn't cover, what do people need to in case they think, I've got pet insurance I'm covered because there are some outside costs that are also in addition."", ""KIMBERLY PALMER: There are. What's so important to know is that in general, you pay for a deductible when your pet needs care. And then the pet insurance kicks in to cover a percentage of the remaining cost. So that's why it can make it so much more manageable to handle those costs."", ""But an important thing to know is that pet insurance generally does not cover pre-existing conditions as well as wellness care. Unless you add that on to your pet insurance, which of course, makes it more expensive. And so the tricky thing for pet owners is that if you know your pet needs some care because it already is sick for example, it's probably too late to get pet insurance at that point because of that exclusion of the pre-existing condition."", 'So a lot for pet owners to consider.', ""RACHELLE AKUFFO: And so then when you think about that cost versus say all the other costs that people have to take on at a time when inflation starting to moderate but still very high for some of these costs, how should people think about incorporating some of these costs.

So what you want to do is weigh the risk of suddenly being faced with some big ticket items because of medical care for your pet versus pet insurance taking that out now, maybe when you first get a pet and you're evaluating what risk do I want to take on."", ""You could set aside money on your own and budget ahead of time for those expenses that can come up or you can turn to pet insurance where you're paying a monthly fee, an annual fee. And then you can go to pet insurance if you need it when your pet needs some medical care. So it's something to weigh the pros and cons of, think about your budget and what might fit into it."", ""What you don't want to do is to put yourself at risk and take on debt that is really hard to handle because that can lead to even more financial stress down the line."", ""RACHELLE AKUFFO: That peace of mind premium certainly worth the cost if you're able to cover it.

The U.S. needs to invest an estimated $4 trillion to decarbonize its economy by 2050, while the world needs to spend $1 trillion on data infrastructure in the coming decade to support digitalization. Those megatrends could power explosive growth for companies focused on them. ', 'NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE) and Brookfield Infrastructure (NYSE: BIPC)(NYSE: BIP) are leaders in those fields. Despite that, their shares currently trade more than 30% below their recent peaks because of concerns that rising interest rates could stunt their growth. However, with that headwind expected to fade this year as the Federal Reserve lowers rates, it could lift the weight holding down their stocks. That near-term catalyst, combined with their focus on long-term megatrends, positions investors to potentially earn explosive total returns in the coming years. That makes them stand out as some of the top stocks to buy this month. ', ""NextEra Energy was an early adopter of renewable energy and has built a leading wind and solar energy platform. The company has leveraged its expertise to invest in adjacent sectors to add more power to its growth engine. It's an emerging leader in operating battery storage to complement its renewable energy assets. NextEra is also developing electricity transmission lines to transmit renewable energy to the grid. In addition, it's starting to invest in green hydrogen, an emissions-free fuel produced with renewable energy. "", ""The company's early foray into renewables has helped power double-digit adjusted earnings and dividends per share growth over the past decade. That has given it the power to produce strong total returns (12.2% annualized). NextEra expects to grow its adjusted earnings by more than 9% per share off of 2021's base through 2026 while increasing its dividend by around 10% annually through that timeframe. It could continue growing rapidly post-2026, given the expected acceleration of renewable energy demand to power data centers, electric vehicles, and green hydrogen production. "", ""Despite that robust growth outlook, NextEra Energy currently trades at its lowest valuation in years. That's due to the more than 30% slump in its stock price as investors sold off shares of higher-yielding stocks as interest rates rose. Its forward P/E ratio of roughly 17 is well below the 25-plus that it fetched in 2022. It's also a lot cheaper than the broader market. The S&P 500's forward P/E is nearly 23, while the Nasdaq 100's is over 30. "", 'With interest rates set to decline, NextEra could regain a higher valuation multiple. Add that upside to the explosive growth of renewable energy, and it could produce powerful total returns from here. ', ""Brookfield Infrastructure trades at an even cheaper price. The global infrastructure operator sells for a little more than 12 times its funds from operations (FFO) per share following a more than 30% slump in its share price from the peak. That's dirt cheap for a company that grew its FFO per share by 10% last year, a rate it expects to sustain in the future. "", ""One factor fueling Brookfield's bullish growth outlook is its increasing focus on the digitalization megatrend. The company has built a leading data infrastructure platform that features communication towers, fiber optic networks, data centers, and semiconductor fabrication."", 'Brookfield is investing heavily in data centers, which it sees as a ""once-in-a-generation"" investment opportunity powered by catalysts like cloud computing and AI. Last year, the company significantly expanded its global platform by investing in three data center operators. Brookfield is also investing in several data center developments, which will more than triple its capacity by 2026. ', ""The company's increasing focus on digitalization could power robust total returns. Brookfield has delivered a nearly 13% annualized total return over the last decade and could produce even better returns in the future, given its cheap valuation and strong growth drivers. "", 'NextEra Energy and Brookfield Infrastructure have delivered excellent total returns over the past decade by focusing on investing in strong global growth trends. Their thematic investment approach should continue producing results as the decarbonization and digitalization megatrends gain steam over the coming years.

Considering the lack of profitability, we also need to check if the company generated enough cash flow to cover the dividend payment.

On the other hand, when the stock market is soft heading into elections, incumbent party often loses. But does that mean President Joe Biden could notch a second term if the Fed begins to cut rates in the summer and stocks keep gaining ahead of the election?

As most would know, long-term fundamentals have a strong correlation with market price movements, so we decided to look at the company's key financial indicators today to determine if they have any role to play in the recent price movement. Specifically, we decided to study Johnson & Johnson's  ROE in this article."", ""Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity."", ' See our latest analysis for Johnson & Johnson ', 'The formula for return on equity is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Johnson & Johnson is:', '19% = US$13b ÷ US$69b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.19."", 'So far, we\'ve learned that ROE is a measure of a company\'s profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don\'t have the same features.', ""To begin with, Johnson & Johnson seems to have a respectable ROE. Even when compared to the industry average of 17% the company's ROE looks quite decent. However, we are curious as to how Johnson & Johnson's decent returns still resulted in flat growth for Johnson & Johnson in the past five years. Based on this, we feel that there might be other reasons which haven't been discussed so far in this article that could be hampering the company's growth. For example, it could be that the company has a high payout ratio or the business has allocated capital poorly, for instance."", ""We then compared Johnson & Johnson's net income growth with the industry and found that the average industry growth rate was 6.5% in the same 5-year period."", 'The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for JNJ? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. ', ""The high three-year median payout ratio of 70% (meaning, the company retains only 30% of profits) for Johnson & Johnson suggests that the company's earnings growth was miniscule as a result of paying out a majority of its earnings."", ""Moreover, Johnson & Johnson has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 47% over the next three years. The fact that the company's ROE is expected to rise to 31% over the same period is explained by the drop in the payout ratio."", ""On the whole, we do feel that Johnson & Johnson has some positive attributes. Although, we are disappointed to see a lack of growth in earnings even in spite of a high ROE. Bear in mind, the company reinvests a small portion of its profits, which means that investors aren't reaping the benefits of the high rate of return. That being so, the latest industry analyst forecasts show that the analysts are expecting to see a huge improvement in the company's earnings growth rate. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

This marked the continuation of a trend, as revisions showed that the previous year's job growth was even stronger than initially reported, totaling 3.1 million new jobs. Economists were surprised by the resilience of the labor market despite aggressive interest rate increases, attributing it to factors such as rising consumer sentiment and easing inflation."", ""The unexpected job growth in January mirrors the strength seen in gross domestic product measurements for the fourth quarter of 2023, reinforcing the Federal Reserve's patient approach to interest rates. While January's gains were broad-based, particularly in professional and business services and healthcare, analysts cautioned against overinterpretation due to potential survey anomalies and temporary factors like weather disruptions."", ""Despite some sectors experiencing growth slowdowns, the overall outlook for the US economy remains positive, with strong wage growth, high consumer confidence, and a tight labor market persisting.

For instance, in industries like financial activities and government, the share of unfilled job openings ranges from 32.5% to 63.5%, with minimal unemployed workers per opening, hovering around 0.2 to 0.39.

If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio could be 73%, which we consider to be quite comfortable, with most of the company's earnings left over to grow the business in the future."", 'The company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2014, the dividend has gone from $1.41 total annually to $1.90. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 3.0% per annum over that time.

(NYSE:PWR) will be pleased this week, given that the stock price is up 11% to US$234 following its latest annual results. It was a workmanlike result, with revenues of US$21b coming in 3.2% ahead of expectations, and statutory earnings per share of US$5.00, in line with analyst appraisals. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Quanta Services ', ""Following the latest results, Quanta Services' 15 analysts are now forecasting revenues of US$22.6b in 2024. This would be a decent 8.2% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to swell 19% to US$6.10. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$22.1b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$6.25 in 2024. So it's pretty clear consensus is mixed on Quanta Services after the latest results; whilethe analysts lifted revenue numbers, they also administered a small dip in per-share earnings expectations."", ""The analysts also upgraded Quanta Services' price target 9.6% to US$238, implying that the higher revenue expected to generate enough value to offset the forecast decline in earnings. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Quanta Services at US$275 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$165. As you can see, analysts are not all in agreement on the stock's future, but the range of estimates is still reasonably narrow, which could suggest that the outcome is not totally unpredictable."", ""These estimates are interesting, but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare, both to the Quanta Services' past performance and to peers in the same industry. It's pretty clear that there is an expectation that Quanta Services' revenue growth will slow down substantially, with revenues to the end of 2024 expected to display 8.2% growth on an annualised basis. This is compared to a historical growth rate of 13% over the past five years. Juxtapose this against the other companies in the industry with analyst coverage, which are forecast to grow their revenues (in aggregate) 7.1% annually. Factoring in the forecast slowdown in growth, it looks like Quanta Services is forecast to grow at about the same rate as the wider industry."", 'The most important thing to take away is that the analysts downgraded their earnings per share estimates, showing that there has been a clear decline in sentiment following these results. They also upgraded their revenue forecasts, although the latest estimates suggest that Quanta Services will grow in line with the overall industry. There was also a nice increase in the price target, with the analysts clearly feeling that the intrinsic value of the business is improving.', ""Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings.

If you would like to skip our discussion on the important factors to consider while retiring abroad, you can go to the 5 Most Luxurious Places To Retire Abroad if You Have a Budget Over $15,000 a Month.', 'Retiring abroad with a budget of over $15,000 per month can offer a luxurious lifestyle and a range of possibilities across the globe. From the sunny beaches of the Caribbean to the cultural richness of European cities and the serene landscapes of Asia, there are many appealing destinations for high-net-worth individuals to consider. However, careful planning is necessary to ensure a comfortable retirement abroad. Real estate is one of the important factors to consider when relocating. The global real estate market is diverse and offers a wide range of options, from secluded beachfront villas to luxurious high-rise apartments in the city. For affluent retirees, luxury is not just about the property itself but also the location, amenities, and lifestyle it affords. Hence, choosing the right real estate property is important for a comfortable and enjoyable retirement abroad.', ""According to Knight Frank's Wealth Report, prime property prices in Monaco, the world’s most expensive real estate market, can exceed €54,000 per square meter. In contrast, luxury properties in places like Phuket, Thailand, offer more value for money while still providing an extravagant lifestyle, with prime property prices around €2,900 per square meter. Renowned real estate agencies CBRE Group, Inc. (NYSE:CBRE) cater to high-net-worth individuals looking for luxury properties in prime retirement destinations worldwide. An alternative choice is Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated (NYSE:JLL). JLL is a professional firm that provides services in real estate and investment management.\xa0The company operates in over 80 countries and provides services ranging from property investment to management. Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated (NYSE:JLL) can offer valuable insights for those considering luxury property purchases abroad, not just for residence but as an investment in the local real estate market."", ""Quality healthcare is another important factor to consider for a stress-free and comfortable retirement. The excellence and accessibility of healthcare services are top considerations for retirees. Countries like France, consistently ranking high in the World Health Organization's healthcare system evaluations, are known for providing excellent care. However, beyond healthcare quality, it's essential to consider the accessibility for expatriates as well. International health insurance providers, such as The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI), offer plans specifically designed for expatriates, ensuring comprehensive healthcare coverage worldwide. The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI) offers health, pharmacy, dental, supplemental insurance, and Medicare plans to individuals, families, and businesses. The cost of these plans can vary significantly based on coverage, but for a luxurious level of care, premiums can range from $4,000 to over $8,000 annually."", ""Here's what Davis Funds said about The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:"", '“In the attractive healthcare sector, we look beyond the obvious to identify businesses that simultaneously have exposure to this growth industry and also trade at low prices. We’re especially drawn to companies like\xa0Cigna Group, whose products or services play a part in helping to mitigate healthcare’s constantly rising costs. The healthcare industry has been a growing part of the U.S. economy for decades. As a result, many companies in this sector trade at high valuations reflecting their robust but well-known reputation for growth. For value-conscious investors like us, investing in healthcare requires looking beyond the obvious to identify businesses that have exposure to this growth industry but which trade at low prices. Furthermore, recognizing that the constantly rising cost of healthcare cannot go on forever, we have been particularly drawn to companies whose products or services play some role in managing or reducing the cost of care. As a result, we have positions in Cigna Group, a well-regarded provider of managed care.', ""In addition to real estate and healthcare, it's also important to consider factors such as the cultural and social richness of the best expat retirement countries. A lively expatriate community can provide a sense of belonging and ease the transition into a new country. For example, Spain boasts a rich history and a diverse culture, along with a warm climate, making it a popular choice for retirement among British expatriates. Spain is home to one of the largest British expatriate communities in the world, with over 300,000 UK citizens living there."", ""Alternatively, Malaysia's My Second Home (MM2H) program has attracted over 40,000 expatriates since its inception, thanks to the country's multicultural environment, low cost of living, and high-quality healthcare. Meanwhile, countries like Monaco are known for their favorable tax regime and zero income taxes for residents, making them financially viable for retirement despite high costs.

Our selection process involved evaluating the cost-of-living index, quality-of-life scores, health standards, and freedom rankings to select countries offering an exceptional quality of life. The freedom ranking is based on a country's economic, social, and political freedoms.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.', ""So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like TE Connectivity (NYSE:TEL). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing."", ' Check out our latest analysis for TE Connectivity ', ""Over the last three years, TE Connectivity has grown earnings per share (EPS) at as impressive rate from a relatively low point, resulting in a three year percentage growth rate that isn't particularly indicative of expected future performance. As a result, we'll zoom in on growth over the last year, instead. To the delight of shareholders, TE Connectivity's EPS soared from US$7.05 to US$10.72, over the last year. That's a commendable gain of 52%."", ""Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth.

But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Holding US$73m worth of stock in the company is no laughing matter and insiders will be committed in delivering the best outcomes for shareholders. That's certainly enough to let shareholders know that management will be very focussed on long term growth."", ""For growth investors, TE Connectivity's raw rate of earnings growth is a beacon in the night. Further, the high level of insider ownership is impressive and suggests that the management appreciates the EPS growth and has faith in TE Connectivity's continuing strength. Fast growth and confident insiders should be enough to warrant further research, so it would seem that it's a good stock to follow. Don't forget that there may still be risks.

This performance fell below market expectations due to destocking activity in Brazil and some production ramp-up issues for its new Patriot sprayer.

While the market was overly focused on near-term demand and sales growth, the agriculture equipment division produced its highest quarterly margin ever at 16.8%—an encouraging development that supports our view of the company’s long-term profitability.

To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL)."", ""Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Royal Caribbean Cruises ', 'Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Royal Caribbean Cruises is:', '35% = US$1.7b ÷ US$4.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.35 in profit."", ""Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Royal Caribbean Cruises has a higher ROE than the average (17%) in the Hospitality industry."", ""That's clearly a positive. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk . You can see the 2 risks we have identified for Royal Caribbean Cruises by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here."", ""Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used."", 'It seems that Royal Caribbean Cruises uses a huge volume of debt to fund the business, since it has an extremely high debt to equity ratio of 4.30. So although the company has an impressive ROE, the company might not have been able to achieve this without the significant use of debt.', ""Return on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE."", 'But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.

If you want to skip our coverage of the latest events in the stock market, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Beaten Down Stocks To Buy Right Now. ', ""The stock market of 2024 is vastly different from what investors were used to at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic and in its immediate aftermath. Before the pandemic, global stocks and the Chinese economy were performing quite well and there was a growing narrative that perhaps America's days as a global economy might be coming to an end, with up and comers the likes of China all ready to challenge U.S. dominance. Similarly, the stock market was used to low interest rates, and as the coronavirus stimulus packages and the monetary policy of that time showed, there was nowhere but up for stocks to go."", ""Now, the environment is different. Not only have the major European economies of the U.K. and Germany entered into a recession, but it seems like the American economy still has a lot of juice left when it comes to leading the world. This is because Chinese economic ails simply refuse to go away, and the start of 2024 has also seen billions of dollars flow out of the country's equity markets as the prospects of a robust economic recovery appear to dim down."", ""However, even though the American economy has been an exception for the last year or so, this doesn't mean that the future is clear. The start of the year saw stock market investors deal with the same set of challenges that they had become accustomed to in 2023. The two key stock market themes in 2024 are interest rates and artificial intelligence, and so far, they've turned out to be bearish and bullish indicators, respectively. While AI stocks such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) have already posted double digit percentage returns year to date, indexes such as the S&P 500 have pared back from their new all time records as inflation continues to be stubborn and the first rate cut dates from the Federal Reserve are still unclear."", ""On the inflationary side, the latest data set to dent investor hopes for rapid rate cuts is the producer price index (PPI). This data set measures 'inflation out of the gate' i.e., the product prices as they leave factories and make their way to retailers. Naturally, it is a leading inflation indicator and higher PPI readings can hint at higher consumer prices down the road. For January 2024, the PPI rose by 0.9% annually and 0.3% monthly, which ended up overshooting economist estimates. Naturally, the markets weren't impressed, and as the data made rounds, major indexes registered significant drops, led by the tech heavy NASDAQ index that lost 82 basis points."", ""Yet, an 82 basis point drop is still rather small when we consider some beaten down stocks that have marked significant drops. Two such beaten down stocks are the shares of the semiconductor firm Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) and the ride sharing firm Lyft, Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT). Starting from the former, Super Micro's shares had posted stunning triple digit percentage gains of 250% year to date as of February 15th, 2024. Then in the following days, they have dropped by 20% so far, making the stock quite an interesting case study for breakout and beaten down stocks. The Super Micro breakout took place as investors determined that it had successfully established itself as a key partner to NVIDIA and others. The beating took place after Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) warned that while the firm has significant AI upside, this has already been priced into the shares."", 'What about Lyft? Well, its shares soared by 57% after the latest earnings release but soon reversed the trend as management shared that the margin expansion estimate for 2024 will be 50 basis points instead of the 500 basis points that the official release had stated. Margin expansion means that Lyft earns more profit per dollar unit of sales, and naturally, the stock fell after the correction.', ""So, if you're wondering about the best beaten down stocks to buy, we made such a list and the top names are Transocean Ltd.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on establishing a retirement living overseas, you may go to 5 Safest Places to Retire Abroad for Less Than $3,000 a Month.', 'Upwards of $10,000. That’s not the cost of a year at college or a year’s worth of rent. According to BuzzFeed Inc. (NASDAQ:BZFD) owned Huffpost, it’s the estimated cost of moving abroad. The BuzzFeed Inc. (NASDAQ:BZFD) backed publication details this figure to include the cost of overseas shipping, securing visas, setting up your documents and finances - such as your driver’s license and money wires from the US - housing, insurance, air travel, and a whole host of other things.\xa0', 'With a $10,000 - or larger - investment on the line, you might think that the number of Americans moving abroad is in the smaller pools. However, these one-time costs don’t seem to have deterred US citizens, presumably as they pale in contrast to the benefits of some of the best countries to relocate to. The Association of American Residents Overseas estimates that a minimum of 5.4 million Americans live beyond the States as of 2023. A good portion of them are retirees.\xa0', 'While a vacation abroad may seem magical, permanently moving to another country can certainly be daunting. So then why do so many American citizens - the Wall Street Journal, a division of News Corp (NASDAQ:NWS), reported that as many as 450,000 retirees received their social security benefits in foreign countries - retire abroad? With this News Corp (NASDAQ:NWS) number already presumed to have grown, the reasons are multi fold.\xa0', 'Generally speaking, retirees are keen on peaceful, safe living. In many cases, they’re also one for living life on a budget, often finding cheap things to do in retirement. While patriots may point out the many wonderful things that the US has to offer, making an argument over how safe it is easily falls short. In a safe countries survey conducted by U.S. News and World Report, the US missed the top 10 - and 20 and 30 - mark, coming in at number 46 out of a total of 87 countries. Instead, it was mainly the European continent that triumphed. Similarly, the US received a disappointing 131st position on the recent Global Peace Index, reported the Miami Herald.\xa0', 'Things are not much better on the financial side either. For retirees spending their days living on Social Security check to Social Security check, their monthly budget comes out to a mere $1,909 based on the Social Security Administration’s Social Security payout for 2024. With average rental numbers at $1,568 for one-bedroom apartments in the US according to Zillow Inc (NASDAQ:Z), this doesn’t leave much behind for utilities, groceries, healthcare, travel, and the like. Of course, Zillow Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) also lists cheaper rental options - such as average one-bedroom rent being $850 for Iowa City and $725 for West Virginia - these cheaper options often come with problems of their own and are not accessible to everyone.\xa0', ""As such, the thought process behind the retiree's decision to spend their Golden Years abroad suddenly becomes clear.\xa0"", 'To assist senior citizens in the move abroad, we have compiled the following list of the safest places to retire abroad for less than $3,000 a month.\xa0', 'Malgorzata Drewniak/Shutterstock.com', 'To compile this list of the 17 safest places to retire abroad for less than $3,000 a month, we consulted several sources including our lists of 15 Cheapest and Safest Countries to Retire In and 25 Best Cities Where You Can Retire On $3,000 A Month, and Nomad Capitalist, Live and Invest Overseas, U.S. News and World Report, and Global Citizen Solutions. Once a list of countries was shortlisted using these sources, we then ranked them across multiple factors, namely, the Institute for Economics and Peace’s Global Peace Index, the Environmental Performance Index, their average cost of living, and their average monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment. For the cost of living and rent, multiple sources were consulted, including expat opinions on forums such as Reddit and Quora. Whereas for the Global Peace Index, countries with a rank of below 80 were removed.\xa0', 'As the safety of a country is determined both by how peaceful it is and by how healthy its environment is, we have included the Environmental Performance Index to provide a holistic picture. For this index, a score of 100 depicts a perfect score. Each country was then awarded a cumulative score, with the highest-scoring country being awarded the number one rank. For countries that gained an equal score, their Global Peace Index ranking was used as a tie-breaker. Since we based research on a country basis due to many indices only being available at the country level, we then selected a specific city or town for each of our finalized 17 countries. The selection process for each city included consulting several sources, such as articles, public forums, and ranking lists, with the criteria of ‘safe’ and ‘affordable’ being used. The resulting list is presented in ascending order, with the highest-ranked place being presented last.\xa0 It is important to remember that personal preference plays a big part. The best course of action is to visit the place you plan to move to, converse with locals, take advice from a financial consultant, and only then make your final decision.\xa0', 'By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

The artificial intelligence (AI) chip leader scored big as more and more companies flocked to buy its top-performing chip and related products and services. And Nvidia's revenue even reached a record at more than $22 billion."", ""Meanwhile, Nvidia's stock has soared about 285% over the past year. Even after these gains, Nvidia still remains a great stock to buy thanks to its solid future prospects. But there's another way to benefit from Nvidia's growth -- without even owning the stock. And that's by investing in companies that work hand in hand with this chip giant, and two perfect examples are leading cloud service provider Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), through Amazon Web Services (AWS), and server giant Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI)."", ""Why would you want to do this? Because it offers you the best of both worlds: Nvidia's growth along with exposure to another top-notch business operating in other compelling areas. Let's take a closer look at each."", ""Amazon's AWS is the world's leading cloud services provider, and it also generally drives overall profitability at the company. AWS offers clients a wide variety of cloud solutions, and in recent times, it's put the focus on AI, investing in technology infrastructure and in supporting clients across their AI projects."", ""By buying Amazon shares, you can benefit from Nvidia's growth because the company's graphics processing units (GPUs), or the chips powering AI, are found in AWS' offerings. And at AWS, you'll also find various Nvidia products and services such as the Nvidia AI Enterprise platform to accelerate AI development. Late last year, AWS and Nvidia even announced an extension of their collaboration to include new projects, such as work to create the world's fastest AI supercomputer -- powered by Nvidia GPUs of course."", ""And since so many companies already use AWS, it's likely they'll stick with the cloud services provider when they're looking for Nvidia products and services. All of this represents a huge revenue growth opportunity for Amazon moving forward."", ""On top of this, when you buy Amazon shares, you also benefit from the company's e-commerce business, which is another area with top growth prospects and a solid earnings track record. So, trading for 41x forward earnings estimates, Amazon makes a top buy right now."", ""Supermicro is a seller of servers, storage systems, full rack scale solutions, and related products. Now here's where things get exciting: The company uses a building blocks method of constructing its products so that it assembles a rack, for instance, according to the customer's needs."", ""And Supermicro monitors Nvidia's product development so that it can ensure its own products are compatible -- and ready to integrate the Nvidia innovation as soon as it's released. Supermicro also maintains this collaborative relationship with other chip companies like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel so it's able to benefit from the growth of all players in the space."", ""As a result, Supermicro offers customers a customized product, powered by the world's fastest chips as soon as they hit the market. In the most recent quarter, the company said it saw record demand for systems at rack scale, incorporating chips from Nvidia and other market leaders."", ""Supermicro's earnings have roared higher in recent times thanks to its close work with these AI chip giants, and in the fiscal year 2023 -- 30 years after the company launched -- it reported its first $2 billion quarter. Now, the company predicts revenue for the current full fiscal year to climb at least 101% to $14.3 billion."", 'All of this means that when the leading chipmakers win, so does Supermicro.

The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the fastest around, driving one of the key elements of AI: the deep learning of AI models, which serves as a starting point for their incredible performance down the road."", ""All of this has helped Nvidia's data center revenue reach record levels, climbing more than 400% to $18.4 billion in the most recent quarter. But this data center business doesn't stop at just a suite of leading AI chips. The company offers customers a full array of products and services through the data center unit to help them advance their AI platforms. And one of these offerings is software and services, a business that just reached a $1 billion annualized revenue run rate in the quarter."", 'In fact, CEO Jensen Huang said during the earnings call that software should become ""a very significant business over time."" All of this suggests software might be Nvidia\'s new AI growth driver, further expanding the company\'s opportunities to dominate in this hot technology. Could this high-flying stock continue to soar? Let\'s find out.', ""So what is this software opportunity all about? Well, let's consider what companies could do with AI on their own and then see what Nvidia offers. To build an AI software platform, a company could gather various open-source software elements to include in its existing infrastructure."", ""But relying on a vast number of open-source packages makes it hard to maintain security and stability -- and those aren't minor issues. Failure in these two areas could lead to failure of an entire AI project. And many companies don't have the engineering resources necessary to keep their software stack running both on site and through every cloud service provider worldwide."", ""This is where Nvidia comes in with its Nvidia AI Enterprise, a sort of operating system for AI. Through enterprise, Nvidia manages a customer's software stack, doing everything from optimizing to updating and more."", 'And the pre-trained models and tools available through the software system help customers gain when it comes to efficiency, therefore reducing costs over time. For instance, the Nvidia Rapids accelerator, which uses GPUs, when paired with the Apache Spark data processing system makes the job five times faster and cuts operational costs by five -- this is compared to systems relying on central processing units (CPUs).', '""My guess is that every enterprise in the world, every software enterprise company that are deploying software in all the clouds and private clouds and on-prem will run on Nvidia AI Enterprise,"" Huang said during the earnings report.', ""All this suggests software could indeed be the next growth driver for Nvidia. Yes, the company's top GPUs are the key product behind all of its other offerings. But by expanding into robust and varied products and services harnessing the power of these high-performing chips, Nvidia is extending its growth opportunity. And software, due to its essential role in AI, could offer Nvidia its next big AI growth driver."", 'Does this mean Nvidia may continue to soar even after climbing more than 270% over the past year? It definitely suggests Nvidia has what it takes to continue to advance over the long term -- even if it marks a pause here and there.', ""That's because Nvidia's software ambitions confirm the company isn't just about the GPU. Yes, the tech giant must stay ahead of rivals when it comes to chip performance -- and its increases in research and development (R&D) spending indicate that's a priority. Last year, Nvidia's R&D spending rose 18% compared to the previous year."", ""Nvidia's software strategy, and the fact that its software platform is available through all the leading cloud providers, show us yet another area that could drive spectacular growth moving forward. And that should drive further share price gains over time."", ""All of this means Nvidia today, trading at 32x forward earnings estimates, looks pretty cheap for a company with so much long-term potential.

There are a number of credible reports out there that discuss the behavior of financial markets during US election years. For example, a Morgan Stanley report analyzed some data to see how the S&P 500 performs during election years. This analysis shows that during presidential election years from 1928 through 2016, the stock market has seen more positive performance than negative. The report also said the election of a Republican president resulted in average gains of 15.3% for the S&P 500, compared to a 7.6% gain when a Democrat president comes in the White House."", 'A 2020 report by T. Rowe Price analyzed historical data on the connection between US elections and the stock market and found some interesting patterns. For example, the report said if the stock market performance is strong ahead of elections in the US, data shows that chances of the incumbent party staying in power increase. On the other hand, when the stock market is soft heading into elections, incumbent party often loses. But does that mean President Joe Biden could notch a second term if the Fed begins to cut rates in the summer and stocks keep gaining ahead of the election? That would be wrong conclusion to deduce from this pattern as the T. Rowe report shed light on a plethora of factors that affect the relationship between the stock market performance and election results. The report also said historical data shows if the incumbent party loses an election, a recession year follows:', '""Conventional wisdom argues that stock markets tend to perform poorly ahead of elections. Since 70% of the years when the incumbent party lost were followed by a recession year, it makes sense that equity markets performed poorly in the wake of the elections when the incumbent party lost.""', 'If you were to ask an average American today about the hottest issues that would be the point of focus in the US election this year, chances are that their answer would be inflation.

With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today we will analyse the most recent data on Walt Disney’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists."", ' See our latest analysis for Walt Disney ', 'According to our valuation model, Walt Disney seems to be fairly priced at around 9.03% above our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Walt Disney today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $98.82, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Walt Disney’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.', ""Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Walt Disney's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value."", 'Are you a shareholder?

However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team.

If you’ve been keeping tabs on DIS, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.', ""In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

The transaction turned it into a free cash flow machine. That gave it the fuel to grow value for its investors through dividends, share repurchases, debt reduction, and acquisitions. The company's adept use of its cash flow has helped power a nearly 190% total return since the merger closed (40.6% annualized), easily beating the S&P 500's roughly 40% (11.4% annualized) total return during that period. "", ""The oil stock should have plenty of fuel to continue growing shareholder value in the future. Here's a look at what drives that view."", 'When Devon Energy closed its merger of equals transaction with WPX Energy in early 2021, the company believed the deal would significantly enhance its ability to generate free cash flow. ""This transformational merger enhances the scale of our operations, builds a dominant position in the Delaware Basin and accelerates our cash-return business model that prioritizes free cash flow generation and the return of capital to shareholders,"" stated Devon\'s executive chairman Dave Hager at the time. ', ""The company used that merger as a springboard to launch the industry's first fixed-plus-variable dividend framework. Devon intended to pay a fixed base dividend that would increase each year. On top of that, it targeted to return up to 50% of its excess free cash to shareholders through a variable dividend. Since launching the framework, Devon has nearly doubled its base dividend rate while paying significant variable dividends:"", ""The company's variable payment surged along with oil prices (and its oil-fueled cash flows) during the first half of 2022. While lower oil prices impacted its cash flow over the past few quarters, Devon still produces lots of cash to pay dividends."", 'In addition to paying dividends, Devon uses its gushing cash flows to repurchase shares, repay debt, and make acquisitions:', 'The company has repurchased over $2.1 billion in stock since late 2021, retiring 6% of its outstanding shares. Meanwhile, it has strengthened its balance sheet by repaying $1.5 billion of debt since the merger closed, reducing its leverage ratio to less than 1. ', 'Devon has also made two cash-gushing acquisitions. It paid $865 million to acquire the leasehold interests and related assets of RimRock Oil & Gas in mid-2022. The highly accretive deal enabled Devon to increase its base dividend by 13%. The company followed that acquisition up with a $1.8 billion deal for Validus Energy in late 2022. The cash-gushing acquisition gave Devon more fuel to pay variable dividends, helping offset some of the decline in oil prices. ', ""Devon Energy expects to continue producing lots of cash. The oil company estimates it could generate $3.2 billion in free cash flow this year, assuming that oil averages around $80 per barrel (slightly above the recent price). That would be a more than 20% improvement from last year's level, fueled by lower service costs and its focus on investing in its highest-return drilling locations. "", 'The company aims to return 70% of its free cash flow to shareholders this year. It intends to grow its base dividend, buyback shares, and pay variable dividends. Given its currently low valuation -- Devon trades at around an 11% free cash flow yield, making it more than 50% cheaper than the broader market indexes -- it will likely prioritize repurchases over variable dividends in the near term. It will use the other 30% to retire maturing debt and further strengthen its financial profile. ', 'Meanwhile, the company is on the lookout for its next transformational merger. While all its rumored acquisition targets have since agreed to a deal with another suitor, plenty of potential merger partners remain. The right deal at the right price could further enhance its ability to generate free cash flow and pay dividends.', 'Devon Energy has become a free cash flow machine since closing its transformational merger with WPX Energy.

The first month of the year saw investors turn their attention to the Federal Reserve as usual in order to set expectations for the remainder of 2024. The Fed, if you're unaware, has been rapidly raising interest rates to combat inflation. Now that inflation has started to drop, Wall Street is eager to know when rates will start to drop, and on this front, ironically, the economy is proving to be the biggest hurdle in forcing the Fed's hand."", ""Higher interest rates increase the cost of doing business and restrict consumer access to capital. This means that firms have a tougher time posting both revenue and earnings growth, and when their figures don't grow, neither does the economy. However, since the American economy continues to outshine peers, the Fed has more leeway to keep rates higher and deflate Wall Street's balloon that had become accustomed to easy money after the 2008 Great Recession and the more recent coronavirus pandemic."", ""At the same time, even as rates are high, the stock market is still continuing to impress. In fact, bears have been left rather red faced as major indexes such as the NASDAQ Composite and the S&P 500 have continued to soar despite the depressing effects that high interest rates have on stock valuation. In fact, despite the tepid interest rate environment, it's the S&P 500 that has once again proven that no matter how shrewd analysts are, they can still miss out on major trends."", 'This is because the flagship Wall Street stock index which contains the crown jewels of the American stock market set a new all time record in February 2024 when it soared above 5,000 points for the first time in its history.

Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, and NVIDIA's shares are up by 7.64%, 35%, 13%, and 49.7%, year to date, respectively.

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.', 'In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like American Express (NYSE:AXP), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business.', ' See our latest analysis for American Express ', ""If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. To the delight of shareholders, American Express has achieved impressive annual EPS growth of 45%, compound, over the last three years. That sort of growth rarely ever lasts long, but it is well worth paying attention to when it happens."", ""One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. Not all of American Express' revenue this year is revenue from operations, so keep in mind the revenue and margin numbers used in this article might not be the best representation of the underlying business. While we note American Express achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 9.7% to US$56b. That's progress."", ""You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. For finer detail, click on the image."", ""In investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of American Express' forecast profits?"", ""Owing to the size of American Express, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$208m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.1% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value."", ""American Express' earnings per share have been soaring, with growth rates sky high. That sort of growth is nothing short of eye-catching, and the large investment held by insiders should certainly brighten the view of the company. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. So based on this quick analysis, we do think it's worth considering American Express for a spot on your watchlist. Don't forget that there may still be risks. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for American Express  that you should be aware of."", ""There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

There are a number of credible reports out there that discuss the behavior of financial markets during US election years. For example, a Morgan Stanley report analyzed some data to see how the S&P 500 performs during election years. This analysis shows that during presidential election years from 1928 through 2016, the stock market has seen more positive performance than negative. The report also said the election of a Republican president resulted in average gains of 15.3% for the S&P 500, compared to a 7.6% gain when a Democrat president comes in the White House."", 'A 2020 report by T. Rowe Price analyzed historical data on the connection between US elections and the stock market and found some interesting patterns. For example, the report said if the stock market performance is strong ahead of elections in the US, data shows that chances of the incumbent party staying in power increase. On the other hand, when the stock market is soft heading into elections, incumbent party often loses. But does that mean President Joe Biden could notch a second term if the Fed begins to cut rates in the summer and stocks keep gaining ahead of the election? That would be wrong conclusion to deduce from this pattern as the T. Rowe report shed light on a plethora of factors that affect the relationship between the stock market performance and election results. The report also said historical data shows if the incumbent party loses an election, a recession year follows:', '""Conventional wisdom argues that stock markets tend to perform poorly ahead of elections. Since 70% of the years when the incumbent party lost were followed by a recession year, it makes sense that equity markets performed poorly in the wake of the elections when the incumbent party lost.""', 'If you were to ask an average American today about the hottest issues that would be the point of focus in the US election this year, chances are that their answer would be inflation.

It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. We can see that Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) does use debt in its business. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?"", 'Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.', ' Check out our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum ', 'As you can see below, Occidental Petroleum had US$19.0b of debt, at December 2023, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. On the flip side, it has US$1.43b in cash leading to net debt of about US$17.6b.', 'Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Occidental Petroleum had liabilities of US$9.15b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$34.5b due beyond that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$1.43b as well as receivables valued at US$3.27b due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$39.0b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.', 'This is a mountain of leverage even relative to its gargantuan market capitalization of US$52.8b. Should its lenders demand that it shore up the balance sheet, shareholders would likely face severe dilution.', ""In order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses."", ""Occidental Petroleum has net debt of just 1.3 times EBITDA, indicating that it is certainly not a reckless borrower. And it boasts interest cover of 7.4 times, which is more than adequate. In fact Occidental Petroleum's saving grace is its low debt levels, because its EBIT has tanked 56% in the last twelve months. Falling earnings (if the trend continues) could eventually make even modest debt quite risky. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Occidental Petroleum's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts."", 'But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. Over the last three years, Occidental Petroleum actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT. That sort of strong cash conversion gets us as excited as the crowd when the beat drops at a Daft Punk concert.', ""Occidental Petroleum's EBIT growth rate and level of total liabilities definitely weigh on it, in our esteem. But the good news is it seems to be able to convert EBIT to free cash flow with ease. We think that Occidental Petroleum's debt does make it a bit risky, after considering the aforementioned data points together. Not all risk is bad, as it can boost share price returns if it pays off, but this debt risk is worth keeping in mind. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it.

What should I do?', 'Unity’s stock sheds nearly a fifth of its value as earnings, forecast underwhelm', 'We rent our $750,000 home with a 2.5% mortgage rate for $4,000 a month, but the tenant is leaving. Should we sell now or later?\xa0', 'Alphabet’s stock has weathered past AI missteps. Is latest blunder different?', 'After Nvidia’s latest blowout, here are 20 AI stocks expected to rise as much as 44%', 'Buffett also lamented the difficulty of picking new investments for a company of Berkshire’s size and said he has no intention of buying the rest of Occidental Petroleum in which it held a nearly 28% stake at the end of 2023. He also offered an update on the success of Berkshire’s insurance business as well as its investments in Coca-Cola, American Express and five Japanese trading houses and detailed troubles in its energy and freight rail businesses.', 'Buffett has always been Berkshire’s front man but according to the 93-year-old investor, it was Munger who was truly the “architect” of the conglomerate.', 'In fact, it was Munger who originally came up with Berkshire’s longstanding mission statement to buy “wonderful businesses at fair prices” after criticizing Buffett for purchasing Berkshire Hathaway, then a struggling New England textile business.', '“In reality, Charlie was the ‘architect’ of the present Berkshire, and I acted as the ‘general contractor’ to carry out the day-by-day construction of his vision,” Buffett said.', 'Munger passed away on Nov. 28 just 33 days shy of his 100th birthday.', 'An unusual element of suspense accompanied the release of this year’s Berkshire annual report. Investors were waiting to see if Buffett would disclose the conglomerate’s latest purchase, widely believed to be a financial stock.', 'Unfortunately, they will have to keep on waiting.', 'No mention of the mystery company was made in the letter to shareholders, or in Berkshire’s annual report. Whatever the company is, it’s widely believed to be a financial firm, given the increased cost basis for financial companies which was first disclosed last year.', 'Financial news and information can be transmitted around the world faster than ever before. Yet, humans appear just as prone to irrational behavior as they have always been, if not more so, Buffett noted.', 'He observed that while the modern U.S. stock market is larger than it was during Berkshire’s early years, the investors of today are “neither more emotionally stable nor better taught” than when he was young.', '“For whatever reasons, markets now exhibit far more casino-like behavior than they did when I was young. The casino now resides in many homes and daily tempts the occupants,” Buffett said.', 'Investors would do well to remember that somebody, somewhere will always find opportunity in hyping up the latest fads. Often, it’s Wall Street that benefits, while buyers are left poorer and worse off.', 'One of Berkshire’s biggest purchases over the past two years has been its 27.8% stake in Occidental Petroleum.', 'While Berkshire has the option of increasing its stake via warrants it owns, Buffett said he has “no interest in purchasing or managing” Occidental — although the company particularly appreciates the firm’s vast holdings of oil and gas assets in the U.S., as well as its leadership in carbon-capture technology.', 'He praised Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub, saying Occidental is doing the right thing for both its country and its owners.', 'During last year’s annual meeting, Buffett told investors that stronger earnings at BNSF, the U.S. freight railroad network owned by Berkshire, and Berkshire Energy Holdings, would help to cushion a decline in earnings at other Berkshire businesses', 'Instead, both turned in lackluster returns, and Buffett felt obligated to try and explain this to shareholders. Buffett attributed weakness at BNSF to rising wages after the White House had stepped in to avert a strike of American freight rail workers back in late 2022.', '“Last year BNSF’s earnings declined more than I expected, as revenues fell. Though fuel costs also fell, wage increases, promulgated in Washington, were far beyond the country’s inflation goals. This differential may recur in future negotiations,” he said.', 'The steeper decline in Berkshire’s energy business, meanwhile, was due to increased regulatory scrutiny of utilities in Western states like California and Hawaii following wildfires. He finished on an ominous note, hinting at the possibility that the energy business could suffer major setbacks depending on how regulators elect to respond.', '“It will be many years until we know the final tally from BHE’s forest-fire losses and can intelligently make decisions about the desirability of future investments in vulnerable western states. It remains to be seen whether the regulatory environment will change elsewhere,” Buffett said.', 'Once upon a time, Berkshire had an abundance of potential takeover targets, but those days are long over.', 'Now, Berkshire’s sheer size makes finding potential acquisition targets extremely difficult, Buffett said. Its net worth according to generally accepted account principles stood at nearly $561 billion at the end of 2022, roughly 6% of the entire S&P 500 index.', '“There remain only a handful of companies in this country capable of truly moving the needle at Berkshire, and they have been endlessly picked over by us and by others. Some we can value; some we can’t. And, if we can, they have to be attractively priced,” Buffett said.', 'As a result, Berkshire’s ability to substantially outperform the broader market has diminished. While Berkshire should perform better than the average well-run U.S. corporation, anything beyond “slightly better” would be “wishful thinking.”', 'The past three years offer an excellent example of why Buffett prefers operating income to “worse than useless” net income, which public companies are mandated to report.', 'Fluctuations in the stock market caused Berkshire to report a net loss of $23 billion in 2022 reflecting the unrealized decline in value of its stock portfolio. On either side of that $23 billion loss were two annual gains of more than $90 billion.', 'By comparison, operating income offers a more stable picture: it shows Berkshire earned $27.6 billion in 2021; $30.9 billion in 2022 and $37.4 billion in 2023.', 'Following the passing of Charlie Munger, Ajit Jain, who leads Berkshire’s insurance businesses, and Greg Abel, who leads Berkshire’s non-insurance businesses, will join him on stage in Omaha for Berkshire Hathaway’s annual gathering on May 4.', 'Berkshire Hathaway’s\xa0 operating earnings after taxes rose 28% to $8.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023 , driven by strength in the company’s insurance business and its stronger investment returns this year.', 'Berkshire’s Class B shares BRK.B have gained 17% since the start of the year.', '‘Things have not been easy for us’: My sister is a hoarder and procrastinator.

', ""Due to the current macroeconomic environment, the banking industry in the U.S. and globally has been one of the most important and most watched sectors. This is because right now, apart from artificial intelligence and AI stocks, the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy is a must watch item on the agenda of both retail and professional investors. Investors are wondering when the rates will start to drop. These rate cuts will be quite important for the banking industry as well as for broader sectors such as commercial and office real estate that have struggled in the aftermath of turmoil in the bond market. 2023 was a notable year for bank stocks and it saw a widespread bloodbath in the regional banking sector. Multiple big regional banks failed as they were unable to assess the impact of rising bond yields on their asset bases."", 'This turmoil resurfaced in 2024 as well. While investors were cheering AI stocks and pumping up the shares of NVIDIA Corporation, the shares of New York Community Bancorp, Inc. (NYSE:NYCB) crashed by 59% in late January and early February after the New York state based regional bank warned in its earnings report that it had to allocate additional capital for trouble in the office real estate sector. Additionally, just as the turmoil in 2023 had prompted the Federal Reserve to step up its efforts at ensuring that the U.S. banking sector was healthy by running stress tests, the NYCB scare of 2024 in the wake of its surprising loss and capital allocation has now spurred the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and other banking bodies to inquire from banks whether they are adequately prepared for any untoward events according to media reports. Due to the sizeable role that they play in funding commercial real estate, small banks are quite exposed to jitters in the market, and anyone interested in following bank stocks would also be well advised to watch the commercial real estate sector.', ""But what about mega bank stocks? After all, following the 2023 regional banking crisis, large banks such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) had remained unscathed despite some fears about their instability. Well, the start of 2024 has seen the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) fine Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) a sizeable $1.3 million over the bank's failure to properly deal with municipal securities. Additionally, if we're to slightly expand our focus from pure play banking to the broader financial services sector, then 2024 has also seen one of the biggest deals in the banking industry."", 'Online banking stock Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) announced a whopping $35 billion deal for Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS), and as investors remain unconvinced that the affair could clear regulatory scrutiny, analysts believe that if Capital One shows that it will help consumers save money and benefit them in other ways, then it might be able to take on giants such as Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V).', 'So, as the banking sector continues to be as dynamic as ever and investors hope for rate cuts soon, we decided to look at some top banking stocks for the long term.

Capital One is the ninth-largest U.S. bank by assets, and Discover is a credit card network like Visa or Mastercard. Its model is more similar to American Express, just a lot smaller. Is that where Capital One is going?', 'Capital One has revamped its credit card program over the past few years, leaning heavily on the American Express example of a large rewards program. This has helped it capture more credit card customers, and increased purchase volume has helped it offset the negative impact of higher interest rates on deposits, as well as increased its net interest income and margin.', ""Overall, credit card debt in the U.S. is growing. And while Capital One isn't the biggest player, it's growing its share."", 'Discover issues its own credit cards, but it also has its own network, and that opens up new opportunities for Capital One.

It gives it access to financial technology that complements its current infrastructure, differentiating\xa0it from the standard large bank.', 'The payments industry has changed with the advent of the digital payment industry, and there are all sorts of new payment methods today that rely on technology. This acquisition gives Capital One a larger global role in the future of payments.', ""On a deeper level, this could lead to a change in Capital One's model that makes it more like American Express. Discover is the smallest of the four credit card networks and operates a closed-loop system like American Express."", 'Visa and Mastercard do not offer banking services nor underwrite the ""loans,"" or the credit customers use when they swipe their cards.

It also increases the chances that you end up missing out on potential gains for your portfolio."", ""The good news is that the stock market has a marked tendency to grow over time, regardless of short-term volatility and outright bearish periods. If you consistently put your cash into quality businesses regardless of the broader market, you stand to benefit from the market's highs as the years go by."", ""For long-term investors (those who buy with the intent of holding for a minimum of five years), it's always a good time to buy great companies. Here are two fantastic businesses that could drive market-beating returns in the years ahead, and are likely to crush the market in 2024."", ""Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX) has had a series of amazing years, with profits, revenue, and cash pouring in because of its successful franchise of cystic fibrosis medicines. Share prices are up 40% over the last year alone. It's the only company with approved drugs that treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis, a disease that affects over 160,000 people globally. There is a significant addressable market for the business, as these revolutionary medicines are helping people live better and longer."", 'Recently, management tallied its core addressable market (North America, Europe, and Australia) at about 92,000 people. The financial workhorse of its portfolio is Trikafta. That drug maintains patent exclusivity until 2037, and Vertex is rapidly advancing new potential blockbusters in its pipeline and portfolio that could stem a future patent cliff.', 'The company just gained approval for its landmark gene-editing therapy Casgevy, the first CRISPR therapy to be approved and a potential one-time functional cure for both sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia. The U.S., U.K., and European Union have given recent regulatory green lights to the drug, which Vertex co-developed and will co-market with CRISPR Therapeutics.', ""Another potential blockbuster that Vertex plans to seek final approvals on this year is its acute pain candidate VX-548. There are a wide range of potential use cases for this drug. It's not an opioid, so it could provide effective pain relief that goes beyond the abilities of an over-the-counter drug but stops short of the addictive potential of many current painkillers on the market. VX-548 has shown promise in multiple phase 3 trials in both safety and patient tolerance, across multiple types of acute pain, and in both surgical and non-surgical settings. In one study, for example, VX-548 helped patients achieve notable improvement in pain following surgery compared to the placebo."", ""Beyond this promising pain candidate, Vertex is working on other cystic fibrosis drugs. It's also working on treatments for diseases that currently have no available options to treat their underlying genetic causes, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy and APOL1-mediated kidney disease. The company is even developing stem cell therapies for diabetes."", 'The future looks bright for this healthcare business, which is already coming from a position of strength. As mentioned, the stock price has risen significantly this past year, so it sells at a bit of a premium (Its price-to-earnings ratio is 30.8). But for long-term investors, its potential for further growth in the years ahead justifies the short-term premium.', 'Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock has been somewhat volatile over the past four pandemic-influenced years. However, a series of cost-cutting measures in 2022 and 2023 have helped to right the ship for this tech giant, and its underlying group of core businesses has proven to be resilient even in an uncertain economy.', ""Most people know Amazon for its flagship e-commerce platform, and most of its top line is still tied to e-commerce-related sales. In 2023's Q4, $114 billion (67%) of Amazon's total $170 billion in net sales came from online stores or fees derived from third-party seller services available on its e-commerce platform."", ""Amazon's second-largest business driver is its cloud division. Net sales from Amazon Web Services (AWS) totaled $24 billion (14%) in Q4. However, AWS accounts for about 55% of the company's profits. AWS brought in $7.2 billion of Amazon's overall $13 billion in operating income in Q4."", ""Another segment that is increasingly proving to be a powerhouse for the company is Amazon's somewhat less discussed advertising business. In Q4, Amazon's advertising revenue was roughly $14.6 billion (8.5%). While that advertising business is small compared to its e-commerce and cloud segments, it's still sizeable, it's growing quicker, and it has much better profit margins. It's also gaining market share of the broader advertising market. According to Statista, Amazon now accounts for 13% of total net digital ad revenue in the U.S., which is the world's largest advertising market, and 10% of all ad spending globally."", 'Shares of Amazon are trading up by roughly 70% over the last 12 months, as investors have reaffirmed their interest in the stock.

As valuable as this track record is, Dividend Kings tend to take a back seat to faster-growing names during a market that keeps going higher.', 'After all, optimistic investors would much rather find a company with growth prospects and that can pour all its excess earnings and cash flow into that growth rather than pass it along to shareholders in the form of a dividend.\xa0But long-term investors know that the true value of Dividend Kings is when equity prices are falling all around you, and yet, the Dividend King is there no matter what to provide reliable passive income.', ""Here's why one of the best-known Dividend Kings, Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO),\xa0 along with two other well-known names, Emerson Electric (NYSE: EMR) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG), are all worth buying now."", ""Daniel Foelber (Coca-Cola): At first glance, Coca-Cola's recent quarter and dividend raise weren't too special. Case volume -- a key metric that shows demand for Coke's products -- grew just 2% in the year, but revenue and earnings growth were solid. 2024 guidance calls for non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) organic revenue growth of 6% to 7% and comparable non-GAAP earnings-per-share growth of 4% to 5%."", ""What's more, Coke raised its dividend by 5.4% to an annual $1.94 per share, marking the 62nd consecutive annual increase."", 'All told, Coke delivered a great 2023, good but not great 2024 guidance, and the largest percentage increase to the dividend since 2017. So why is Coke up over 3% since reporting earnings a couple of weeks ago? The answer has more to do with what investors expect from Coke than from its recent results.', ""Coke is an industry-leading business with an above-average dividend yield and a below-market valuation. Once factoring in the recent raise, its dividend yield is a hearty 3.2% -- more than double the 1.4% dividend yield of the S&P 500. Coke's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 24.8 is also less than the S&P 500's P/E multiple of 27."", ""Opponents of Coke stock will say it deserves to trade at a discount to the market because of its low growth. But I'd argue that you can count on one hand how many dividend stocks are in the same league as Coke when it comes to paying and raising a reliable dividend."", ""Coke isn't the kind of company that needs to deliver outstanding growth. All it has to do is grow earnings per share in the mid-single-digit range per year, and it can fund a sizable buyback program and grow its payout.\xa0Coke's 2023 performance and latest dividend raise validate why Coke remains a top-tier dividend stock to buy and hold for decades to come."", ""Lee Samaha (Emerson Electric): The industrial company has increased its dividend for the last 65 years. That's excellent news for income-seeking investors, as well as growth investors. It's not often discussed that being able to grow your dividend implies having the ability to grow the earnings and cash flow to fund the increase."", 'The company\'s current dividend yield of 2% is well and fine, but it\'s not the key reason investors are holding the stock. Instead, management\'s plan to pivot the company toward automation and adjacent markets has caught the eye. Its stated aim is to ""become a pure-play global automation company serving diversified end markets,"" and management took a big step in that direction by selling its majority share in its climate technologies business in 2023.', ""That deal followed Emerson's deal in 2022 to combine its industrial software business with AspenTech to create a new Aspen Technology, of which Emerson owns 55%. The dealmaking continued in 2023 with the successful acquisition of software-connected automated test and measurement systems company NI in October. The timing of the acquisition may prove opportune as the semiconductor and consumer electronics industries are expected to pass a trough in 2024."", ""Thinking longer-term, Emerson's focus on automation makes it ideally placed to benefit from powerful reshoring trends in the U.S. economy and the drive toward using automation to enhance productivity in general.\xa0There may be better value automation-focused stocks out there. Still, they tend to be foreign, and investors who don't want to worry about exchange rate movements will prefer Emerson Electric for its combination of dividends and growth."", 'Scott Levine (Procter & Gamble): For those keen on drinking up the dividends Coca-Cola offers, Procter & Gamble will also be appealing. Like Coca-Cola, P&G is a consumer staples company with an impressive history of rewarding shareholders, hiking its dividend higher for the past 67 consecutive years.', 'How has it accomplished this striking feat? The company maintains a portfolio of leading consumer products, which helps it generate massive amounts of cash it then returns to investors. For those looking to further fortify their portfolios with a consumer staples stalwart, P&G -- and its 2.4% forward-yielding dividend -- is an ideal consideration.', 'From baby care to home care to grooming, P&G owns some of the most popular consumer staples brands found in our homes today -- and many located around the globe. And the company does an excellent job of translating sales of these items into strong cash flow. In 2023, for example, P&G converted 16.8% of its revenue into free cash flow. While this allows the company to pursue growth through acquisitions, it also helps fund its dividend payments without jeopardizing its financial well-being.', ""And that's not the only perspective from which the company's dividend looks secure. Over the past 10 years, P&G has averaged a payout ratio of 80.6%, which seems even more conservative if you discount the uncharacteristically high payout ratio of 186% it had in 2019."", ""The remarkable strength of P&G's portfolio is unlikely to wane anytime soon. In fact, it may grow even stronger if the company pursues further acquisitions or grows organically through its own innovations -- two strategies the company has excelled at over its 187-year history."", ""Moreover, it's quite probable the company will continue to increasingly reward shareholders, making the stock a great choice for those looking to supplement their passive income."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them.

Unless otherwise stated, metrics presented today will be on a comparable and FX-neutral basis throughout. Following the call, a full transcript will be made available as soon as possible on our website. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Damian."", ""Damian Gammell: Thank you, Sarah, and good morning, everybody, and many thanks for joining us today. Before I begin, I just want to take this opportunity to thank all of my great colleagues at CCEP for their continued hard work and dedication to our customers and our business. And obviously, today, we welcome our new colleagues joining us from the Philippines, a great coke market and a great addition to the CCEP story. So welcome. And again, a big thank you to everybody at CCEP for your ongoing hard work. 2023 was another great year for CCEP. We continue to execute on our clear strategy. We have an unwavering commitment to stakeholder value creation. Our retail customers importantly continue to share in our success since 2017, we've created more value for them than any of our peers."", ""And indeed, our tier store speaks for itself, validated by entering the NASDAQ 100 index late last year, we've paid a record dividend last year and now returned more than $6 billion to shareholders since 2016. We are clear on the strategic choices we make. We're making the right decisions on our portfolio to drive a more efficient business for the long-term. And from today, as I mentioned, we welcome Coca-Cola Beverage Philippines to the CCEP family, the acquisition having now formally closed. This creates an even more diverse footprint for CCEP, provides the opportunity to leverage best practice and talent, including supporting our exciting transformation journey in Indonesia. I'll come back on bulk markets a little bit later. And as always, we are supported by our strongly aligned relationship with the Coca-Cola Company and our other brand partners."", ""So now to our full year key messages. I'm really pleased with our performance in 2023, delivering on all key metrics. We achieved solid top and bottom line growth, value share gains in the market and as always, an impressive free cash flow generation. Top line growth was price/mix led, but also supported by solid volume growth in Europe, Australia and New Zealand, where we also grew transactions at of volume. We continue to invest for the long term in our portfolio, our digital journey, our supply chain, sustainability and, of course, in our people. We are a stronger and better business. We're more diverse and robust in our categories. They remain resilient despite some of the ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility. This collectively makes us well-placed for full year 2024 and beyond, underpinning our commitment to create continued shareholder value."", ""As I've talked about before, we are focused on great people, great service, great beverages, all done sustainably. So now let's take a brief look back on last year. Starting with our great people, we achieved an excellent score in our global engagement survey, position us comfortably ahead of our industry benchmark group. And we continue to be externally recognized as being a great and diverse place to work. This included our 2023 inaugural entry into the Forbes Top 200 World's Best Employers and the Top 100 World's Top Companies for Women. Great service and execution are always a key priority at CCEP as we strive to make it even easier for our customers to do business with us. We continue to invest in our supply chain like new state-of-the-art can lines in Australia, Norway and Great Britain."", ""And we were recognized for our great service in the Advantage survey results where we ranked number one globally among our top retailers up from last year. On our journey to becoming the world's most digitized bottler, we continue to invest in our broader digital capabilities. For example, around 85% of our volume is now captured digitally including our B2B portals which represent nearly 15%. And finally, our great brands and beverages. We are extremely privileged to make move and sell the world's most loved drink brands. We continue to invest and innovate to make them even better and appeal to even more consumers. In fact in Europe, over 75% of households purchased from our NARTD portfolio up 70 basis points from the previous year. And now let's look at our sustainability journey where we continued to make great progress."", ""We've achieved 55% recycled plastic content up from 48% last year. Having surpassed our 50% commitment, but our efforts do not stop there as we remain focused on our ultimate goal of a 100%. We continue to invest in sustainability focused technology to our CCEP ventures arm and we are proud to be part of the Coca-Cola System Sustainable Venture Capital Fund. A big milestone was the validation of our carbon emissions targets by the science-based targets initiative across all of our markets including API. This includes both our 2030 30% greenhouse gas reduction and our long-term 2040 net zero targets. And importantly, we continue to be recognized externally retaining our inclusion on the CDP's A List for climate and maintaining our MSCI AAA ESG rating."", ""So now turning to our performance highlights. As I mentioned earlier, we delivered a solid top-line performance. Solid underlying demand in our developed markets alongside grading in-market execution drove volume growth in Europe of 0.5% despite what you will all recall was a very mixed summer in terms of weather. Excluding the strategic choices we've made we saw underlying volume growth in Europe of 1% and in Australia and New Zealand of 2%. In Indonesia, we made good progress with our long-term transformation journey, which I will come on to in a bit more detail later. Execution of our revenue and margin growth management initiatives along with our dynamic price and promotion strategies across a broad pack offering drove solid revenue per case growth of 8.5%."", 'Headline pricing last year although ahead of pre-pandemic levels was below realized cost inflation as we continue to prioritize relevance and affordability for our consumers. Now to the NARTD category overall. It remains resilient, growing in volume terms by 8% -- in value terms by 8% -- in value terms by 8% in Europe and 9% in API. We gained value share both in-store and online and continue to win with our customers, supported by some great activation. Our strong top line performance, together with our continued focus on efficiency as we close out our full year 2021 to 2023 efficiency programs drove strong operating profit growth of 13.5%. This, in turn, supported impressive comparable free cash flow generation of just over €1.7 billion and the return to the top end of our target leverage range as guided.', ""I'd now like to hand over to Nik to talk to more detail to the financials. Over to you, Nik."", ""Nik Jhangiani: Thank you, Damian, and thank you all for joining us today. Let me start by taking you through our financial summary. We delivered comparable revenue of €18.3 billion, an increase of 8%, which I'll come back to shortly. Cost per unit case increased by 7.5%, broadly aligned with our guidance of around 8%. This was driven by our increased revenue per unit case, driving higher concentrate costs through our incidence pricing model, inflation in manufacturing, and commodities. High single-digit growth in commodities reflected higher sugar and aluminum pricing, partly offset by lower gas and power and recycled PET pricing. This equated to gross margin expansion of around 80 basis points with Europe ahead of that number."", ""We delivered comparable operating profit growth of €2.4 billion, up 13.5%, reflecting our solid top line growth, the benefit of our ongoing efficiency programs, and our efforts on managing discretionary spend. This equated to operating margin expansion of around 60 basis points, reflecting our focus on returning to our 2019 operating margin baseline. In line with our guidance, our comparable effective tax rate increased to 24% from 22% in 2022. This is largely due to the differences in the mix of taxable profits across our different territories and known tax rate increases, such as last year's U.K. tax rate increase to 25%, which comes into full effect in the 2024 calendar year for the full year. This resulted in a comparable diluted earnings per share of €3.71, up 12%."", ""Free cash flow generation, as Damian referenced, continues to be a core priority, and we delivered an impressive €1.7 billion on a comparable basis, which I'll cover in more detail shortly. Our returns on invested capital increased by 120 basis points to 10.3% on a comparable basis, driven by the increase in profit after tax and our continued focus on capital allocation. And finally, on shareholder returns, we paid a record dividend per share of €1.84, up 9.5% versus 2022. Now, to our revenue highlights. As Damian mentioned, the strong growth in our top line was driven by an increase in revenue per case with reported volumes down 0.5% for the year. This reflects the strategic choices we made driven by our SKU rationalization in Indonesia and the exit of bulk water across a number of our markets, namely in Australia, Germany, and Spain."", 'Excluding these one-offs, volume overall would have been up around 1%. Specifically, in the fourth quarter, our volumes were up 1%, reflecting resilient consumer demand, supported by great Christmas activation, and in-market execution. Revenue per unit case grew by 8.5% for the full year. This reflects positive headline pricing, continued focus on promotional optimization and revenue growth management initiatives. However we are not complacent. Although consumer spending has held up reasonably well we fully understand that some of our consumers are feeling the pressure. And we are seeing some shifting into retailer brands across a few categories less in colors and flavors but also more shopping and discounters. And this channel will and -- has and will continue to remain a core focus for CCEP, where we continue to grow and gain share.', ""Our consumer-centric approach remains focused on maintaining affordability and relevance for all consumers. We have great brands across a broad price pack architecture which enables shoppers to access our products across a wide spectrum of price points. It is essential now more than ever that we continue to balance premiumization for those that seek it with more affordable packs for those that need it. For example, in Spain, we've activated a popular and affordable price point on the iconic 1.25 liter pack to continue to drive frequency and household penetration. Revenue by segment is referred to here with more detailed commentary by geography, in the release. As mentioned just now, underlying volume growth of around 1% was driven by core brands where we continue to invest."", ""Here are a few examples. Coke Zero Sugar continued to achieve good share and volume growth across all key markets with volume 4%, as consumer trends for low and no-calorie beverages continue. In fact these now account for approximately 50% of our total volumes. In Energy Monster continued to outperform driving full year volume growth of 14%. Fantastic innovation continues to drive recruitment and distribution including the launch of Monster Green Zero Sugar, which has had a great start. Sports volumes were up 9% with Power Aid growth across all markets, driven by great activation and continued favorable consumer trends in this category. We will look to replicate the fantastic Women's World Cup activation in Australia and New Zealand last year alongside Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, as we look ahead to the exciting pipeline of sporting events favoring our European markets this year."", ""Fuze Tea outperformed with volumes up 23%, reflecting continued growth across Europe especially in France and Germany. And finally, we launched Jack and Coke with very encouraging results, in the fast-growing ARTD drinks category. Briefly now to a summary of the strategic choices we're making to ensure we grow our business profitably, and sustainably. We are being more choiceful about where we want to play, as you can see here. The Indonesia, 60% SKU rationalization was successfully executed and Damian will talk to that in a bit more detail later. We've already touched on the strategic exit of low-margin Bulk Water across a number of our markets and this has now largely been cycled through. And as we announced alongside the half year results last year, we have made some further strategic choices on our beverage portfolio and partnerships."", ""In Australia and New Zealand, we will maximize our extensive knowledge in the ARTD category by launching new scalable offerings aligned with the Coca-Cola Company. In this context, our partnership with Beam Sun will come to an end in the second half of 2025. And in Europe, our partnership with Capri Sun will come to an end this year. As you can see here neither of these choices will have a significant impact to CCEP. They are the right ones for the long-term success of our business, enabling a greater focus on priority categories and with our two key brand owners, the Coca-Cola Company and Monster. Now on to OpEx and our efficiency programs. We've now closed out delivery of our full year 2021 to 2023 program, which, as I mentioned earlier, supported our operating profit growth in 2023."", ""The entire program ultimately amounted to approximately €375 million of benefits, adding up to more than €700 million in total, together with our first post-merger efficiency program initiated in 2016. At our Capital Markets Day, we announced a new efficiency program aiming to deliver €350 million to €400 million of incremental savings by full year 2028. Overall, yes, it's a big number, but we feel very confident in its delivery. It will largely be enabled by leveraging digital tools, data and analytics. Of course, this is not an area that's new to us. We've been investing in digital capabilities for many years. And as Damian said, already 85% of our volume is captured digitally. For this next phase, we're moving from four legacy systems that we're still operating with today to one system as HANA."", ""That's going to be -- that's going to enable us to take a huge amount of standardization into our processes and ways of working over the next multiple years. Our large base in Bulgaria and our auto service providers will be pivotal. Already, our capability there has been transitioned from a more traditional shared service center to being a lot more focused around not just reporting but analytics and robotics. And there's a lot more we can do to build out capability beyond finance to people and culture, supply chain and the commercial areas of our business, while incorporating our new and established shared services center in Manila that we're very excited about. We said when we announced this program that the savings would be multiyear from 2024 through 2028."", ""With respect to this year, we anticipate savings of around €60 million to €70 million, which back to the previous slide, will help offset inflation. And naturally, there will be cash costs associated to deliver this program. These have been included in un-intercomparable free cash flow guidance of around €1.7 billion per year. So turning to free cash flow in more detail, a hugely important metric for us, and I'm sure for you as well. We generated €1.7 billion of comparable free cash flow in full year 2023, and this slide lays out the key components, including ongoing restructuring cash costs, as I referred to. Recognizing the importance of targeted investment, we spent around $700 million in CapEx, excluding leases on supply chain examples, which Damian gave earlier, digital and other technologies as well as cold drink equipment."", ""And as you know, working capital remains a core focus for us, and I'm really pleased that we delivered yet another year of significant benefits taking the cumulative amount to approximately $1.3 billion since 2017. Finally, you can see our comparable free cash flow excludes the one-off receipt of proceeds from the disposal of core royalties of approximately €90 million in Australia related to the acquisition of Amatil in 2021. And now for our leverage and balance sheet, we ended 2023 with net debt to comparable EBITDA ratio at three times. This means that we returned to the top end of our target leverage range of 2.5 to 3 times one year earlier than originally guided, thus firmly demonstrating the pace of de-leveraging since we closed the Amatil transaction in mid-2021."", ""Given the timing of today's closing of the Philippines acquisition, this does not include that related impact. Having said that, this will only have a modest impact on our leverage and given our strong focus on driving cash and further working capital improvements, we anticipate that we will return to within our target leverage range during this year. This, while remaining fully committed to our strong investment-grade ratings. Now, to a quick reminder of our midterm objectives, which we updated at our last Capital Markets Day. They remain unchanged and hear more for context as I come into our full year '24 guidance, which brings me into our full year '24 guidance, which is aligned with these midterm objectives. The guidance reflects our current view of market conditions and is based on an adjusted and comparable basis, which from a modeling perspective, assumes the Philippines was included in our business from the start of last year."", ""As you may have already seen, we did today provide a separate release incorporating full year '23 adjusted financial information for selected metrics for the Philippines. Please note that these growth rates are all provided on a comparable and FX-neutral basis, as it is really too early to provide specific FX guidance. Of course, we will update you as the year progresses. So we expect comparable revenue growth of around 4% and COGS copper unit case growth of around 3% to 4%, both of which will talk to shortly. With our continued focus on OpEx, as highlighted earlier, we will look to deliver comparable operating profit growth of around 7%. On interest, we do expect our underlying interest costs to be broadly flat, equating to a weighted average cost of net debt of around 1.3%, which clearly reflects a very attractive debt maturity profile."", ""The Philippines transaction has been funded through existing liquidity and incremental borrowing with a mix of euro public debt issuance completed in November '23 and local peso borrowings. Therefore, this newly acquired debt now takes our total weighted average cost of net debt for this year to be expected around still a very attractive level of around 2%. As I referred to previously, we do anticipate an upward trend on our effective tax rate, reflecting differences in the mix of taxable profits across our markets and known tax rate increases. We, therefore, expect ETR to increase to around 25% this year, up from 24%, including the full transition to the 25% tax rate in 2024 in the UK, as I referenced to earlier. We will continue to update you on our expected ETR, including our assessment of any uncertain tax positions during the course of the year."", 'On CapEx specifically, given the opportunities that lay ahead, we expect our CapEx guidance to be the top end of our range of 4% to 5% of revenue. This largely reflects two areas. Firstly, the upweighted digital investments we are making, and I spoke to that earlier and then also in the context of our new efficiency program, which will clearly be supported through those investments. And secondly, having now closed the Philippines transaction, which underpins these midterm objectives, we plan to invest a bit faster near term in this established and fast-growing market to position us for long-term success, and Damien will touch on that a bit more later. Given both opportunities are more near term in nature, we anticipate that our CapEx will be at the top end of our range for the next three years or so.', ""And finally, we do expect to deliver comparable free cash flow of around €1.7 billion, which will be after the tax cost associated with our efficiency programs. Let me provide a bit more color on the COGS guidance before handing back to Damian to talk top line, Indonesia and the Philippines. So on COGS, clearly, these comments are based on what we know today, which per unit case, we expect to increase by about 3% to 4%. Our concentrate costs are tied to our revenue per unit case growth, as you know, albeit much more balanced with volume compared to last year. We anticipate low single-digit commodity inflation. This reflects significantly higher sugar pricing in part offset by lower pricing in the other commodities. And from a hedging perspective, I'm pleased to say that we are now approximately 80% hedged for full year 2024, including the Philippines."", ""Of course, we continue to see inflationary pressures in labor within the manufacturing line. However, these will be broadly offset with lower gas and power in our plants and our continued focus on efficiency, as I talked to earlier. Finally, on tax, we have the throughput tax impact from the Netherlands change in soft drinks excise tax from €0.08 to €0.26 per liter with the offset, obviously, within revenue. And with that, I'll hand back to Damian. Damian?"", ""Damian Gammell: Thank you, Nik. And now I'd like to spend a bit of time on the revenue opportunities for 2024. We expect top line growth this year to be much more balanced between volume growth and price mix compared to last year. As Nik said earlier, our main priority is to continue to remain affordable and relevant to the consumer. And as such, we continue to manage the business for the longer term with our overall realized pricing tracking below inflation to date. We are, however, still seeing some inflationary pressures across the industry, albeit lower than last year. To that end, we've already closed pricing negotiations in a number of our markets for this year. We have great brands, which our consumers love. And on the back of the ongoing investment and innovation brands, product and packaging, our category and brands continue to support a solid growth platform for all of our customers."", ""We will continue to invest in Coca-Cola, Zero Sugar and Powerade, taking the success from the Women's World Cup in Australia with some fantastic activation plans around the key sporting events of the Olympics and France and the euros in Germany. We have some exciting innovation plans for the Coke portfolio, including a lemon-flavor extension being launched both for Coca-Cola original taste and for Zero Sugar. In Flavors, we will be launching a new tasting Fanta and also driving a label-free more sustainable Sprite pack in GB. We will build on the success of Jack Daniel's & Coke, already the number one alcohol ready-to-drink value brand in GB, coming with all our packaging this year alongside the launch of Absolute and Sprite. Energy will benefit from the wider launch of the very well-received Monster Green Zero Sugar and the launch of new and exciting flavor extensions and Reign Storm."", ""And refillable glass remains a focus where we will continue to invest and will become even more relevant with the inclusion of the Philippines for over 5% of the volumes are sold through refillable glass. So now on to the Philippines, a great strategic move for us, the best use of cash and a good deal for our shareholders. The transaction creates an even more diverse footprint for CCEP within what will now be renamed APS, Australia, Pacific and Southeast Asia. The business is established with a proven track record, and it operates in a highly attractive and growing market, led by a great local team. It provides the opportunity to leverage best practice and talent, including supporting Indonesia's transformation journey where the sparkling category, as we know, is much less developed."", ""We very much look forward to working with a like-minded now joint venture partner, Aboitiz, one of the leading conglomerates in Southeast Asia. Their considerable experience of the market and cultural dynamics will no doubt be invaluable to us as we unlock even more potential together for the Philippines business and of course, all aligned with the Coca-Cola Company. Just by way of reminder, the Philippines operates in a large and attractive NARTD category. Currently, it's valued at around €8 billion, and therefore, take CCEP's addressable market to around €140 billion. The category is fast growing, estimated at around 10% per annum in value terms, so well ahead of CCEP's current group average of 3% to 4%. The market comes with attractive macros."", ""The Philippines is the 13th largest country globally with solid GDP and population growth and importantly, a fast-growing middle class, all metrics that are clearly ahead of Europe. Within the NARTD category, sparkling is well established, representing around 55% of volume where per caps over 4 times higher than the average for Asia Pacific. There remains attractive presence for growth when compared to more developed markets. Future opportunities would include low, low sugar, energy and ARTD, so lot to aim for and leverage from the rest of the group. And it's a very established business. Last year, the business delivered around 655 million unit cases, translating into APS representing one-third of the total volumes for CCEP. It generated around EUR 1.7 billion of revenue and EUR 105 million of operating profit, so already a business with attractive scale and profitability."", ""So as you know, the transaction completed today. As we have acquired a majority 60% stake alongside Aboitiz, we will consolidate the business into our results from an accounting perspective with their minority stake recognized as a noncontrolling interest. The business delivered solid top and bottom line growth last year, although some of this did reflect the return to a more normalized performance following adverse weather in 2022, which affected sugar availability. The transaction is, therefore, immediately EPS accretive. And as Nick said earlier, has a modest impact from CCEP's leverage in 2024. Our strong focus on capital allocation and our long-term mindset will ensure we invest in this established business to support the market's long-term 10% growth expectations."", ""The transaction gives us the opportunity to reset the growth ambitions for this business, and so our capital plans today reflect that. And lastly, before you ask, we will not be talking to specific synergies in relation to the Philippines. They sit within our overall guidance for CCEP. Of course, just like we did with Amatil, we see many opportunities to share learnings and best practices in areas such as digital, technology, procurement, sustainability and indeed shared services given there's already an established capability in that area in Manila. So our legacy, as I'm confident you would agree, we have a strong track record of integrating and driving value creation. So we've already started and look forward to share more with you in due course."", ""So from one exciting market to the next, I just wanted to close out with an update on where we are with Indonesia. As you all know, we are in the early stages of our long-term transformation journey, and we are making good progress. Unfortunately, as highlighted previously, consumer spending remains under pressure, generally impacted by wider market inflation and the reduction in fuel subsidies. So clearly, that's not helping us right now, but we remain focused on the longer-term opportunity. As I said earlier, the sparkling category in Indonesia is much less developed than in the Philippines at less than 10% of the NARTD category. We've successfully executed our portfolio plans. We now have a much tighter portfolio. We're focused on winning in sparkling and ready-to-drink tea."", ""Beyond the brand portfolio, we've completed a new price-packed channel strategy, which incorporates a deeper understanding of the Indonesian consumer sensitivities and affordability. We're working on building out new drinking occasions across the calendar beyond the must-win Ramadan period. This is a picture of the annual Jakarta Fair, the biggest consumer event in Indonesia where we executed our biggest activations yet in 2023. And alongside the Coca-Cola Company, we are focused on younger consumer recruitment. We are taking the right decisions to reengineer both our cost base and the route to market for the longer-term. We've implemented a comprehensive productivity program, while starting to move our largely direct route to market to a more fit-for-purpose and indirect model."", ""We are starting to see progress, a few examples of which I will share on the next slide. Just to talk to a few here. Sparkling transactions, a key metric are growing ahead of volume and Coke Trademark is achieving decade record volumes in what is a traditionally Sprite led market. As you would expect, we are fully aligned with the Coca-Cola Company on our brand priorities in Indonesia. A good example being the recent launch of Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and Sprite Zero, a really great opportunity for the future and off to a promising start. As I said just now, we are focused on recruiting younger consumers. We've step changed our approach to Gen Z, incorporating nearly 900 influencers with a combined following of nearly 370 million. That's more to me."", ""One of which is on the slide here with around 1.3 million followers alone. On sustainability, we are owning our circularly journey from day one through the right partnerships and investments. You can see here the significant progress we've already made on recycled content, supported by the first-to-market launch of 100% recycled PET bottles in Indonesia achieved through an industry partnership recycling facility just outside of Jakarta. And importantly, despite all of the change, our colleagues are highly engaged in the fact that had a CCEP average, which is great to see. So we remain confident in our future in Indonesia, and as always, look forward to updating you more in due course. So finally, to our closing remarks. As I said at the start, 2023 was another great year for CCEP, delivering on all key metrics."", ""We continue to execute on our clear strategy. We continue to invest for the long-term in our portfolio, our digital journey, supply chain, sustainability and, of course, in our people. We are a stronger and better business, more diverse, now including the great market of the Philippines, and robust -- and our categories remain resilient despite ongoing macroeconomic and some geopolitical volatility. This collectively makes us well-placed for the full year 2024, and beyond underpinning our commitment to create continued shareholder value. To close, I would particularly like to thank our customers, our brand partners and again, our colleagues whose hard work and commitment mean we're able to go further together for all our stakeholders. So again, thank you very much."", 'Nik and I will now be happy to take your questions.

If you want to skip our coverage of the latest stock market news and some recent trends, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Major Stocks to Buy Right Now. ', ""The start of 2024 for the stock market is more of the same. The first month of the year saw investors turn their attention to the Federal Reserve as usual in order to set expectations for the remainder of 2024. The Fed, if you're unaware, has been rapidly raising interest rates to combat inflation. Now that inflation has started to drop, Wall Street is eager to know when rates will start to drop, and on this front, ironically, the economy is proving to be the biggest hurdle in forcing the Fed's hand."", ""Higher interest rates increase the cost of doing business and restrict consumer access to capital. This means that firms have a tougher time posting both revenue and earnings growth, and when their figures don't grow, neither does the economy. However, since the American economy continues to outshine peers, the Fed has more leeway to keep rates higher and deflate Wall Street's balloon that had become accustomed to easy money after the 2008 Great Recession and the more recent coronavirus pandemic."", ""At the same time, even as rates are high, the stock market is still continuing to impress. In fact, bears have been left rather red faced as major indexes such as the NASDAQ Composite and the S&P 500 have continued to soar despite the depressing effects that high interest rates have on stock valuation. In fact, despite the tepid interest rate environment, it's the S&P 500 that has once again proven that no matter how shrewd analysts are, they can still miss out on major trends."", 'This is because the flagship Wall Street stock index which contains the crown jewels of the American stock market set a new all time record in February 2024 when it soared above 5,000 points for the first time in its history. Quite a sharp turnaround from the tail end of 2022 had seen speculation far and wide that a recession was incoming and that everyone should batten down their hatches.', ""Just like 2023 saw the NASDAQ 100 soar to new highs on the back of major stocks such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). 2024's record setting index levels are also influenced by such companies. The start of the year ushered in all important earnings season that saw major stocks the likes of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) take the lead on the artificial intelligence front. A.I. was the biggest theme on the stock market last year, and the mega stock earnings calls saw their management share strategies about costs, future plans, and other data that investors parsed over with eagle eyes to see whether the hype in A.I. is really worth investing in."", ""And as we've seen through major stock performance in 2024, seems like investors are impressed. Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, and NVIDIA's shares are up by 7.64%, 35%, 13%, and 49.7%, year to date, respectively. This shows that even though small cap stocks that are often touted for their ability to deliver double digit and higher percentage returns, major stocks the likes of some of the magnificent seven that we've talked about above can also stun everyone given the market and economic contexts align in their favor."", 'Before we head on to the best major stocks to buy, another big news for these stocks this year has come from Meta. Meta has traditionally been a high growth technology company whose income statement for years was a classic example of a venture capital model that saw negative profits but revenue growth. Yet in 2024 Meta declared a 50 cent dividend for the first time in its history to mark its entry into the list of stable big guns that can regularly pay out their profits to investors as a reward for patience and belief.', 'So, as major stocks continue to shine, which ones are hedge funds interested in?

There are a number of credible reports out there that discuss the behavior of financial markets during US election years. For example, a Morgan Stanley report analyzed some data to see how the S&P 500 performs during election years. This analysis shows that during presidential election years from 1928 through 2016, the stock market has seen more positive performance than negative. The report also said the election of a Republican president resulted in average gains of 15.3% for the S&P 500, compared to a 7.6% gain when a Democrat president comes in the White House."", 'A 2020 report by T. Rowe Price analyzed historical data on the connection between US elections and the stock market and found some interesting patterns. For example, the report said if the stock market performance is strong ahead of elections in the US, data shows that chances of the incumbent party staying in power increase. On the other hand, when the stock market is soft heading into elections, incumbent party often loses. But does that mean President Joe Biden could notch a second term if the Fed begins to cut rates in the summer and stocks keep gaining ahead of the election? That would be wrong conclusion to deduce from this pattern as the T. Rowe report shed light on a plethora of factors that affect the relationship between the stock market performance and election results. The report also said historical data shows if the incumbent party loses an election, a recession year follows:', '""Conventional wisdom argues that stock markets tend to perform poorly ahead of elections. Since 70% of the years when the incumbent party lost were followed by a recession year, it makes sense that equity markets performed poorly in the wake of the elections when the incumbent party lost.""', 'If you were to ask an average American today about the hottest issues that would be the point of focus in the US election this year, chances are that their answer would be inflation. But we are still months away from the election and a lot could change. Morgan Stanley analyst Michael D. Zezas recently said in a report that in 2008 expectations were that the elections would move around the US foreign policy. But the financial crisis changed everything. Similarly, presidential candidates in the US election 2020 focused their energies on healthcare and pandemic.', 'Photo by History in HD on UnsplashMethodology For this article we went through multiple research reports and analyses of experts who took a look at what stocks and sectors usually benefit during election years.

It was a credible result overall, with revenues of US$14b and statutory earnings per share of US$3.49 both in line with analyst estimates, showing that LKQ is executing in line with expectations. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their earnings models, following these results."", ' Check out our latest analysis for LKQ ', ""After the latest results, the eleven analysts covering LKQ are now predicting revenues of US$15.3b in 2024.

In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$15.2b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$3.85 in 2024.

Compare this with other companies in the same industry, which are forecast to grow their revenue 4.9% annually. It seems obvious that, while the growth outlook is brighter than the recent past, the analysts also expect LKQ to grow faster than the wider industry."", 'The biggest concern is that the analysts reduced their earnings per share estimates, suggesting business headwinds could lay ahead for LKQ.

But I'd argue that you can count on one hand how many dividend stocks are in the same league as Coke when it comes to paying and raising a reliable dividend."", ""Coke isn't the kind of company that needs to deliver outstanding growth. All it has to do is grow earnings per share in the mid-single-digit range per year, and it can fund a sizable buyback program and grow its payout.\xa0Coke's 2023 performance and latest dividend raise validate why Coke remains a top-tier dividend stock to buy and hold for decades to come."", ""Lee Samaha (Emerson Electric): The industrial company has increased its dividend for the last 65 years. That's excellent news for income-seeking investors, as well as growth investors. It's not often discussed that being able to grow your dividend implies having the ability to grow the earnings and cash flow to fund the increase."", 'The company\'s current dividend yield of 2% is well and fine, but it\'s not the key reason investors are holding the stock. Instead, management\'s plan to pivot the company toward automation and adjacent markets has caught the eye. Its stated aim is to ""become a pure-play global automation company serving diversified end markets,"" and management took a big step in that direction by selling its majority share in its climate technologies business in 2023.', ""That deal followed Emerson's deal in 2022 to combine its industrial software business with AspenTech to create a new Aspen Technology, of which Emerson owns 55%. The dealmaking continued in 2023 with the successful acquisition of software-connected automated test and measurement systems company NI in October. The timing of the acquisition may prove opportune as the semiconductor and consumer electronics industries are expected to pass a trough in 2024."", ""Thinking longer-term, Emerson's focus on automation makes it ideally placed to benefit from powerful reshoring trends in the U.S. economy and the drive toward using automation to enhance productivity in general.\xa0There may be better value automation-focused stocks out there. Still, they tend to be foreign, and investors who don't want to worry about exchange rate movements will prefer Emerson Electric for its combination of dividends and growth."", 'Scott Levine (Procter & Gamble): For those keen on drinking up the dividends Coca-Cola offers, Procter & Gamble will also be appealing. Like Coca-Cola, P&G is a consumer staples company with an impressive history of rewarding shareholders, hiking its dividend higher for the past 67 consecutive years.', 'How has it accomplished this striking feat? The company maintains a portfolio of leading consumer products, which helps it generate massive amounts of cash it then returns to investors. For those looking to further fortify their portfolios with a consumer staples stalwart, P&G -- and its 2.4% forward-yielding dividend -- is an ideal consideration.', 'From baby care to home care to grooming, P&G owns some of the most popular consumer staples brands found in our homes today -- and many located around the globe. And the company does an excellent job of translating sales of these items into strong cash flow. In 2023, for example, P&G converted 16.8% of its revenue into free cash flow. While this allows the company to pursue growth through acquisitions, it also helps fund its dividend payments without jeopardizing its financial well-being.', ""And that's not the only perspective from which the company's dividend looks secure. Over the past 10 years, P&G has averaged a payout ratio of 80.6%, which seems even more conservative if you discount the uncharacteristically high payout ratio of 186% it had in 2019."", ""The remarkable strength of P&G's portfolio is unlikely to wane anytime soon. In fact, it may grow even stronger if the company pursues further acquisitions or grows organically through its own innovations -- two strategies the company has excelled at over its 187-year history."", ""Moreover, it's quite probable the company will continue to increasingly reward shareholders, making the stock a great choice for those looking to supplement their passive income."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them.

In addition to this, looking back to 1960, 69% of the overall return of the S&P 500 Index can be credited to the reinvestment of dividends and the compounded growth they generate over time.', 'There has been a new angle on dividend investing cropping up lately. Traditionally, investors leaned towards companies offering hefty dividends, assuming they were more dependable. However, recent studies suggest that companies maintaining a balance with sustainable dividends, without excessively high payouts, have actually yielded superior returns over the long term. A research conducted by Wellington Management\xa0split dividend-paying companies into five groups and then sorted them based on their payout levels from highest to lowest. Surprisingly, the companies that performed better than the S&P 500 Index fell into the second-highest quintile rather than the highest. This unexpected outcome suggests that some companies may have been overdoing it with their dividend payouts, leaving themselves with less capital for future growth. Meanwhile, companies with more moderate payouts were able to reinvest their earnings and maintain enough flexibility to continue offering steady dividends in the long run.', 'Apart from reliable dividends, the growth of dividends is also crucial to contemplate when investing in dividend stocks. According to research conducted by Ned Davis Research, companies that either increased or began paying dividends yielded the highest returns compared to other stocks, and they exhibited considerably less volatility. Additionally, the study highlighted a robust relationship between companies that consistently enhance their dividends and those boasting strong fundamentals, well-defined business strategies, and a sincere dedication to their shareholders. The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) stand out as top choices for dividend investors. These companies have demonstrated a strong dedication to their shareholders by consistently increasing their dividend payouts over many years.', ""While it's difficult to forecast the stock market's performance with absolute certainty, analysts are optimistic about dividend-paying stocks for 2024, especially following their subpar performance in 2023. In the Bloomberg Outlook report, analysts from Citigroup offered their perspective on investing in dividend stocks for the year 2024. Here are the comments:"", '“With investors swept up in the artificial intelligence fervor, valuations for dividend-paying stocks have quietly drifted toward multi-decade lows compared to the broader market.

However, the return on invested capital for airlines is still expected to come close to 5% this year and there is scope for the airlines to do better than forecast. Passenger traffic will reach or surpass 2019 levels in all regions in 2024, but recovering the four years of lost growth will take a good deal longer.

Don't buy into that; history suggests that rate isn't sustainable."", ""Investors interested in good yields on REITs will be better off with Federal Realty (NYSE: FRT), Realty Income (NYSE: O), or Essex Property Trust (NYSE: ESS), all of which have increased their dividends annually for decades. Here's why these three unstoppable stocks are better buys."", ""Pardon the punny Lord of the Rings reference above, but it really does describe the situation. You only need one chart to see why most investors will be better off avoiding Annaly Capital and its giant dividend yield. The chart below shows that despite the yield being fairly lofty on an ongoing basis (the orange line), the dividend and stock price (purple and blue) have both been heading lower since around 2010. That's a terrible chart for any investor trying to find a reliable dividend-paying stock."", 'Now add in the complexity of the mortgage REIT business, which can be impacted by interest rates, housing market dynamics, mortgage payment trends, and refinancing activity, among other things. There are just too many checks in the negative column for most average investors here. But there are plenty of other REITs you can buy with incredible dividend track records.', ""Although Federal Realty's dividend yield is a fairly modest 4.3%, it stands head and shoulders above all other public REITs because it is the only Dividend King in the group. It has achieved this dividend success by focusing on a small, high-quality portfolio of strip malls and mixed-use assets. The story is location, location, location, as it operates in areas with average wealth and population size metrics that are higher than any of its strip mall peers. If dividend consistency is important to you, Federal Realty needs to be on your watch list if not in your portfolio."", 'Realty Income pays dividends monthly and has increased its dividend annually for nearly three decades. The dividend yield is currently around 5.8%. The core of the REIT\'s portfolio is single-tenant net lease retail properties, though it also has some modest exposure to industrial assets and ""other"" (the other grouping includes vineyards and casinos). Net leases require the tenant to pay for most property-level operating costs. Although a property with just one tenant is high risk, across a large enough portfolio, the risk is fairly low -- Realty Income owns over 15,000 properties and is one of the largest net lease REITs you can buy. The REIT is so focused on returning dividends to investors that it trademarked the nickname ""The Monthly Dividend Company."" It\'s a sleep-well-at-night REIT.', ""Essex owns apartment buildings on the West Coast. That's a concentration risk, geographically speaking, as it ties the landlord's fortunes to technology-dependent regions. And yet, the dividend has been increased annually for nearly 30 years. Clearly, the bet on the West Coast has worked out well so far. The core of the business suggests that won't change, given that Essex is highly focused on owning modern, amenity-rich apartments. These tend to be in high demand regardless of what's going on in any given sector. Not every year is a good one, and 2024 is expected to see just flat financial performance, thanks to higher interest rates, among other things. But the 3.9% dividend yield here is actually near the highest levels of the past decade, suggesting the stock is historically cheap right now."", ""As you can see with Annaly over the past decade or so, a huge yield can lead dividend investors down a bad investment path. You'd be better off focusing on REITs that have proven they can perform well in good markets and bad, with that evidence coming from a steadily growing dividend.

Similarly, the copper market is projected to reach $240.52 billion in 2028, indicating a CAGR of 7.5% throughout the forecast period of 2024-28.\xa0', ""Global copper producers experienced strong demand from China in the first half of the year due to decarbonization efforts, countering a weak property market. However, the future outlook depends on Beijing's stimulus measures. The copper market may shift into a modest, multiyear surplus until 2025, driven by increased mined supply. Similarly, South America's challenging regulatory and political environments may support the market in the midterm. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, near-term copper prices could dip below $8,000 a ton, with marginal cost support around $7,400. Miners anticipate a significant output increase in the second half of this year, with 2024 showing a potential 4-4.5% growth in mined supply. However, Bloomberg suggests that the benefits of greenfield and brownfield projects may start to diminish from 2027. Regulatory approvals could become more protracted, potentially causing a slowdown in mined copper supply growth by the middle of the decade, leading to market deficits by the end of the decade unless development speeds up."", 'According to a January 2024 CNBC report, copper prices are projected to surge by over 75% in the next two years due to disruptions in mining supply and increased demand for the metal, particularly driven by the global push for renewable energy. The rise in demand, fueled by the green energy transition, coupled with an expected decline in the US dollar in the latter half of 2024, is expected to contribute to the upward trend in copper prices. Market expectations of potential rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve this year, leading to a weaker dollar, are seen as a factor making US dollar-priced copper more appealing to foreign buyers.', 'Over 60 countries endorsed a plan at the recent COP28 climate change conference to triple global renewable energy capacity by 2030. Citibank sees this development as highly positive for copper. In a December report, the bank predicted that the increased targets for renewable energy would lead to an additional demand for 4.2 million tons of copper by 2030. This surge in demand could potentially drive copper prices to $15,000 per ton in 2025, surpassing the previous record peak of $10,730 per ton reached in March 2023.

Constant ""innovation"" in flavors and ingredients is to blame. (Right now, I\'m sipping a Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) ""made with AI"" -- such are the times we live in!) We young consumers like our variety and change.', ""And yet, energy drinks are a fiercely competitive field, dominated by big players Red Bull and Monster Beverage (NASDAQ: MNST). Celsius has some oddities in its history, and there have been plenty of doubts its epic rise was even possible. Despite some of my own doubts that it will continue, I recently bought a small starter position. Here's why."", ""Besides the whole secular growth trend favoring energy drinks and caffeinated beverages, there's another simple reason I decided to buy a little Celsius. After holding Disney (NYSE: DIS) for well over a decade (around the time a younger and just-as-nerdy version of me was excited about the company launching a new era of Star Wars), it was high time to part ways."", ""I recently sold all my Disney stock. For a holding that old in my portfolio, it was an egregious underperformer. This was an exit I've been planning for over a year, and Celsius is but one consumer-facing stock I decided to buy as a replacement."", 'Consumer goods don\'t exactly dominate my attention these days -- semiconductors and accelerated computing do, thus the choice of a ""Coke AI"" as an afternoon pick-me-up. So, it was time to brush up on Celsius\' history again.', 'The last time I took a hard look was in 2022, when PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) was investing in Celsius in exchange for becoming a distribution partner in the U.S. Pepsi scored a $550 million investment in brand-new convertible preferred stock that pays out a 5% annual dividend. We ordinary shareholders get no such dividend from Celsius. At the time, it seemed like Pepsi was landing a deal to scoop up most of the profitability from any future Celsius growth.', 'Now, what I do know is that marketing a hot consumer brand is key, but the food and beverage industry is also largely dominated by big distributors. After all, part of Monster\'s wildly successful run (including a name change from ""Hansen Natural"" to Monster back in 2012) has been at least partly attributable to its distribution partnership with titan Coca-Cola. But Celsius signing on with Pepsi in exchange for a big equity slice didn\'t excite me. I was wrong.', ""Plugging into PepsiCo's distribution has worked wonders for Celsius -- Pepsi has accounted for nearly 61% of Celsius' distribution through the first nine months of 2023 (versus 12% in the comparable period in 2022). Revenue soared, and profits have begun to rise as well.

The same can't be said for consumer food brands like PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP). The S&P 500 has posted a 24% total return in the past year, but PepsiCo stock is slightly down as investors worry about declining volumes and the effects of weight-loss drugs on future customer demand."", 'Despite these fears, PepsiCo just raised its dividend yet again -- marking 52 straight years of dividend increases -- putting its forward dividend yield above 3% for the first time since the March 2020 low. Does that make the stock a good buy for long-term investors?', 'PepsiCo is more than just its namesake soda brand. The company owns other drinks such as Gatorade as well as the dominant snack food company Frito-Lay, which sells Lays, Tostitos, and other salty snack products. The company reported its fourth-quarter earnings results earlier this year, posting solid revenue growth, with total organic revenue growth up 9% year over year to $91.4 billion.', 'Despite a global presence, the two most important categories for PespiCo are North American drinks and North American food and snacks. Combined, North American Pepsi and Frito-Lay segments brought in $52 billion in revenue last fiscal year and $9 billion in operating earnings. Its home markets still drive the bus, with the company able to consistently raise prices year after year.', ""Now, there are fears this two-headed growth engine is over. Last fiscal year, Pepsi's volume declined 5% in North America, with Frito-Lay down 1% compared to the previous year. Both segments are still growing revenue due to price increases, but it is possible that the company is finally hitting a ceiling where consumers are pushing back against price increases for their favorite soda and potato chip brands."", 'No company has infinite pricing power, and PepsiCo may be stretching its brand power too thin at the moment. Or, perhaps there is another culprit.', 'New weight-loss drugs such as Ozempic have taken wealthier countries by storm in the last few years, with millions of people now on these medications. Analysts predict that 7% or more of the United States population could be taking these drugs by 2035. Forty percent of the population is considered obese, and you could make an argument that companies such as PepsiCo are partly to blame for the problem.', ""These drugs work by depressing cravings and appetites, which lead people to eat fewer calories. More specifically, it looks like people are eating less junk food when using these drugs. That could pose a huge demand problem for Pepsi soda or Lay's potato chips. It is possible that these headwinds are already showing up in Pepsi's operating metrics with volumes suddenly turning down in North America last year."", ""You might think 7% of the population on Ozempic won't present a huge headwind for PepsiCo. But remember that soda, snack food, and candy consumption is not evenly distributed among the U.S. population; it is skewed toward the obese and diabetic citizens who would be taking Ozempic in this scenario. This could end up being a huge demand hit for PepsiCo if usage of these drugs continues to grow for the rest of this decade."", ""Even if PepsiCo looks more like a tobacco company in the near future -- meaning volume declines combined with price increases -- it isn't the end of the world. Tobacco stocks have been some of the best-performing stocks of all time as investors continually underrated their ability to raise prices ahead of inflation."", ""The same could play out for PepsiCo, especially if the company's snack foods become more of an occasional treat instead of a daily consumption habit. With a dividend yield of 3%, now looks like a fine entry point for investors looking to buy a dividend grower at a reasonable price."", ""Still, investors need to pay close attention to PepsiCo's volume declines. Weight-loss drugs could be an overrated threat, but the declines could also be the canary in the coal mine for the future of the soda and snack food sector.
