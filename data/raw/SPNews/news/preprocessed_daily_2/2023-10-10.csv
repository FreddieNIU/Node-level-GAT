0,d312a7f4-a13c-33bf-83ad-dc9312aefa46,SCHW,2023-10-10,Is Schwab Fundamental Emerging Markets Large Company Index ETF (FNDE) a Strong ETF Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schwab-fundamental-emerging-markets-large-102007278.html,1696933207,STORY,['SCHW'],"[A smart beta exchange traded fund, the Schwab Fundamental Emerging Markets Large Company Index ETF (FNDE) debuted on 08/13/2013, and offers broad exposure to the Broad Developed Market ETFs category of the market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?Market cap weighted indexes were created to reflect the market, or a specific segment of the market, and the ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on this strategy.Market cap weighted indexes offer a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns, and are a good option for investors who believe in market efficiency.There are some investors, though, who think it's possible to beat the market with great stock selection; this group likely invests in another class of funds known as smart beta, which track non-cap weighted strategies.This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.This area offers many different investment choices, such as simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies; however, not all of these strategies can deliver superior results.Fund Sponsor &amp; IndexManaged by Charles Schwab, FNDE has amassed assets over $4.87 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs in the Broad Developed Market ETFs. Before fees and expenses, this particular fund seeks to match the performance of the Russell RAFI Emerging Markets Large Co. Index (Net).The Russell RAFI Emerging Markets Large Company Index (Net) ranks companies in the Russell Emerging Markets Index by measures of fundamental size and tracks the performance of those companies whose fundamental scores are in the top 87.5% of the Russell Emerging Markets Index.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long-term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins, other things remaining the same.Story continuesAnnual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.39%, making it on par with most peer products in the space.The fund has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 5.37%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.Taking into account individual holdings, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing accounts for about 4.08% of the fund's total assets, followed by China Construction Bank Corp H and Hon Hai Precision Industry Ltd.The top 10 holdings account for about 4.08% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskYear-to-date, the Schwab Fundamental Emerging Markets Large Company Index ETF has gained about 5.68% so far, and is up roughly 13.61% over the last 12 months (as of 10/10/2023). FNDE has traded between $23.19 and $28.35 in this past 52-week period.The fund has a beta of 0.76 and standard deviation of 17.03% for the trailing three-year period, which makes FNDE a medium risk choice in this particular space. With about 399 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab Fundamental Emerging Markets Large Company Index ETF is not a suitable option for investors seeking to outperform the Broad Developed Market ETFs segment of the market. Instead, there are other ETFs in the space which investors should consider.IShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (IEMG) tracks MSCI Emerging Markets Investable Market Index and the Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (VWO) tracks FTSE Emerging Markets All Cap China A Inclusion Index. IShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF has $68.42 billion in assets, Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF has $69.72 billion. IEMG has an expense ratio of 0.09% and VWO charges 0.08%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Broad Developed Market ETFs.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

1,ceadd31c-6ba1-3558-8d82-e58bd940e071,SCHW,2023-10-10,Analysts Estimate The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-charles-schwab-corporation-140005062.html,1696860005,STORY,['SCHW'],"[The market expects The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 16, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.76 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -30.9%.Revenues are expected to be $4.69 billion, down 14.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.01% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for The Charles Schwab Corporation?For The Charles Schwab Corporation, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.45%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that The Charles Schwab Corporation will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that The Charles Schwab Corporation would post earnings of $0.72 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.75, delivering a surprise of +4.17%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.The Charles Schwab Corporation doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The favorable estimate revisions instill investor confidence in the stock.Positive Earnings Surprise HistoryCF Industries outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters.

ROE for the trailing 12-months for CF Industries is 31.2%, above the industry’s level of 23%.Attractive ValuationValuation looks attractive as CF’s shares are currently trading at a level that is lower than the industry average, suggesting that the stock still has upside potential.Going by the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization) multiple, which is often used to value fertilizer stocks, CF is currently trading at trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA multiple of 3.82, cheaper compared with the industry average of 6.60.Healthy Nitrogen Demand &amp; Lower Gas Costs Bode WellCF Industries is benefiting from healthy nitrogen fertilizer demand in major markets and lower natural gas costs. The company is well-positioned to capitalize on rising nitrogen fertilizer demand in major markets. Higher crop commodity prices are contributing to healthy demand globally.Demand for nitrogen in North America is expected to be driven by high levels of corn planted acres in the United States and favorable farm economics. Moreover, increased planted corn acres, higher crop prices and healthy farm economics are likely to support urea demand in Brazil. CF also expects demand in India to be driven by the government’s plans to maintain high urea volumes in stock.Lower natural gas prices are also acting in the company’s favor. CF Industries saw a significant decline in natural gas costs in the second quarter of 2023. Average cost of natural gas fell to $2.75 per MMBtu in the second quarter of 2023 from $7.05 per MMBtu in the year-ago quarter.

Following these closures, there will be 52 remaining Starbucks locations in the city.Starbucks did not disclose the reason for the closures. In a letter to employees, Jessica Borton, the Northern California regional vice president, stated: ""There are several factors Starbucks considers when tasked with the tough decision of closing a store, but it is all part of ensuring a healthy store portfolio.""Starbucks isn't the only consumer-facing giant to take a second look at its San Francisco portfolio this year.Other companies that recently closed locations in San Francisco include Amazon (AMZN), which closed a Whole Foods Market just 13 months after opening it earlier this year and all four Amazon Go Stores in March; Office Depot (ODP), which closed a store in April; and Anthropologie (URBN), which left Union Square after two decades in May.Gap (GPS) also shuttered Old Navy, Banana Republic, and Athleta stores this year, while Nordstrom (JWN) closed its flagship store in August, and Saks Off 5th shut its doors this fall.The Starbucks stores being added to this list are located on Mission and Main, Geary and Taylor, 425 Battery, 398 Market, 4th and Market, 555 California, and Bush and Van Ness. It's worth noting that none of the stores set to close are unionized and employees at the stores will be offered the opportunity to transfer to other locations.San Francisco sluggish in returning to officesWhat's behind the exodus? Hybrid and fully remote companies may be partly to blame.""A big component for sure is that people are remote working and not coming into those offices as much,"" John Zolidis, president of Quo Vadis Capital, told Yahoo Finance. ""That's got to be one of the driving forces — just less traffic from office workers.""Story continuesA customer leaves a Starbucks coffee shop in San Francisco, Calif., on Sept. 13, 2018. (Robert Alexander/Getty Images) (Robert Alexander via Getty Images)Per foot traffic analytics platform Placer.ai, San Francisco has the lowest number of visits to offices of any major US city. In August 2023, office visits were down 52.7% compared to August 2019, before the pandemic disrupted workplaces.San Francisco is ""by far the slowest to come back,"" Ethan Chernofsky, senior vice president of marketing at Placer.ai, told Yahoo Finance. ""When you think about what that means for retail more broadly ... lots of people work there and then shop there and eat there, so that's obviously going to have an impact. ... Then, even [the] people who are coming back to the office [are] not doing so five days a week.""Migration patterns — such as people moving out of the city — are a factor too, Chernofsky said, affecting cities across the US as well as San Francisco. And if retailers leave a city, it can lead to fewer visits to that area as well, causing companies to further reconsider their real estate portfolios.""We see significant headroom for new store growth in underpenetrated areas in the US, including smaller cities, as well as new formats in larger metros,"" Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan said on a call with investors following its Q3 earnings results.However, the tide may be turning for San Francisco, with the artificial intelligence boom acting as a bright spot for activity. Just as the tech industry was the first to move to remote work during the pandemic, it may be a leader in bringing workers back to offices.""San Francisco and the Bay Area in general is really a market that's led by the tech industry,"" Colin Yasukochi, executive director at CBRE’s Tech Insights Center, told Yahoo Finance. ""Over the last six months ... they're starting to see growth perk up in the tech industry. Artificial intelligence is one of those particular areas where the companies are actually looking to expand — they're looking to upgrade the [office] space that they currently have to provide a better experience for their employees.""Pedestrians and vehicles are visible at the base of the Salesforce Tower in San Francisco, Calif., on May 5, 2022. (Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images) (Smith Collection/Gado via Getty Images)A 'difficult operating environment'Crime and safety may also be playing a role.On Sept. 26, Target (TGT) announced plans to close nine stores at the end of October, including three in the San Francisco and Oakland area. Target said crime and retail theft were the reasons behind the decision to close stores.""We cannot continue operating these stores because theft and organized retail crime are threatening the safety of our team and guests, and contributing to unsustainable business performance,"" the company said in a statement.According to crime data on the city's website, theft has been the top issue, followed by burglary. That has affected not only whether companies open retail space in the city but also where they choose to expand.""On-the-ground type of issues have probably impacted where companies are willing to be located in terms of their office space,"" Yasukochi said, ""which is why we've seen a greater concentration of companies looking for space in the central business district and less so in the South of Market or mid-market areas.""For Starbucks, though, it's a bit harder to understand if crime truly was a factor. A spokesperson for the company declined to comment on whether safety played a part in the decision in particular.""There's not large quantities of merchandise to steal and resell,"" Zolidis said about Starbucks stores, though he added: ""It's just a difficult operating environment from an employee safety perspective.""Another factor affecting how companies position themselves in the Golden State could be the approach of a minimum wage law that goes into effect on April 1. The law, which raises starting pay for fast food workers to $20 an hour, is one to watch, Zolidis said.But, he added, ""if that were a deciding factor [for Starbucks], it wouldn't be seven stores in San Francisco [but] a much broader group of stores.""Meanwhile, San Francisco Mayor London Breed remains optimistic about the city's future, despite its challenges.""People still want to be here,"" Breed told Yahoo Finance in a recent interview at Salesforce's annual Dreamforce conference.

AMD continues to benefit from acquisitions, including Xilinx and Pensando, which has diversified its business.However, weakness in the Gaming and Embedded segment revenues are expected to hurt top-line growth.

The asset divestments might hinder BP’s future cash generating opportunities going forward.BP’s balance sheet is more levered than most peers, limiting its financial flexibility. Thus, the integrated energy company is more vulnerable to economic downturn than its peers. While crude oil prices are currently on an upward trend, the broader commodity pricing environment is not as robust as it was a year ago.As a result, the Zacks analyst anticipates that the leading integrated energy company's revenue to decrease in 2023.

In prior negotiations, a strike threat was enough to spur a deal, but these talks have been slow, union representatives said on Monday.""We're not really seeing anything that's sufficient to try to avert a strike and that's unfortunate,"" Ted Pappageorge, secretary-treasurer for the Culinary Union, told reporters.Union workers will picket in front of eight MGM and Caesars resort locations on Thursday. The unions have asked casino customers not to cross picket lines.Unions in the auto, rail, healthcare and other industries have kept companies off balance in recent months with labor actions. The unions are among the most powerful in the United States, representing 53,000 hospitality workers in Las Vegas.The unions met last week with MGM, Caesars and Wynn Resorts - the three largest private employers in Las Vegas.Pappageorge said that negotiations were ""very disappointing"" and the companies did not make substantive wage proposals. The unions are demanding higher wages, stronger protections against new technology that may threaten jobs, lower housekeeping quotas and improved safety.MGM Resorts, Caesars Entertainment and Wynn Resorts did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.Some 95% of union members voted in September to authorize a citywide strike. Tourism is the city's lifeblood and Las Vegas is gearing up for major events including a Formula 1 race expected to bring more than 100,000 tourists to the city in November.In August, there were 7% fewer visitors to Las Vegas than in August 2019 before the pandemic. But room rates were more than 30% higher.MGM has said that every 1% increase in wages would add about $10 million to labor costs, according to Truist analyst Barry Jonas. He estimated wage increases could cost Caesars $40 million to $60 million a year and double that for MGM based on their employee count.

Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Cinemark Holdings (CNK) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.56 a share 25 days away from its upcoming earnings release on November 3, 2023.By taking the percentage difference between the $0.56 Most Accurate Estimate and the $0.33 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Cinemark Holdings has an Earnings ESP of 70.56%.CNK is part of a big group of Consumer Discretionary stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at MGM Resorts (MGM) as well.Slated to report earnings on November 1, 2023, MGM Resorts holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $0.69 a share 23 days from its next quarterly update.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MGM Resorts is $0.64, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 8.01%.Story continuesCNK and MGM's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores.

The company's interest coverage ratio of 0, positions it worse than 0% of 566 companies in the Travel &amp; Leisure industry. This ratio highlights potential challenges the company might face when handling its interest expenses on outstanding debt.The company's Altman Z-Scoreis just -0.22, which is below the distress zone of 1.81. This suggests that the company may face financial distress over the next few years. Additionally, the company's low cash-to-debt ratio at 0.07 indicates a struggle in handling existing debt levels.The company's debt-to-equity ratio is 903.85, which is worse than 100% of 663 companies in the Travel &amp; Leisure industry.

Positive investor sentiments were witnessed because of pent-up demand and solid interest from additional cinema operators in playing the concert film.

Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.59%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.39%.Heading into today, shares of the chipmaker had gained 0.96% over the past month, outpacing the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 2.3% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 3.39% in that time.Market participants will be closely following the financial results of Microchip Technology in its upcoming release. In that report, analysts expect Microchip Technology to post earnings of $1.62 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 10.96%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $2.26 billion, up 8.95% from the year-ago period.In terms of the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates predict earnings of $6.07 per share and a revenue of $8.69 billion, indicating changes of +0.83% and +8.01%, respectively, from the former year.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Microchip Technology. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

This valuation marks a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 17.6.We can additionally observe that MCHP currently boasts a PEG ratio of 1.09.

MET, American International Group Inc. AIG, The Hartford Financial Services Group HIG, Everest Group, Ltd. EG and MGIC Investment Corp. MTG.Industry: Insurance (Multi-line)Link: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2161629/5-multiline-insurers-worth-buying-despite-industry-challengesProduct diversification helps Zacks Multiline Insurance industry players lower concentration risk, ensure uninterrupted revenue generation and improve retention ratio. Better pricing, prudent underwriting, increased exposure, faster economic recovery on the receding impact of the pandemic and increased vaccinations should benefit MetLife Inc., American International Group Inc., The Hartford Financial Services Group, Everest Group, Ltd. and MGIC Investment Corp. Accelerated digitalization will help in the smooth functioning of the industry.The solid capital level of the multiline insurers will fuel merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activities. With four rate hikes this year already, investment income should improve further as insurers are beneficiaries of a better rate environment.About the IndustryThe Zacks Multiline Insurance industry comprises companies that provide single insurance coverage, bundling automobile, homeowner, long-term care, and life and health insurance to individuals and businesses. The insured pays a single premium and is covered for many things through a single contract.These companies cover commercial and personal properties, automobiles, marine, livestock, aviation, personal accident, life, including permanent and term insurance, supplemental accident and health insurance, workers' compensation, annuity products, private mortgage insurance, et al. The players also provide risk management services.Since the companies offer single insurance coverage for multiple products, customer retention improves. The insured stands to benefit from lower premium payment compared to paying individual premiums for insuring varied products.Story continues3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Multiline Insurance IndustryDiversified portfolio lowers concentration risk:  Given the nature of the business, multiline insurers' product and service portfolios are diversified. This lowers concentration risk. Increased awareness, driving higher demand for protection products, should benefit sales and premiums of life insurance operations. Continued improvement in pricing and an increase in exposure should support premium growth.Also, per Deloitte Insights, the transition to green energy and related insurance products, as well as exposure to intangible assets, offers growth opportunities. Per Deloitte Insights, life insurance premium is estimated to increase 1.9% in 2023 while non-life premiums are expected to increase 2.2%.The report also stated that trends like commercial lines witnessing growth faster than personal lines and homeowners' premiums improving at a better rate than personal auto are likely to continue in 2023. However, underwriting losses are expected to persist, driven by challenging results in personal lines.Merger and acquisitions:  Consolidation in the multi-line insurance industry is expected to continue as players look to diversify their operations into new business lines and geographies. Buying businesses along the same lines is driven by the players' need to gain a fair market share and grow in their niche areas. However, with high inflation and a rise in interest rates (the Fed has already made one rate hike this year), momentum in the M&amp;A environment is likely to slow down. Increased adoption of technology: Digitalization has increased by leaps and bounds, especially amid pandemic-induced restrictions. The industry is witnessing greater use of technology like blockchain, AI, advanced analytics, telematics, cloud computing and robotic process automation to expedite business operations and save costs.Many life insurers have started selling policies online that appeal to the tech-savvy population. At the same time, the use of real-time data is making premium calculation easier and reducing risk.The P&amp;C industry, in particular, also witnessed the emergence of insurtech — technology-led insurers — sparking competition for incumbent players. Insurers remain focused on ramping up data and analytics capabilities as well as realizing the benefit of the technological infrastructure per Deloitte Insights. Moreover, the adoption of technology has helped in seamless underwriting and claims processing. However, the adoption of technology comes with the risk of cyber threats.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Weak ProspectsThe group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dismal prospects in the near term. The Zacks Multiline Insurance industry, housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #165, which places it in the bottom 34% of 255 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is the result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. The bleak outlook reflects that the industry's earnings estimates have been revised downward by analysts for the current year.  Earnings estimates for the current year have moved 6.3% south in the past year.Before we present a few multiline insurance stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Underperforms Sector and S&amp;P 500The Multiline Insurance industry has underperformed both the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and its sector over the past six months. The stocks in this industry have collectively gained 6.3% in the past year compared with the Finance sector's increase of 9% and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite rise of 17.7% in the same time frame.Current ValuationOn the basis of its trailing 12-month price-to-book (P/B), which is commonly used for valuing insurance stocks, the industry is currently trading at 2.32X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 5.57X and the sector's 3.03X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 2.74X, as low as 0.69X and at the median of 1.46X.5 Multiline Insurance Stocks to Keep an Eye OnWe are presenting five Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock from the Multiline Insurance industry.

Mistakes are inevitable, but a single top stock pick can cover any losses, and so much more.

In the last week shares have slid back 1.9%.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. Check out our latest analysis for International Petroleum While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.International Petroleum was able to grow its EPS at 345% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. This EPS growth is higher than the 75% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems investors have become more cautious about the company, over time. We'd venture the lowish P/E ratio of 5.28 also reflects the negative sentiment around the stock.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that International Petroleum has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store?

42,2dfe1fc9-d779-32dc-8134-5d2c453a4031,O,2023-10-10,Why terror attacks on Israel mean surging energy prices,The Telegraph,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/2dfe1fc9-d779-32dc-8134-5d2c453a4031/why-terror-attacks-on-israel.html,1696926036,STORY,"['CL=F', 'NG=F']","[oilConflict in the Middle East has a history of pushing up oil prices. The Yom Kippur War between Israel and a coalition of Arab states in 1973 triggered an oil embargo that caused prices to nearly quadruple in a year. The oil shock sent inflation surging and contributed to a lost decade.Now, the brutal Hamas attack on Israel has prompted fears of a new energy crisis.“This month marks 50 years since the 1973 oil shock,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note sent to clients on Monday.“Is history repeating itself in the 2020s?”While price movements have been relatively muted for now, with oil prices still below where they were two weeks ago, the atmosphere is febrile and markets are watching closely for signs that the conflict in the region could spill over into a wider fuel shock.“The market is not pricing in these risks yet,” says Caroline Bain, chief commodities economist at Capital Economics.“But it is fair to say that as long as this conflict goes on, and the suggestion is that Israel is preparing for a longer conflict, you would expect a higher risk premium in the oil price going forwards.”This embedded content is not available in your region.Israel is not itself an oil exporter but the region is crucial to global supplies and the conflict raises three key questions: what happens to Iranian oil?; how will Saudi Arabia react?; and will shipments from and through the region be disrupted?“The big one is Iran,” says Bain.While Iranian oil is already under US sanctions, enforcement has been softer under President Joe Biden and Iran has been ramping up production this year.However, the Hamas attacks have shattered rapprochement between the US and Iran, with speculation that Washington and its allies will now step up sanctions against Tehran.Iran has already publicly praised the terrorists and there are unverified reports that the Revolutionary Guard helped Hamas plan the attacks.The impact of tougher sanctions on Iran would be significant for oil prices.“It would be about 1pc of world oil supply disappearing if Iran went back to producing the amount it did last year, and the starting point is that we were already short,” says Bain.Story continuesTehran has increased crude production by nearly 500,000 barrels per day over the last year, according to the International Energy Agency. By other estimates, production has increased by as much as 700,000 barrels a day.Most of Iran’s oil is sold to China but the impact is felt on global prices given it is a commodity.This embedded content is not available in your region.Bain says: “What we have seen over the course of this year was the US ignoring an increase in Iranian production, obviously because the US is keen to keep a lid on oil prices.“But these latest events will make it much more difficult to ignore the fact that Iran has been sanction dodging. So we could see lower supply from Iran as a result of this.”The price of Brent crude would rise by $1 for every 100,000 barrels of Iranian crude taken off the global market each day, according to Goldman Sachs.The second, and related, concern is how Saudi Arabia and its Opec allies will react to the conflict.Saudi Arabia and Russia were already cutting global exports this year in an effort to prop up oil prices.On Friday, the day before Hamas launched its attack, the Wall Street Journal reported that Saudi Arabia had told the White House it would be willing to boost oil production early next year.This was a goodwill gesture to aid talks around a defence pact with Washington.The deal, which would include US security guarantees, weapons sales and help to build a civilian nuclear program, hinged on Saudi Arabia recognising Israeli sovereignty, something it has never done since the country was founded in 1948.However, war between Israel and Hamas threatens to derail that diplomatic effort and could also mean the Opec cuts drag on for even longer.In a note to investors, Daan Struyven, head of oil research at Goldman Sachs, said: “In our view, the escalating conflict in Gaza reduces the likelihood of a near-term normalization in Saudi-Israeli relations.”As a result, “This weekend’s developments reduce the probability of an early unwind of the Saudi production cuts.”Goldman currently expects Brent crude prices will rise from $85 per barrel last week to $100 by next June and could climb as high as $104.Higher wholesale costs typically take a month to filter through to the pumps, meaning motorists could be paying up to a fifth more for petrol and diesel by July.This embedded content is not available in your region.Even if Saudi Arabia does reverse its production cuts next year, it is no guarantee of lower oil prices.If the Kingdom does press ahead with the US-led “megadeal” and recognise Israeli sovereignty, Iran would consider it a betrayal and could retaliate.“During the Yemeni war, we saw Iran actually hit oil targets in Saudi Arabia,” says Bain. In this scenario, oil prices would quickly surpass $100 per barrel too.Finally, there is the question of the Strait of Hormuz. Around 17m barrels of crude oil are transported through this narrow shipping lane between the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Gulf, nearly a fifth of global supply. The entire eastern border is in Iranian territory.If Iran did sponsor or support Hamas, it could spur a retaliatory attack from Israel.“If that happened, it is very likely the Iranians would at least threaten to close the Strait of Hormuz,” says Callum Macpherson, head of commodities at Investec.Any restrictions on the strait would also have big implications for gas prices, as it is as important for liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports as it is for oil. Qatar transports around a fifth of the world’s LNG exports through the channel.Israel is also a gas producer itself. It produced 21.29bn cubic metres last year and exported around 9.21bn. The country makes up a relatively small share of the global market: Norway exported 120bn cubic metres last year by comparison.Even still, there are knock-on effects when the Israeli gas industry is disrupted. On Monday, Tel Aviv suspended production at the Tamar gas field as a precaution given the violence. European gas prices surged by as much as 14pc in response.At this stage, there are many hypotheticals but almost all of them lead to higher energy prices.“There are all sorts of scenarios you think of about how this might escalate,” says Bain.Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

If you want to skip our overview of the mining and extractive sectors, head straight to the Top 8 Countries With Most Natural Resources.Natural resources, primarily oil, gas, and coal, are indispensable for driving industrial machinery. Countries with massive reserves of these non-renewable resources often boast a robust national income; for example, Qatar has a gross national income of $70,500. Notably, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), a consortium of 13 nations, controls approximately 80.4% of the world's proven oil reserves. The revenue generated from exporting these resources is a principal source of wealth in countries with the most natural resources in the world. The mining and drilling industry, which extracts these resources in affluent countries, significantly contributes to GDP growth. For instance, Guyana made headlines when Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) discovered vast oil reserves off its coast in 2015. Since this discovery by Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), there have been multiple significant finds in the region, which has transformed the small South American nation into one of the most promising new oil producers. The Stabroek Block, the most prolific of these discoveries, is estimated to hold over 11 billion barrels of recoverable oil equivalent resources. Due to these abundant reserves, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has approved a $12.7 billion oil project in Guyana.According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Guyana's GDP growth has been substantial, reaching a record high of 47.8% in 2022, up from 5.35% in 2019. Such significant growth rates in the Top Mining Countries in the World, like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the UAE, largely result from their extractive industries.Developments In The Natural Resources Horizon Chevron Corp (NYSE:CVX), the second-largest oil company in the US, is at the forefront of major developments in the oil &amp; gas sector. Operating in 180 countries, the company plays a role in every aspect of the oil industry. For three decades, Chevron has collaborated with Kazakhstan to develop its energy resources, aiding its emergence as a significant energy producer and exporter globally. Chevron Corp (NYSE:CVX) has significantly invested in Tengizchevroil (TCO), Kazakhstan's largest crude oil-producing field and one of the largest oil fields in the world. This investment has resulted in a fifteen-fold increase in the annual gross production of oil from the 1990s to the 2020s. Story continuesAccording to Chevron's Q2 earnings call, TCO is anticipated to deliver production exceeding 1 million barrels of oil equivalent daily and generate approximately $5 billion of free cash flow by 2025. Additionally, Chevron has initiated production at 10 wells in New Mexico and expects to introduce 30 more wells with higher production rates by the year's end to meet the demands of countries with the highest oil consumption.Reuters reports that Chevron Corp (NYSE:CVX) plans to introduce 65,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Venezuelan oil to the global market by the end of 2024. This initiative marks Chevron's first major drilling campaign in Venezuela since Washington imposed sanctions on the country in 2019. Chevron's joint ventures with Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA currently yield 135,000 bpd, and with the addition, production is expected to reach 200,000 bpd by the end of 2024.

In this domain, Livent Corporation (NYSE:LTHM), listed among the top 10 lithium mining companies in the world, announced an all-stock merger with Allkem. The merger between Livent Corporation (NYSE:LTHM) and Alkem is poised to establish the third-largest lithium producer globally, with the deal expected to conclude by this year's end. The merged entity is projected to be valued at $10.6 billion and have a supply chain spanning the Americas, Europe, and Australia, according to Livent Corporation (NYSE:LTHM).Let's now talk about the world's biggest natural resource holders!Top 20 Countries With Most Natural Resources in the WorldTop 20 Countries With Most Natural Resources in the WorldOur Methodology We have listed the top resource-rich countries based on their total natural resources rents, expressed as a percentage of their GDP as of 2021. Natural resources rents refer to the economic gain a country derives from the extraction and production of resources like oil, natural gas, coal, minerals, and forests. Essentially, it's the difference between the total revenue generated from these resources and the production costs borne by the country. These rents are often represented as a percentage of the country's GDP. To identify countries abundant in natural wealth, we consulted the World Bank's database and ranked the world's biggest natural resource holders in ascending order of the GDP percentage derived from natural resources.Based on our findings, here are the countries with the most natural resources: 20. NorwayTotal Natural Resources Rents As % Of GDP: 10%Recently, Norway has become Europe's largest exporter of natural gas and oil following a buyer boycott against Russia due to its invasion of Ukraine. Bloomberg reports that to maintain production levels and increase exports, Norway has approved new oil and gas projects worth $18.5 billion. The Johan Sverdrup oil field, a significant project, produces 31,500 barrels of oil equivalent of gas per day, substantially contributing to the economy. Located 150 km off the coast of Stavanger, this field reached its maximum production capacity of 755,000 barrels of oil per day during a test phase. Jointly owned by Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR), TotalEnergies, Lundin Norway, Petoro, and Aker, the field recently increased its capacity to 755,000 barrels per day, as reported in Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR)'s Q2 earnings call transcript. Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR) continues investing in the Norwegian continental shelf's oil sector, developing Irpa and Verdande (subsea oil fields in the Norwegian Sea) in the upcoming years, which are expected to yield valuable, low-carbon barrels.19. VenezuelaTotal Natural Resources Rents As % Of GDP: 10.1%Venezuela is among the top oil producing countries in the world, possessing one of the world's largest proven oil reserves, primarily located in the Orinoco Oil Belt. However, US sanctions imposed in 2019 have significantly hindered its oil production and export capacities. Targeting the oil sector and government officials, these sanctions have limited Venezuela's access to global financial markets and deterred foreign investment, causing a decline in oil production levels and prompting the search for alternative trading partners.18. PeruTotal Natural Resources Rents As % Of GDP: 12.7%Peru, rich in natural resources, is a leading global producer of silver, copper, lead, and zinc. The significant Antamina mine extracts copper and zinc, eventually supporting its GDP. Additionally, with portions of the Amazon Rainforest within its territory, Peru offers considerable timber and biodiversity resources. However, the exploitation of these resources is controversial due to environmental and indigenous peoples' rights concerns.17. AustraliaTotal Natural Resources Rents As % Of GDP: 13.4%Australia's wealth in natural resources encompasses coal, iron ore, gold, and natural gas. The Pilbara region is renowned for extensive iron ore extraction, with projects like Roy Hill making significant contributions. Furthermore, the North West Shelf and the Prelude FLNG project play a crucial role in the country's natural gas production.16. ChileTotal Natural Resources Rents As % Of GDP: 16.9%Topping the list of countries with the largest copper reserves, Chile has reserves amounting to 190 million metric tons. The Escondida mine, the world's largest of its kind, is pivotal in this regard. In addition to copper, Chile possesses substantial reserves of lithium, molybdenum, and precious metals, with significant lithium extraction occurring in the unique geography of the Atacama Desert.15. United Arab EmiratesTotal Natural Resources Rents As % Of GDP: 17.6%The UAE derives its wealth predominantly from oil and gas found mainly in Abu Dhabi. The flagship Zakum field, one of the world's largest oil fields, significantly boosts the nation's production capacity. Besides oil, the UAE is heavily investing in developing a smart renewable energy sector to diversify its energy portfolio.14. RussiaTotal Natural Resources Rents As % Of GDP: 18.5%With extensive natural resources, Russia has considerable reserves of oil, gas, coal, and metals. The Yamal LNG project exemplifies Russia's robust gas production capabilities, providing access to massive reserves in the Russian Arctic.13. AlgeriaTotal Natural Resources Rents As % Of GDP: 22.6%Algeria's wealth in resources is chiefly in oil and gas, with the Hassi Messaoud and Hassi R'Mel fields being integral to its petroleum industry. Fundamental for both domestic consumption and exports, these fields also support Algeria's prominent role in the fertilizer industry due to its substantial phosphate reserves.12. Saudi ArabiaTotal Natural Resources Rents As % Of GDP: 25.6%Primarily known for oil, Saudi Arabia is home to Ghawar Field, the world's largest crude oil production facility. This field enhances Saudi Aramco's production capabilities and cements the nation's status in the global oil market. Additionally, with significant gold and phosphate deposits, Saudi Arabia is also exploring opportunities in the mining sector.11. KazakhstanTotal Natural Resources Rents As % Of GDP: 26.8%Kazakhstan is rich in minerals, including uranium, copper, and zinc. As a leading uranium producer with 969,200 tons of uranium reserves, the country's Inkai and South Inkai mines are vital to its uranium extraction efforts. Kazakhstan also boasts substantial oil reserves, with the Tengiz Field being a significant contributor to its oil production.10. QatarTotal Natural Resources Rents As % Of GDP: 27.3%With substantial natural gas reserves located primarily in the North Field, Qatar garners global attention. This field is crucial to the nation's status as one of the leading LNG exporters worldwide. Additionally, the country possesses significant crude oil reserves, bolstering its energy-centric economy.9. OmanTotal Natural Resources Rents As % Of GDP: 29.2%Like other Middle Eastern countries on the list, Oman derives the majority of its wealth from oil and gas. The nation has also invested in its emerging mining sector, focusing on the exploitation of copper, gold, and phosphate reserves.Click to continue reading Top 8 Countries with Most Natural Resources in the World.Suggested Articles: 20 Countries With Highest Gold Consumption By Year10 Best Aluminum and Aluminum Mining Stocks To Buy11 Best Mining Penny Stocks to Buy NowDisclosure: None. Top 20 Countries with Most Natural Resources in the World was originally published at Insider Monkey.]"

It found that more than 400,000 workers are employed in mines set to cease operations before 2035.If plans were implemented to phase down coal to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), only 250,000 miners - less than 10% of the current workforce - would be required worldwide, GEM estimated.China's coal industry, the world's biggest, currently employs more than 1.5 million people, GEM estimated. Of the 1 million job global job losses expected by 2050, more than 240,000 will be in the province of Shanxi alone.China's coal sector has already undergone several waves of restructuring in recent decades, with many mining districts in the north and northeast struggling to find alternative sources of growth and employment following pit closures.""The coal industry, on the whole, has a notoriously bad reputation for its treatment of workers,"" said Ryan Driskell Tate, GEM's program director for coal.""What we need is proactive planning for workers and coal communities ... so industry and governments will remain accountable to those workers who have borne the brunt for so long.""(Reporting by David Stanway; Editing by Sonali Paul)]"

(NYSE: FE) subsidiary Penn Power has completed an expansion of its smart grid in Mercer County to reinforce the local power system and help prevent lengthy service disruptions, especially during severe weather. Work includes installation of new, automated equipment and technology in distribution substations and along neighborhood power lines serving more than 15,000 customers in Sharon, Sharpsville, Hermitage, Transfer, Greenville, West Middlesex and nearby areas.Penn Power Logo (PRNewsfoto/FirstEnergy Corp.)View and download photos of Penn Power crews completing the work on Flickr.The work is part of Penn Power's second phase Long Term Infrastructure Improvement Plan (LTIIP II), approved by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission to help enhance electric service for customers. The company has experienced a 74% decrease in customer minutes of interruption related to outages since the installation of smart grid technology along neighborhood power lines under LTIIP.Scott Wyman, president of FirstEnergy's Pennsylvania operations: ""Penn Power has made significant investments in smart grid technologies in recent years, helping enhance our reliability performance and piloting new devices that our sister utilities have since begun to implement successfully within their own service areas. The completion of this work ahead of winter is a win-win because it strengthens our electric system and keeps the lights on for customers when they depend on it the most to stay warm and comfortable.""Hundreds of homes and businesses in the area will benefit from the installation of more than a dozen new automated reclosing devices in the substations and along neighborhood power lines that will help limit the frequency, duration and scope of service interruptions. A video of utility personnel explaining and installing automated devices can be found on YouTube.Story continuesThese electrical devices:Work like a circuit breaker in a home that shuts off power when trouble occurs, with the added benefit of automatically reenergizing a substation or power line within seconds for certain types of outages to keep power safely flowing to customers.Are safer and more efficient because they often allow utility personnel to automatically restore service to customers instead of sending a crew to investigate.Isolate the outage to that area and limit the total number of affected customers if the device senses a more serious issue, like a fallen tree on electrical equipment.Quickly pinpoint the location of the fault and help utility personnel better understand the cause of the outage to help speed restoration.Automated voltage regulators were also installed to help ensure safe, constant voltage levels along power lines on extremely cold or hot days that create high demand for electricity. In addition to preventing voltage issues for customers, the devices could potentially help provide energy savings by evenly distributing electricity to allow all customers served by a single power line to receive the same flow of safe, reliable power. Lastly, Penn Power workers installed nearly 100 new poles designed to withstand severe winter elements like high winds, ice and heavy, wet snow.This work builds upon system upgrades that were completed in recent years across Penn Power's service area in Mercer County, including the installation of more than 200 automated reclosing devices in rural, tree-filled communities, and the addition of interior fencing in four substations to help deter climbing animals and protect against electrical equipment interference that can cause power outages.Penn Power serves more than 160,000 customers in all or parts of Allegheny, Beaver, Butler, Crawford, Lawrence and Mercer counties in western Pennsylvania.

52,7a053144-9e19-30f6-9eb6-6f0929c99fac,CRM,2023-10-10,Wall Street Analysts See Salesforce.com (CRM) as a Buy: Should You Invest?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-analysts-see-salesforce-133006869.html,1696858206,STORY,['CRM'],"[When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Salesforce.com (CRM) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Salesforce.com currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.74, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 38 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.74 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 38 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 24 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 63.2% and 5.3% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for CRMBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for CRMCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Salesforce.com here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Salesforce.com, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Should You Invest in CRM?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Salesforce.com, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0% over the past month to $8.06.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Salesforce.com. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Salesforce.com may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

53,d1e92d58-651e-335d-88a8-20083366008c,CRM,2023-10-10,Salesforce Inc. (CRM) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-inc-crm-attracting-investor-130011201.html,1696856411,STORY,['CRM'],"[Salesforce.com (CRM) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this customer-management software developer have returned -7.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3.4% change. The Zacks Computer - Software industry, to which Salesforce.com belongs, has lost 3.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Salesforce.com is expected to post earnings of $2.06 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +47.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed 0%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.06 points to a change of +53.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.37 indicates a change of +16.3% from what Salesforce.com is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.5%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Salesforce.com.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Salesforce.com, the consensus sales estimate of $8.71 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +11.1%. The $34.75 billion and $38.61 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +10.8% and +11.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySalesforce.com reported revenues of $8.6 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.4%. EPS of $2.12 for the same period compares with $1.19 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.52 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.93%. The EPS surprise was +11.58%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Salesforce.com is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Salesforce.com. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

55,318878ec-f8b1-3d07-84f7-5ebca898d449,FLS,2023-10-10,Flowserve Corporation's (NYSE:FLS) Intrinsic Value Is Potentially 71% Above Its Share Price,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/flowserve-corporations-nyse-fls-intrinsic-163948467.html,1696869588,STORY,['FLS'],"[Key InsightsFlowserve's estimated fair value is US$64.22 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityFlowserve is estimated to be 41% undervalued based on current share price of US$37.66 Analyst price target for FLS is US$44.73 which is 30% below our fair value estimateIn this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Flowserve Corporation (NYSE:FLS) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. See our latest analysis for Flowserve Is Flowserve Fairly Valued?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$291.0mUS$380.4mUS$396.1mUS$453.7mUS$496.3mUS$532.0mUS$562.3mUS$588.4mUS$611.2mUS$631.8mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 9.38%Est @ 7.21%Est @ 5.69%Est @ 4.63%Est @ 3.89%Est @ 3.37% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.9% US$270US$327US$315US$335US$339US$337US$330US$320US$308US$295(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$3.2bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$632m× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.9%– 2.2%) = US$11bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$11b÷ ( 1 + 7.9%)10= US$5.2bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$8.4b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$37.7, the company appears quite undervalued at a 41% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Flowserve as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.150. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for FlowserveStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Machinery market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Dividends are not covered by cash flow.Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For Flowserve, there are three pertinent aspects you should explore:Risks: Be aware that  Flowserve is showing  3 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those shouldn't be ignored...Future Earnings: How does FLS's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

NGN has settled more than a thousand phone-hacking cases without making any admission of liability in relation to the Sun.In June, Harry became the first senior British royal for more than 130 years to give evidence in court when he appeared as part of another lawsuit against Mirror Group Newspapers.

Recent return-to-office requirements and high childcare costs may also be driving home shoppers to factor family proximity and support into their purchasing plans, the research shows.Of those surveyed who are planning to buy a home within the next 12 months, half (51%) are potentially looking to their parents to help them prepare for buying a home, with nearly one third (29%) saying they've already moved in with their parents to help save money in preparation for buying a home and another quarter (22%) saying they would consider doing so.Similarly, one third (32%) of respondents are even cohabitating with other family members to help save enough money to buy a home, including siblings, aunts and uncles, and cousins, and another 24% would consider doing so.Hoping to be close to family to share childcare and reduce expenses In addition to the short-term savings that living with family provides, many are planning to stay close to family even after they've saved up by purchasing a home nearby their relatives. Twenty-eight percent of respondents who are planning to buy a home in the next year are doing so in part to be closer to their family.Of those who are planning to buy a home to be close to family, many are motivated by financial reasons and sharing the cost and responsibilities of childcare. Helping care for other children in the family was cited as a top reason by that group (50%), followed by needing affordable help caring for their own children (44%). Other top cited reasons for buying near family were because they liked the area, prices/cost of living have become too high where they currently live, or health issues.Story continuesWhile many would-be buyers are looking to buy a home near their family, many respondents already call their family neighbors, with about 4 in 10 surveyed consumers saying their parents, siblings, extended family or grandparents have purchased a home near them.Co-buying and living with family longer-term As housing affordability continues to be a barrier for many would-be buyers, co-living or co-buying with family has gained significant popularity in recent years. Eighty-three percent of those surveyed would consider buying a home to live in together, as a primary residence, with someone other than their spouse/partner, including an extended family member or friend. Respondents were most open to buying a home with their child (37%), a romantic partner they're not married or engaged to (31%); a sibling, cousin or other family member from the same generation (27%), and their parents or in-laws (23%).Realtor.com®'s collaboration tools make it easy for shoppers buying a home together and let you invite your home search partner to link Realtor.com® accounts and begin sharing your home search in one easy place across all devices, including comments back and forth that only the two of you can see.""The challenging market conditions this year are changing buyer behavior in significant ways, driving many more people to explore alternative living situations they may not have considered in the past,"" said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist at Realtor.com. ""Mortgage rates hovering at or near 7% have eroded buyers' purchasing power at a time when the consistently low number of homes for sale has kept housing markets surprisingly competitive.""For those who would consider buying a home with someone other than their spouse, top reasons cited included that pooled resources would afford them a better location (43%), a more updated home (41%), and/or a bigger home (38%). One-third (36%) of those who said that they would buy a home with someone other than their spouse said it was because they're already living together and would prefer to buy and start building equity sooner, and 29% said it's because they can't afford to buy a home on their own.""While home buyers have long received financial assistance from family members to help them afford a home purchase – especially first-time home buyers who may not have already built up equity – we're seeing more and more prospective buyers take this a step further,"" said Clare Trapasso, executive news editor at Realtor.com®. ""Faced with ongoing housing affordability issues and rising childcare costs, we're seeing parents and children becoming roommates again in later years as the 'kids' save up to purchase their own place, siblings moving near each other to pool childcare resources, and some even buying homes with family to split the financial burden and make homeownership a reality.""Survey MethodologyThe research was conducted by Censuswide, with 2,291 respondents in the U.S. The fieldwork took place May 12-19, 2023.

But importantly, Swift has captured the wallets of these people as well. In fact, she’s been so successful that many have started referring to her business acumen as “Swiftonomics.”The Eras Tour grossed some $2.2 billion — just in America. The singer was able to tap into a generation of women seeing their disposable income rise significantly over the past few years. The ticket sales have been a big part of her income, but the merchandise is also a big slice of the pie, adding to her revenue streams. And she’s not the only one benefitting from her incredible popularity. Anywhere that Taylor’s legions of fans visited throughout her tour saw an economic boost as well.But now that the tour is over, Swift’s contributions to the economy are far from over. She’s sparked a new romance with a high-profile NFL player and announced the release of The Eras Tour documentary. Excitement over Taylor’s whereabouts continues, and her loyal fans are still on the move to see her — be it in theatres or at NFL games.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWith that in mind, many investors are looking for stocks that could see a Swift tailwind over the next few months. These are the companies likely to benefit from her upcoming film and stand to gain as she continues to make a splash in the NFL. This aspect of her popularity could be an interesting one as the games see an influx of new viewers who could significantly impact the business of football.Taylor Swift Stocks: AMC Entertainment (AMC)The AMC Empire 25 Cinemas in Times Square in New YorkSource: rblfmr / Shutterstock.comBeleaguered movie theatre and former meme stock AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) is in a financially precarious position, but Taylor Swift could change all that. The group is working to shore up its finances at the expense of investors. A dilutive share sale and years of struggling against a declining industry have left the group struggling to gain momentum. Taylor Swift and her legions of loyal fans could turn things around, though.Story continuesThe Eras Tour is set to make its way to theatres, and AMC is set to be the biggest beneficiary. AMC has been able to capture 43% of revenues for The Eras Tour documentary. That’s not chump change either. The concert film set a new record for advance ticket sales, raking in $26 million. Add to that all of the popcorn, soda and candy the Swifties will be buying and AMC should have a windfall of cash. Not to mention the precedent that The Eras Tour will set. Taylor Swift is making post-tour films a thing, and Beyonce recently announced she would release a similar film. If movie theatres can capture a slice of the excitement that comes from mega-stars tours, there could be hope for the industry yet.DraftKings (DKNG)A man opens the DraftKings (DKNG) app from his iPhone. DraftKings is an American daily fantasy sports contest and sports betting operator. DKNG Stock ForecastSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comSports betting firm DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) should benefit from the start of football season, but that benefit’s been amplified now that Taylor Swift entered the chat. Swift’s relationship with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce means there’s a whole lot more focus on the sport. With Swifties now watching and attending games to catch a glimpse of their favorite singer or cheer on her beau, the NFL may have a whole new audience. Sunday Night Football saw a 22% increase in viewership, and the number of women watching the game was up by two million.But the enhanced excitement didn’t just mean more eyeballs on screens. It also drove more betting activity — a good thing for DraftKings. The company said bets on Kelce more than doubled. Whether people are worried he’ll crack under the pressure or see Swift’s presence at his games as a good luck charm, DraftKings stands to benefit. With so many newly minted NFL fans out there, the company is likely to have a bumper season of its own.News Corporation (NWSA)News Corp. (NWSA_ Building frontSource: ShutterstockYou need only look at the mountains of stories pouring out of the latest game attended by Taylor Swift to understand why a media company like News Corporation (NASDAQ:NWSA) stands to gain from the singer’s latest endeavors. Questions about Kelce’s post-game reaction, the Singer’s post-game movements and speculation about whether she’ll be at the next game, are all dominating the conversation. News Corp owns a host of the tabloids publishing these stories, and sharing between Swifties will be music to advertisers’ ears.News Corp has been embroiled in a succession scandal of its own, so the stock could benefit from a Swift tailwind. But there’s nothing like a new, and popular, relationship to get people talking. Given that both Swift and Kelce are public features, there’s plenty to delve into and News Corp and its assets will be taking full advantage as the relationship continues to unfold.On the date of publication, Marie Brodbeck did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

It may result in increased latency, signal degradation and reduction of overall network performance.The engineers from the RF hunter group relentlessly search for any anomalies in the signal. With the help of advanced equipment, they detect and track down the originating point that is causing the interference. They efficiently eliminate the disruptive signal, ensuring the restoration of clear and dependable service.

68,79cf73ad-c911-302f-845c-eea616a45275,MSI,2023-10-10,Silicon Motion (SIMO) Preliminary Q3 Results Show Higher Revenues,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/silicon-motion-simo-preliminary-q3-151800046.html,1696864680,STORY,"['SIMO', 'ANET', 'MSI']","[Silicon Motion Technology Corporation SIMO recently issued preliminary third-quarter 2023 results. The selective preliminary metrics offer clarity regarding its business operations as it aims to navigate through a challenging macroeconomic environment.In concurrence with the second-quarter 2023 results, Silicon Motion offered guidance for the third quarter. The company had then expected third-quarter revenues to be up 15-20% sequentially as end-market demand stabilized with the reduction in customer inventory levels. Management currently expects the soon-to-be-reported quarter’s revenues to exceed the higher end of its guided range. However, non-GAAP gross margin is likely to be relatively flat on a sequential basis — in line with the original guidance.Silicon Motion is bullish about a more robust market recovery in the second half of 2023. It is taking several measures to enhance its gross margins, including reducing manufacturing costs, minimizing compensation-related expenses, discontinuing unprofitable product lines and streamlining research and development expenditures. Despite facing challenging market conditions, the company's management remains committed to providing cost-effective, high-quality, and unique solutions to its customers while maintaining a strong presence in the storage controller market.The company appears to be well-equipped to adapt to industry changes. It has collaborated with flash vendors to develop proprietary controller technology to overcome the existing weakness of 3D NAND and outshine peers. It has commenced initial sales of 3D SSD controllers to flash partners. The company expects this controller to be a significant SSD controller growth driver for the next year, as NAND Flash partners’ 3D capacity expands. Also, the company commenced mass production of PCIe NVMe client SSD controller for flash partners. We believe accelerated product sales and favorable industry trends signal bright prospects for Silicon Motion.Silicon Motion has expanded its SSD controller program engagements with PC OEMs and eMMC/UFS controllers for smartphones, automotive applications and IoT/smart devices. The company is adding to this momentum with the upcoming launch of its next-generation enterprise-class SSD controllers. Silicon Motion’s eMMC is showing strong signals of rebound, thereby adding to the strength of its overall embedded storage market that comprises both SSD controllers and eMMC embedded memory.As market trends suggest the tilting of balance from eMMC 4.5 toward eMMC 5.0, the company foresees lucrative prospects for eMMC 5.1 controller sales. We believe an expanding customer base and innovative products will likely act as tailwinds for the company’s top-line growth, going forward. Notably, over the last 10 years, Silicon Motion has shipped more than five billion controllers cumulatively – more than any other company in the world. On a yearly basis, Silicon Motion ships more than 750 million NAND controllers.Shares of the company have lost 10.3% in the past year against the industry’s growth of 71.2%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSilicon Motion presently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Key PicksArista Networks, Inc.

73,844209c0-7798-37dc-83d3-502189f50edd,MSFT,2023-10-10,Top 30 Most Democratic Countries in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-30-most-democratic-countries-032938804.html,1696908578,STORY,"['NET', 'GOOGL', 'MSFT']","[In this article, we look at the most democratic countries in the world. You can skip our detailed analysis on the link between democracy and economic growth, and head over directly to the Top 10 Most Democratic Countries in the World.The 2022 Democracy Index issued by The Economist Intelligence Unit earlier this year categorized 167 countries according to the type of regimes in these nations. Of these, only 24 were fully democratic, while 48 were termed as flawed democracies. On the other hand, 36 were hybrid regimes, whereas 59 were categorized as authoritarian regimes.China’s spectacular rise over the last two decades and increasing prosperity in the oil-rich monarchies of the Arab world, coupled with growing populist politics in Europe and the United States have once again given prominence to the question of whether democracy leads to economic growth, or are democratic institutions a hindrance.A research conducted in 2019 by professors belonging to various universities of the US concluded that democracy does cause economic growth and provide evidence that democratization leads to an increase in GDP per capita over the long run. The paper studied countries from 1960 to 2010 and tracked their path from nondemocracy to democracy between this time period. Results showed that countries that transitioned to democracy experienced a 20% growth in GDP per capita over the next 25 years after embracing democracy.While the United Nations does not publicly advocate for any form of government, it includes democratic elements such as human development, equal participation, and gender equality in the set of principles and values it promotes.Corporations That Promote DemocracyRecently, a number of large corporations have also made commitments to advance democracy. Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) for instance, which connects to more than 11,000 networks around the globe, works with researchers on sharing data about internet shutdowns across different regions of the world. Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) works with organizations such as the Internet Society, Access Now, and others to monitor internet censorship. Moreover, Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) also regularly consults members of the civil society to ensure that all future product developments and technologies are privacy-enhancing and consistent with human rights.Story continuesEarlier this year at the White House’s Summit for Democracy, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s Google announced to commit $2 million to support human rights defenders since they consistently face harassment and are targeted which threatens their privacy and freedom of expression. This fund will be dedicated by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) to safety helplines and digital security for human rights defenders. In addition to this, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) also recently announced plans to provide 100,000 security keys, free of cost, to individuals who are at high risk of cyber attacks.In 2022, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) partnered with International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES) to train investigative journalists on cybersecurity and digital safety with a focus on how state machineries abuse power to steal elections. The first training was held in Tunisia in October 2022, followed by Serbia in November. 29 local journalists in these countries benefited from the curriculum training offered by IFES and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). The IFES has received high demand for this training from several other countries as well, and it plans on expanding this offering in collaboration with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in 33 other countries in the coming years.MethodologyWe have ranked the the most democratic countries using The Economist’s 2022 Democracy Index released this year and V-dem Institute’s Democracy Report 2023. Rankings of countries on both of these indices were averaged to get an aggregated score. The most democratic countries are listed in descending order of these rankings. In case where the scores were the same for two or more countries, we outranked one over the other by seeing which country had the highest ranking on either of the two indices.Top 30 Most Democratic Countries in the WorldPhoto by MIKE STOLL on UnsplashLet’s now head over to the list of the most democratic countries in the world.30. SlovakiaScore: 30.5Slovakia is ranked 18th in V-dem’s democracy report 2023, but it was placed under the flawed democracies list by The Economist. While the country’s democratic credentials are still stronger than most other countries in Europe and the world, only 48% of Slovaks believe liberal democracy is good for their country – signaling a risk to the future of democracy in Slovakia.29. ItalyScore: 26.5Italy finds itself in the middle ranks in terms of its democratic credentials. The country is a parliamentary republic with a multi-party system. Its ratings have dropped by three points on The Economist’s democracy index compared to last year.28. AustriaScore: 26.5Austria is one of the most democratic countries in the world and is acclaimed for its electoral processes, pluralism, and civil liberties. An estimated 61% of the population in Austria is satisfied with how democracy is functioning in their country.27. United StatesScore: 26.5While the United States is widely considered as the world’s bastion of democracy, it receives low scores when it comes to its political culture and functioning of the government. The Economist rated it as a flawed democracy and ranked it at 30. On the other hand, V-dem placed it on 23rd in its democracy report.26. South KoreaScore: 26South Korea is a democratic republic with a presidential form of government. While its democracy remains susceptible to populism, South Korea still manages to have a healthier democracy compared to several other Asian nations. It ranks among the most democratic nations in the world. The country is considered a full-fledged democracy by The Economist Democracy Index 2022.25. PortugalScore: 25Portugal is a stable parliamentary form of democracy in Europe and ranks among the most democratic countries in the world. The country received high scores from V-dem for ensuring free, fair and transparent elections.24. JapanScore: 21.5Japan is one of the most democratic countries in Asia and has improved its ratings over the last few years. According to The Economist, Japan’s democracy performs well when it comes to pluralism, civil liberties, functioning of the government, and electoral process.23. BelgiumScore: 21.5Belgium is ranked 36th on the Democracy Index 2022 issued by The Economist, while it was placed on 7th spot by V-dem. The country is known for hosting the headquarters of several large international organizations, including the European Union and NATO.22. UruguayScore: 21Uruguay was recently ranked as the most democratic country in The Americas by The Economist. It received a full 10 out of 10 score for its electoral process and pluralism, and also scored well on other metrics such as functioning of the government, political participation, and civil liberties.21. Czech RepublicScore: 21The Czech Republic is one of the most democratic countries in the world and in Europe. It is a unitary parliamentary republic, with the president as the head of state, and the prime minister as the head of the government. The Economist, however, identified one area where the country’s democracy needs to improve: functioning of the government, for which it received a score of 6.43 out of 10.20. ChileScore: 20After the return of civil rule in 1990, Chile has experienced an expansion of political rights and liberties, and is considered to be a stable, full democracy. Chile ranks 19th on The Economist and 21st on V-dem Institute’s democracy indices.19. TaiwanScore: 20Taiwan is one of the most democratic countries in the world, and recently, President Tsai Ing-wen reaffirmed her country’s commitment to a democratic future by saying that Taiwan will never give up on its democratic way of life. Taiwan is claimed by China as its own, and Taipei regularly faces both political and military pressure from Beijing which is under communist rule.18. SpainScore: 19.5Spain has climbed two spots in The Economist Democracy Index of 2022, compared to 2021, and is considered to be a full democracy. However, several independent analysts have, in recent times, cast doubts on Spain’s democratic credentials over curbs placed on secessionist politicians in Catalonia.17. United KingdomScore: 19The United Kingdom falls in the upper-middle tier when it comes to democratic credentials. It was ranked 20th on V-dem Institute’s 2023 Democracy Report, and 18th on The Economist’s 2022 Democracy Index, which also listed the UK as a full-fledged democracy due to its sound electoral process, pluralism, and civil liberties.16. CanadaScore: 18According to a recent survey, 66% of Canadians are satisfied with democracy in their country. Canada scored 10 out of 10 on The Economist’s electoral politics and pluralism metrics. It is one of the most democratic nations in the world.15. FranceScore: 17.5France has a vibrant democracy, with strong protections for civil liberties and political rights. The country has a semi-presidential form of government. It is listed among full democracies by The Economist.14. EstoniaScore: 16Estonia has strong democratic credentials, with civil liberties and political rights not just enshrined in the constitution, but also upheld and widely practiced around the country. Estonia is ranked by V-dem Institute as the fifth most democratic country in the world, whereas The Economist ranked the country at 27th.13. IcelandScore: 16Iceland has been widely recognized as a full democracy since 2021 and has been consistently improving its democratic credentials in areas such as electoral process, political participation, functioning of the government, and civil liberties.12. LuxembourgScore: 14Luxembourg has strong democratic institutions and ranks among the upper-middle tier of countries in terms of democratic credentials. The country’s media is pluralist and generally free from political interference. Luxembourg allows foreign nationals from both EU and third-countries to vote during the elections.11. Costa RicaScore: 13Costa Rica is a presidential form of democratic republic and has a multi-party system. According to a recent survey, 87% of the respondents in the country reported that they are satisfied with their quality of life. This is likely due to the high levels of civil liberties, pluralism, and strong functioning of the government in Costa Rica.Click to continue reading and see the Top 10 Most Democratic Countries in the World.Suggested Articles:20 Least Censored Countries with Most Internet Freedom50 Largest Economies in the World Ranked by PPP25 Most Powerful Countries in the World in 2023Disclosure: None.

75,75515527-b387-340b-8623-b5a441d5b81c,MSFT,2023-10-10,‘A Massive Rally Ahead’: Daniel Ives Says Buy Tech Stocks Into Year-End — Here Are 2 Names That He Likes Right Now,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/massive-rally-ahead-daniel-ives-233911407.html,1696894751,STORY,"['PRGS', 'MSFT']","[The September jobs report exceeded expectations with the addition of 336,000 jobs last month, nearly double the amount anticipated on Wall Street.Add that ‘goldilocks’ figure to minimal wage inflation, and the scene is set for a soft landing for the economy, says Wedbush’s Daniel Ives, a 5-star analyst rated in the top 2% of the Street’s stock pros. This, in turn, is great news for the tech sector. In fact, with earnings season about to kick off, Ives thinks Wall Street is poised to be caught off-guard by the strength of reporting, laying the groundwork for a big end-of-year surge.“Our view is that 3Q earnings over the coming weeks will be an eye-opener for the Street, as the transformational AI growth and stabilizing IT spending environment will create a massive tech rally heading into year-end, during which we expect tech stocks to be up another 12%-15% in 4Q,” Ives opined.While Ives acknowledges that bears may try to temper the bulls’ enthusiasm, his advice remains clear: Ignore the noise and direct your attention towards the potential of this generational AI growth, with $1 trillion in tech spending anticipated on the horizon over the next decade.With the prospect of all this about to take place, Ives believes certain names are well-positioned to gain, and we decided to take a closer look at some of his picks. Do these equities receive support from the rest of the Street? According to the TipRanks database, they certainly do; both are rated as ‘Strong Buys’ by the analyst consensus. Let’s see what makes them so.Progress Software (PRGS)We’ll start with a leading American infrastructure software company, the aptly titled Progress Software. This firm specializes in providing a wide range of software tools and solutions to help businesses enhance their operational efficiency and accelerate digital transformation. Since being founded in 1981, Progress has established itself as a trusted partner for enterprises seeking to harness the power of data and applications in an evolving digital landscape.Story continuesThe company’s product portfolio includes a variety of software platforms, such as Progress OpenEdge, which enables the development of robust, scalable business applications, and Progress Telerik, a suite of developer tools for building modern web and mobile applications.Progress’ customer roster is notably extensive, encompassing a diverse array of prominent clients, including Meta, Microsoft, IBM, Barclays, and S&amp;P Global.All the above helped the company deliver a strong fiscal Q3 report (August quarter). Revenue climbed by 15.7% year-over-year to $175 million, beating the Street’s forecast by $1.9 million. Adj. EPS of $1.08 also exceeded expectations by $0.08.The company also delivered a net retention rate – a key software metric – above 100% and is actively seeking out its next M&amp;A transaction. Earlier in the year, the company closed the $355 million acquisition of the document-oriented database operator MarkLogic.For Daniel Ives, the prospect of more such activity is enticing and should further cement its standing in the space.“The company continues to maintain an accretive M&amp;A strategy as this environment now provides an attractive opportunity for PRGS to capitalize on a diminished valuation marketplace with $138.0 million in cash to spend on undervalued assets coming to market,” Ives explained. “We maintain our bullish stance on Progress as the company improves its cost structure while positioning to capitalize on growing demand for its entire product portfolio while maintaining an accretive inorganic growth strategy.”These comments form the basis for Ives’ Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating on PRGS, while his $65 price target makes room for 12-month returns of 23%. (To watch Ives’ track record, click here)In general, other analysts echo Ives’ sentiment. 3 Buys and 1 Hold add up to a Strong Buy consensus rating. Based on the average price target of $63.75, the upside potential comes in at ~21%. (See PRGS stock forecast)Microsoft (MSFT)If we’re talking about tech and how companies stand to gain from the AI revolution, then not much digging is required to get to one of the firms that stands to benefit the most. Microsoft has been at the forefront of tech’s rise, has played a pivotal role in shaping the modern technology landscape, and only Apple ranks higher on the list of the world’s most valuable companies.Its ubiquitous Windows operating system is used by billions of computers worldwide, and it also offers a wide range of software applications and services, including the Microsoft Office suite, Azure cloud computing platform, and the Xbox gaming console.Microsoft is also betting big on AI. It is heavily invested in ChatGPT maker OpenAI and has already announced that Microsoft CoPilot – the AI assistant feature for Microsoft 365 applications – is set to become widely available for enterprise customers next month.Its positioning in this burgeoning space has given investors plenty to cheer about this year, and as with other tech giants, Microsoft has enjoyed the spoils of 2023’s bull market (up by 38%), even if its fiscal fourth quarter of 2023 (June quarter) report failed to entirely please.On the face of it, there was little to worry about. Revenues reached $56.2 billion, representing an 8.3% year-over-year uptick and beating the consensus estimate by $710 million. Likewise, EPS of $2.69 came in ahead of the $2.55 anticipated on Wall Street.However, along with Cloud service Azure’s revenue showing some deceleration, for F1Q, the company guided for revenues between $53.8 billion to $54.8 billion, which is at the midpoint, lower than the $54.94 billion the Street was hoping for.While Ives is cognizant of the worries regarding growth, all signs are that there is little need for concern, especially with the anticipated AI windfall about to take place.“Since Microsoft reported its June quarter investors have been in a ‘wait and see’ mode on the cloud growth trajectory of Redmond and most importantly when the AI monetization opportunity will start to show up in numbers,” Ives said. “We believe while management has talked about a ‘gradual ramp’ for AI monetization in FY24 we believe so far the adoption curve is happening quicker than expected based on our recent checks. Our latest Azure checks also show a clear uptick in activity sequentially (AI driven) which gives us further confidence in Microsoft exceeding its 25%-26% Azure growth guidance in FY1Q.”Conveying his confidence, Ives rates MSFT shares as Outperform (i.e. Buy) backed by a $400 price target, suggesting the stock will post growth of 21% over the one-year timeframe.Overall, MSFT gets a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on a mix of 30 Buys against 4 Holds. The average target is almost identical to Ives’ objective, and at $397.19 allows for share gains of 20% over the coming months.

And, according to research firm Gartner, things could be looking up, which should spell good news for manufacturers ranging from Apple (AAPL) to HP (HPQ) and Windows maker Microsoft (MSFT).“There is evidence that the PC market’s decline has finally bottomed out,” Mikako Kitagawa, research director at Gartner, said in a statement.“Seasonal demand from the education market boosted shipments in the third quarter, although enterprise PC demand remained weak, offsetting some growth. Vendors also made consistent progress towards reducing PC inventory, with inventory expected to return to normal by the end of 2023, as long as holiday sales do not collapse,” she added.PC manufacturers shipped 64.3 million units in Q3, a 9% year-over-year decline. Still, that’s better than the 16.6% decline the industry saw in Q2.The PC industry has been hammered over the last eight quarters thanks to the COVID-related slowdowns, inflation, and rising interest rates. PC companies initially were riding high during the pandemic as consumers looked for ways to work and play at home during long lockdowns. But as stay-at-home orders lifted, sales fell off of a cliff.Inflationary pressures and high interest rates, meanwhile, made it difficult for some consumers to find the cash for new computers, as both prices and financing costs rose. PC shipments subsequently plummeted to their worst levels in decades.In January, Gartner reported that PC shipments dropped a staggering 28.5% year over year, the largest year-over-year decline since the company began tracking shipments in the mid-1990s.Laptops sit on display in a Costco warehouse Wednesday, Sept. 13, 2023, in Sheridan, Colo. (David Zalubowski/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)But the market appears to be turning around, as inventory levels drop and more people seek out newer PCs.“The good news for PC vendors is that the worst could be over by the end of 2023,” Kitagawa said. “The business PC market is ready for the next replacement cycle, driven by the Windows 11 upgrades. Consumer PC demand should also begin to recover as PCs purchased during the pandemic are entering the early stages of a refresh cycle.”Story continuesStill, third quarter declines will sting some companies especially hard. Apple, for instance, saw a 24.2% drop in PC shipments in the quarter. Gartner says the steep fall is a result of tough comparisons to Apple’s Q3 2022 when demand surged following manufacturing disruptions caused by COVID lockdowns in China.While 2023 will be a wash for the industry overall, Gartner says the PC market should recover in 2024, with shipments expected to grow 4.9%, as both consumers and enterprise customers stock up on new systems.Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

Following these closures, there will be 52 remaining Starbucks locations in the city.Starbucks did not disclose the reason for the closures. In a letter to employees, Jessica Borton, the Northern California regional vice president, stated: ""There are several factors Starbucks considers when tasked with the tough decision of closing a store, but it is all part of ensuring a healthy store portfolio.""Starbucks isn't the only consumer-facing giant to take a second look at its San Francisco portfolio this year.Other companies that recently closed locations in San Francisco include Amazon (AMZN), which closed a Whole Foods Market just 13 months after opening it earlier this year and all four Amazon Go Stores in March; Office Depot (ODP), which closed a store in April; and Anthropologie (URBN), which left Union Square after two decades in May.Gap (GPS) also shuttered Old Navy, Banana Republic, and Athleta stores this year, while Nordstrom (JWN) closed its flagship store in August, and Saks Off 5th shut its doors this fall.The Starbucks stores being added to this list are located on Mission and Main, Geary and Taylor, 425 Battery, 398 Market, 4th and Market, 555 California, and Bush and Van Ness. It's worth noting that none of the stores set to close are unionized and employees at the stores will be offered the opportunity to transfer to other locations.San Francisco sluggish in returning to officesWhat's behind the exodus? Hybrid and fully remote companies may be partly to blame.""A big component for sure is that people are remote working and not coming into those offices as much,"" John Zolidis, president of Quo Vadis Capital, told Yahoo Finance. ""That's got to be one of the driving forces — just less traffic from office workers.""Story continuesA customer leaves a Starbucks coffee shop in San Francisco, Calif., on Sept. 13, 2018. (Robert Alexander/Getty Images) (Robert Alexander via Getty Images)Per foot traffic analytics platform Placer.ai, San Francisco has the lowest number of visits to offices of any major US city. In August 2023, office visits were down 52.7% compared to August 2019, before the pandemic disrupted workplaces.San Francisco is ""by far the slowest to come back,"" Ethan Chernofsky, senior vice president of marketing at Placer.ai, told Yahoo Finance. ""When you think about what that means for retail more broadly ... lots of people work there and then shop there and eat there, so that's obviously going to have an impact. ... Then, even [the] people who are coming back to the office [are] not doing so five days a week.""Migration patterns — such as people moving out of the city — are a factor too, Chernofsky said, affecting cities across the US as well as San Francisco. And if retailers leave a city, it can lead to fewer visits to that area as well, causing companies to further reconsider their real estate portfolios.""We see significant headroom for new store growth in underpenetrated areas in the US, including smaller cities, as well as new formats in larger metros,"" Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan said on a call with investors following its Q3 earnings results.However, the tide may be turning for San Francisco, with the artificial intelligence boom acting as a bright spot for activity. Just as the tech industry was the first to move to remote work during the pandemic, it may be a leader in bringing workers back to offices.""San Francisco and the Bay Area in general is really a market that's led by the tech industry,"" Colin Yasukochi, executive director at CBRE’s Tech Insights Center, told Yahoo Finance. ""Over the last six months ... they're starting to see growth perk up in the tech industry. Artificial intelligence is one of those particular areas where the companies are actually looking to expand — they're looking to upgrade the [office] space that they currently have to provide a better experience for their employees.""Pedestrians and vehicles are visible at the base of the Salesforce Tower in San Francisco, Calif., on May 5, 2022. (Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images) (Smith Collection/Gado via Getty Images)A 'difficult operating environment'Crime and safety may also be playing a role.On Sept. 26, Target (TGT) announced plans to close nine stores at the end of October, including three in the San Francisco and Oakland area. Target said crime and retail theft were the reasons behind the decision to close stores.""We cannot continue operating these stores because theft and organized retail crime are threatening the safety of our team and guests, and contributing to unsustainable business performance,"" the company said in a statement.According to crime data on the city's website, theft has been the top issue, followed by burglary. That has affected not only whether companies open retail space in the city but also where they choose to expand.""On-the-ground type of issues have probably impacted where companies are willing to be located in terms of their office space,"" Yasukochi said, ""which is why we've seen a greater concentration of companies looking for space in the central business district and less so in the South of Market or mid-market areas.""For Starbucks, though, it's a bit harder to understand if crime truly was a factor. A spokesperson for the company declined to comment on whether safety played a part in the decision in particular.""There's not large quantities of merchandise to steal and resell,"" Zolidis said about Starbucks stores, though he added: ""It's just a difficult operating environment from an employee safety perspective.""Another factor affecting how companies position themselves in the Golden State could be the approach of a minimum wage law that goes into effect on April 1. The law, which raises starting pay for fast food workers to $20 an hour, is one to watch, Zolidis said.But, he added, ""if that were a deciding factor [for Starbucks], it wouldn't be seven stores in San Francisco [but] a much broader group of stores.""Meanwhile, San Francisco Mayor London Breed remains optimistic about the city's future, despite its challenges.""People still want to be here,"" Breed told Yahoo Finance in a recent interview at Salesforce's annual Dreamforce conference.

81,ac8bb99f-bece-3190-9f63-fa95b08b48d0,PH,2023-10-10,A Closer Look At Parker-Hannifin Corporation's (NYSE:PH) Impressive ROE,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/closer-look-parker-hannifin-corporations-145559173.html,1696863359,STORY,['PH'],"[One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. We'll use ROE to examine Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH), by way of a worked example.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. Check out our latest analysis for Parker-Hannifin How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Parker-Hannifin is:20% = US$2.1b ÷ US$10b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.20.Does Parker-Hannifin Have A Good Return On Equity?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Parker-Hannifin has a higher ROE than the average (14%) in the Machinery industry.roeThat is a good sign. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk.  Our risks dashboardshould have the 2 risks we have identified for Parker-Hannifin.How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesParker-Hannifin's Debt And Its 20% ROEIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Parker-Hannifin, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.21. There's no doubt its ROE is decent, but the very high debt the company carries is not too exciting to see. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.SummaryReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.

With 80% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Archer-Daniels-Midland. See our latest analysis for Archer-Daniels-Midland ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Archer-Daniels-Midland?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Archer-Daniels-Midland does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Archer-Daniels-Midland, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Archer-Daniels-Midland is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 12%. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.7% and 8.1% of the stock.Story continuesWe also observed that the top 10 shareholders account for more than half of the share register, with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Archer-Daniels-MidlandThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$245m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 19% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Archer-Daniels-Midland better, we need to consider many other factors.

The new report from the Synopsys Cybersecurity Research Center is based on a survey conducted by Censuswide polling more than 1,000 IT professionals across the world – including developers, application security professionals, DevOps engineers and CISOs, as well as experts in technology, cybersecurity, and software development.Synopsys (PRNewsfoto/Synopsys)Over 80% of survey respondents indicated that a critical security issue in deployed software impacted their DevOps delivery schedule in the last year. Implementing DevSecOps, a framework focused on embedding security testing throughout each phase of the software development life cycle (SDLC), is an established way to reduce the volume of critical vulnerabilities and exploitable security issues in production applications.""While a vast majority [91%] of organizations have adopted some level of DevSecOps practices, they continue to face barriers effectively implementing its methods, especially at enterprise scale,"" said Jason Schmitt, general manager of the Synopsys Software Integrity Group. ""Specifically, we're noticing that organizations across the globe are struggling with integrating and prioritizing the results from the multiple application security testing tools used by their teams. They also struggle to enforce security and compliance policies automatically through infrastructure-as-code, a practice that was cited most often by respondents as a key factor of their security program's overall success.""Key findings from the report include:-   Most security professionals are already using AI –and even more are wary of its risks. A majority (52%) of survey respondents noted that they are actively using AI to enhance their organization's software security measures. However, even more (76%) are ""very or somewhat concerned"" about potential errors or issues with AI-based cybersecurity solutions.Story continues-   Remediation timelines for most organizations can span weeks. Twenty-eight percent of respondents said their organizations take as long as three weeks to patch critical security risks/vulnerabilities in deployed applications. Another 20% said it can take up to a month, even as most exploits appear within days.-   Application security testing tools are seen as useful to at least two-thirds of respondents. When asked to gauge the usefulness of security tools and practices – including dynamic application security testing (DAST), interactive application security testing (IAST), static application security testing (SAST), and software composition analysis (SCA) – each tool included in the survey was regarded as useful by at least two-thirds of respondents. The report identifies SAST as the highest-regarded AST tool, with 72% indicating that they find it useful. That is closely followed by IAST (69%), SCA (68%), and DAST (67%).-   Security testing responsibilities are equally shared between internal security and development/engineering teams. Software developers and engineers (45%) are just as likely to be tasked with performing security tests on their organization's business-critical applications and continuous improvement (CI) pipelines as internal security team members (46%). One-third (33%) of organizations are also enlisting external consultants to supplement the efforts of internal teams.To learn more, download a copy of the ""Global State of DevSecOps 2023"" report or read the detailed blog post.

REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein (Evelyn Hockstein / reuters)He cited similar concerns bankers had about lending and economic growth in the years after the 2008 crisis, as regulators asked banks to boost their capital cushions to protect against future blowups. Yet, he said, the US economy grew, banking profits recovered to historical averages, and the banking system expanded in size to $23 trillion in assets from $12 trillion.""As banks increased their capital cushions, their profitability grew, as did their market valuation,"" he said. ""This is not to dismiss arguments that higher capital could harm the economy — just to note that similar warnings were not borne out in recent experience.""US regulators proposed their most recent set of changes in July, saying banks affected by the changes would see an aggregate 16% increase in their capital requirements. Regulators said the increase would primarily affect the largest banks and that most have enough capital already to comply. Capital is the buffer banks have to hold to absorb future losses.Regulators also proposed changes in how these banks assess risks and widened the scope of the new rules to institutions with as few as $100 billion in assets, meaning roughly 30 banks would be subject to the same calculations.That would include giants such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) as well as midsized regional banks such as Fifth Third (FITB) and Regions (RF).Story continuesRegulators are accepting comments on this proposal through Nov. 30.Banks have reacted aggressively to the suggested changes. Several bank trade groups sent a letter to the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency asking them to ""re-propose"" the rule, arguing that the initial proposal ""relies on data and analyses that the agencies have not made available to the public.""JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon on Capital Hill in May. REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein (Evelyn Hockstein / reuters)JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon called the new proposal ""hugely disappointing,"" warning that it could push more lending into private credit markets.""I would love to know what they really want to accomplish,"" Dimon said.Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon also didn’t hold back. ""I don’t think these rules make sense,"" he said.Financial Services Forum President and CEO Kevin Fromer on Monday said ""the largest banks have tripled their capital since the crisis and have clearly demonstrated their strength and resilience. There is no evidence in the proposal or today’s remarks that justifies a 20 percent increase, and no one should downplay the costs of these increases to the economy.”Barr said the bulk of the increase in proposed capital is tied to trading and other areas besides lending — activities that he says have generated large losses at big banks and areas where he feels current rules have shortcomings.""The effective rise in capital requirements related to lending activities in the current proposal is a small portion of the estimated overall capital increase,"" Barr said.Barr estimated the higher requirement would increase the costs to banks for funding the average lending portfolio by up to 3 basis points.Though, he added, ""We recognize that the cost of funding for a specific loan would depend on the specific risk weight for that activity and that there may be other channels by which higher capital requirements could matter.""He said the Fed is very interested in public feedback for the capital proposal but that since the Fed has just begun receiving comments, he couldn’t say how the rules could evolve.Barr noted that the Fed has already heard concerns that the proposed risk-based capital treatment for mortgage lending, tax credit investments, trading activities, and activities that generate fee-based income might overestimate the risk of those activities.Regulators have argued the changes are needed to make lenders stronger, more resilient, and better prepared for shocks like the crisis of this spring, when the failures of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic triggered deposit withdrawals across the banking world.Barr said Monday that banks need to be prepared for the worst. After the 2008 crisis, he said, it took six years for employment to recover. The cost of a financial crisis could range from $5 trillion to $25 trillion, he added.Click here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

SLB 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of SLBSLB (SLB): A Deep Dive into Its Performance PotentialUnderstanding the GF ScoreThe GF Score is a stock performance ranking system developed by GuruFocus using five aspects of valuation, which has been found to be closely correlated to the long-term performances of stocks by backtesting from 2006 to 2021. The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores. The GF Score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 as the highest rank.Financial strength rank: 6/10Profitability rank: 6/10Growth rank: 1/10GF Value rank: 4/10Momentum rank: 9/10Based on the above method, GuruFocus assigned SLB the GF Score of 68 out of 100, which signals poor future outperformance potential.SLB (NYSE:SLB): A Snapshot of Its BusinessSLB, formerly known as Schlumberger, is the largest oilfield service firm in the world, with expertise in myriad disciplines, including reservoir performance, well construction, production enhancement, and more recently, digital solutions.

98,e8392b02-8222-34b9-9cde-ca4e3cea5994,SLB,2023-10-10,Schlumberger Limited (SLB) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schlumberger-limited-slb-trending-stock-130007405.html,1696856407,STORY,['SLB'],"[Schlumberger (SLB) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this world's largest oilfield services company have returned -7.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3.4% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry, to which Schlumberger belongs, has lost 7.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Schlumberger is expected to post earnings of $0.77 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.5%.The consensus earnings estimate of $2.97 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +36.2%. This estimate has changed -0.3% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.73 indicates a change of +25.4% from what Schlumberger is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Schlumberger.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Schlumberger, the consensus sales estimate of $8.33 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +11.4%. The $32.92 billion and $37.07 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +17.2% and +12.6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySchlumberger reported revenues of $8.1 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +19.6%. EPS of $0.72 for the same period compares with $0.50 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.23 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.65%. The EPS surprise was +1.41%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Schlumberger is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Schlumberger. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

99,131390dc-3e02-3867-a514-08233a91a8b4,APTV,2023-10-10,Investors in Aptiv (NYSE:APTV) have seen decent returns of 34% over the past five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-aptiv-nyse-aptv-seen-104852508.html,1696934932,STORY,['APTV'],"[Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 12% in the last quarter. But at least the stock is up over the last five years. However we are not very impressed because the share price is only up 31%, less than the market return of 68%.So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. See our latest analysis for Aptiv In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Aptiv's earnings per share are down 5.0% per year, despite strong share price performance over five years.Essentially, it doesn't seem likely that investors are focused on EPS. Because earnings per share don't seem to match up with the share price, we'll take a look at other metrics instead.On the other hand, Aptiv's revenue is growing nicely, at a compound rate of 5.7% over the last five years. It's quite possible that management are prioritizing revenue growth over EPS growth at the moment.The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthAptiv is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. You can see what analysts are predicting for Aptiv in this interactive graph of future profit estimates.What About The Total Shareholder Return (TSR)?Investors should note that there's a difference between Aptiv's total shareholder return (TSR) and its share price change, which we've covered above. The TSR attempts to capture the value of dividends (as if they were reinvested) as well as any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings offered to shareholders. Dividends have been really beneficial for Aptiv shareholders, and that cash payout contributed to why its TSR of 34%, over the last 5 years, is better than the share price return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAptiv shareholders are up 16% for the year. But that was short of the market average. The silver lining is that the gain was actually better than the average annual return of 6% per year over five year. It is possible that returns will improve along with the business fundamentals. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted   2 warning signs for Aptiv  you should be aware of.Of course Aptiv may not be the best stock to buy.

MTG.Industry: Insurance (Multi-line)Link: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2161629/5-multiline-insurers-worth-buying-despite-industry-challengesProduct diversification helps Zacks Multiline Insurance industry players lower concentration risk, ensure uninterrupted revenue generation and improve retention ratio. Better pricing, prudent underwriting, increased exposure, faster economic recovery on the receding impact of the pandemic and increased vaccinations should benefit MetLife Inc., American International Group Inc., The Hartford Financial Services Group, Everest Group, Ltd. and MGIC Investment Corp. Accelerated digitalization will help in the smooth functioning of the industry.The solid capital level of the multiline insurers will fuel merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activities. With four rate hikes this year already, investment income should improve further as insurers are beneficiaries of a better rate environment.About the IndustryThe Zacks Multiline Insurance industry comprises companies that provide single insurance coverage, bundling automobile, homeowner, long-term care, and life and health insurance to individuals and businesses. The insured pays a single premium and is covered for many things through a single contract.These companies cover commercial and personal properties, automobiles, marine, livestock, aviation, personal accident, life, including permanent and term insurance, supplemental accident and health insurance, workers' compensation, annuity products, private mortgage insurance, et al. The players also provide risk management services.Since the companies offer single insurance coverage for multiple products, customer retention improves. The insured stands to benefit from lower premium payment compared to paying individual premiums for insuring varied products.Story continues3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Multiline Insurance IndustryDiversified portfolio lowers concentration risk:  Given the nature of the business, multiline insurers' product and service portfolios are diversified. This lowers concentration risk. Increased awareness, driving higher demand for protection products, should benefit sales and premiums of life insurance operations. Continued improvement in pricing and an increase in exposure should support premium growth.Also, per Deloitte Insights, the transition to green energy and related insurance products, as well as exposure to intangible assets, offers growth opportunities. Per Deloitte Insights, life insurance premium is estimated to increase 1.9% in 2023 while non-life premiums are expected to increase 2.2%.The report also stated that trends like commercial lines witnessing growth faster than personal lines and homeowners' premiums improving at a better rate than personal auto are likely to continue in 2023. However, underwriting losses are expected to persist, driven by challenging results in personal lines.Merger and acquisitions:  Consolidation in the multi-line insurance industry is expected to continue as players look to diversify their operations into new business lines and geographies. Buying businesses along the same lines is driven by the players' need to gain a fair market share and grow in their niche areas. However, with high inflation and a rise in interest rates (the Fed has already made one rate hike this year), momentum in the M&amp;A environment is likely to slow down. Increased adoption of technology: Digitalization has increased by leaps and bounds, especially amid pandemic-induced restrictions. The industry is witnessing greater use of technology like blockchain, AI, advanced analytics, telematics, cloud computing and robotic process automation to expedite business operations and save costs.Many life insurers have started selling policies online that appeal to the tech-savvy population. At the same time, the use of real-time data is making premium calculation easier and reducing risk.The P&amp;C industry, in particular, also witnessed the emergence of insurtech — technology-led insurers — sparking competition for incumbent players. Insurers remain focused on ramping up data and analytics capabilities as well as realizing the benefit of the technological infrastructure per Deloitte Insights. Moreover, the adoption of technology has helped in seamless underwriting and claims processing. However, the adoption of technology comes with the risk of cyber threats.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Weak ProspectsThe group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dismal prospects in the near term. The Zacks Multiline Insurance industry, housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #165, which places it in the bottom 34% of 255 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is the result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. The bleak outlook reflects that the industry's earnings estimates have been revised downward by analysts for the current year.  Earnings estimates for the current year have moved 6.3% south in the past year.Before we present a few multiline insurance stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Underperforms Sector and S&amp;P 500The Multiline Insurance industry has underperformed both the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and its sector over the past six months.

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's 0.63% gain on the day. Elsewhere, the Dow saw an upswing of 0.59%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq appreciated by 0.39%.The medical device maker's shares have seen a decrease of 3.31% over the last month, not keeping up with the Medical sector's loss of 1.62% and outstripping the S&amp;P 500's loss of 3.39%.Analysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of Hologic in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings report is set to go public on November 9, 2023. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $0.85, reflecting a 3.66% increase from the same quarter last year.

103,7d17a0d1-ebfb-3ea1-a56e-04cf2f868699,HOLX,2023-10-10,"Investors Heavily Search Hologic, Inc. (HOLX): Here is What You Need to Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-hologic-inc-130010030.html,1696856410,STORY,['HOLX'],"[Hologic (HOLX) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this medical device maker have returned -3.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3.4% change. The Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, to which Hologic belongs, has lost 7.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Hologic is expected to post earnings of $0.85 per share, indicating a change of +3.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.92 points to a change of -34.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.99 indicates a change of +1.8% from what Hologic is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Hologic is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Hologic, the consensus sales estimate of $941.83 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -1.2%. The $4.03 billion and $4.05 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -17.2% and +0.5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryHologic reported revenues of $984.4 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.8%. EPS of $0.93 for the same period compares with $0.95 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $957.13 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.85%. The EPS surprise was +5.68%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Hologic is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Hologic. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

104,d20cd7be-bce9-3c0e-9c6c-f1526fe78ac7,NFLX,2023-10-10,Hollywood's minority writers fear diversity to fall farther down the agenda after strike,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hollywoods-minority-writers-fear-diversity-100000420.html,1696932000,STORY,['NFLX'],"[By Danielle BroadwayLOS ANGELES, Oct 10 (Reuters) - After the Writers Guild of America approved a new three-year contract with major studios, Hollywood writers from underrepresented groups, many nervous about their job security in the rapidly changing industry, aim to refocus studios' attention on increasing diversity.The WGA represents 11,500 film and television writers, but many minority members – people of color, LGBTQ+ individuals, disabled people and women – hoped the negotiations would have made diversifying the business a priority.The Guild's demands did not directly address diversity. But WGA West board member and negotiating committee member Angelina Burnett said the contract talks were meant to protect everyone’s economic stability. The new contract was approved on Monday.However, some Hollywood minority writers are troubled by what they see as institutional bias after several diversity initiatives suffered during cost-cutting this year. Studios are not as outspoken about the inclusion pledges they made after the police killing of George Floyd in 2020.Some writers have decided to launch their own initiatives to revive those promises and support other minority writers.“There will need to be lots of efforts made by writers and companies to make sure that our hiring is as equitable as possible,"" said writer Luvh Rakhe, who is South Asian American, has worked on sitcom “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” among others and was a WGA negotiator.Caroline Renard, a writer on animated children's show “Bossy Bear,” co-founded Black Women Rising after Floyd’s death. The group's mission is to help low- to mid-level Black women writers in their careers. Similar groups like Black Women Brunch and Black Male Screenwriters also support Black writers.Renard said building community and resources remains vital because underrepresented writers fear that studios after the strike will focus on cost-cutting to make up for lost revenue, rather than diversity.Story continuesThis summer, six Black women executives who led diversity and inclusion initiatives abruptly left their jobs at major Hollywood organizations including Warner Bros Discovery, Netflix, the BBC and the Academy of Motion Pictures.Some were laid off while others voluntarily quit. The reasons were not publicly announced, but the exodus occurred as studios including Disney, Warner Bros Discovery and Netflix implemented major cost cuts.The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, the group representing the major studios, did not respond to a request for comment. The companies have largely been silent about diversity initiatives since the strikes began in May.INDUSTRY IN UPHEAVALEmployment figures for the industry back up claims that minority writers are underrepresented. The share of Black, Indigenous and people of color in screen employment was 22.6% in 2020 while these groups accounted for 42.2% of the U.S. population, according to a WGA report.White people held 77.4% of jobs and represented 57.8% of the population, according to the report. Disabled people hold about 1% of writing roles for TV series, pilots and screenplays, yet 27% of American adults report having a disability.The drive for greater equity faces a different climate than it did during racial justice protests of 2020. The Supreme Court's decision in June banning affirmative action in college admissions has prompted corporate America to reconsider the issue.Since May, film and TV businesses shed 45,000 jobs, according to U.S. government data in October. Meanwhile, traditional television viewership is plummeting and streaming video services are struggling to turn a profit.“I know a lot of people are scared. I am scared, of course,” said Renard.As a Black disabled woman, writer Keisha Zollar, whose credits include family drama “Young Love,” worries she and other disabled writers will be ""marginalized further.""“It’s a lot of emotional stress because I’m in a position where I’m the breadwinner of my family,” Zollar said.The nonprofit Inevitable Foundation provides financial support to disabled writers facing economic hardships and lobbies for more equitable opportunities in Hollywood.Co-founder Richie Siegel believes many studios will default to the ""status quo"" as they restart after the strike, paying little attention to employment and accessibility barriers faced by disabled writers.Kyle Bowser, NAACP senior vice president for its Hollywood bureau, said there are concerns that as pay rises for writers, studios will create fewer shows.This would make minority writers especially vulnerable as they are often in the most junior positions. “There’s the adage that the last hired are the first fired,” he said.

Per the agreement terms, Bristol Myers will acquire all the outstanding shares of Mirati for $58 per share in cash, aggregating to $4.8 billion.Existing Mirati shareholders will also receive one non-tradeable contingent value right (“CVR”) per share, entitling the holder to receive an additional $12 per share.The CVR holders will be entitled to the payment if the FDA grants regulatory approval to Mirati’s PRMT5 inhibitor, MRTX1719, in patients with either locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) who have received no more than two prior lines of systemic therapy. For the CVR holders to be eligible for this payment, the approval must be received within seven years after the merger's closing.The CVR adds another $1 billion to the transaction, bringing the deal's total value up to $5.8 billion.The buyout offer comes a couple of months after Mirati reported encouraging data from clinical studies, which showed that treatment with the Krazati-Keytruda combination achieved an ORR of 63% in patients with KRAS G12C-mutated first-line NSCLC. This ORR was superior and favorable compared with the 39-45% ORR achieved by the current standard of care, i.e., Keytruda plus chemotherapy. Based on the above data, management intends to start a pivotal late-stage study on the Krazati-Keytruda combination in first-line NSCLC before 2023-end.The transaction, expected to be completed by first-half 2024, is subject to customary closing conditions and clearance from the regulatory authorities. Mirati’s and Bristol Myers’ board of directors have already approved this transaction.The above transaction will be funded by Bristol Myers using a combination of cash and debt.Year to date, shares of Mirati have rallied 32.9% against the industry’s 16.5% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLast Thursday, the share price of Mirati surged 45% after a Bloomberg article suggested that pharma giant Sanofi SNY was interested in acquiring Mirati. Though neither Mirati nor Sanofi commented on the rumor, the report suggested that several other suitors besides Sanofi were also interested in acquiring Mirati.Story continuesMirati Therapeutics has been a likely acquisition target since the FDA granted accelerated approval to its sole-marketed drug, Krazati (adagrasib), last December. Krazati is approved to treat KRASG12C-mutated locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC in adult patients who received at least one prior treatment. Mirati is also evaluating Krazati in multiple-label expansion studies, both as monotherapy and in combination with other drugs, across multiple cancer indications.Apart from Krazati, Mirati is also evaluating multiple other pipeline candidates. These include MRTX1719, SOS1 inhibitor MRTX0902 and KRASG12D inhibitor MRTX1133 candidates in separate early-stage clinical studies.The timing of the acquisition offer also benefits Mirati as it came a few days after an FDA advisory committee was supposed to issue its recommendation on Lumakras, another KRASG12C inhibitor marketed by Amgen AMGN, also approved for an indication similar to Krazati. The committee members questioned the late-stage confirmatory study supporting Amgen’s regulatory filing on Lumakras and voted 10-2, stating that they cannot correctly interpret the study’s primary endpoint.Like Krazati, Amgen’s Lumakras was also granted accelerated approval in 2021 as the first FDA-approved therapy to target a KRASG12C-mutated cancer indication. An FDA filing is currently under review to convert this accelerated approval to a full one.Despite a negative recommendation, the FDA did not suggest withdrawing the drug from the market. A final decision on Amgen’s Lumakras is still expected before this year’s end.Mirati Therapeutics, Inc. Price Mirati Therapeutics, Inc.

One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Newmont saw its share price decline over the three years in which its EPS also dropped, falling to a loss. Extraordinary items contributed to this situation. Due to the loss, it's not easy to use EPS as a reliable guide to the business. But it's safe to say we'd generally expect the share price to be lower as a result!The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into Newmont's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Newmont's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Newmont's TSR for the last 3 years was -33%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 18% in the last year, Newmont shareholders lost 6.8% (even including dividends). Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 6% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Newmont  that you should be aware of.Of course Newmont may not be the best stock to buy.

This means that a larger number of shares were purchased by insiders in relation to shares sold.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Palisades Goldcorp The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Palisades GoldcorpNotably, that recent purchase by Michael Parker is the biggest insider purchase of Palisades Goldcorp shares that we've seen in the last year. That implies that an insider found the current price of CA$2.38 per share to be enticing. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. While we always like to see insider buying, it's less meaningful if the purchases were made at much lower prices, as the opportunity they saw may have passed. The good news for Palisades Goldcorp share holders is that an insider was buying at near the current price. Michael Parker was the only individual insider to buy during the last year.Michael Parker bought a total of 45.00k shares over the year at an average price of CA$2.30. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeThere are always plenty of stocks that insiders are buying. So if that suits your style you could check each stock one by one or you could take a look at this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insider OwnershipFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Insiders own 39% of Palisades Goldcorp shares, worth about CA$46m. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Palisades Goldcorp Insider Transactions Indicate?It is good to see the recent insider purchase. And an analysis of the transactions over the last year also gives us confidence. But we don't feel the same about the fact the company is making losses. Given that insiders also own a fair bit of Palisades Goldcorp we think they are probably pretty confident of a bright future. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. For instance, we've identified 2 warning signs for Palisades Goldcorp (1 doesn't sit too well with us) you should be aware of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.Have feedback on this article?

This comparison sets the stage for a deeper exploration of the company's value.Unveiling General Dynamics (GD)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right?

A Comprehensive GuideProfitability and Growth of General DynamicsInvesting in profitable companies carries less risk, especially those with consistent profitability over the long term. A company with high profit margins often offers better performance potential than a company with low profit margins. General Dynamics has been profitable for 10 years over the past 10 years.

Overall, GuruFocus ranks General Dynamics's profitability as strong.Growth is a crucial factor in the valuation of a company. Growth is closely correlated with the long-term performance of a company's stock. If a company's business is growing, it usually creates value for its shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. Conversely, if a company's revenue and earnings are declining, the value of the company will decrease. General Dynamics's 3-year average revenue growth rate is worse than 54.92% of 264 companies in the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry. General Dynamics's 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 0.3%, which ranks worse than 52.61% of 230 companies in the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry.Another method of determining the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital (ROIC) to the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The ROIC measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The WACC is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it implies the company is creating value for shareholders. For the past 12 months, General Dynamics's ROIC is 7.83, and its cost of capital is 7.56.Unveiling General Dynamics (GD)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideConclusionBased on our analysis, General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) stock is estimated to be fairly valued. The company's financial condition is fair, and its profitability is strong. However, its growth ranks worse than 52.61% of 230 companies in the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry.

Williams (DDG 95) assault ships. The award has been offered by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C.Details of the DealValued at $15.6 million, the contract is expected to be completed by April 2024. Per the terms of the deal, General Dynamics will provide planning of the maintenance, modernization, and repair of USS Chung-Hoon and USS James E. Williams ships’ fiscal 2024 depot maintenance period availabilities. A major portion of the work related to this deal will be carried out in Norfolk, VA. This contract includes options which, if exercised, would bring its cumulative value to $753 million and work for the same will continue through November 2030.What’s Favoring General Dynamics?The changing dynamics of the military landscape and the rising geopolitical tension make it mandatory for a country to continuously evolve and strengthen its defense structure. To this end, Navy ships form an integral part of any military mission and arm the same in its ship warfare affairs.Among different types of assault ships, DDG are guided missile destroyer warships that offer multi-mission offensive and defensive capabilities. It is imperative to mention in this context that General Dynamics builds the Arleigh Burke-class (DDG-51) guided-missile destroyers, one of the most guided missile destroyers. The company also manages the modernization and lifecycle support for this class of warship.Notably, its NASSCO unit conducts full-service maintenance and surface-ship repair operations in Navy fleet concentration areas. As a result, the company frequently secures contracts from Pentagon for providing maintenance and repair support for the U.S. Navy ships, like the latest one. Such contract wins, in turn, should further boost revenue growth for GD’s Marine Systems segment, which houses the NASSCO unit and registered 15.4% top-line growth in the last reported quarter.Story continuesGrowth ProspectsWith increased spending by nations for strengthening their sea warfare capabilities, the military shipbuilding market is expected to witness strong demand. Per Mordor Intelligence, the global shipbuilding market is likely to witness a CAGR of more than 4.8% over the 2023-2028 period.

Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo said it was caused by an “external source” as he declined to speculate who may be responsible.“It makes sense to increase our security of supply, secure critical infrastructure,” Orpo told reporters in Helsinki. “The wise prepare. If something like this, so far inexplicable, happens, then it can also happen again.”European gas prices jumped, as the leak revived concerns about the vulnerability of energy infrastructure particularly in the context of the war in Ukraine. Following the explosions on the Nord Stream pipelines from Russia to Germany last year — for which responsibility has yet to be determined — European countries have stepped up defense of their key assets.While the rupture of the pipeline is not significant for the wider European gas market, it raises questions about security of supply just as Europe goes into winter. Russia halted gas flows to Finland in May 2022, about a week after the Nordic country said it would apply for NATO membership in response to Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.The Most Vulnerable SitesFinland’s President Sauli Niinisto spoke to NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Tuesday, and the group said it’s sharing information and “stands ready” to support its allies.

Australia's Offshore Alliance union had called off strikes at Chevron's facilities after the union and Chevron accepted proposals from the country's industrial arbitrator, resolving a fight that threatened to disrupt around 7% of the world's LNG supply. Chevron had been negotiating with the workers for weeks at the same as Australia's Woodside Energy, which managed to avert strikes in August after reaching a deal. Here is a sequence of events leading up to the strike action: Date Development Aug. 9 Workers at Woodside's liquefied LNG facilities in Australia vote for industrial action. Aug. 10 Chevron and Woodside say they are holding talks with union to avert any potential action by the workers. Aug. 11 Australia's labor regulator, the Fair Work Commission, allows workers' union to hold a ballot of employees to decide if they wanted to make a decision on taking industrial action at Chevron's Gorgon and downstream Wheatstone LNG facilities. Aug. 15 Negotiations between Chevron, Woodside Energy Group and Australian unions continue but a source with knowledge of the matter tells Reuters that the talks are unlikely to yield results for days. Aug. 16 Woodside says ""positive progress"" was being made on talks with a union alliance on disputes over the wages of workers. Aug. 16 The Offshore Alliance says during the negotiations Woodside was ""well off the pace on key bargaining issues including job security and remuneration."" Aug. 18 Voting opens in Chevron's facilities to let workers decide if they want to strike due to disputes over wages and working conditions. Aug. 20 Unions at Woodside's North West Shelf offshore gas platforms announce plans to strike as early as Sept. 2. Aug. 22 Woodside CEO Meg O'Neil says the company has had ""constructively addressed"" several concerns of workers but said it also has a duty to shareholders to be able to run the business. Aug. 23 Woodside and unions meet for another round of talks to avoid the strikes. Aug. 23 Chevron's Australian unit says it would increase domestic gas production capacity at its Wheatstone facility. Aug. 24 Woodside reaches an in-principle agreement with unions to avert strikes. Aug. 24 Workers at Chevron's Gorgon and Wheatstone downstream facilities vote to allow unions to call for a strike if necessary. Aug. 25 Unions at Chevron's LNG facilities in Australia warn that work stoppages could cost the U.S. energy major billions in exports if workers' demands on wages and conditions were not met. Aug. 28 Workers at Chevron's offshore Wheatstone facility grant unions the power to call strikes on their behalf. Aug. 28 Unions representing workers at Chevron's two major Australian LNG complexes say that they will take industrial action from Sept. 7. Aug. 29 Chevron's workers release details of industrial action including potential work stoppages of up to 10 hours. Sept. 1 Chevron workers reject a company pay and conditions offer. Sept. 1 The offshore alliance says no meetings have been scheduled between unions and Chevron. Sept. 4 Mediation talks to avert strikes at Chevron's LNG facilities in Australia begin once again. Sept. 5 Chevron workers announce plans for total strikes from Sept. 14 if their demands were not met. Sept. 5 Some employees of Chevron's Wheatstone LNG facility in Australia offer to work during industrial action in a bid to avert domestic supply disruptions, the Offshore alliance says. Sept. 6 Workers at Chevron's LNG facilities agree to pause planned strike action for one day until Sept. 8. Sept. 7 Chevron's LNG workers agree to delay the strike until 1 p.m. local time in Perth (0500 GMT) on Sept. 8 from the earlier scheduled start at 6 a.m. in Perth. Sept. 8 Workers at Chevron's LNG project begin strike as talks between the company and the unions fail to yield any results. Sept. 9 Chevron starts withdrawing contractor workers from Gorgon as the strike continues. Sept. 11 Chevron says it sees ""no reasonable prospect of agreement"" with the workers and would apply to the Fair Work Commission for an ""intractable bargaining"" declaration, which, if granted, would end the strike and allow the labor regulator to dictate an agreement. Sept. 12 The office of the labor regulator said it would hold a hearing on Sept. 22 about the dispute, while the unions wanted it to be held at a later date in November. Sept. 14 Union group Offshore Alliance said a turbine tripped at one of Wheatstone's two LNG trains, which convert natural gas into liquid, on the same day strikes escalated. Sept. 15 Workers begin a 24-hour strike at Chevron's LNG plants. Union representative says they intend to extend industrial action for a further two weeks to mid-October. Sept. 18 Chevron says full production had resumed on Sept. 17 at its Wheatstone LNG plant after a fault last week cut production by almost a quarter. Sept. 20 Latest round of talks between Chevron and unions at its two LNG facilities in Western Australia ends without a deal. Sept. 21 Chevron says it would accept the terms of a deal brokered by the Fair Work Commission to end the dispute. Sept. 22 Australian union alliance calls off strikes at Chevron's two major LNG projects after accepting proposals from the country's industrial arbitrator to end long-running disputes over pay and conditions. Oct. 5 Workers vote to restart strikes accusing Chevron of reneging on commitments. Night-shift workers at Chevron's Oct. 6 facilities also vote for strikes. Chevron Oct. 9 asks the Fair Works Commission to help resolve the dispute again as unions announce Oct. 19 as the date for fresh strikes.

Some of the victims were beheaded.The criminal complaint filed on Monday accuses TotalEnergies, which was developing a $20 billion liquefied natural gas project at Afungi near Palma, of involuntary manslaughter and failure to assist persons in danger.Mozambique's government said around 30 people were killed in the attack but Alex Perry, an independent journalist who carried out a five-month investigation into the massacre, counted 1,402 people dead or missing, including 55 Total contractors.- 'Danger was known' -Seven British and South African complainants --- three survivors and four relatives of victims -- accuse TotalEnergies, which was still known as Total in 2021, of failing to take steps to ensure the safety of subcontractors before the assault.The Al-Shabab group (no link to the Somali group of the same name) which carried out the attack had been active in Cabo Delgado province since 2017 and drawing ever closer to Palma.""The danger was known. Several villages had already been attacked before the Palma attack, and there was a real jihadist threat,"" the complainants lawyer Thulliez argued.Total is also accused of refusing to provide fuel to a South African security company that organized helicopter rescues from a besieged hotel during the attack.The company eventually ran out of fuel, leaving people stranded inside.Janik Armstrong, a Canadian whose husband Adrian Nel was killed in the siege, told reporters in Paris Tuesday how he held out under siege for two days at Amarula Lodge, with 150 others ""waiting for a rescue by Total or the Mozambican security forces that never came.""Story continuesShe said that when they realised that ""they had been abandoned"" they tried to break out in a convoy of cars but came under fire from the gunmen, who killed her husband.She quoted Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne declaring in February 2021 that security both of Total staff and subcontractors in Mozambique was his ""highest priority"" and said: ""We are here today to call Total to account for those broken promises.""Britain's Mark Mawyer whose brother Philip also died in the attack, said he joined the legal action to commemorate the dead because he did not want to ""let Total brush their memory under the carpet"".On its website Tuesday TotalEnergies said that ""all the staff of Mozambique LNG and its contractors and subcontractors had been evacuated"", mostly by boat.The company also insisted it had supplied fuel for the rescue operation.In July 2021, Rwanda and southern African countries deployed troops which helped Mozambique retake control of much of Cabo Delgado.Pouyanne has indicated that he hopes to soon relaunch the Afungi project -- the fourth-largest offshore gas project in the world at the time of its discovery in 2010 -- despite low-level jihadist attacks continuing in part of Cabo Delgado.This is the second criminal complaint against the French gas giant in days.Last week, four environmental groups launched legal action against the group for ""climaticide"" over a controversial oil project in Tanzania and Uganda.cf/cb/sjw/rl]"

The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores. The GF Score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 as the highest rank.Financial strength rank: 3/10Profitability rank: 6/10Growth rank: 3/10GF Value rank: 4/10Momentum rank: 2/10Based on the above method, GuruFocus assigned NextEra Energy Partners LP the GF Score of 60 out of 100, which signals poor future outperformance potential.NextEra Energy Partners LP Business OverviewNextEra Energy Partners LP, with a market cap of $1.95 billion and sales of $1.22 billion, operates in the clean energy sector. It owns interests in wind and solar projects in North America, as well as natural gas infrastructure assets in Texas.

The company's interest coverage ratio of 0.39 positions it worse than 94.92% of 315 companies in the Utilities - Independent Power Producers industry. This ratio highlights potential challenges the company might face when handling its interest expenses on outstanding debt. The company's Altman Z-Score is just 0.26, which is below the distress zone of 1.81. This suggests that the company may face financial distress over the next few years. Additionally, the company's low cash-to-debt ratio at 0.09 indicates a struggle in handling existing debt levels. Furthermore, the company's debt-to-Ebitda ratio is 8.51, which is above Joel Tillinghast's warning level of 4 and is worse than 71.52% of 316 companies in the Utilities - Independent Power Producers industry.Growth ProspectsA lack of significant growth is another area where NextEra Energy Partners LP seems to falter, as evidenced by the company's low Growth rank.

Over the past five years, NextEra Energy Partners LP has witnessed a decline in its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). The three-year growth rate is recorded at -5.5, while the five-year growth rate is at -6.8. These figures underscore potential challenges in the company's profitability. Lastly, NextEra Energy Partners LP predictability rank is just one star out of five, adding to investor uncertainty regarding revenue and earnings consistency.NextEra Energy Partners LP (NEP): A Deep Dive into Its Performance MetricsConclusionGiven the company's financial strength, profitability, and growth metrics, the GF Score highlights the firm's unparalleled position for potential underperformance. While NextEra Energy Partners LP has a commendable history in the Utilities - Independent Power Producers industry, its current financial and growth indicators suggest that it may struggle to maintain its past performance.

LMT 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of LMTLockheed Martin Corp, the world's largest defense contractor, has dominated the Western market for high-end fighter aircraft since winning the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program in 2001. The company's largest segment, aeronautics, generates upwards of two-thirds of its revenue from the F-35.Lockheed Martin's remaining segments include rotary and mission systems (mainly the Sikorsky helicopter business), missiles and fire control (creating missiles and missile defense systems), and space systems (producing satellites and receiving equity income from the United Launch Alliance joint venture).The company's stock price currently stands at $433.03, with a GF Value of $450.63, suggesting that the stock is fairly valued.Lockheed Martin (LMT): A Comprehensive Analysis of Its Market ValueUnderstanding the GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary measure of a stock's intrinsic value, computed considering historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates.The GF Value Line denotes the stock's ideal fair trading value. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued, and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is estimated to be fairly valued based on GuruFocus' valuation method. At its current price of $433.03 per share, Lockheed Martin stock is estimated to be fairly valued. Because Lockheed Martin is fairly valued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be close to the rate of its business growth.Story continuesLockheed Martin (LMT): A Comprehensive Analysis of Its Market ValueLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial Strength of Lockheed MartinInvesting in companies with poor financial strength has a higher risk of permanent loss of capital. Thus, it is crucial to carefully review a company's financial strength before deciding whether to buy its stock.Looking at the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage is a great starting point for understanding a company's financial strength. Lockheed Martin has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.21, which is worse than 71.33% of 293 companies in the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry. GuruFocus ranks the overall financial strength of Lockheed Martin at 6 out of 10, indicating fair financial strength.Lockheed Martin (LMT): A Comprehensive Analysis of Its Market ValueProfitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies, especially those demonstrating consistent profitability over the long term, poses less risk. A company with high profit margins is also typically a safer investment than one with low profit margins. Lockheed Martin has been profitable 10 over the past 10 years.Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $67.40 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $27.35. Its operating margin is 12.86%, which ranks better than 75.51% of 294 companies in the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry. Overall, GuruFocus ranks Lockheed Martin's profitability at 9 out of 10, indicating strong profitability.Growth is probably the most important factor in a company's valuation. The faster a company is growing, the more likely it is to be creating value for shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. The 3-year average annual revenue growth rate of Lockheed Martin is 5.8%, which ranks better than 61.74% of 264 companies in the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 0.9%, which ranks worse than 50.43% of 230 companies in the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry.ROIC vs WACCAnother method of determining a company's profitability is to compare its return on invested capital to the weighted average cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it implies the company is creating value for shareholders. For the past 12 months, Lockheed Martin's return on invested capital is 16.26, and its cost of capital is 6.42.Lockheed Martin (LMT): A Comprehensive Analysis of Its Market ValueConclusionIn conclusion, the stock of Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is estimated to be fairly valued.

Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system.

(PHM) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pultegroup-inc-phm-trending-stock-130012588.html,1696856412,STORY,['PHM'],"[PulteGroup (PHM) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this homebuilder have returned -10.6%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry, which PulteGroup falls in, has lost 8.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, PulteGroup is expected to post earnings of $2.79 per share, indicating a change of +3.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $11.62 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +7.6%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.71 indicates a change of +0.8% from what PulteGroup is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for PulteGroup.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For PulteGroup, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $4.04 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +2.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $16.49 billion and $17.36 billion estimates indicate +1.6% and +5.3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPulteGroup reported revenues of $4.19 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.7%. EPS of $3 for the same period compares with $2.73 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.96 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.9%. The EPS surprise was +21.46%.Over the last four quarters, PulteGroup surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.PulteGroup is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about PulteGroup. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company’s overall business growth is dented by lower economic activity in China and cautious spending across its customer base globally, particularly in biotech. Declining COVID-19 testing revenues impede the company’s growth. The contraction of margins, due to escalating costs remain a concern.However, on a positive note, strong execution of proven growth strategy, launching a range of high-impact, innovative new products are likely to aid the company’s growth in coming quarters.

AMD continues to benefit from acquisitions, including Xilinx and Pensando, which has diversified its business.However, weakness in the Gaming and Embedded segment revenues are expected to hurt top-line growth.

The asset divestments might hinder BP’s future cash generating opportunities going forward.BP’s balance sheet is more levered than most peers, limiting its financial flexibility. Thus, the integrated energy company is more vulnerable to economic downturn than its peers. While crude oil prices are currently on an upward trend, the broader commodity pricing environment is not as robust as it was a year ago.As a result, the Zacks analyst anticipates that the leading integrated energy company's revenue to decrease in 2023.

At a pre-specified interim analysis, KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy before surgery (neoadjuvant), followed by resection and KEYTRUDA as a single agent after surgery (adjuvant), demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in OS compared to neoadjuvant placebo plus chemotherapy followed by adjuvant placebo in these patients.The safety profile of KEYTRUDA was consistent with that observed in previously reported studies; no new safety signals were identified. Full results from this analysis of KEYNOTE-671 will be presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress 2023 and shared with regulatory authorities worldwide.""This is a significant milestone in the treatment of resectable non-small cell lung cancer, as it represents the first Phase 3 study to show a statistically significant overall survival benefit for these patients with stage II, IIIA or IIIB (T3-4N2) non-small cell lung cancer. These results build upon the previously reported event-free survival data, and demonstrate the potential for this KEYTRUDA-based regimen to help extend the lives of these patients,"" said Dr. Marjorie Green, senior vice president and head of late-stage oncology, global clinical development, Merck Research Laboratories. ""We're excited by the progress we have made to help patients with earlier stages of non-small cell lung cancer, who are in need of additional treatment options.""Story continuesAs previously announced, at the first interim analysis, KEYNOTE-671 met the other one of its dual primary endpoints, event-free survival (EFS), as well as its key secondary endpoints of pathological complete response (pCR) and major pathological response (mPR). These results were presented at the 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and, based on these data, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted Merck’s new supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), or target action, date of October 16, 2023.Merck has an extensive clinical development program in lung cancer and is advancing multiple registration-enabling studies, with research directed at earlier stages of disease and novel combinations. Key studies in earlier stages of NSCLC and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) include KEYNOTE-671, KEYNOTE-091, KEYNOTE-867, KEYLYNK-012, KEYVIBE-006 and KEYLYNK-013.About KEYNOTE-671KEYNOTE-671 is a randomized, double-blind Phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03425643) evaluating neoadjuvant KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy, followed by adjuvant KEYTRUDA as a single agent versus placebo plus neoadjuvant chemotherapy, followed by adjuvant placebo in patients with resectable stage II, IIIA or IIIB (T3-4N2) NSCLC. The trial’s dual primary endpoints are EFS and OS. Key secondary endpoints include pCR and mPR. The study enrolled 786 patients who were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either:KEYTRUDA (200 mg intravenously [IV] every three weeks [Q3W] for up to four cycles) plus chemotherapy (cisplatin [75 mg/m^2, IV; given on Day 1 of each cycle] and either gemcitabine [1000 mg/m^2, IV; given on Days 1 and 8 of each cycle) or pemetrexed [500 mg/m^2, IV; given on Day 1 of each cycle]) as neoadjuvant therapy prior to surgery, followed by KEYTRUDA (200 mg IV Q3W for up to 13 cycles) as adjuvant therapy post-surgery, orPlacebo (saline IV Q3W for up to four cycles) plus chemotherapy (cisplatin [75 mg/m^2, IV; given on Day 1 of each cycle] and either gemcitabine [1000 mg/m^2, IV; given on Days 1 and 8 of each cycle] or pemetrexed [500 mg/m^2, IV; given on Day 1 of each cycle]) as neoadjuvant therapy prior to surgery, followed by placebo (saline IV Q3W for up to 13 cycles) as adjuvant therapy post-surgery.About lung cancerLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. In 2020 alone, there were more than 2.2 million new cases and 1.8 million deaths from lung cancer globally. Non-small cell lung cancer is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for about 81% of all cases. In the U.S., the overall five-year survival rate for patients diagnosed with lung cancer is 25%, which is a 21% improvement over the last five years. Improved survival rates are due, in part, to earlier detection and screening, advances in diagnostic and surgical procedures, as well as the introduction of new therapies. Early detection and screening remain an important unmet need, as 44% of lung cancer cases are not found until they are advanced. Only 5.8% of people in the U.S. who are eligible were screened for lung cancer in 2021.About Merck’s research in lung cancerMerck is advancing research aimed at transforming the way lung cancer is treated, with a goal of improving outcomes for patients affected by this deadly disease. Through nearly 200 clinical trials evaluating more than 36,000 patients around the world, Merck is at the forefront of lung cancer research. In NSCLC, KEYTRUDA has five approved U.S. indications (see indications below) and is approved for advanced disease in more than 95 countries. Among Merck’s research efforts are trials focused on evaluating KEYTRUDA in earlier stages of lung cancer as well as identifying new combinations and coformulations with KEYTRUDA.About Merck’s early-stage cancer clinical programFinding cancer at an earlier stage may give patients a greater chance of long-term survival. Many cancers are considered most treatable and potentially curable in their earliest stage of disease. Building on the strong understanding of the role of KEYTRUDA in later-stage cancers, Merck is studying KEYTRUDA in earlier disease states, with approximately 20 ongoing registrational studies across multiple types of cancer.About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mgKEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.Selected KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S.Non-Small Cell Lung CancerKEYTRUDA, in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.KEYTRUDA, in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or paclitaxel protein-bound, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with NSCLC expressing PD-L1 [tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥1%] as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations, and is:stage III where patients are not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation, ormetastatic.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving KEYTRUDA.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated as adjuvant treatment following resection and platinum-based chemotherapy for adult patients with stage IB (T2a ≥4 cm), II, or IIIA NSCLC.See additional selected indications for KEYTRUDA in the U.S. after the Selected Important Safety InformationSelected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDASevere and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsKEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the PD-1 or the PD-L1, blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.Immune-Mediated PneumonitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution.Pneumonitis occurred in 41 (7%) patients, including fatal (0.2%), Grade 4 (0.3%), and Grade 3 (1%) adverse reactions. In adult patients who received adjuvant therapy for NSCLC, patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 1 day to 2.3 months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 26 (4.5%) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 54% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 63% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 71% had resolution.Immune-Mediated ColitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients.Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated HepatitisKEYTRUDA as a Single AgentKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients.KEYTRUDA With AxitinibKEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT ≥3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT ≥3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both. All patients with a recurrence of ALT ≥3 ULN subsequently recovered from the event.Immune-Mediated EndocrinopathiesAdrenal InsufficiencyKEYTRUDA can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 77% (17/22) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.3% (8) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.HypophysitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism. Initiate hormone replacement as indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.2%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 94% (16/17) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Hypophysitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (4) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.Thyroid DisordersKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated thyroid disorders. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism. Initiate hormone replacement for hypothyroidism or institute medical management of hyperthyroidism as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.3%). None discontinued, but KEYTRUDA was withheld in &lt;0.1% (1) of patients.Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (0.8%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (2) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. Hypothyroidism occurred in 8% (237/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (6.2%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.5% (14) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. The majority of patients with hypothyroidism required long-term thyroid hormone replacement. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC, occurring in 16% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 389 adult patients with cHL (17%) receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grade 1 (6.2%) and Grade 2 (10.8%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hyperthyroidism was higher in 580 patients with resected NSCLC, occurring in 11% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent as adjuvant treatment, including Grade 3 (0.2%) hyperthyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 580 patients with resected NSCLC, occurring in 22% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent as adjuvant treatment (KEYNOTE-091), including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism.Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Which Can Present With Diabetic KetoacidosisMonitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Initiate treatment with insulin as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Type 1 DM occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA. It led to permanent discontinuation in &lt;0.1% (1) and withholding of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (1) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.Immune-Mediated Nephritis With Renal DysfunctionKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Immune-mediated nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.1%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 89% (8/9) of patients. Nephritis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (3) and withholding in 0.1% (3) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Nephritis resolved in 56% of the 9 patients.Immune-Mediated Dermatologic Adverse ReactionsKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated rash or dermatitis. Exfoliative dermatitis, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, has occurred with anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Topical emollients and/or topical corticosteroids may be adequate to treat mild to moderate nonexfoliative rashes. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions occurred in 1.4% (38/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (1%) and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 40% (15/38) of patients. These reactions led to permanent discontinuation in 0.1% (2) and withholding of KEYTRUDA in 0.6% (16) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 6% had recurrence. The reactions resolved in 79% of the 38 patients.Other Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsThe following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of &lt;1% (unless otherwise noted) in patients who received KEYTRUDA or were reported with the use of other anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions. Cardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; Ocular: Uveitis, iritis and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica; Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism; Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection.Infusion-Related ReactionsKEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple MyelomaIn trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.Embryofetal ToxicityBased on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.Adverse ReactionsIn KEYNOTE-006, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 9% of 555 patients with advanced melanoma; adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%).

163,71974fc9-93b0-3db1-91f5-a7a78a96cfe8,ILMN,2023-10-10,NVIDIA and Illumina have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-illumina-highlighted-zacks-bull-122900399.html,1696854540,STORY,"['NVDA', 'ILMN', 'GM']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – October 9, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares NVIDIA NVDA as the Bull of the Day and Illumina ILMN as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on General Motors GM, Ford F and Stellantis STLA.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:I last wrote about NVIDIA as the Bull of the Day in early September when it seemed like estimates had surged so much that they couldn't go any higher.This was two weeks after the company's August 23 quarterly report and most analysts had made their upward revisions based on strong guidance from Jensen Huang &amp; Co.But the full wrath (and math) of the AI tsunami that NVIDIA has given life to is still being underestimated by Wall Street analysts and investors.And that means the sales and profit estimates for NVDA keep getting revised upwards.For perspective, here was the update I gave on September 6...Because look what happened with the Starship Jensen's results and guidance: They blew the roof off with a roughly $2 billion beat on the Q2 top line and then forecasted almost a $4 billion beat for the current Q3.This means that the crowd of spreadsheet jockeys (Wall Street analysts), who have been underestimating NVIDIA's growth in hyper-scale accelerated computing, have spent the last two weeks punching new, much more bullish assumptions into their models that keep NVDA a Zacks #1 Rank.Here are where their consensus revenue projections stand now (9/6) on the Zacks Detailed Estimates page...FY'24 (ends January): $53 billion for 97% growthFY'25 (begins in Feb): $76 billion for 43% growthAnd there's profit optimism too...FY'24 EPS consensus just moved from $7.79 to $10.46FY'25 EPS consensus just moved from $10.77 to $15.48 (48% annual growth after the current year's 210%+ advance!)Based on these revenue and profit estimates for next year, NVDA trades at 30X EPS and only 16X sales. As I described in my June video and article, NVDA should continue to trade at a premium of 20X sales as it progresses to $100 billion in annual revenue...Story continuesNvidia DGX: Workhorse of AI Will Drive NVDA to $2 Trillion(end of excerpt from September 6 report)The Moonshot to $100 Billion in SalesIn that June video and article, I suggested that NVIDIA sales could climb to $100 billion annually by 2026. At the time, sales estimates for next year (FY'25 which ends in January of 2025) were just beginning to breach $50 billion after their May earnings and product announcements.Fast forward just over 3 months and here's where the consensus views have ascended to...FY'24 (ends January): $54.4 billion for 101.7% growthFY'25 (begins in Feb): $80 billion for 47% growthAt a $1.1 trillion market cap, NVDA now trades under 14X next year's sales.And the profit optimism persists too as the premier maker of GPUs commands top margins. Here's a look at the move higher in EPS estimates just in the past four weeks since my last public report (I update for members every week)...FY'24 EPS consensus just moved from $10.46 to $10.74FY'25 EPS consensus just moved from $15.48 to $16.32 (52% annual growth after the current year's 221.5%+ advance!)$100 Billion -- Sooner Than Even I ImaginedKeep in mind that these are consensus views. The high end estimate on next year's topline is $116 billion.Given the surge in demand for NVIDIA systems architecture like DGX Grace Hopper 200 supercomputers, even my optimistic expectations are getting run over quickly.To wit, last week KeyBanc analyst John Vinh put out a note where he explained why he was raising his price target from $670 to $750.After the firm's quarterly supply-chain channel checks, his top takeaway is that AI data center demand remained extremely strong, outstripping supply by about 20%.In his model, that computes to datacenter revenue of $45 billion for fiscal year 2024, up over 100%.Vinh reported that while China's demand remained weak, it didn't deteriorate significantly. More importantly, Vinh sees a new opportunity for Nvidia in the second half, driven by ""very strong"" demand for L40S, a GPU designed for datacenter workloads like generative AI and large language model inference and training.He estimates a revenue contribution of $2.25 billion to $3 billion from this next-gen GPU.I haven't talked much about the new L40S platform yet because we're still in a revenue phase driven by a mix shift from Ampere 100 chipsets to the higher ASP (average selling price) Grace Hopper 100 ""admirals.""A DGX system which holds eight GPUs, can command a price tag between $200,000 and $300,000 depending on configuration and availability (i.e., demand outstripping supply).But the L40S will be another game-changer for NVIDIA in datacenters because the workload capacities are hyper-industrial strength.Breaking down why Vinh sees NVIDIA DC doing $45 billion this year, he predicts that the Microsoft/Open AI alliance will procure 450,000 Nvidia GPUs this year, translating to $11 billion in revenue, and 1.6 million GPUs next year, contributing $40 billion in revenue.These estimates are based on ASPs for GPUs of about $25,000, which is really the low end in this demand-driven environment. The real market is closer to $40K each.And Apple is expected to purchase 200,000 H100 GPUs next year, representing $5 billion in revenue.""We believe NVDA has order and backlog visibility through 1H24 at this point and have not heard of any order cuts from its major CSP customers,"" Vinh said.To wit, KeyBanc expects Nvidia's data center revenue of $101 billion for fiscal year 2025, up 124%.CUDA the KrakenIn my September report, I reviewed the ""killer app"" that makes NVIDIA GPUs so special...For the past seven years since I first learned about what Jensen was creating from GPU gaming cards, I've said that the key to NVIDIA innovation dominating the world of hyperscale accelerated computing revolved around three factors...1) The capabilities of GPU stacks creating ""massively parallel architectures"" for harnessing big-data with modeling, automation, and simulation2) The CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) hardware + software stack that enables fast training and deployment of machine learning and deep learning models3) The evangelism of thousand of developers who get ingrained in the platform tools and never want to leave that ecosystemLong-time Apple evangelist Gene Munster recently said the same thing...""CUDA has created a moat around Nvidia's chip business. It would be difficult to get developers to switch to a different platform.""And that's why observers like me and Dan Ives of Wedbush think that this is the ""iPhone moment"" for NVIDIA and its AI tools.In conclusion, let's hear from the AI wizard himself, Jensen Huang...""The world has something along the lines of about a trillion dollars' worth of data centers installed in the cloud and enterprise. And that trillion dollars of data centers is in the process of transitioning into accelerated computing and generative AI.""I think this translates into NVIDIA hitting $100 billion per year in revenue much sooner than my 2026 projection in June. So don't miss your chance to buy NVDA under $450 again. I'm pretty sure you won't see it below $400 ever again.(end of excerpt from Sep 6)As I write this on Friday afternoon, NVDA shares are popping back above $450 after a trip down to $410 on September 21. And I also see a new article by the Wall Street Journal's Dan Gallagher in his Heard on the Street column titled ""How Nvidia Got Huge — and Almost Invincible.""Here's a quote that sums up the built-in invincibility of the developer moat...Over time, CUDA has grown to encompass 250 software libraries used by AI developers. That breadth effectively makes Nvidia the go-to platform for AI developers; Credit Suisse analysts said those libraries ""provide a starting point for AI projects that aren't available on non-NVDA systems, "" in a report earlier this year. During a speech at the Computex conference in May, Nvidia's Huang said CUDA was downloaded 25 million times over the last year, which was more than double the software's life-to-date downloads prior to that.Looks like I wasn't crazy optimistic enough calling for $100 billion in sales in 2025. Let's make that call $125 billion now.Bear of the Day:Illumina, the maker of million-dollar genome sequencing machines that revolutionized the fields of genetics and biotechnology, has fallen hard in the past year.And some analysts believe the pain is not over. Barclays just lowered their price target from $150 to $100 as top and bottom line estimates continue to drop.Illumina is on track for barely positive revenue growth this year and EPS projections in the past few months have dropped from $1.40 to $0.83, representing a 60% annual crash.While next year's profits are expected to surge back to EPS of $2.42, there is enough uncertainty still in those numbers -- as margins continue to contract -- to keep institutional investors fleeing the stock since its zenith above $500 two years ago.What's Been Driving the Plummet?As a former Illumina investor in the past year, I watched two elements unfold that created chaos for the company.The first was the bid to re-acquire GRAIL in 2020 after Illumina had spun-off the cancer test developer in 2016, but retained a 12% stake.Regulators in Europe and the U.S. stood in opposition to this move, but Illumina management charged ahead.The second chaos element was that grizzlie corporate raider Carl Icahn getting involved and trashing Illumina management at every turn.Icahn even accused them of spinning out and then reacquiring GRAIL in order to enrich Illumina's directors and executives.For a good timeline of all the drama, see this Reuters article from July which culminates in the EU imposing a $476 million antitrust penalty on the company...Rocky history of Illumina's Grail dealIcahn has certainly succeeded in several ways, including shaking up Illumina management and the board of directors. But he also helped clobber the stock price for himself and other investors. I hope he finds some value now.""Illumina has changed a lot in the last 10 years and is no longer a 20%+ revenue growth stretching-the-bounds-of-science company.""That quote is from Piper Sandler analyst David Westenberg and it captures what I missed when I thought buying Illumina last year near $200 was a good idea.Despite this dour realization, the analyst has maintained his optimism, and as recently as September 5 had an Overweight rating and $275 price target on the shares.In conclusion, here's what I told my Healthcare Innovators member in April when shares had climbed back to $230 and the ""biotech battle royale"" between Icahn and Illumina was getting hot...You might imagine where I stand. While I respect Icahn's prowess to dissect balance sheets, income statements, and management teams to extract more value, how much does his team really know about genomic sequencing and the opportunities ahead that are built on key relationships with research institutions and biotech-focused universities?I tend to favor the scientists here, but that's my bias.Either way, it will be a great battle at the epicenter of Biotech progress to watch.Additional content:Is GM a Steal at 3-Year Lows?Shares of General Motors hit a three-year low yesterday, dropping below $30 per share during intraday trading, before closing the session at $30.31. The decline can be attributed to the historic United Auto Workers (UAW) strike coupled with a looming airbag recall threatening to strain the automaker's finances further. With the stock at a three-year low, is it a tempting deal for value investors now? Or should you stay away from it considering the near-term hurdles?Ongoing Strike &amp; Recall Risk Dragging Down the StockThe UAW had initiated an unprecedented simultaneous strike against the Detroit 3 automakers — General Motors, Ford and Stellantis — on Sep 15. Since then, the shares of GM have contracted around 10%. While some Wall Street analysts argue that the UAW strike was already factored into GM's stock price, the reality on the trading floor tells a different tale. GM's stock has seen only five positive trading days in the last 14 sessions. Moreover, GM disclosed that the strike had already cost it $200 million in lost production during the third quarter, a figure that might escalate if a resolution isn't reached soon.In a bid to mitigate the strike's impact, GM presented its sixth counteroffer to the union yesterday. The automaker believes its offer would not only reward its team members but also ensure the company's success and sustainability in the long run. As negotiations continue round the clock, the stakes are high for both GM and its workforce.Additionally, Wall Street Journal's report stating that at least 20 million GM vehicles are fitted with potentially hazardous airbag inflators added to the woes of the U.S. auto giant. The government is recommending recall of the same to avoid fatalities and injuries, possibly leading General Motors to incur significant costs for replacements and repairs.The recall concerns about 52 million airbag inflators supplied by Tennessee-based auto supplier ARC Automotive. So far, GM has recalled approximately 1 million vehicles due to this issue. However, the company contested the NHTSA's findings, stating that the current evidence and data do not necessitate any further recalls beyond what has already been done. Despite this defense, the shadow of a larger recall looms, threatening to impose significant financial and reputational costs on GM.3-Year Low Price Point is a Golden Buying OpportunityWhile these near-term concerns are triggering a sell-off, GM is still one of the top auto stocks to buy now for the long haul on the back of promising fundamentals. Especially, the company's electrification push is likely to be a key growth driver in the coming years.General Motors plans to roll out 30 fresh EV models by 2025-end. This year, it will have nine EV models in the North America market. Solid demand for GMC Hummer EV, Chevrolet Bolt EV and EUV, Cadillac crossover EV, Equinox EV, Silverdo EV, Sierra EV, Blazer EV and BrightDrop Zevo 600 is expected to buoy top-line growth. The firm's modular battery platform, the Ultium Drive system, is aiding the transition to an all-electric portfolio. GM's battery plants in Ohio, Tennessee and Lansing are likely to scale up its e-mobility prowess.Additionally, General Motors has enough cash on the balance sheet to weather short-term headwinds and navigate economic cycles. The firm had total automotive liquidity of $38.9 billion as of Jun 30, 2023, including $16 billion of cash/cash equivalents. Recently, GM has secured a new $6 billion line of credit extending through October 2024. This move is seen as a strategic step to ensure financial stability amid the uncertainty surrounding the strike's resolution.General Motors stock does make a strong case for being undervalued at just 0.24X forward sales currently. This not only looks attractive when compared with the industry's 1.85X, but it also compares favorably with its closest peers — Ford's 0.30X and STLA's 0.31X. At 4.17X forward earnings currently, GM is trading below its five-year high of 12.68X as well as the median of 6.19X. For those seeking discounted GM shares, now is the time to buy.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GM's sales implies a year-over-year increase of 9.2% to around $171.2 billion in 2023 and edge up another 2.3% next year to $175.19 billion.General Motors currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a Value Score of A.

SO subsidiary, Georgia Power, announced a $413-million resolution with Oglethorpe Power Corporation, a wholesale electricity provider. The resolution is set to settle a dispute over the Vogtle nuclear power plant project, which is currently under construction in Georgia.Let’s delve into the details of the dispute, shedding light on the financial aspects and implications for both parties involved.The Genesis of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4First, it's important to understand the background of Plant Vogtle and the expansion project. Plant Vogtle, located in Burke County, GA, is home to two operational nuclear power units, Vogtle 1 and 2. These units have been serving as reliable sources of electricity for decades.The expansion project, known as Vogtle Units 3 and 4, aims to add two more nuclear reactors to the existing facility. The expansion was initiated to meet the growing energy demands of Georgia and contribute to clean energy production. Southern subsidiary, Georgia Power, one of the primary stakeholders in this venture, embarked on this ambitious project in partnership with Oglethorpe Power.The Legal DisputeThe Monetary Settlement: The crux of the legal dispute revolves around a cost-sharing agreement between Georgia Power and Oglethorpe Power regarding the construction of Vogtle Units 3 and 4. According to a disclosed 8-K filing, Georgia Power has agreed to pay at least $413 million to resolve this contentious issue.Of this amount, $308 million will be disbursed by Georgia Power to cover a portion of the construction costs for the two Vogtle units. Additionally, Georgia Power has committed to covering part of the future construction costs, estimated at approximately $105 million based on the current project’s capital cost estimation. Notably, the utility company has agreed to bear two-thirds of any cost incurred above the current forecast.Financial Implications: The financial ramifications of this settlement are substantial. Georgia Power anticipates recording a $114-million after-tax charge for third-quarter 2023 in connection with the settlement and the current project’s capital cost estimation. This charge reflects the company's commitment to resolve the dispute and move forward with the construction of Vogtle Units 3 and 4.Story continuesTechnical Hurdles: In addition to the financial aspects, SO also reported a technical challenge at Plant Vogtle. Specifically, Georgia Power identified a motor fault in one of the four reactor coolant pumps at Plant Vogtle Unit 4. In response, the utility company initiated the process of replacing the faulty pump with an on-site spare.This technical setback is expected to impact the timeline for the unit's in-service date, pushing it into the first quarter of 2024.The Road AheadAs Georgia Power and Oglethorpe Power work to resolve their legal dispute, the focus remains on completing the construction of Vogtle Units 3 and 4. These additional nuclear reactors are vital for meeting the energy needs of Georgia and advancing the state's commitment to clean energy production.In conclusion, the legal dispute between Georgia Power and Oglethorpe Power regarding the cost-sharing agreement for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 has been resolved with a significant financial commitment from the former. This resolution allows the project to move forward, albeit with a technical hurdle that may delay the in-service date of Unit 4.The future of Plant Vogtle represents not only a substantial investment in clean energy but also a testament to the complexities and challenges faced in the construction of nuclear power facilities.Zacks Rank and Other Key PicksSO is an American utility firm that provides electricity to customers across Southern United States.

169,6454390a-4cc0-392e-8f6e-c076b6df7a9c,SWKS,2023-10-10,"With 84% ownership of the shares, Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) is heavily dominated by institutional owners",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/84-ownership-shares-skyworks-solutions-150434863.html,1696863874,STORY,['SWKS'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Skyworks Solutions' stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisionsA total of 19 investors have a majority stake in the company with 50% ownership Recent sales by insiders Every investor in Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 84% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Skyworks Solutions, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Skyworks Solutions ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Skyworks Solutions?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Skyworks Solutions. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Skyworks Solutions, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Skyworks Solutions. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 12% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.4% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.8% of the company stock.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 19 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Skyworks SolutionsThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that Skyworks Solutions, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$51m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 15% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Skyworks Solutions. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Skyworks Solutions .But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

NOC recently secured a modification contract worth $235 million involving Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR) Polar Space Vehicles 1 and 2. The work related to the deal will be carried out at Redondo Beach, CA.The contract, which is expected to be completed by Jul 25, 2026, has been awarded by the Space Systems Command, Los Angeles Air Force Base, CA. The latest modification brings the cumulative value of the contract to $2.15 billion.Importance of OPIRNorthrop Grumman’s Next-Generation OPIR polar-orbiting satellite, known as NextGen Polar (NGP), plays a key role in providing strategic missile warning for the nation’s defense. The NGP has the capability to cover the most difficult region to monitor from space – the northern polar region.The NGP, equipped with advanced modeling and simulation, will provide excellent coverage of the entire northern hemisphere. The enhanced communication system allows customers to transmit wide-band OPIR data to the ground.What’s Ahead?As nations continue to strengthen their defense structure, defense spending on military satellite systems increases manifold, backed by demand for technologically advanced orbital assets strategically designed for missile interception and recognition.According to a report by the Research and Markets firm, the global military satellites market is expected to witness a CAGR of 4.2% during the 2023-2027 period. This should benefit NOC, which enjoys an extensive satellite portfolio containing Evolved Strategic SATCOM, Protected Tactical SATCOM, and a few more.The company’s latest achievement in this area includes the August 2023 contract by the Space Development Agency to design and build 36 data transport satellites, the first space vehicles in the latest generation of its low-Earth orbit Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture. In the same month, NOC successfully delivered two major components of the Arctic Satellite Broadband Mission and started the next phase of pre-launch preparations. Such developments and contract wins involving military communication systems, including the latest one, should boost its revenue generation prospects in the coming months.Story continuesPeer ProspectsConsidering the solid growth opportunities offered by the global military satellite market, other defense primes like Lockheed Martin LMT, Airbus SE EADSY, L3Harris Technologies Inc. LHX, with a strong presence in this space, should also benefit.Lockheed Martin uses cutting-edge technologies to build capabilities that comprise layered space defense systems. The LM 400, a multi-mission satellite that can be tailored for almost any mission, is LMT’s most flexible satellite bus with capabilities that can serve military, civil or commercial users. In September 2023, LMT deployed 10 satellites into low-Earth orbit in support of the SDA’s Tranche 0 Transport Layer mission.LMT boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Lockheed’s 2023 sales indicates an improvement of 1% from that reported in 2022.Airbus is a world leader in military satellite communication services with a very broad portfolio of services, including the SATCOMBw, Syracuse 4A and 4B, Skynet 5 and many more. Airbus has been a long-term operator of the SATCOMBw secure satellite communications system for Germany’s Armed Forces.EADSY boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 12.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Airbus’ 2023 sales indicates an improvement of 17.8% from that reported in 2022.L3Harris is the prime contractor of Navigation Technology Satellite – 3 (NTS-3). The NTS-3, to be launched later this year, will provide for the safety and success of the warfighters with its accurate and uninterrupted positioning, navigation and timing technology. In September 2023, it successfully demonstrated the U.S. Department of Defense’s new anti-jam Satellite Communications waveform at the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command’s Northern Edge 2023 Exercise.LHX boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for L3Harris’ 2023 sales indicates an improvement of 9.9% from the year-ago reported number.Price PerformanceIn the past six months, shares of NOC have gained 0.7% against the industry’s 17.6% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankNorthrop Grumman currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The Dow grew by 197 points on the day, +0.59%, the S&amp;P 500 was +0.63%, the Nasdaq +52 points, +0.39%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 +0.60%. This is also the third day in the last four where we’ve seen market indices closer higher.Two Fed officials — Governor Philip Jefferson and Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan — both made appearances today, and both commented that high bond yields, on the 10-year especially, are helping the Fed do its job of bringing down inflation. Though the bond market was closed today for a bank holiday, the 10-year at roughly 4.8% and the 2-year around 5.1% represent historically high yields which we’ve seen over the past month or so cool markets. Neither official said another 25 basis-point (bps) rate hike at its November meeting was off the table, but neither appeared to be in a hurry to crank rates up further.This caused the change of mood among market participants all by itself, though there are other developments that, while dire and tragic on the ground, look to be giving a boost to certain areas of the market. Oil prices, for instance, are up, along with defense stocks like Northrop Grumman NOC, which gained a lofty +11.5% on the day. WTI crude reached $86 per barrel, +4.2%, while gold reached its highest level in a month.The attacks on Israel by Palestinian group Hamas is the center of global news today. Neither is an oil producer of any note, though the apparent proxies in this turmoil — Iran and Saudi Arabia — very much are. Also, the business of war — such as war ships, planes and munitions — are all very energy intensive. We had seen oil prices on the wane in all but a few key areas of the U.S., like California, but depending on these countries’ involvement in the crisis over time, we may see destabilization of energy prices in the Middle East.The U.S. already gives more than $3 billion annually to Israel in military aid, and a “complete siege” has already been ordered by Israeli forces on the Gaza Strip, which is now 140 miles of land on the greater Mediterranean containing more than 2.3 million people. Though the fear is this conflict may expand to the other larger countries, there’s nothing imminent at this stage. Defense companies have been bought up today, but we’ll see if this is a lasting development. We also do not have a U.S. House of Representatives currently in operation, so the level of additional military and/or financial assistance cannot be currently determined.Questions or comments about this article and/or author?

Nike would not comment on whether the jersey sold out, or how many it sold, but the shirts do not currently appear for sale on its website or through the England Football Association’s website.In a statement to Reuters, the company said that ""more will be for sale later this season.""Earps was one of the standout stars of the Women's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand this year, earning FIFA's Golden Glove award. She was voted England Women's Player of the Yearlast month.Nike previously faced backlash from fans and from Earps herself after replicas of the goalkeeper’s jersey were not made available during the competition, which ended on August 20 with a Spain victory against England.More than 170,000 people signed a Change.org petition calling on Nike to sell jerseys for Earps and other women goalkeepers.The England men's goalkeeper jersey is available to buy on Nike’s website.Nike announced on August 24 that it would make its women's teams goalkeeper kits available for fans, telling Reuters it had “secured limited quantities of goalkeeper jerseys for England, U.S., France and the Netherlands to be sold through the Federation websites over the coming days.”The company did not comment on why it chose to release Earps' jersey in October.Nike produced 13 of the 32 team jerseys for the Women's World Cup. Its England kits became an added source of revenue after the U.S. team, which it has sponsored since 1995, suffered their earliest exit ever in the tournament, creating a major loss in earnings potential.Sports sponsorship is a major sales driver for apparel manufacturers. Last month, Nike executives told investors the company beat sell-through plans and saw double-digit growth across its global football category in the quarter ended Aug 31, which included this year's 2023 tournament.

If they fail, they miss out on the chance to buy the shoes.“This is to ensure that the shoes are being purchased by golfers rather than resellers,” the press release says.The customers will attempt to win the sneakers at Pitch Soho, part of a chain of indoor golf clubs that lets patrons drive a ball into a screen to simulate a real shot. The golfers angling for the sneakers will be placed in a simulation of the Ryder Cup.Shoes for golfersWhile it's an unconventional way to sell sneakers, Chris Collick, head of content and marketing at Trendygolf, told Fortune it’s the only way to stop them from falling into the hands of customers with ulterior motives.Last year, Collick says, Trendygolf sold out its batch of Air Jordan 1 Low G Golf Shoes in two minutes. However, he was later flooded with complaints from customers who claimed the shoes had been picked up by bots operated by resellers.Collick said last year’s Nike Jordan 1s were selling for up to three times those sold by Trendygolf. On StockX, a sneaker auction site, the new Travis Scott sneaker is listed at £950 (around $1,160), nearly 10 times what the retailer is selling its batch for.Story continues“The biggest thing for us and the biggest thing for Nike releasing this shoe is we wanted it to go the hands of golfers who were going to wear them on the course, and wear them proudly being a golf shoe,” Collick said.“It eliminates the fact that it’s going to a reseller. We know it will at least go to a golfer who can play.”The 100 best drivers on the PGA tour can throttle a ball more than 300 yards on average, according to data compiled by CBS. While there’s limited official data on the average driving distance of an amateur, analysis by golf technology group Shot Scope suggests most can drive a ball at least 200 yards.Chris is confident that his golfing customers will comfortably manage to hit a ball 150 or 200 yards.“I’ve just had heart surgery four weeks ago and I could still probably hit the ball 200 yards in recovery,” he said. Still, Collick joked that resellers might still be panic-booking golf lessons in advance of Friday’s launch.The second half of Trandygolf’s allocation of sneakers will be sold in a normal online raffle.However, Collick thinks the idea of crafting a bespoke customer base through some form of test is one that could catch on. He suggested skaters could prove they can do a kickflip in order to buy a pair of limited Nike Dunks.$30 billion marketThe shoe resale market has exploded in recent years, driven largely by a combination of hype and scarcity. Cowen Group, an investment management company, predicts that the global sneaker resale market will swell from $6 billion in 2020 to $30 billion by 2030.Sneakers are sold secondhand on websites like StockX, GOAT, and eBay for hundreds of dollars over their price on the primary market.Resellers will either buy in bulk and operate at lower margins, or try going for more exclusive individual launches that can sell at markups into the thousands.Sneaker companies have leaned in to this trend with their own exclusive launches, one of which is the Nike and Travis Scott collaboration being sold by Trendygolf.Because they’re highly speculative, there’s no hard and fast rule to pricing sneakers. Kobia Redd, a shoe reseller from Boston, told NBC News he sets the prices of his shoes based on hype, and compared the assets to stocks.He told NBC a pair of Yeezys originally costing $200 were going on resale markets for $5,000.Last year, Nike said it would begin clamping down on resellers using artificial technology to jump the line and buy sneakers with the intention of making a profit. The seller said it could cancel online orders found to be made using special software.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com]"

For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: A crucial inflation print and the start of third quarter earnings is on investors' minds this week. Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer here to break down the busy week ahead. Josh, what's happening?JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, Brad, we really do have a busy week here when you take a look at both economic data and the start of third quarter earnings season. I want to start first with that economic data, though. We can take a look at that calendar. You're gonna see some key data points coming out of last week's jobs report. Remember that jobs report came in a little bit hotter than expected.So then when you take a look at the report this week, the key thing I'm watching is that inflation print on Thursday because of a lot of economists we've spoken with over the last couple of days, that sort of understanding what Friday's hot jobs report meant means there is the potential for the soft landing still, right? When we talk about the economy doing well, job growth happening. But is that balanced with inflation continuing to come down?Story continuesIf you have inflation continuing to come down, we saw wages decrease in that Friday jobs report. The economy could still be in a very good position here. Now, of course, the downside to that and the potential risk for another Fed rate hike would be if we see inflation increase on Thursday or even just remain flat, we're expecting those prices to come down on a monthly basis, just slightly.So we're looking for a little bit of a decrease in inflation on Thursday, then we'll get consumer sentiment on Friday. And of course, always I shouldn't have skipped over it on Wednesday, the FOMC meeting minutes, always something interesting to watch. I'm sure there'll be a tidbit on Wednesday there that we're talking about.SEANA SMITH: And Josh, when we talk about everything that's on the radar right now, you mentioned it briefly off the top. But earnings clearly going to be a focus here. We're starting to hear from some of the larger banks. At the end of the week, what are you gonna be keeping a close eye on?JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, Seana. So Friday is sort of the kickoff of third quarter earnings season in earnest, if you will, with all of those financial companies you're gonna see reporting there, all those banks. You've got JP Morgan, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, PNC, BlackRock.And really what we're wondering there, what we always wonder from these banks, is what are they saying about the overall health of the US economy and the consumer? And then also, how are they dealing with these higher-for-longer interest rates, right? How is that impacting what is going on within the financial system? Because that will tell us what will happen with the rest of the companies and some of the companies that were just on your screen moving forward.But on Tuesday, I'm really interested to hear what we hear from Pepsi this week because Pepsi is one of the companies that has been listed recently by various different Wall Street research firms as a company that could see downside risk from Ozempic and different prescription weight loss drugs.If you take a look at Pepsi shares over the last five days, they're off about 5%. They're off nearly 10% in the last month. Coca-Cola shares have also been down. So I'm wondering if Pepsi earnings is gonna be the start of us hearing about Ozempic for third quarter earnings.It's been a big story on the street thus far. And I'm curious if one of these analysts is going to start asking executives about it and we hear a little bit more about what prescription weight loss drugs means for the food sector moving forward.BRAD SMITH: All right, Josh, a lot to keep tabs on there. Thanks for kicking off the week with a view at what we should be keeping our eye on. Thanks so much.]"

The company’s quarterly revenues are expected to have improved year over year, while earnings are projected to have declined.In the last reported quarter, WFC’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on higher net interest income (NII) and non-interest income. The improvement in capital and profitability ratios was another positive. However, higher provisions for credit losses and a rise in expenses were the undermining factors.Over the trailing four quarters, Wells Fargo’s earnings surpassed the consensus estimate on all four occasions, the average surprise being 10.3%.Wells Fargo &amp; Company Price and EPS Surprise Wells Fargo &amp; Company Price and EPS SurpriseWells Fargo &amp; Company price-eps-surprise | Wells Fargo &amp; Company QuoteKey Developments During the QuarterIn Late September, Wells Fargodivested around $2 billion of private equity investments in Norwest Equity Partners and Norwest Mezzanine Partners to a buyer group, including AlpInvest Partners, Atalaya Capital Management, Lexington Partners and Pantheon. The divestiture of these private equity funds enabled the company to explore avenues for growth and profitability by freeing up resources for strategic reallocation.Let’s take a look at factors that are expected to have influenced Wells Fargo’s third-quarter earnings.Loans and NII: Banks’ lending activities are likely to have been muted in the third quarter due to the challenging macroeconomic backdrop and high interest rates. While demand for commercial and industrial loans improved in July and August, it remained muted, per the Fed’s latest data. Moreover, commercial real estate loans declined in July and August from the second-quarter end. Nonetheless, consumer loans were stable in August from the second-quarter 2023 end.In July 2023, the Fed raised interest rates by 25 basis points to a target of 5.25-5.5%, marking the 11th time the FOMC has raised interest rates in a tightening process that began in March 2022. The interest rate was the highest in around 22 years.Story continuesDriven by interest rate hikes, Wells Fargo is expected to have witnessed an improvement in earning asset yields in the quarter to be reported. Also, lower mortgage-backed securities premium amortization is expected to have aided NII.However, an inverted yield curve, deposit migrations and higher funding costs are expected to weigh on NII and margins.Amid these considerations, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for WFC’s NII is pegged at $12.73 billion, indicating a 5.3% rise from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.Non-Interest Revenues: The company is likely to have seen lower deposit-related fees due to an expected decline in deposits. The consensus mark for the same is pegged at $1.18 billion, implying a year-over-year decrease of 7.8%.In the third quarter, mortgage rates continued to increase, with the rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage reaching 7.31% in September, the highest level in nearly 23 years. The climb in mortgage rates, which kept home buyers on the sidelines, led to a smaller origination market, both purchase and refinancing, compared with the prior-year quarter.Hence, being one of the preeminent bank mortgage lenders in the United States, WFC is likely to have continued seeing declines in its home lending portfolio and mortgage banking income in third-quarter 2023. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for WFC’s third-quarter 2023 mortgage banking revenues is pegged at $221 million, implying a 31.8% fall on a year-over-year basis.Wells Fargo’s investment advisory and other asset-based fee revenues are likely to have borne the brunt of weak equity and fixed-income market performance. A dip in market valuations and lower transactional activities are expected to have been headwinds. The consensus mark for investment advisory and other asset-based fee revenues is pegged at $2.23 billion, implying a year-over-year rise of 5.8%.Merger and acquisition activities continued to be depressed in the third quarter, with total deal value declining from the prior year. High interest rates, increased antitrust scrutiny, fears of a global recession and looming U.S. federal government shutdown are likely to have acted as headwinds for merger and acquisition deals.While there was a pick up in activity in September, equity capital market fees and debt capital market fees are expected to have declined in the third quarter, given low IPOs and follow-up equity issuances, as well as bond issuance. This is expected to have affected WFC’s investment banking fees. Nonetheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $386 million, suggesting a 2.9% rise from the prior-year quarter’s reported number.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Wells Fargo’s total non-interest income is pegged at $7.38 billion, suggesting a marginal decline from the prior-year quarter’s reported number.Expenses: Wells Fargo’s costs are expected to have continued to flare up in the third quarter, given its franchise investments in technology and digitalization efforts. Additionally, amid the rising inflation, salary expenses are anticipated to have led to elevated non-interest expenses. This is likely to have hindered bottom-line growth in the quarter under review.Asset Quality: With expectations of a worsening macroeconomic outlook, growing recession risk, slower GDP growth and the potential for deteriorating employment conditions, Wells Fargo’s credit quality is likely to have deteriorated. Moreover, given the heightened market volatility, commercial loan defaults are expected to have risen. Hence, as WFC has substantial exposure to commercial loans, it is likely to have set aside reserves in the third quarter.The consensus mark for total non-accrual loans is pegged at $7.41 billion, implying a year-over-year rise of 32.6%.What Our Model PredictsAccording to our quantitative model, the chances of WFC beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings this time are high. This is because it has the combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: The Earnings ESP for Wells Fargo is +3.83%.Zacks Rank: WFC currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings has been unrevised in the past month to $1.24 per share. Also, it suggests a year-over-year decline of 4.6%.The consensus estimate for quarterly revenues of $20.20 billion indicates a 3.5% increase from the prior-year quarter’s reported number.Other Banks That Warrant a LookThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. PNC and M&amp;T Bank Corporation MTB are a couple of bank stocks that you may want to consider, as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases, per our model.The Earnings ESP for PNC is +1.60% and the company carries a Zacks Rank #3 at present.

The stock lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 0.63%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.59%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.39%.Heading into today, shares of the drugmaker had lost 3.27% over the past month, lagging the Medical sector's loss of 1.62% and outpacing the S&amp;P 500's loss of 3.39% in that time.Investors will be eagerly watching for the performance of Pfizer in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings report is set to be unveiled on October 31, 2023. It is anticipated that the company will report an EPS of $0.59, marking a 66.85% fall compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $14.52 billion, down 35.87% from the prior-year quarter.Regarding the entire year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates forecast earnings of $3.33 per share and revenue of $66.32 billion, indicating changes of -49.39% and -33.9%, respectively, compared to the previous year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Pfizer should also be noted by investors. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has witnessed a 0.09% increase. As of now, Pfizer holds a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Story continuesValuation is also important, so investors should note that Pfizer has a Forward P/E ratio of 9.95 right now. This expresses a discount compared to the average Forward P/E of 13.98 of its industry.It's also important to note that PFE currently trades at a PEG ratio of 1.11. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. The Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1.7 as of yesterday's close.The Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry is part of the Medical sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 217, placing it within the bottom 14% of over 250 industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

(PFE): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-pfizer-inc-130012146.html,1696856412,STORY,['PFE'],"[Pfizer (PFE) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this drugmaker have returned -3.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3.4% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, to which Pfizer belongs, has lost 0.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Pfizer is expected to post earnings of $0.59 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -66.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +5.3%.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.33 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -49.4%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.22 indicates a change of -3.2% from what Pfizer is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.3%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Pfizer.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Pfizer, the consensus sales estimate of $14.52 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -35.9%. The $66.32 billion and $65.95 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -33.9% and -0.6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPfizer reported revenues of $12.73 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -54.1%. EPS of $0.67 for the same period compares with $2.04 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.03%. The EPS surprise was +19.64%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Pfizer is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Pfizer. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The stock's change was less than the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 0.63%. On the other hand, the Dow registered a gain of 0.59%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq increased by 0.39%.Heading into today, shares of the technology and consulting company had lost 3.83% over the past month, lagging the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 2.3% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 3.39% in that time.The upcoming earnings release of IBM will be of great interest to investors. On that day, IBM is projected to report earnings of $2.13 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 17.68%. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $14.82 billion, showing a 5.02% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.For the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $9.43 per share and a revenue of $61.49 billion, signifying shifts of +3.29% and +1.58%, respectively, from the last year.Investors should also pay attention to any latest changes in analyst estimates for IBM. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the company's business performance and profit potential.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection remained stagnant. IBM is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Story continuesDigging into valuation, IBM currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 15.06. This signifies a discount in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 16.08 for its industry.We can also see that IBM currently has a PEG ratio of 3.61. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory. By the end of yesterday's trading, the Computer - Integrated Systems industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.98.The Computer - Integrated Systems industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 173, which puts it in the bottom 32% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank assesses the vigor of our specific industry groups by computing the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks incorporated in the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.Don't forget to use Zacks.com to keep track of all these stock-moving metrics, and others, in the upcoming trading sessions.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

193,168a43ec-142a-3349-ad3a-caedf39fa974,IBM,2023-10-10,Can AI fix Wall Street’s ‘spaghetti code’ crisis? Microsoft and IBM are betting that it can,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-fix-wall-street-spaghetti-183001627.html,1696876201,STORY,"['MSFT', 'IBM']","[There aren’t a lot of businesses built around tape cassettes or floppy disks, so a lack of experts who can repair those decades-old technologies is rarely a problem. That’s not the case with Cobol—a 64-year-old programming language that Wall Street and the federal government rely on to process tens of trillions of dollars worth of transactions annually. As Cobol gets older, those massive organizations have been hard-pressed to find people who can update their ancient systems.When something does go wrong, many firms turn to 82-year-old Bill Hinshaw, the “Cobol Cowboy.” Hinshaw works out of his home office in northern Texas, where he oversees a remote team of some 600 aging Cobol engineers—some of whom cut their teeth as programmers in the ’60s and ’70s. Every week, the cowboys respond to emergency calls—including one in 2021 from Superior Welding Supply, a 93-year-old Iowa firm whose only in-house Cobol expert died just before the company’s software crashed.Firms of all sorts are wrestling with how to maintain old code, typically Cobol, that still runs but that is often poorly documented and hard to modify—part of a sprawling problem that programmers call “spaghetti code.” For years, government agencies, the media, and large banks have sounded the alarm over their aging technical infrastructure. Now tech giants like IBM and Microsoft think they may have found a powerful tool to wean us off Eisenhower-era tech: generative AI.“Spaghetti code”Cobol is out of sight and mind when we transfer money from savings to checking, but it is critical for banks’ day-to-day operations. These also include adding customers to a database, enabling ATM transactions, and payroll processing. It’s even pervasive throughout the federal government, which has used the same system since 1973—built with approximately 1 million lines of Cobol code—to process student aid applications.There are somewhere between 220 billion and 800 billion lines of Cobol still in use today, according to OpenText, an IT company. “The vast majority of major banks, when you get down to the actual core banking systems, you get down to Cobol,” said Michael Abbott, the global banking lead at Accenture.Story continuesAfter programmers designed it in 1959, Cobol quickly became the de facto language for data processing, which meant that banks, insurers, government agencies, and any other company dealing with terabytes of information wrote and maintained millions of lines of Cobol code.Legacy Cobol, however, lacks the efficiency and versatility of upstarts like C, Java, and Python that emerged in the ’70s and later. These languages were built differently and allowed engineers to better structure and reuse previously written code. Eventually, startups and Silicon Valley ventures began building with Java or Python rather than Cobol.Generative AI could help wean corporate America off Eisenhower-era tech.As Cobol has fallen out of favor, maintenance costs have soared. Moreover, since legacy Cobol code is often poorly documented, repairs and upgrades take longer. A major overhaul may not be viable in a fast-paced economic environment, where interest rate changes, for example, force banks to rapidly update the products they offer customers.“It might take them nine to 12 months to launch by the time they untangled the spaghetti and updated the product inside of it,” Abbott said. “With a modern architecture, that can be done in weeks.”The costs of an upgrade, meanwhile, can run into the hundreds of millions. When Commonwealth Bank of Australia finished replacing its core banking system in 2017, the process had taken five years and cost almost $750 million. And, if done poorly, upgrades can result in catastrophe. In 2022, a U.K. financial regulator fined TSB, a British bank, more than $60 million for a failed migration to a new IT platform after thousands of customers were unable to make online payments for weeks.Code assistantsRuchir Puri, chief scientist at IBM Research, jumped up to a whiteboard on a recent afternoon at the company’s leafy campus north of New York City. With two markers, the mustachioed executive, wearing a ball cap and white dress shirt, sketched out how financial institutions can use watsonx Code Assistant to translate millions of lines of code from Cobol to Java.Yes, he said, code transpilers, or translators, have existed for decades, but these older systems translate spaghetti Cobol into spaghetti Java. In other words, a poorly documented and hard-to-understand legacy language becomes a poorly documented and hard-to-understand modern language.IBM’s solution, he said, goes beyond existing transpilers. Through generative AI, or the same technology that powers OpenAI’s ChatGPT, IBM can turn poorly documented Cobol into structured, easy-to-parse Java. Puri said IBM’s tools can increase the speed at which companies modernize their code bases by a factor of up to 10.And this could save Wall Street—and the government—billions. In February 2018, for example, the Air Force finished modernizing computing systems responsible for the management of supplies and equipment for war-fighting missions. The three-year process, which included translating millions of lines of Cobol into Java, saved the government $25 million in annual computing costs, according to a 2019 report. Imagine, then, how much taxpayers could have saved if generative AI cut the three years needed to modernize the Air Force’s systems into months.Unsurprisingly, this has translated into a major business opportunity for IBM. Puri said big companies are clamoring to use its Cobol-to-Java translation software. “The majority of Fortune 100 companies are our clients, and all of them, every one of them, is engaged at this point,” he noted.For Thomas Dohmke, the CEO of GitHub, the Microsoft-owned software platform for developers, Cobol is also top of mind. “Cobol still running on mainframes is a much bigger societal problem than we think,” he recently posted on X. He said he’s heard more about Cobol in the past year than he has in the past 30 years.And just like with IBM, customers are reaching out to GitHub to see how its generative AI–powered assistant, GitHub Copilot, can help modernize their legacy infrastructure.Powered by the same algorithms that drive ChatGPT, Copilot functions like auto-complete for email. As programmers type—the model is trained on all programming languages that appear in public GitHub projects—Copilot suggests line edits. Dohmke added that programmers can also use the tool to highlight swaths of Cobol code and ask Copilot to explain what that code actually does. And just like IBM’s own coding assistant, Copilot can translate swaths of Cobol into Java or any other programming language.“Generative AI and Copilot will make our lives easier in maintaining those old code bases,” he said, “and ultimately modernizing them.”Riding into the sunsetThe hype of AI has reached such a crescendo that even Hinshaw, the Cobol cowboy, is advising a startup on its own AI and Cobol product. Hinshaw, whose leather hat hangs on his office door in Texas, is not afraid, though, that AI will force him to ride off into the proverbial sunset. “At three o’clock in the morning you may get a call saying this program fails,” he said. “How do you get AI involved in that, so you can have it up and running in that hour?”The executives at IBM and GitHub also took pains to say humans should be involved in the process of code translation and modernization every step of the way. And both concede that AI-generated code isn’t perfect, and should therefore, just like human-generated code, go through a battery of tests. Stanford researchers found, for example, that developers who used OpenAI’s coding assistant often wrote less secure code than those who didn’t.But despite the risks, those enmeshed in the financial industry, likeAbbott from Accenture, hope that products like IBM’s or GitHub’s can untangle the spaghetti code that so often bogs down big banks. “I will tell you,” he said of generative AI, “I think it holds enormous promise.”Tech’s aging building blocksMany businesses and the federal government still run quite well on these 20th-century coding languages.1957 | FortranJohn Backus leads a team at IBM to create Formula Translation, or Fortran, one of the first programming languages to incorporate natural language (e.g., “if,” “read,” “write”) into its syntax.1959 | CobolA group of computer scientists, including famed programmer Grace Hopper, prompts the development of Common Business-Oriented Language, or Cobol, which becomes the de facto language for data processing.1972–73 | CAt Bell Labs, Dennis Ritchie develops C,which still consistently ranks among the five most popular programming languages.1983 | AdaFrench programmer Jean David Ichbiah and his team devise Ada, which briefly becomes the Department of Defense’s programming language of choice in the ’90s.1987 | PerlAmerican programmer and linguist Larry Wall releases Perl, which sees a mini-boom in the early 2000s before Python supplants it.This article appears in the October/November 2023 issue of Fortune with the headline, ""Can AI fix Wall Street’s ‘spaghetti code’ crisis?""This story was originally featured on Fortune.com]"

Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.Considering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with both ""A"" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.Marathon Petroleum (MPC) is a stock many investors are watching right now. MPC is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as an A grade for Value.Another valuation metric that we should highlight is MPC's P/B ratio of 1.80. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks solid versus its industry's average P/B of 1.95. Over the past year, MPC's P/B has been as high as 1.98 and as low as 1.36, with a median of 1.67.Finally, investors will want to recognize that MPC has a P/CF ratio of 3.73. This metric focuses on a firm's operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook. MPC's P/CF compares to its industry's average P/CF of 4.74. Over the past year, MPC's P/CF has been as high as 4.10 and as low as 2.39, with a median of 3.38.If you're looking for another solid Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing value stock, take a look at PBF Energy (PBF).

Active investors aim to buy stocks that vastly outperform the market - but in the process, they risk under-performance. Investors in The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) have tasted that bitter downside in the last year, as the share price dropped 50%. That's disappointing when you consider the market returned 18%. Even if you look out three years, the returns are still disappointing, with the share price down36% in that time. Shareholders have had an even rougher run lately, with the share price down 42% in the last 90 days.If the past week is anything to go by, investor sentiment for AES isn't positive, so let's see if there's a mismatch between fundamentals and the share price. See our latest analysis for AES In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Unhappily, AES had to report a 4.6% decline in EPS over the last year. Readers should not this outcome was influenced by the impact of extraordinary items on EPS. In fact, it actually made a loss over the last twelve months. The share price decline of 50% is actually more than the EPS drop. Unsurprisingly, given the lack of EPS growth, the market seems to be more cautious about the stock.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on AES' earnings, revenue and cash flow.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveInvestors in AES had a tough year, with a total loss of 49% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 18%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 0.5% per year over five years. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should ""buy when there is blood on the streets"", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

However, it has recently witnessed a daily loss of 0.24%, juxtaposed with a three-month change of -40.46%. Fresh insights from the GF Score hint at potential headwinds.

AES 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of AESUnraveling The AES Corp (AES)'s Potential Underperformance: A Deep Dive into Key MetricsWhat Is the GF Score?The GF Score is a stock performance ranking system developed by GuruFocus using five aspects of valuation, which has been found to be closely correlated to the long-term performances of stocks by backtesting from 2006 to 2021. The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores. The GF Score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 as the highest rank.Financial strength rank: 3/10Profitability rank: 6/10Growth rank: 4/10GF Value rank: 8/10Momentum rank: 2/10Based on the above method, GuruFocus assigned The AES Corp the GF Score of 66 out of 100, which signals poor future outperformance potential.Understanding The AES Corp BusinessThe AES Corp, with a market cap of $8.32 billion and sales of $12.95 billion, operates in the global power industry. As of year-end 2022, its generation portfolio consists of over 32 gigawatts of generation including renewable energy (46%), gas (32%), coal (20%), and oil (2%). The company owns and operates six electric utilities, distributing power to 2.6 million customers. With an operating margin of 17.97%, the company's financial performance is a key area of interest for investors.Story continuesUnraveling The AES Corp (AES)'s Potential Underperformance: A Deep Dive into Key MetricsFinancial Strength BreakdownThe AES Corp's financial strength indicators present some concerning insights about the company's balance sheet health. The company has an interest coverage ratio of 1.91, which positions it worse than 79.49% of 429 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. This ratio highlights potential challenges the company might face when handling its interest expenses on outstanding debt. It's worth noting that the esteemed investor Benjamin Graham typically favored companies with an interest coverage ratio of at least five.The company's Altman Z-Scoreis just 0.48, which is below the distress zone of 1.81. This suggests that the company may face financial distress over the next few years. Additionally, the company's low cash-to-debt ratio at 0.08 indicates a struggle in handling existing debt levels. The company's debt-to-equity ratio is 10.65, which is worse than 98.67% of 452 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. A high debt-to-equity ratio suggests over-reliance on borrowing and vulnerability to market fluctuations. Additionally, the company's debt-to-Ebitda ratio is 11.62, which is above Joel Tillinghast's warning level of 4 and is worse than 91.38% of 441 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. Tillinghast said in his book Big Money Think's Small: Biases, Blind Spots, and Smarter Investing that a high debt-to-Ebitda ratio can be a red flag unless tangible assets cover the debt.Growth ProspectsA lack of significant growth is another area where The AES Corp seems to falter, as evidenced by the company's low Growth rank. Over the past five years, The AES Corp has witnessed a decline in its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). The three-year growth rate is recorded at -13.6, while the five-year growth rate is at -18.1. These figures underscore potential challenges in the company's profitability. Lastly, The AES Corp predictability rank is just one star out of five, adding to investor uncertainty regarding revenue and earnings consistency.Unraveling The AES Corp (AES)'s Potential Underperformance: A Deep Dive into Key MetricsNext StepsGiven the company's financial strength, profitability, and growth metrics, the GF Score highlights the firm's unparalleled position for potential underperformance. While the company has a strong reputation in the Utilities - Regulated industry, its recent performance and financial indicators suggest that it may struggle to maintain its historical performance. Investors should consider these factors when making investment decisions.GuruFocus Premium members can find more companies with strong GF Scores using the following screener link: GF Score ScreenThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

The deal recognizes employee contributions with significant pay and benefit increases and additional job security, the automaker said.The new agreement covers autoworkers at GM’s assembly plant in Oshawa, a powertrain plant in St. Catharines, and a parts distribution center in Woodstock.The workers struck at GM after Unifor workers ratified a new three-year labor contract with Ford late last month.Payne said she expects a ratification vote on the GM deal in the coming days. If approved, only Jeep maker Stellantis would be left without a contract with Unifor. Payne said she expects talks to begin soon with the company, which has the largest manufacturing footprint in Canada of the Detroit automakers.“I expect Stellantis will come here kicking and screaming the same way that General Motors did,” she told reporters Tuesday.Stellantis declined to comment.Unifor said that the deal includes pay raises of nearly 20% for production workers and 25% for skilled trades. Workers would get 10% in general pay raises in the first year, with 2% in the second and 3% in the third. The company also agreed to restore cost-of-living pay raises starting in December of 2024. Temporary workers would get pay raises, and those with at least one year of service would get permanent jobs.Story continuesWorkers who get defined-contribution retirement plans will move to a new defined-benefits pension on Jan. 1, 2025.Payne said earlier that the union had a lot of bargaining leverage with GM because the factory in Oshawa is working around the clock to build profitable Chevrolet pickups.The deal ratified by workers at Ford of Canada raises base hourly pay for production workers by almost 20% over three years.Until Tuesday, Unifor had avoided going on strike against the Detroit automakers, unlike its U.S. counterpart, the United Auto Workers. About 25,000 UAW members are on strike against Detroit automakers at five targeted factories and 38 parts distribution centers.Unifor members at a fourth GM facility, the CAMI Assembly Plant in Ingersoll, Ontario, are covered by a separate bargaining agreement and did not strike.The union is Canada's largest in the private sector, with 315,000 workers in many industries.]"

As part of Yahoo Finance's week long special, EVs: The Road Ahead, we're taking a look at the biggest challenges in place for the EV transition. Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian, of course, is here with the details. So Pras, what are some of those challenges.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah, as this transformation takes place, we're watching these things over the next week. I feel like there's three things that we should watch out for-- labor, demand, but then also the cost of materials. So these are the three factors that I am watching and come into play.So we'll start with labor here. This is obviously front and center right now with the UAW strike happening right now. This, it comes at the worst time for the big three as they're ramping up investment to build out their EV facilities, but spending billions here. Also losing hundreds of millions here because of the strike.And conversely, for the Union, making EVs requires fewer jobs in general. It's simpler to make the fewer moving parts, fewer cast parts to use. The unions are concerned here about that which will lead to more rancor, and maybe calls for job security. Secondly, demand. The demand picture, EVs sold last quarter around 9%, 8% of all light vehicles sold in the US. Steadily creeping up, but still tailing off in some regions.A big part of it is cost. KBB finds EVs cost on average $18,000 more than gas powered cars. That's a big deal. It's a huge premium hitting demand. And conversely, this is why the EV tax credit is so important here, right? So problems like infrastructure and demand, anxiety don't help with demand either.Story continuesFinally, cost of materials. Despite fewer labor inputs, EVs cost more to make, that's just a reality. Legacy automakers spending billions of dollars to make these factories to get these horizontal line. But once you're online, they have to pay for materials like lithium, cobalt, nickel, all in large quantities.When you pair it all together, supply costs, things like that, these costs for these cars, EVs are rocketing higher, and leaving automakers with the conundrum here. Either you eat the cost and hurt margins, or pass the costs on and hit sales. So these are things we're watching here, as the EV transformation hits this big green tidal wave as, as some are calling it.- Pras, thank you for that.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Thank you.]"

This comes as Canada’s auto union, Unifor, says GM is making negotiations difficult, as a big deadline looms for tonight.Late on Sunday, the UAW announced workers voted to reject a tentative agreement its negotiators made with the truckmaker with a 73% “no” vote, prompting workers to strike at 7 a.m. ET on Monday. ""I'm inspired to see UAW members at Mack holding out for a better deal, and ready to stand up and walk off the job to win it,"" UAW president Shawn Fain said via the UAW’s X account. The union has 4,000 workers at Mack Trucks plants in Pennsylvania, Florida, and Maryland.In a letter to Volvo North America Trucks (which owns Mack Trucks) head of labor relations Holly Georgell, Fain stated the union's demands of the trucking company are similar to those of the Big Three, including cost of living allowances (COLA), wage progression, job security, pension, healthcare, and other issues.""We clearly demonstrated our commitment to good faith bargaining by arriving at a tentative agreement that was endorsed by both the International UAW and the UAW Mack Truck Council,"" Mack Trucks CEO Stephen Roy said. Roy added that he was “surprised and disappointed” by the vote to reject the deal, which included a 19% pay hike, a $3,500 ratification bonus, increased retirement benefits, additional vacation time, and a decrease in time for wage progression to top pay.Meanwhile in Canada, the country’s Unifor auto workers union said GM (GM) was ""resisting"" a number of important elements that the union secured with Ford (F), with a strike deadline looming Monday night at 11:59 p.m ET.Unifor, like the UAW in the US, uses a “pattern agreement” with one automaker to use as a template for the others. Unifor chose GM as its second target after Ford, to hammer out issues it has with the Detroit-based automaker using concessions gained from its Ford deal.Story continuesA used Mack truck on a lot in Evans City, Pa., Jan. 9, 2020.

Unifor representatives did not immediately respond following Yahoo Finance’s request for comment.Earlier last month, Unifor ratified a new three-year contract with Ford that offered wage increases of up to 25%, COLA protection, and a reduction of the wage progression wait time to four years for top pay for the approximately 5,600 workers at Canadian Ford facilities.If a deal is not reached, Unifor’s 4,300 workers at GM Canada facilities will potentially go on strike late Monday night.Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

With 80% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).As a result, institutional investors endured the highest losses last week after market cap fell by US$2.7b. Needless to say, the recent loss which further adds to the one-year loss to shareholders of 13% might not go down well especially with this category of shareholders. Also referred to as ""smart money"", institutions have a lot of sway over how a stock's price moves. As a result, if the decline continues, institutional investors may be pressured to sell McCormick which might hurt individual investors.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of McCormick. Check out our latest analysis for McCormick ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About McCormick?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that McCormick does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of McCormick, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in McCormick. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 11% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 6.9% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 6.2% by the third-largest shareholder.Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 18 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of McCormickThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that McCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$79m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 20% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks for example - McCormick has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.Ultimately the future is most important.

UAL is benefiting from air-travel demand and improved outlook. However, low liquidity is worrisome.Factors Favoring UALOwing to buoyant air-travel demand, United Airlines posted a significant year-over-year increase (17.1%) in second-quarter 2023 revenues. This was driven by a 20.1% rise in passenger revenues (accounting for 91.7% of the top line).Due to robust air-travel demand, UAL expects revenues for the September quarter to grow 10-13% year over year. For third-quarter 2023, United Airlines expects capacity to improve 16% from the year-ago reported figure.Driven by the rosy air-travel-demand scenario, UAL projects third-quarter earnings per share in the $3.85-$4.35 band. Management has lifted its EPS forecast for 2023 to $11-12 (prior view: $10-$12).In a bid to modernize its fleet, the carrier placed the largest 787 Dreamliner order to Boeing in December 2022. UAL will purchase 100 Boeing 787 Dreamliners, with options to buy 100 more. It anticipates getting delivery of this new widebody planes between 2024 and 2032. The new jets are expected to result in 25% improvement pertaining to fuel usage compared with the older Boeing 767 widebodies and some 777s that will be replaced.Key RisksThe decline in current ratio (a measure of liquidity) does not bode well for the company. The carrier exited the second-quarter of 2023 with a current ratio of 0.91, down from the reading of 1 in fourth-quarter 2022. Reduction in this key ratio generally implies that the company's ability to generate cash is on the decline.Zacks RankUAL currently carries Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks for investors interested in the Zacks Transportation sector are FedEx Corporation FDX and Ryder System R.FDX’s consistent efforts to reward shareholders through dividends and buybacks are encouraging.

It marked the strongest job gain in eight months and well above the 70K-100K needed per month to maintain the growth in the working-age population, per tradingeconomics.The unemployment rate was 3.8%, compared to the forecast for 3.7%. Wage increases, however, were softer than expected, with average hourly earnings up 0.2% for the month and 4.2% from a year ago, compared to respective estimates for 0.3% and 4.3%.In September, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls increased by 7 cents, or 0.2%, to $33.88. Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings have increased by 4.2%. In September, average hourly earnings of private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees rose by 6 cents, or 0.2%, to $29.06.Below, we have highlighted some of the sectors that will likely see smooth trading in the days ahead in light of the September jobs data.Sectors in FocusHealthcareEmployment in the healthcare industry increased by 41,000 in jobs, compared with the average monthly gain of 53,000 over the prior 12 months. Over the month, employment continued to go up in ambulatory health care services (+24,000), hospitals (+8,000), and nursing and residential care facilities (+8,000).Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF XLV can be played to tap the moderate momentum. HCA Healthcare HCA, which has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) deserves a mention. It is the largest non-governmental operator of acute care hospitals in the United States.LeisureEmployment in leisure and hospitality rose by 96,000, above the average monthly gain of 61,000 over the past one year. Employment in food services and drinking places rose by 61,000 over the month and has returned to its pre-pandemic February 2020 level. Accommodation employment continued to increase over the month (+16,000) but remains below its February 2020 level by 217,000, or 10.3%.Story continuesThe data makes Invesco Dynamic Leisure and Entertainment ETF PEJ a timely investment. The Zacks Rank #1 Carrols Restaurant Group TAST is the largest BURGER KING franchisee in the United States, with over 800 restaurants.TransportationIn September, employment in transportation and warehousing changed little (+9,000). Truck transportation has witnessed 9,000 job growth, following a decline of 25,000 in August that largely reflected a business closure. Air transportation added 5,000 jobs in September. Employment in transportation and warehousing has shown little net change in the past one year.Investors can keep a watch on the price movement of U.S. Global Jets ETF JETS.

An In-Depth Exploration,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-airlines-holdings-ual-smart-153644208.html,1696865804,STORY,"['VALU', 'UAL']","[Value-focused investors are always on the hunt for stocks that are priced below their intrinsic value. One such stock that merits attention is United Airlines Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:UAL). The stock, which is currently priced at 39.16, recorded a loss of 6.37% in a day and a 3-month decrease of 28.76%. The stock's fair valuation is $73.4, as indicated by its GF Value.Understanding GF ValueWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with UAL. Click here to check it out. UAL 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of UALThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our exclusive method. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. It is calculated based on three factors: historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at, GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future estimates of the business performance.We believe the GF Value Line is the fair value that the stock should be traded at. The stock price will most likely fluctuate around the GF Value Line. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.United Airlines Holdings (UAL): A Smart Investment or a Value Trap? An In-Depth ExplorationDelving Deeper: Is United Airlines Holdings a Value Trap?However, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with United Airlines Holdings should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of 1.05, and the company's revenues and earnings have been on a downward trend over the past five years, which raises a crucial question: Is United Airlines Holdings a hidden gem or a value trap? These indicators suggest that United Airlines Holdings, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Story continuesUnderstanding the Altman Z-ScoreBefore delving into the details, let's understand what the Altman Z-score entails. Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Company Snapshot: United Airlines Holdings IncUnited Airlines is a major U.S. network carrier with hubs in San Francisco, Chicago, Houston, Denver, Los Angeles, New York/Newark, and Washington, D.C. United operates a hub-and-spoke system that is more focused on international and long-haul travel than its large U.S. peers. Despite its extensive network and significant market presence, United Airlines Holdings's financial health may be weak, suggesting possible financial distress. This raises concerns about its investment attractiveness, despite its low price relative to the GF Value.United Airlines Holdings (UAL): A Smart Investment or a Value Trap? An In-Depth ExplorationUnited Airlines Holdings's Low Altman Z-Score: A Breakdown of Key DriversThe Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio provides insights into a company's capability to reinvest its profits or manage debt. Evaluating United Airlines Holdings's historical data, 2021: 0.01; 2022: -0.01; 2023: 0.03, we observe a declining trend in this ratio. This downward movement indicates United Airlines Holdings's diminishing ability to reinvest in its business or effectively manage its debt. Consequently, it exerts a negative impact on its Z-Score.The Bearish Signs: Declining Revenues and EarningsOne of the telltale indicators of a company's potential trouble is a sustained decline in revenues. In the case of United Airlines Holdings, both the revenue per share (evident from the last five years' TTM data: 2019: 158; 2020: 124.68; 2021: 47.12; 2022: 108.81; 2023: 153.04; ) and the 5-year revenue growth rate (-7.3%) have been on a consistent downward trajectory. This pattern may point to underlying challenges such as diminishing demand for United Airlines Holdings's products, or escalating competition in its market sector. Either scenario can pose serious risks to the company's future performance, warranting a thorough analysis by investors.United Airlines Holdings (UAL): A Smart Investment or a Value Trap? An In-Depth ExplorationThe Red Flag: Sluggish Earnings GrowthThe company's earnings picture does not look much brighter. The 3-year EPS without NRI growth rate (-42.3%) is sluggish, and the future 3 to 5-year EPS growth estimate (36.63%) does not show a promising uptick. These indicators could suggest the company is struggling to translate sales into profits effectively, a critical element of a successful business model.Conclusion: Navigating the Value TrapDespite its low price-to-fair-value ratio, United Airlines Holdings's falling revenues and earnings cast a long shadow over its investment attractiveness. A low price relative to intrinsic value can indeed suggest an investment opportunity, but only if the company's fundamentals are sound or improving. In United Airlines Holdings' case, the declining revenues, EBITDA, and earnings growth suggest that the company's issues may be more than just cyclical fluctuations.Without a clear turnaround strategy, there's a risk that the company's performance could continue to deteriorate, leading to further price declines. In such a scenario, the low price-to-GF-Value ratio may be more indicative of a value trap than a value opportunity. Therefore, United Airlines Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:UAL) might indeed be a value trap, underlining the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.GuruFocus Premium members can find stocks with high Altman Z-Score using the following Screener: Walter Schloss Screen .Investors can find stocks with good revenue and earnings growth using GuruFocus' Peter Lynch Growth with Low Valuation Screener.This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

(JPM), Citigroup (C), and PNC Financial Services Group (PNC), will be reporting earnings. Scott Krisiloff, The Transcript Editor and Avondale Asset Management Founder, joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss what to watch for from the financial sector going into earnings season.“The types of things that we’ll be looking for in earnings seasons as it starts up,” Krisiloff says, is “we're looking at interest-rate sensitive sectors across the board right now with longer term interest rates rising and trying to see the impact that that... rise of interest rates is having on them,” as well as the mortgage space. Krisiloff adds that he's “not expecting any sort of continued financial crisis from especially these long-duration asset securities portfolios at banks.”For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptAKIKO FUJITA: Well, earnings season is set to kick off this week with JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup set to report third quarter earnings on Friday. There's certainly gonna be a lot of scrutiny surrounding some of the nation's biggest banks as they navigate one of the most challenging periods for their industry.Will big banks be able to catch a break this quarter? Let's bring in Scott Krisiloff, the transcripts editor and founder of Avondale Asset Management. Scott, good to talk to you today. There's certainly gonna be a lot of focus on loan loss provisions, for example, with some of these big banks, given how we have seen credit tightening. What are you expecting?SCOTT KRISILOFF: Yeah, I mean, I think we're looking at interest rate-sensitive sectors across the board right now with longer-term interest rates rising and trying to see the impact that that rise in interest rates is having on them. So, you know, the same sorts of dynamics that hit Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year as their longer duration, securities portfolios were impacted by rising rates.Story continuesWe wanna see how that's impacting other banks across the space as well. Obviously, the mortgage space is going to be heavily impacted by this. Mortgage volumes have fallen already significantly. But those are the types of things that we'll be looking for in earnings season as it starts up.AKIKO FUJITA: You know, we have seen the water, so to speak, sort of a little calmer at least when it comes to regional banks since we saw the SVB collapse earlier this year. You talked about the interest rate-sensitive spaces. I mean, these regional banks, medium-sized banks certainly gonna be in focus yet again. What's your sense right now in terms of how much more of a shakeup we're likely to see given where rates are and where they're expected to remain?SCOTT KRISILOFF: Yeah, I mean, I'm not expecting any sort of continued financial crisis from especially these long-duration asset securities portfolios at banks. But we do really want to look at the way that interest rates are impacting, for instance, loan demand at the banks just for a broader sense of how it's impacting the economy.As rates go higher, obviously, you mentioned mortgages are one place where now that we're above 7%, it makes housing less affordable. But there's a lot of other areas of the economy that are interest rate-sensitive as well, dependent on credit that will make their way into loan demand. It'll be interesting to see how that's impacting bank quarters through that lens.]"

For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: A crucial inflation print and the start of third quarter earnings is on investors' minds this week. Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer here to break down the busy week ahead. Josh, what's happening?JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, Brad, we really do have a busy week here when you take a look at both economic data and the start of third quarter earnings season. I want to start first with that economic data, though. We can take a look at that calendar. You're gonna see some key data points coming out of last week's jobs report. Remember that jobs report came in a little bit hotter than expected.So then when you take a look at the report this week, the key thing I'm watching is that inflation print on Thursday because of a lot of economists we've spoken with over the last couple of days, that sort of understanding what Friday's hot jobs report meant means there is the potential for the soft landing still, right? When we talk about the economy doing well, job growth happening. But is that balanced with inflation continuing to come down?Story continuesIf you have inflation continuing to come down, we saw wages decrease in that Friday jobs report. The economy could still be in a very good position here. Now, of course, the downside to that and the potential risk for another Fed rate hike would be if we see inflation increase on Thursday or even just remain flat, we're expecting those prices to come down on a monthly basis, just slightly.So we're looking for a little bit of a decrease in inflation on Thursday, then we'll get consumer sentiment on Friday. And of course, always I shouldn't have skipped over it on Wednesday, the FOMC meeting minutes, always something interesting to watch. I'm sure there'll be a tidbit on Wednesday there that we're talking about.SEANA SMITH: And Josh, when we talk about everything that's on the radar right now, you mentioned it briefly off the top. But earnings clearly going to be a focus here. We're starting to hear from some of the larger banks. At the end of the week, what are you gonna be keeping a close eye on?JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, Seana. So Friday is sort of the kickoff of third quarter earnings season in earnest, if you will, with all of those financial companies you're gonna see reporting there, all those banks. You've got JP Morgan, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, PNC, BlackRock.And really what we're wondering there, what we always wonder from these banks, is what are they saying about the overall health of the US economy and the consumer? And then also, how are they dealing with these higher-for-longer interest rates, right? How is that impacting what is going on within the financial system? Because that will tell us what will happen with the rest of the companies and some of the companies that were just on your screen moving forward.But on Tuesday, I'm really interested to hear what we hear from Pepsi this week because Pepsi is one of the companies that has been listed recently by various different Wall Street research firms as a company that could see downside risk from Ozempic and different prescription weight loss drugs.If you take a look at Pepsi shares over the last five days, they're off about 5%. They're off nearly 10% in the last month. Coca-Cola shares have also been down. So I'm wondering if Pepsi earnings is gonna be the start of us hearing about Ozempic for third quarter earnings.It's been a big story on the street thus far. And I'm curious if one of these analysts is going to start asking executives about it and we hear a little bit more about what prescription weight loss drugs means for the food sector moving forward.BRAD SMITH: All right, Josh, a lot to keep tabs on there. Thanks for kicking off the week with a view at what we should be keeping our eye on. Thanks so much.]"

BLK is slated to report third-quarter 2023 results on Oct 13 before the opening bell. While its revenues are expected to have improved in the quarter, earnings are likely to have witnessed a year-over-year decline.In second-quarter 2023, BLK’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results benefited from a decline in expenses and higher non-operating income. The assets under management (AUM) balance witnessed improvement. However, lower revenues acted as a headwind.BlackRock has an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering a surprise of 12.1%, on average.BlackRock, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise BlackRock, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseBlackRock, Inc. price-eps-surprise | BlackRock, Inc. QuoteThe company’s business activities and prospects in the to-be-reported quarter have not encouraged analysts to revise earnings estimates upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BlackRock’s third-quarter earnings of $8.73 has been revised 1.6% lower over the past seven days. The figure indicates a decline of 8.6% from the year-ago quarter’s reported number. Our estimate for third-quarter earnings is pinned at $8.47.The consensus estimate for sales is pegged at $4.67 billion, which suggests a rise of 8.4% from the prior-year quarter’s reported number. Our estimate for sales is pinned at $4.60 billion.Before we take a look at what our quantitative model predicts for the to-be-reported quarter, let’s discuss the factors that are likely to have impacted the company’s quarterly performance.Key Factors &amp; Estimates for Q3BlackRock has been a dominant player in the exchange traded fund (“ETF”) market, given its continued investments in the U.S. iShare core ETFs. As investors have kept increasing allocations toward ETFs instead of alternative investments to reduce management costs, the company’s iShares inflows have been strong over the past several quarters, with the trend expected to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter.Thus, driven by expected inflows, BLK’s AUM balance is likely to have increased. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total AUM is pegged at $9.58 trillion, suggesting a year-over-year rise of 20.3%. Our estimate for total AUM for the third quarter is $9.44 trillion, indicating a rise of 18.6%.Because of the rise in AUM, the related fee is expected to have been positively impacted. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s investment advisory performance fees is pegged at $166 million, indicating a significant increase from the previous-year quarter’s reported number. Our estimate for performance fees is $127.8 million, suggesting a rise of 55.8%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for investment advisory, administration fees and securities-lending revenues for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $3.76 billion, indicating a 6.4% year-over-year rise. Our estimate for the same is $3.73 billion, implying a rise of 5.5%.The consensus estimate for distribution fee of $338 million indicates a rise of 4% from the previous year. We also project the metric to be $338 million.The consensus estimate for technology services revenues is pegged at $369 million, implying a 9.2% year-over-year rise. We also project the metric to increase to $369 million.BlackRock’s expenses have been elevated over the past few years. Given that the company has been continuing its restructuring initiatives to modify the size and shape of its workforce and improve operating efficiency, overall costs are expected to have increased in the third quarter. Our estimate for total expenses is pinned at $3.06 billion, implying a year-over-year rise of 9.8%.Story continuesKey Developments During the QuarterIn August, BlackRock completed its previously announced agreement to acquire London-based Kreos Capital, which is a leading provider of growth and venture debt financing to companies in the technology and healthcare industries.While the transaction (announced in June) had no material impact on BlackRock's earnings, the acquisition adds to BlackRock's position as the global credit asset manager.Per an announcement in July, BLK is set to revolutionize India’s asset management industry through a joint venture with Jio Financial Services Limited (“JFS”) named Jio BlackRock. The 50:50 partnership brings together the scale and investment expertise of BLK with the local market knowledge and digital infrastructure capabilities of India-based JFS.The primary goal of the joint venture is to democratize access to investment solutions and provide affordable, tech-enabled options for millions of investors in India.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. In light of that, when we looked at Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Intuitive Surgical, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.13 = US$1.7b ÷ (US$14b - US$1.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).So, Intuitive Surgical has an ROCE of 13%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Medical Equipment industry average of 9.7% it's much better. View our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical roceIn the above chart we have measured Intuitive Surgical's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Intuitive Surgical here  for free.What Does the ROCE Trend For Intuitive Surgical Tell Us?When we looked at the ROCE trend at Intuitive Surgical, we didn't gain much confidence. Over the last five years, returns on capital have decreased to 13% from 20% five years ago. Although, given both revenue and the amount of assets employed in the business have increased, it could suggest the company is investing in growth, and the extra capital has led to a short-term reduction in ROCE. If these investments prove successful, this can bode very well for long term stock performance.Story continuesIn Conclusion...While returns have fallen for Intuitive Surgical in recent times, we're encouraged to see that sales are growing and that the business is reinvesting in its operations. Furthermore the stock has climbed 70% over the last five years, it would appear that investors are upbeat about the future. So while the underlying trends could already be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.While Intuitive Surgical doesn't shine too bright in this respect, it's still worth seeing if the company is trading at attractive prices. You can find that out with our  FREE intrinsic value estimation  on our platform.While Intuitive Surgical isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

223,0acbddc0-dbb2-3f95-b09c-ccbf403966ed,CSX,2023-10-10,Calculating The Fair Value Of CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-fair-value-csx-corporation-120027269.html,1696939227,STORY,['CSX'],"[Key InsightsCSX's estimated fair value is US$31.38 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityWith US$31.08 share price, CSX appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value The US$35.77 analyst price target for CSX is 14% more than our estimate of fair valueIn this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for CSX Step By Step Through The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.47bUS$3.80bUS$3.82bUS$3.82bUS$3.84bUS$3.87bUS$3.93bUS$3.99bUS$4.06bUS$4.14bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x11Analyst x5Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 0.53%Est @ 1.01%Est @ 1.35%Est @ 1.59%Est @ 1.76%Est @ 1.88% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.6% US$3.2kUS$3.3kUS$3.1kUS$2.8kUS$2.7kUS$2.5kUS$2.3kUS$2.2kUS$2.1kUS$2.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$26bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.1b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.6%– 2.2%) = US$77bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$77b÷ ( 1 + 7.6%)10= US$37bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$63b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$31.1, the company appears about fair value at a 1.0% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at CSX as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.099. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for CSXStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Transportation market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For CSX, we've compiled three further items you should further research:Risks: Be aware that  CSX is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...Future Earnings: How does CSX's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

RCL need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jan 19, 2024 $30.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Royal Caribbean Cruises shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Royal Caribbean Cruises is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) Leisure and Recreation Services industry that ranks in the Bottom 37% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, three analysts have increased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one has revised the estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from earnings of $3.25 per share to $3.44 in that period.Given the way analysts feel Royal Caribbean Cruises right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay.

However, low to moderate-income customers continue to reel under higher costs.The company’s off-price model offers a strong value proposition and micro-merchandising that drive better product allocation and margins. Overall, gains at the core business demonstrated consumers' continued focus on value and ROST’s ability to deliver value bargains to customers. Over the long term, the company expects the rigorous execution of its off-price business models to enable it to consistently deliver solid results.Ross Stores stays focused on delivering the most compelling bargains going forward, as customer demand for the best-branded values remains high amid prolonged inflation woes. Moreover, the company has been judiciously managing its expenses and inventory to maximize its potential for sales and earnings growth.Driven by the continued business momentum, management raised its second-half sales and earnings guidance. Comparable store sales for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2023 are expected to be up 2-3% and 1-2% year over year, respectively. Total sales are anticipated to grow 4-6% year over year.For the fiscal third quarter, earnings per share are envisioned to be $1.16-$1.21, suggesting a rise from the last-year quarter’s reported figure of $1.00. The operating margin for the fiscal third quarter is expected to be 10.3-10.5%, whereas it reported 9.8% in the last-year quarter, driven by gains from lower ocean and domestic freight costs, which more than offset increased incentive compensation and store wages.For fiscal 2023, comparable store sales are anticipated to be up 2-3% year over year. Earnings are forecast to be $5.15-$5.26, whereas it reported $4.38 in the prior year.Story continuesStore Growth Ambition Bodes WellROST has been consistent with the execution of its store expansion plans over the years.

In the second quarter, U.S. GDP expanded at an impressive annualized real rate (over and above inflation) of 2.1% in the second quarter. For the third quarter, the Federal Reserve predicts that the economy will soar an annualized, real, seasonally adjusted 4.9%. Moreover, the labor market remains very strong, with the unemployment rate at 3.8%. Meanwhile, the forces enabling the U.S. economy to grow rapidly, including energy transformation, and strong consumer spending continue to stay intact. So, I strongly believe the economy will continue to expand significantly going forward. That being said, here are seven ways to trade that strength.Strong U.S. Economy Stocks: Roku (ROKU)The entrance sign at Roku San Jose campus. Roku produces a variety of digital media players that allow customers to access internet streamed video or audio services.Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comRoku (NASDAQ:ROKU) is well-positioned to benefit from the growth of ad spending in the U.S. In fact, according to Ad Age, ad revenue is expected to climb a healthy 5% this year. By 2024, it’s expected to grow another 8.1%.Moreover, the “streaming wars” are heating up, with nearly 30% of U.S. households canceling one or more streaming services to save money.  Also, since I’ve seen many other streaming services, including Fox’s (NASDAQ:FOXA) Fox Nation and Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) streaming service advertise on Roku, I believe that these renewed streaming wars will boost Roku’s financial results going forward. Roku already began benefiting from the rejuvenated ad market last quarter, as its sales climbed an impressive 11% year over year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMeta Platforms (META)Threads app logo seen on screen. Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.Source: Ascannio / Shutterstock.comLike Roku, Meta (NASDAQ:META) is well-positioned to benefit from the rejuvenation of digital ad spending.Indeed, in the second quarter, the company’s ad revenue climbed 12% year over year to $31.5 billion. According to Modern Retail, the rebound of Meta’s ad revenue was partially driven by e-commerce marketers. In addition, the publication says analysts expect online ad spending to continue to climb as U.S. e-commerce revenue expands.Story continuesMoreover, Morgan Stanley says Meta’s earnings per share could surge to $20 next year thanks Reels, Click to Message, and ads businesses. The bank maintained a $375 price target and an “overweight” rating on the shares.META stock trades at a rather low forward price-earnings ratio of 18.6 times.Strong U.S. Economy Stocks: Brinker (EAT)A photo of a Chili's restaurant sign, owned by Brinter International (EAT).Source: James R. Martin/ShutterStock.comAs I’ve noted in previous columns, I expect restaurant chains to benefit from the easing of the “revenge travel” trend and a stronger U.S. economy. That’s because, with consumers spending less on large travel expenses like airfare, hotels, and auto rentals, they’ll have more funds to spend at their local restaurants.Brinker (NYSE:EAT) seems like a good candidate to get a significant boost from this trend. Helping, Stifel just upgraded the shares to “buy” from “hold,” citing its belief that the company can rejuvenate the performance of its Chili’s chain. Stifel also raised its price target on the shares to $45. Analysts, on average, expect the company’s EPS to rise to $3.77 next year from $2.83 in 2022. And EAT stock has a very low forward price-earnings ratio of 9.5.Rivian (RIVN)Rivian (RIVN) All Electric R1T Pickup Truck in a forest green colorSource: Roschetzky Photography / Shutterstock.comRivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) appears to be well-positioned to become a leading seller of electric SUVs. In fact, strong economic growth should enable more consumers to buy Rivian’s EVs this quarter and in 2024. Helping, analysts at Evercore upgraded RIVN stock to “outperform.” The bank expects the company’s Q3 margin to come in ahead of the Street’s mean estimate. It also predicts that the company’s gross margins will hit the break-even level in the second quarter of next year. In addition, the firm says Rivian will be able to produce more than 80,,000 EVs next year. Evercore has a $35 price target on RIVN.Strong U.S. Economy Stocks: Ross Stores (ROST)Photo of the storefront of a Ross storeSource: ShutterstockWhile the U.S. economy is showing signs of improvement, higher costs are still causing chaos for consumers. As a result, many of these consumers will likely look to shop at discount stores such as Ross (NASDAQ:ROST). At the same time, Ross could benefit from consumers trading up from chains like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and the dollar stores.Investment bank Jefferies recently named ROST as one of the companies likely to benefit from a trend of shopping at “deep value” retailers. The firm noted that, in a survey of shoppers with children, Ross was one of the five chains at which respondents expected to spend more going forward. Analysts, on average, expect Ross’ EPS to climb to $5.71 in 2024 from $4.38 in 2022, and the company has a reasonable forward price-earnings ratio of 21.9.Chipotle (CMG)a pedestrian walks past a ChipotleSource: Northfoto / Shutterstock.comChipotle (NYSE:CMG) is a restaurant chain that’s well-positioned to benefit both from strong economic growth and reduced spending by consumers on travel.Helping, analysts at Baird reiterated that CMG is a “top idea” for investors, citing its belief that the chain’s traffic can climb this quarter. The firm is also upbeat about the impact of the company’s current limited-time offer of carne asada. Also bullish on CMG stock was Seeking Alpha columnist The Value Seeker, who is upbeat on the firm because of its “aggressive restaurant expansion plan and its focus on digital innovation.”Analysts, on average, expect the company’s EPS to jump to $52.59 in 2024 from $32.78 in 2022.Robert Half (RHI)The Robert Half International (RHI) logo on the website homepageSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comRecruitment firm Robert Half (NYSE:RHI) reported disappointing second-quarter financial results. In fact, its bottom line plunged to $106.29 million from $175 million year over year. The company blamed slow hiring due to “macro uncertainties” for the relatively weak quarter. I believe that, with many companies finally realizing that a recession is not around the corner, those uncertainties will ease. Additionally, the slight tightening of the labor market that’s occurring now could make more workers amendable to leaning on Robert Half’s recruiters for help finding their next positions, instead of easily doing so themselves.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a long position in RIVN.

(NASDAQ:ADI)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-intrinsic-value-analog-devices-120049050.html,1696939249,STORY,['ADI'],"[Key InsightsThe projected fair value for Analog Devices is US$162 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityAnalog Devices' US$173 share price indicates it is trading at similar levels as its fair value estimate The US$200 analyst price target for ADI is 24% more than our estimate of fair valueHow far off is Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Analog Devices Step By Step Through The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.03bUS$4.88bUS$5.21bUS$5.49bUS$5.73bUS$5.95bUS$6.14bUS$6.32bUS$6.49bUS$6.66bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x3Analyst x4Est @ 6.76%Est @ 5.38%Est @ 4.41%Est @ 3.73%Est @ 3.26%Est @ 2.93%Est @ 2.69%Est @ 2.53% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.7% US$3.7kUS$4.1kUS$4.1kUS$3.9kUS$3.8kUS$3.6kUS$3.4kUS$3.2kUS$3.1kUS$2.9k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$36bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$6.7b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (8.7%– 2.2%) = US$103bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$103b÷ ( 1 + 8.7%)10= US$45bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$81b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$173, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Analog Devices as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.315. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Analog DevicesStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Semiconductor market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityADI's financial characteristics indicate limited near-term opportunities for shareholders.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein (Evelyn Hockstein / reuters)He cited similar concerns bankers had about lending and economic growth in the years after the 2008 crisis, as regulators asked banks to boost their capital cushions to protect against future blowups. Yet, he said, the US economy grew, banking profits recovered to historical averages, and the banking system expanded in size to $23 trillion in assets from $12 trillion.""As banks increased their capital cushions, their profitability grew, as did their market valuation,"" he said. ""This is not to dismiss arguments that higher capital could harm the economy — just to note that similar warnings were not borne out in recent experience.""US regulators proposed their most recent set of changes in July, saying banks affected by the changes would see an aggregate 16% increase in their capital requirements. Regulators said the increase would primarily affect the largest banks and that most have enough capital already to comply. Capital is the buffer banks have to hold to absorb future losses.Regulators also proposed changes in how these banks assess risks and widened the scope of the new rules to institutions with as few as $100 billion in assets, meaning roughly 30 banks would be subject to the same calculations.That would include giants such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) as well as midsized regional banks such as Fifth Third (FITB) and Regions (RF).Story continuesRegulators are accepting comments on this proposal through Nov. 30.Banks have reacted aggressively to the suggested changes. Several bank trade groups sent a letter to the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency asking them to ""re-propose"" the rule, arguing that the initial proposal ""relies on data and analyses that the agencies have not made available to the public.""JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon on Capital Hill in May. REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein (Evelyn Hockstein / reuters)JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon called the new proposal ""hugely disappointing,"" warning that it could push more lending into private credit markets.""I would love to know what they really want to accomplish,"" Dimon said.Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon also didn’t hold back. ""I don’t think these rules make sense,"" he said.Financial Services Forum President and CEO Kevin Fromer on Monday said ""the largest banks have tripled their capital since the crisis and have clearly demonstrated their strength and resilience. There is no evidence in the proposal or today’s remarks that justifies a 20 percent increase, and no one should downplay the costs of these increases to the economy.”Barr said the bulk of the increase in proposed capital is tied to trading and other areas besides lending — activities that he says have generated large losses at big banks and areas where he feels current rules have shortcomings.""The effective rise in capital requirements related to lending activities in the current proposal is a small portion of the estimated overall capital increase,"" Barr said.Barr estimated the higher requirement would increase the costs to banks for funding the average lending portfolio by up to 3 basis points.Though, he added, ""We recognize that the cost of funding for a specific loan would depend on the specific risk weight for that activity and that there may be other channels by which higher capital requirements could matter.""He said the Fed is very interested in public feedback for the capital proposal but that since the Fed has just begun receiving comments, he couldn’t say how the rules could evolve.Barr noted that the Fed has already heard concerns that the proposed risk-based capital treatment for mortgage lending, tax credit investments, trading activities, and activities that generate fee-based income might overestimate the risk of those activities.Regulators have argued the changes are needed to make lenders stronger, more resilient, and better prepared for shocks like the crisis of this spring, when the failures of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic triggered deposit withdrawals across the banking world.Barr said Monday that banks need to be prepared for the worst. After the 2008 crisis, he said, it took six years for employment to recover. The cost of a financial crisis could range from $5 trillion to $25 trillion, he added.Click here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

These companies are also better equipped to weather an economic downturn, providing another beneficial advantage for investors from a long-term standpoint.And for those interested in investing in strong cash flows, three companies – Alphabet GOOGL, Visa V, and UnitedHealth UNH – are all cash-generating machines. Let’s take a closer look at each.UnitedHealthHealthcare titan UNH generated roughly $23.4 billion in free cash flow throughout its FY22, improving 17% year-over-year. And over the last twelve months, UNH has generated nearly $40 billion in free cash flow, owing to its successful operations.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company also boasts a shareholder-friendly nature, with its dividend payout growing by an impressive 16% annually over the last five years.

The tech titan has long been recognized as a cash generator, reporting roughly $60 billion in free cash flow throughout FY22.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIt’s worth noting that the company has seen positive earnings estimate revisions across all timeframes, reflecting optimism among analysts.

NOC recently secured a modification contract worth $235 million involving Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR) Polar Space Vehicles 1 and 2. The work related to the deal will be carried out at Redondo Beach, CA.The contract, which is expected to be completed by Jul 25, 2026, has been awarded by the Space Systems Command, Los Angeles Air Force Base, CA. The latest modification brings the cumulative value of the contract to $2.15 billion.Importance of OPIRNorthrop Grumman’s Next-Generation OPIR polar-orbiting satellite, known as NextGen Polar (NGP), plays a key role in providing strategic missile warning for the nation’s defense. The NGP has the capability to cover the most difficult region to monitor from space – the northern polar region.The NGP, equipped with advanced modeling and simulation, will provide excellent coverage of the entire northern hemisphere. The enhanced communication system allows customers to transmit wide-band OPIR data to the ground.What’s Ahead?As nations continue to strengthen their defense structure, defense spending on military satellite systems increases manifold, backed by demand for technologically advanced orbital assets strategically designed for missile interception and recognition.According to a report by the Research and Markets firm, the global military satellites market is expected to witness a CAGR of 4.2% during the 2023-2027 period. This should benefit NOC, which enjoys an extensive satellite portfolio containing Evolved Strategic SATCOM, Protected Tactical SATCOM, and a few more.The company’s latest achievement in this area includes the August 2023 contract by the Space Development Agency to design and build 36 data transport satellites, the first space vehicles in the latest generation of its low-Earth orbit Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture. In the same month, NOC successfully delivered two major components of the Arctic Satellite Broadband Mission and started the next phase of pre-launch preparations. Such developments and contract wins involving military communication systems, including the latest one, should boost its revenue generation prospects in the coming months.Story continuesPeer ProspectsConsidering the solid growth opportunities offered by the global military satellite market, other defense primes like Lockheed Martin LMT, Airbus SE EADSY, L3Harris Technologies Inc. LHX, with a strong presence in this space, should also benefit.Lockheed Martin uses cutting-edge technologies to build capabilities that comprise layered space defense systems. The LM 400, a multi-mission satellite that can be tailored for almost any mission, is LMT’s most flexible satellite bus with capabilities that can serve military, civil or commercial users. In September 2023, LMT deployed 10 satellites into low-Earth orbit in support of the SDA’s Tranche 0 Transport Layer mission.LMT boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Lockheed’s 2023 sales indicates an improvement of 1% from that reported in 2022.Airbus is a world leader in military satellite communication services with a very broad portfolio of services, including the SATCOMBw, Syracuse 4A and 4B, Skynet 5 and many more. Airbus has been a long-term operator of the SATCOMBw secure satellite communications system for Germany’s Armed Forces.EADSY boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 12.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Airbus’ 2023 sales indicates an improvement of 17.8% from that reported in 2022.L3Harris is the prime contractor of Navigation Technology Satellite – 3 (NTS-3). The NTS-3, to be launched later this year, will provide for the safety and success of the warfighters with its accurate and uninterrupted positioning, navigation and timing technology. In September 2023, it successfully demonstrated the U.S. Department of Defense’s new anti-jam Satellite Communications waveform at the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command’s Northern Edge 2023 Exercise.LHX boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for L3Harris’ 2023 sales indicates an improvement of 9.9% from the year-ago reported number.Price PerformanceIn the past six months, shares of NOC have gained 0.7% against the industry’s 17.6% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankNorthrop Grumman currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

(Artur Widak / NurPhoto via Getty Images)Californians can soon say goodbye to so-called junk fees, those startling charges that appear in a transaction only when a customer is about to hit ""purchase.""You know the ones: A hotel bill that ends with a vague ""resort fee."" Or those concert tickets that double in price once it's time to type in your credit card information.On Saturday, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law Senate Bill 478, which bans ""offering a price for a good or service that does not include all mandatory fees or charges other than taxes or fees imposed by a government on the transaction.""Also known as hidden fees or surprise fees, junk fees obscure the total cost of a transaction until it's often too late, or too frustrating, to back out.The new law, which will go into effect July 1, 2024, won’t necessarily make things cheaper. Businesses are allowed to set prices as they wish, but the final total must be disclosed upfront.Read more: How Biden and Taylor Swift beat TicketmasterThe bill, introduced by state Sens. Bill Dodd (D-Napa) and Nancy Skinner (D-Berkeley), categorizes junk fees as a form of ""bait and switch advertising"" and a ""deceptive"" business practice.""With the signing of SB 478, California now has the most effective piece of legislation in the nation to tackle this problem. The price Californians see will be the price they pay,"" California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta, who has backed the bill since it was introduced earlier this year, said in a statement. He added that junk fees are ""bad for consumers and bad for competition.""The use of junk fees stifles fair market competition, the bill says. Tacking on charges only at the final point of sale makes it harder for consumers to know the true price of what they're buying, limiting their awareness when comparison shopping for the lowest price.Ticketing companies in particular have come under fire for tacking on high junk fees that appear at the end of a transaction. A face-value “Platinum” ticket for Blink-182’s June 16 show at BMO Stadium was listed on Ticketmaster at $290, The Times reported. But that was before an additional $47.90 in “service” and “processing” fees, which brought the total to $337.90.Story continuesSeatGeek and LiveNation, which owns Ticketmaster, in June pledged they would disclose fees at the beginning of each sale.Read more: Free from fees? California bill combats 'junk' fees for everything from concert tickets to groceries“Without knowing the true price of a product or service upfront, the process of comparison shopping becomes nearly impossible,” Jenn Engstrom, state director of the consumer advocacy group CALPIRG, said in a statement.CALPIRG supports the new law. “In the 50 years that CALPIRG has been fighting for common-sense reforms to protect consumers, this is one of the biggest no-brainers,"" Engstrom said. ""We applaud the efforts of Gov. Newsom, Atty. Gen. Bonta and the other state leaders to protect Californians’ finances and ensure a fair marketplace.”Hotel guests sued Marriott International in June over an alleged junk fee imposed at the hotel giant’s Los Angeles hotels. The “hotel worker protection ordinance costs surcharge” violates unfair competition laws, the lawsuit says.“The cost for Marriott to comply with the ordinance at the Los Angeles Airport Marriott is far less than $3.6 million annually,” the lawsuit said, according to the Wall Street Journal. “Instead, the HWPO Fee is nothing more than a ‘junk fee’ that directly benefits Marriott at the expense of guests at Marriott’s hotels.”The Biden administration has been a vocal advocate against junk fees, seeming to respond to voters' economic anxieties. The president vowed in his State of the Union address to crack down on junk fees.Read more: Biden's White House is taking on corporate mergers, landlord junk fees and food pricesUnder pressure from Biden, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in February ""announced a proposed rule to cut most credit card late fees to no more than $8.""""Junk fees are not a matter for the wealthy very much, but they’re a matter for working folks, like the homes I grew up in,"" Biden said in June. ""And they can add hundreds of dollars a month and make it harder for families to pay their bills. I think it’s just wrong.""This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

NGN has settled more than a thousand phone-hacking cases without making any admission of liability in relation to the Sun.In June, Harry became the first senior British royal for more than 130 years to give evidence in court when he appeared as part of another lawsuit against Mirror Group Newspapers.

Recent return-to-office requirements and high childcare costs may also be driving home shoppers to factor family proximity and support into their purchasing plans, the research shows.Of those surveyed who are planning to buy a home within the next 12 months, half (51%) are potentially looking to their parents to help them prepare for buying a home, with nearly one third (29%) saying they've already moved in with their parents to help save money in preparation for buying a home and another quarter (22%) saying they would consider doing so.Similarly, one third (32%) of respondents are even cohabitating with other family members to help save enough money to buy a home, including siblings, aunts and uncles, and cousins, and another 24% would consider doing so.Hoping to be close to family to share childcare and reduce expenses In addition to the short-term savings that living with family provides, many are planning to stay close to family even after they've saved up by purchasing a home nearby their relatives. Twenty-eight percent of respondents who are planning to buy a home in the next year are doing so in part to be closer to their family.Of those who are planning to buy a home to be close to family, many are motivated by financial reasons and sharing the cost and responsibilities of childcare. Helping care for other children in the family was cited as a top reason by that group (50%), followed by needing affordable help caring for their own children (44%). Other top cited reasons for buying near family were because they liked the area, prices/cost of living have become too high where they currently live, or health issues.Story continuesWhile many would-be buyers are looking to buy a home near their family, many respondents already call their family neighbors, with about 4 in 10 surveyed consumers saying their parents, siblings, extended family or grandparents have purchased a home near them.Co-buying and living with family longer-term As housing affordability continues to be a barrier for many would-be buyers, co-living or co-buying with family has gained significant popularity in recent years. Eighty-three percent of those surveyed would consider buying a home to live in together, as a primary residence, with someone other than their spouse/partner, including an extended family member or friend. Respondents were most open to buying a home with their child (37%), a romantic partner they're not married or engaged to (31%); a sibling, cousin or other family member from the same generation (27%), and their parents or in-laws (23%).Realtor.com®'s collaboration tools make it easy for shoppers buying a home together and let you invite your home search partner to link Realtor.com® accounts and begin sharing your home search in one easy place across all devices, including comments back and forth that only the two of you can see.""The challenging market conditions this year are changing buyer behavior in significant ways, driving many more people to explore alternative living situations they may not have considered in the past,"" said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist at Realtor.com. ""Mortgage rates hovering at or near 7% have eroded buyers' purchasing power at a time when the consistently low number of homes for sale has kept housing markets surprisingly competitive.""For those who would consider buying a home with someone other than their spouse, top reasons cited included that pooled resources would afford them a better location (43%), a more updated home (41%), and/or a bigger home (38%). One-third (36%) of those who said that they would buy a home with someone other than their spouse said it was because they're already living together and would prefer to buy and start building equity sooner, and 29% said it's because they can't afford to buy a home on their own.""While home buyers have long received financial assistance from family members to help them afford a home purchase – especially first-time home buyers who may not have already built up equity – we're seeing more and more prospective buyers take this a step further,"" said Clare Trapasso, executive news editor at Realtor.com®. ""Faced with ongoing housing affordability issues and rising childcare costs, we're seeing parents and children becoming roommates again in later years as the 'kids' save up to purchase their own place, siblings moving near each other to pool childcare resources, and some even buying homes with family to split the financial burden and make homeownership a reality.""Survey MethodologyThe research was conducted by Censuswide, with 2,291 respondents in the U.S. The fieldwork took place May 12-19, 2023.

245,7ed86fd7-ec69-3811-ab22-ab817ecd6b91,NWSA,2023-10-10,3 Stocks That Could Use a Taylor Swift Boost,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-could-taylor-swift-180028335.html,1696356028,STORY,"['NWSA', 'DKNG']","[Taylor Swift is a phenomenon that has captured the attention of millions around the world. But importantly, Swift has captured the wallets of these people as well. In fact, she’s been so successful that many have started referring to her business acumen as “Swiftonomics.”The Eras Tour grossed some $2.2 billion — just in America. The singer was able to tap into a generation of women seeing their disposable income rise significantly over the past few years. The ticket sales have been a big part of her income, but the merchandise is also a big slice of the pie, adding to her revenue streams. And she’s not the only one benefitting from her incredible popularity. Anywhere that Taylor’s legions of fans visited throughout her tour saw an economic boost as well.But now that the tour is over, Swift’s contributions to the economy are far from over. She’s sparked a new romance with a high-profile NFL player and announced the release of The Eras Tour documentary. Excitement over Taylor’s whereabouts continues, and her loyal fans are still on the move to see her — be it in theatres or at NFL games.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWith that in mind, many investors are looking for stocks that could see a Swift tailwind over the next few months. These are the companies likely to benefit from her upcoming film and stand to gain as she continues to make a splash in the NFL. This aspect of her popularity could be an interesting one as the games see an influx of new viewers who could significantly impact the business of football.Taylor Swift Stocks: AMC Entertainment (AMC)The AMC Empire 25 Cinemas in Times Square in New YorkSource: rblfmr / Shutterstock.comBeleaguered movie theatre and former meme stock AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) is in a financially precarious position, but Taylor Swift could change all that. The group is working to shore up its finances at the expense of investors. A dilutive share sale and years of struggling against a declining industry have left the group struggling to gain momentum. Taylor Swift and her legions of loyal fans could turn things around, though.Story continuesThe Eras Tour is set to make its way to theatres, and AMC is set to be the biggest beneficiary. AMC has been able to capture 43% of revenues for The Eras Tour documentary. That’s not chump change either. The concert film set a new record for advance ticket sales, raking in $26 million. Add to that all of the popcorn, soda and candy the Swifties will be buying and AMC should have a windfall of cash. Not to mention the precedent that The Eras Tour will set. Taylor Swift is making post-tour films a thing, and Beyonce recently announced she would release a similar film. If movie theatres can capture a slice of the excitement that comes from mega-stars tours, there could be hope for the industry yet.DraftKings (DKNG)A man opens the DraftKings (DKNG) app from his iPhone. DraftKings is an American daily fantasy sports contest and sports betting operator. DKNG Stock ForecastSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comSports betting firm DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) should benefit from the start of football season, but that benefit’s been amplified now that Taylor Swift entered the chat. Swift’s relationship with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce means there’s a whole lot more focus on the sport. With Swifties now watching and attending games to catch a glimpse of their favorite singer or cheer on her beau, the NFL may have a whole new audience. Sunday Night Football saw a 22% increase in viewership, and the number of women watching the game was up by two million.But the enhanced excitement didn’t just mean more eyeballs on screens. It also drove more betting activity — a good thing for DraftKings. The company said bets on Kelce more than doubled. Whether people are worried he’ll crack under the pressure or see Swift’s presence at his games as a good luck charm, DraftKings stands to benefit. With so many newly minted NFL fans out there, the company is likely to have a bumper season of its own.News Corporation (NWSA)News Corp. (NWSA_ Building frontSource: ShutterstockYou need only look at the mountains of stories pouring out of the latest game attended by Taylor Swift to understand why a media company like News Corporation (NASDAQ:NWSA) stands to gain from the singer’s latest endeavors. Questions about Kelce’s post-game reaction, the Singer’s post-game movements and speculation about whether she’ll be at the next game, are all dominating the conversation.

246,1d9ea86b-e1a0-3c70-8f5c-ad009bcc37e1,VZ,2023-10-10,Is There Opportunity in AT&T (T) or Verizon (VZ) Stock Near 52-week Lows?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/opportunity-t-t-verizon-vz-220300183.html,1696888980,STORY,"['VZ', 'T']","[Increasing competition among what seems like an abundance of national wireless carriers and cautious consumer shopping behavior has the Zacks Wireless National Industry currently in the bottom 17% of over 250 Zacks industries.With that being said, among what is now an -11% YTD drop (total return including dividends) for the Zacks Wireless National Industry, AT&amp;T T and Verizon VZ have hovered near their 52-week lows and investors may be wondering if there is opportunity here.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOutlook &amp; Growth ComparisonWith the number of smaller and privately-owned phone carriers consistently emerging and seemingly undercutting the price plan cost of larger carriers, it may be wise to monitor the broader growth of the Zacks Wireless National Industry in comparison with AT&amp;T and Verizon.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn this regard, the Zacks subindustry is actually expecting strong EPS growth this year at an average of around 25%. However, AT&amp;T’s earnings are now forecasted to dip -6% in fiscal 2023 although FY24 EPS is expected to stabilize and rise 3% to $2.50 per share.On the top line, AT&amp;T’s sales are projected to decline -5% in FY23 but rebound and rise over 1% in FY24 to $123.64 billion although this would still be below the industry’s historical growth rate of 2%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTurning to Verizon, its FY23 earnings are also expected to be below the anticipated growth rate of the industry. Verizon’s earnings are forecasted to drop -9% this year and be virtually flat next year at $4.72 per share.Total sales are forecasted to dip -2% in FY23 and then stabilize and rise over 1% in FY24 to $135.72 billion but below the Wireless National Industry’s historical growth rate as well.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMore Reasonable ValuationsOne argument for buying AT&amp;T or Verizon stock is that at current levels, their valuations are very reasonable. AT&amp;T and Verizon stock trade at just 5.9X and 6.5X forward earnings respectively. This is a notable discount to the industry average of 10.3X and well below the S&amp;P 500’s 20.2X.Story continuesFurthermore, this is also below what may be considered the industry leader in T-Mobile’s TMUS 19.3X. Plus, AT&amp;T and Verizon’s stock trade at significant discounts to their decade-long highs and medians regarding the forward earnings multiple.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAttractively, the price-to-sales multiple of both companies reflects the same discount for investors with AT&amp;T and Verizon's P/S ratios nicely beneath the optimum level of less than 2X. To that point, AT&amp;T’s 0.8X sales is on par with the industry average and while Verizon’s 0.9X is just above this level it is attractively below T-Mobile’s 2X and the S&amp;P 500’s 3.7X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStellar DividendsStellar dividends could be another deciding factor for investing in AT&amp;T and Verizon stock right now especially if they can sustain them. This could also help turn around the total return performance of both stocks with Verizon having an 8.62% dividend yield that slightly tops AT&amp;T’s 7.68%.Their yields tower over the S&amp;P 500’s 1.48% average and are well above the Wireless National Market’s 4.73% in an industry where there are still many companies that don’t offer a payout including T-Mobile.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineAt the moment, AT&amp;T and Verizon's stock both land a Zack Rank #3 (Hold). Despite the short-term weakness expected for these companies and the broader Zacks Wireless National Industry, their long-term prospects are still attractive considering their very reasonable valutions and investors may be rewarded for holding shares at current levels.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

INGN is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its high prospects in the portable oxygen concentrator (POC) space. The optimism led by solid second-quarter 2023 and a strong product portfolio also looks promising. However, issues like stiff competition and macroeconomic concerns are major downsides.Over the past year, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 77.5% against the 1.8% rise of the industry and 19.7% growth of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned provider of POCs has a market capitalization of $111.1 million. The company projects 7.2% growth for 2024 and expects to witness continued improvements in its business. Inogen surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, delivering an earnings surprise of 28.4%, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.High Prospects in the POC Space: We are optimistic about the POCs’ superiority over conventional oxygen therapy (known as the delivery model). Inogen primarily develops, manufactures and markets innovative POCs to deliver supplemental long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) to patients suffering from chronic respiratory conditions. Inogen’s proprietary Inogen One and Inogen Rove systems concentrate the air around the patient to offer a source of supplemental oxygen anytime, anywhere, with a battery that can be plugged into an outlet.Product Portfolio: We are optimistic about Inogen’s expanding product portfolio. The company completed the acquisition of Physio-Assist SAS in September. Following the close of the transaction, it owns Physio-Assist and will now market the Simeox device outside of the United States.Inogen launched the Rove 6, its latest POC, in December 2022. It has also received the FDA’s 510(k) clearance for the Rove 4 that will be launched in 2023.Strong Q2 Results: Inogen’s robust year-over-year uptick in overall, as well as rental and domestic business-to-business sales in second-quarter 2023, buoy optimism.Story continuesDownsidesStiff Competition: The LTOT market is a highly competitive industry. Inogen competes with several manufacturers and distributors of POC and providers of other LTOT solutions, such as home delivery of oxygen tanks or cylinders. Given the relatively straightforward regulatory path in the oxygen therapy device manufacturing market, Inogen expects that the industry will become increasingly competitive in the future.Macroeconomic Concerns: Public health outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics of contagious or infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, may significantly disrupt Inogen’s business. Business disruptions could include temporary closures of Inogen’s facilities or the facilities of its contractors, suppliers and other partners. Inogen’s business could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy and the global financial markets.Estimate TrendInogen has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. Over the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its loss per share has narrowed from $2.41 to $2.35.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $80.9 million, suggesting a 23.3% decline from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are DaVita Inc. DVA, McKesson Corporation MCK and Integer Holdings Corporation ITGR.DaVita, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present, has an estimated long-term growth rate of 12.7%.

260,4f52b92d-9044-3546-8420-aa618b240b75,MCK,2023-10-10,Here's How Much a $1000 Investment in McKesson Made 10 Years Ago Would Be Worth Today,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-much-1000-investment-mckesson-123002429.html,1696854602,STORY,['MCK'],"[How much a stock's price changes over time is a significant driver for most investors. Not only can price performance impact your portfolio, but it can help you compare investment results across sectors and industries as well.Another thing that can drive investing is the fear of missing out, or FOMO. This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in McKesson (MCK) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to MCK for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?McKesson's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at McKesson's main business drivers.San Francisco, CA-based McKesson Corporation is a health care services and information technology company. McKesson operates through two segments:The Distribution Solutions segment distributes branded and generic pharmaceutical drugs along with other healthcare-related products on a global basis worldwide. The segment also provides practice management, technology, clinical support and business solutions to community-based oncology and other specialty practices. In addition, the segment provides specialty pharmaceutical solutions for pharmaceutical manufacturers including offering multiple distribution channels and study access to oncology physicians. The segment also provides medical-surgical supply distribution, equipment, logistics and other services to healthcare providers within the U.S.The Technology Solutions segment provides enterprise-wide clinical, patient care, financial, supply chain, and strategic management software solutions.In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, per segment realignment, McKesson reported revenues through four segments: U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions, Internation, Medical-Surgical Solutions and Prescription Technology Solutions.Notably, McKesson’s role in the COVID-19 response was reflected in the collaboration with the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine distribution effort, wherein McKesson was selected as the centralized distributor of refrigerated and frozen COVID-19 vaccines and the ancillary kits used to administer those vaccines.FY23 at a GlanceRevenues in fiscal 2023 grossed $276.71 billion, up 5%  from the year-ago period. U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions (87% of net revenues), International (7.4%), Medical-Surgical Solutions (4%) and Prescription Technology Solutions (1.6%).Story continuesBottom LineWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in McKesson ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in October 2013 would be worth $3,376.73, or a gain of 237.67%, as of October 9, 2023, and this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 gained 154.87% and the price of gold went up 34.57% over the same time frame.Analysts are forecasting more upside for MCK too.So far this year, McKesson has outperformed its industry. McKesson exited the fiscal first quarter on a strong note, beating estimates on both counts. Strong fiscal first-quarter show by three of the four segments is encouraging. A strong earnings outlook for fiscal 2024 instills optimism. Strong adjusted operating profit growth across key segments is encouraging. A strong position in the Distribution market continues to favor the stock. Declining demand for COVID-19-related products and loss of sales due to divesture of European businesses continue to hurt Medical-Surgical Solutions and International segments. Yet, both gross and operating margin contractions are woes. Price fluctuation of generic pharmaceuticals and stiff competition in the MedTech space remain headwinds.The stock is up 5.82% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 3 higher, for fiscal 2023. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

264,ec8eb3b7-9eb7-3201-b91c-df625c3edf3d,CMI,2023-10-10,"Auto Roundup: LAD's Sweetened Bid for Pendragon, Ford's 7th Offer to UAW & More",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/auto-roundup-lads-sweetened-bid-150200594.html,1696863720,STORY,"['F', 'LAD', 'AN', 'TM', 'CMI', 'GM']","[The United Auto Workers (UAW) decided against further strikes at Detroit Three auto plants on Friday, marking the first week without strike expansion since the work stoppages began on Sep 15. This pause in strikes came as talks progressed, and General Motors GM agreed to include battery cell workers in the company's national agreement. GM's Arlington Assembly plant, which manufactures lucrative full-size SUVs, narrowly avoided closure with a last-minute proposal to integrate the automaker's battery cell workers into the national agreement. Also, GM secured a new $6 billion line of credit extending through October 2024. This move is seen as a strategic step to ensure financial stability amid the uncertainty surrounding the strike’s resolution.Early last week, Ford F presented its seventh proposal to the UAW, featuring what the company touts as unmatched compensation and benefits packages. At present, approximately 25,200 workers, accounting for about 17% of UAW members, are on strike.Last week, auto biggies reported third-quarter U.S. vehicle sales numbers. Most automakers experienced year-over-year sales growth thanks to improving inventory levels and a rebound in fleet shipments. Many companies like General Motors, Honda and Toyota among others recorded double-digit percentage gains.  The demand for automobiles has remained strong so far despite high vehicle financing costs. Per GlobalData, the seasonally adjusted annualized sales rate for September 2023 was 15.2-15.5 million vehicles, up from 13.7 million vehicles a year earlier. Per Automotive News, U.S. light vehicle sales in the third quarter of 2023 topped 3.8 million units, up 17% year over year.On the news front, leading engine manufacturer Cummins CMI successfully acquired two Faurecia commercial vehicle manufacturing plants in the United States and Netherlands to enhance its emissions control capabilities and ensure a stable supply of low-emission components.Story continuesThe bidding war for the acquisition of Pendragon, UK’s third-largest automotive dealership group, escalated a notch higher when Lithia Motors LAD announced a 42% increase in its initial acquisition offer for Pendragon. The increased bid was in response to rival propositions from AutoNation and a joint bid from Hedin Mobility Group and Penske Automotive.Last Thursday, General Motors touched a three-year low amid the strike coupled with a looming airbag recall threatening to strain the automaker's finances further.Japan’s auto giant Toyota TM has partnered with LG Energy Solution to procure lithium-ion battery modules for its forthcoming U.S.-assembled electric vehicles (EVs) from 2025, with an annual capacity of 20 GWh. This aligns with Toyota's goal of creating a lineup of 30 BEVs globally by 2030 and marks LG Energy Solution's significant investment in its Michigan facility.Last Week’s Top Stories1. Lithia upped its bidding offer for Pendragon last week. The revised bid from Lithia now totals £397 million, valuing each share for existing Pendragon shareholders at around 35.4 pence. This revision is anticipated to augment the cash dividend payable to Pendragon's shareholders by 49% to 24.5 pence per share, while allowing them to retain roughly 83.3% ownership in Pinewood Tech. Besides, this acquisition paves the way for a rewarding joint venture to proliferate Pinewood's software in the North American market.Currently, the revised offer from Lithia has overshadowed the 32 pence per share bid from the Penske/Hedin alliance and AutoNation, setting the stage for a three-pronged tussle. The deal is expected to be funded with Lithia's existing on-balance sheet capacity, pending approval from Pendragon shareholders. If the deal goes through, it would broaden Lithia’s horizon and diversify its business operations by establishing a formidable presence in the UK market.2. Per Wall Street Journal’s report, at least 20 million General Motors vehicles are fitted with potentially hazardous airbag inflators added to the woes of the U.S. auto giant. The government is recommending recall of the same to avoid fatalities and injuries, possibly leading General Motors to incur significant costs for replacements and repairs.The recall concerns about 52 million airbag inflators supplied by Tennessee-based auto supplier ARC Automotive. So far, GM has recalled approximately 1 million vehicles due to this issue. However, the company contested the NHTSA's findings, stating that the current evidence and data do not necessitate any further recalls beyond what has already been done. Despite this defense, the shadow of a larger recall looms, threatening to impose significant financial and reputational costs on GM.3. Cummins completed its acquisition of two Faurecia commercial vehicle manufacturing plants in the United States and the Netherlands, showing its commitment to low-emission solutions. These facilities have been integrated into Cummins Emission Solutions, bolstering its technical and manufacturing capabilities. The move ensures the continued supply of vital aftertreatment components and assemblies, critical for reducing emissions.This strategic acquisition, financed with €199.2 million from Cummins' cash reserves, strengthens Cummins' position in the commercial vehicle industry. It aligns with the company’s commitment to sustainability and low-emission technology. This move positions Cummins to meet the rising demand for eco-friendly products and ensures continuity for employees and customers.4. Toyota and LG Energy Solution have signed a battery supply agreement, per which the latter will provide lithium-ion battery modules to power Toyota’s battery EVs planned to be assembled in the United States. LG will supply Toyota with 20 GWh of battery modules annually, starting from 2025. The supply will be sufficient for the production of 250,000 electric vehicles (EVs) per year. Per the agreement, the battery modules will consist of high-nickel NCMA (nickel, cobalt, manganese, aluminum) pouch-type cells.LG plans to invest $3 billion in its Holland, MI, plant to set up exclusive battery production lines for Toyota. The line will increase battery module supply to Toyota’s Kentucky plant. In the plant, the battery modules will be assembled into battery packs and used to power EVs in the United States. Tetsuo Ogawa, president and CEO of Toyota Motor North America, said that the battery supply agreement is critical to meeting Toyota’s manufacturing and carbon reduction plans.5. Ford presented its seventh and most robust offer to the union aiming to resolve crucial economic matters. In this offer, Ford has outlined remarkable enhancements in terms of wages, positioning its employees among the top 25% in the United States, encompassing both hourly and salaried positions, while also providing substantial benefits, product commitments for all UAW factories, and a strong commitment to job security. Simultaneously, the proposal ensures Ford's capability to invest and expand its operations. The offer includes a notable wage increase to $21 per hour, a significant 26% raise for temporary workers, and the conversion of all temporary employees with at least three months of service to permanent status upon ratification.Ford currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present.

Senior Media &amp; Internet Analyst, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss Peltz's decision and what this will mean for the future of the company.On the what Peltz could add for investors, Martin says ""we are hitting 10-year lows in these shares, I think Nelson Peltz is going to try to disaggregate and sell off pieces much more aggressively, which will take better care of public share holders in the near term.""For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptAKIKO FUJITA: With these reports, Nelson Peltz is now pushing for additional seats on the Disney board, his Trian fund already one of the largest shareholders. What kind of pressure do you think this now puts on Disney?LAURA MARTIN: Yeah, I think it puts a lot of pressure, because I think Bob Iger, historically, has-- came into a mess when he got here, and he bought Pixar and he bought Star Wars. He bought assets to fix that. And I think for the next step, what we need is to disentangle this conglomerate. And I think Nelson Peltz is going to be good for shareholders because, as you know, Disney just announced they're going to spend $60 billion over 10 years on the parks. And I think Bob Iger's vision is more of a 5 to 10-year vision.And I think with rising interest rates, the discount rate says that shareholders want returns now, or they don't want to be anywhere near the shares. And so, we're hitting 10-year lows in these shares. I think Nelson Peltz is going to try to disaggregate and sell off pieces much more aggressively, which will take better care of public shareholders in the near term.Story continuesAKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, how do you think Disney responds to this pressure? To your point, we have seen the stock recently hit a nine-month low. There are a number of catalysts that analysts, including yourself, have pointed to, that could push the stock to the upside. This particular push, though, for additional board seats, what does that mean in terms of how Disney views its asset?LAURA MARTIN: Well, as you know, Bob Iger at Disney, and actually Bob Chapek too, has had a couple of these activists. And what they do is they typically listen to the guy. They send a letter saying they're going to do that. And then, the activist sells the shares, goes away.So [? third ?] [? point ?] just has a piece. It's scheduled today. It's completely liquidated its Disney position. So that's my guess here.I don't even know if Nelson Peltz has to actually get board seats, or he just has to threaten a war. And then, maybe they listen to him more intently, and they try to execute it on their own time frame. So I think it will be-- he will be heard. And he owns enough that I don't even know if he actually needs to actually get board seats to actually get something done here and make money on his investment.We'll see. But worst case, yeah. You'll have an activist in the boardroom who will be much more short-term focused than anyone currently on the board.]"

Senior Media &amp; Internet Analyst, believes that the NFL has a lucrative opportunity to buy ABC from the media giant.She joins Yahoo Finance to discuss her reasoning as well as the recent news of Nelson Peltz's decision to increase Trian Management's position in Disney.Martin argues the NFL needs ""to take a stronger hand in making sure linear TV survives or they're not going to have alternate bidders in 2032 and they're not going to have team values because the team values come from broadcast TV license fees,"" especially as media conglomerates move further into non-linear streaming.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptAKIKO FUJITA: Laura, let's talk about your note. You certainly got a lot of people talking by calling for the NFL to maybe pursue ABC completely or outright. Walk me through your thesis here.LAURA MARTIN: Sure. So my thesis is that the current NFL contracts are all with like ABC, NBC, Fox, Amazon, and YouTube video are all 2032. So the NFL is sitting around fiddling while Rome burns because they figure, hey, we've got payments through 2032, it's 9 years from now, what's to worry about?And we're making two points. A, in 2032, there's only going to be one bidder for the next set of NFL rights, and that's going to be Amazon because all these other companies will either be too small or too global to care about the NFL because the NFL programming doesn't travel well offshore. So if they're only going to have one bidder, suddenly their team values aren't going to go up from the 4 billion they are today. Past 2032. And in theory, they want a league post 2032.So they need to figure out who they can keep alive to have alternate bidders to have a bidding war in 2032. And that means they need to not kill-- they not they need to not stand by while the linear TV ecosystem dies because NFL is the primary beneficiary of all those payments as is the MLB and the NBA, et cetera. So they need to get more involved when like Disney, Charter are threatening to actually unravel the linear TV ecosystem before 2032. They need to be more involved they need to take a stronger hand in making sure that linear TV survives, or they're not going to have alternate bidders in 2032.Story continuesAnd they're not going to have team values because their team values come from broadcast TV license fees essentially. So that's our one thing. The thing about what CBS found, which was a broadcaster. When it launched CBS All Access and it had access directly into homes, they had a lot more negotiating leverage with their other distributors. My issue is these guys, meaning the NFL should buy ABC and its affiliates, that way it has guaranteed reach forever of 100 million homes, and usually affiliate these broadcasters like ABC have 45% profit margins. So it would give them a different business, a distribution business.Content and distribution are only valuable together. I don't care how good your NFL content is. You can't get it distributed because everyone's gone bankrupt or can't afford your rights. It's worthless. So I'm saying buy your own distribution, backward integrate and distribute to everybody in America.AKIKO FUJITA: From the Disney perspective, certainly looking for the price tag that they can command in any kind of acquisition of ABC. How much negotiating leverage do you think they have as it stands currently?LAURA MARTIN: So they don't have to sell, right? It makes like I said 45% profit margin. So they got a lot of current free cash flow to service their debt. So it would have to sell at a higher multiple than Disney sells at. And Bob Iger said in Aspen, that he wanted to sell the ABC broadcast station. So-- and I think he's wanted to do that for a decade. So I think Bob Iger is perfectly willing to sell the ABC owned and operated stations that Disney owns. And I think the NFL is a buyer that nobody's talking about. I think it's an interesting idea for them.]"

It is worth considering Walt Disney (DIS), which belongs to the Zacks Media Conglomerates industry.When looking at the last two reports, this entertainment company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 4.27%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the last reported quarter, Disney came out with earnings of $1.03 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.99 per share, representing a surprise of 4.04%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.89 per share and it actually produced earnings of $0.93 per share, delivering a surprise of 4.49%.Thanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Disney lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Disney has an Earnings ESP of +9.51% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on November 8, 2023.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

This is a substantial increase from 837 rooftop solar systems connected to the ComEd grid in 2016, reflecting an annual growth rate of 53%. Year to date, ComEd has received a record volume of nearly 15,000 applications to connect solar resources to its grid, and through September, nearly 11,000 systems have been completed, demonstrating the positive impact of climate legislation in Illinois and growing consumer interest in managing energy bills and reducing their carbon footprint with solar energy.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231009144509/en/Rooftop Solar Adoption Accelerating in ComEd Service Territory (Graphic: Business Wire)""We have seen a significant increase in the amount of solar in our service territory due to the passage of the Future Energy Jobs Act in 2016, and it will continue to grow with the implementation of the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA) over the next several years,"" said Scott Vogt, vice president of Strategy and Energy Policy at ComEd. ""The clean energy transition is well underway, and ComEd is making the necessary investments to ensure continued reliability as additional clean energy resources like solar panels come onto our system.""More than 1,300 commercial and industrial customers have connected solar systems to the ComEd grid, representing an annual growth rate of 20%. Additionally, more than 900 megawatts (MW) of DER have been connected to the system, and ComEd expects that will increase to over 1,900 MW by 2025 and to more than 3,600 MW by 2030, or enough energy to power approximately 120,000 US homes for one year.Story continuesFor customers with overly shady roofs or who rent or live in a multi-family dwelling, community solar may be a better option than private residential solar panels. Community solar participants subscribe to a large solar energy project owned by an independent developer and earn credits on their monthly ComEd bills for their portion of the electricity produced by the project. The first community solar project in Illinois was completed in 2019 and there are now 87 projects in service in the ComEd region, resulting in an 18% annual growth rate. By the end of this year, ComEd expects to have about 100 community solar projects on its system serving a total of 25,000 customers.ComEd recently introduced new enhancements to its rooftop solar calculator to make it easier for customers to learn more about costs, benefits, and savings. The calculator also provides information on a rebate program that is newly available to residential customers through CEJA. It offers a rebate of $300 per kilowatt for an eligible distributed generation facility, such as rooftop solar, and a rebate of $300 per kilowatt hour for an associated energy storage device. Customers can compare their potential payback with and without incorporating the rebate, enabling them to see how it would impact their estimated payback period. Customers can print out their personalized solar energy system estimate for use when negotiating with solar contractors about the purchase and installation of solar panels. ComEd also has launched a new community solar calculator, which provides estimated savings based on a customer’s current energy usage.The rooftop and community solar calculators also provide information on customer assistance programs, including Illinois Solar for All, which helps customers who may qualify for more affordable solar installation or community solar subscriptions through state incentives. CEJA, which was enacted in 2021, increases funding for Illinois Solar for All from $30 million to $70 million annually.In addition to solar resources, DER technologies also include assets that can help balance and control demand on the grid, such as battery storage and batteries in electric vehicles used to export power back to the grid.The multi-year grid and rate plans ComEd filed with the Illinois Commerce Commission earlier this year outline the proposed investments required to support this rapid expansion of renewable energy and help ensure equitable access to the benefits of clean energy under CEJA. The plans align with ComEd 2030, the company's recently announced vision for a carbon-free energy future that will benefit all communities and meet customers' changing needs for the rest of this decade and beyond.###About ComEdComEd is a unit of Chicago-based Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ: EXC), a Fortune 250 energy company with approximately 10 million electricity and natural gas customers – the largest number of customers in the U.S. ComEd powers the lives of more than 4 million customers across northern Illinois, or 70 percent of the state’s population.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Right now, Chegg is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while F5 Networks has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that CHGG has an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.CHGG currently has a forward P/E ratio of 7.93, while FFIV has a forward P/E of 12.41. We also note that CHGG has a PEG ratio of 0.65. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. FFIV currently has a PEG ratio of 1.22.Another notable valuation metric for CHGG is its P/B ratio of 0.97. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities.

The priority in Washington was an informal détente with Tehran so as to allow the world more oil supply in the advent of OPEC+ production cuts.As a result, Iranian crude output is estimated to have surged nearly 700,000 barrels a day this year – the second-largest source of incremental supply in 2023, behind only US shale oil.Now, as reprisal for Tehran’s involvement, the United States could turn its full attention again towards enforcing the sanctions on Iran and that would be positive for crude prices, analysts said.But as of Tuesday, there was no word yet of a clampdown on Iranian oil.“Crude prices are lower as profit-taking settled in after it was clear a fresh catalyst was needed to take prices above the $90 a barrel level,” said Ed Moya, analyst at online trading platform OANDA. “Energy traders will have lots of time to assess how the Israel-Hamas conflict impacts Saudi production, if Iranian crude will face sanctions, and if other OPEC+ members will pick up their production levels.”Story continuesEnergy analysts at ING had a similar view.""There is still plenty of uncertainty across markets following the attacks in Israel over the weekend,"" said ING analysts, in a note.""If reports of Iran's involvement turn out to be true, this would provide another boost to prices, as we would expect to see the U.S. enforcing oil sanctions against Iran more strictly. That would further tighten an already tight market.""There should be no “free lunch” helping oil rallyIt was also important to put the brakes on any oil rally to prevent the market from getting ahead of itself again, like it did in the third quarter — in spite of concerns about global inflation and stagnating European growth, said John Kilduff, a partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital.Crude prices rose almost 30% between July and September, reaching more than one-year highs that took WTI above $95 and Brent to over $97.“It’s alright to assign some geopolitical risk to oil in situations like this, but not to the extent that the geopolitical risk itself becomes a free lunch for the trade,” said Kilduff. “As of now, there’s no proof that there’ll be a meaningful reduction in barrels because of this war alone and that includes any clampdown on oil exports from Iran, which is a supporter of all things Hamas. Until and unless we get evidence of that, crude prices should not trade much higher than where they did last week.”OPEC+ vows that cuts will continueThe downside in crude prices was, meanwhile, limited by Saudi Energy Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman’s pledge that output cuts by oil producers in the global alliance known as OPEC+ will continue.The Saudis and Russians, who jointly lead the OPEC+, are withholding a daily supply of 1.3 million barrels between them, while the rest of the 23-nation alliance is contributing to a squeeze of another 2 million barrels or more.“I honestly believe that the best thing I could say is that the cohesion of OPEC+ should not be challenged,” Abdulaziz said on the sidelines of a climate conference in Riyadh. “We’ve been through the worst, I don’t think we will have to go through any terrible situation at all,”“Yes, we may be delayed with a decision on what to do, but I would not forfeit the precautionary approach, even if it goes beyond a month or two, or three or four months, or five months,” he added.(Peter Nurse contributed to this article)Related ArticlesOil dips on reality check over Mideast war impact; Iranian supply unimpairedCrude futures settle down on fewer worries of supply disruptionsGold eases as risk appetite improves, traders eye more Fed cues]"

Devon Energy (DVN), which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This oil and gas exploration company has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 2.95%.For the last reported quarter, Devon Energy came out with earnings of $1.18 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.17 per share, representing a surprise of 0.85%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.39 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.46 per share, delivering a surprise of 5.04%.For Devon Energy, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Devon Energy has an Earnings ESP of +2.19% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on November 7, 2023.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Brandywine Realty Trust (BDN) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.29 a share 15 days away from its upcoming earnings release on October 24, 2023.By taking the percentage difference between the $0.29 Most Accurate Estimate and the $0.28 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Brandywine Realty Trust has an Earnings ESP of 0.35%.BDN is part of a big group of Finance stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Prologis (PLD) as well.Slated to report earnings on October 17, 2023, Prologis holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $1.26 a share eight days from its next quarterly update.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Prologis is $1.26, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 0.18%.Story continuesBDN and PLD's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

The move was backed by solid volume with far more shares changing hands than in a normal session. This compares to the stock's 23.7% loss over the past four weeks.Overstock.com extended its rally, driven by the latest investment by its Director, Marcus Lemonis who purchased 31,800 shares of the company at $15.67 per share. This indicates insider’s confidence in the company’s future performance and prospects.This online discount retailer is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.60 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -561.5%. Revenues are expected to be $391.87 million, down 14.9% from the year-ago quarter.Earnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.For Overstock, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 60.9% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. And a negative trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't usually translate into price appreciation. So, make sure to keep an eye on OSTK going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road.The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

300,f2f93a9d-6199-3323-b4f6-248e19b47b7c,NWL,2023-10-10,Retail Resilience: 7 Consumer Goods Stocks to Buy to Weather the Storm,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/retail-resilience-7-consumer-goods-001439960.html,1696378479,STORY,"['KHC', 'PG', 'MDLZ', 'NWL']","[Although investors have enjoyed another strong season of returns in the equities market, it may be time to consider more reliable consumer goods stocks to buy. Primarily, the sentiment pivot on Wall Street suggests that surviving an onslaught – rather than thriving amid tailwinds – may be the name of the game.Naturally, the first clue stems from the S&amp;P 500 index. Up until the end of July, circumstances appear quite robust for the benchmark gauge of market health. However, since the aforementioned date, the index slipped rather heavily. And circumstances have been rough recently, with the index printing much red ink in the trailing month.Fundamentally, the second clue comes from outside economic factors. While the Federal Reserve made some progress in facilitating a disinflationary trend, consumer prices remain stubbornly high. Also, with more interest rate hikes not out of the question, mass layoffs may materialize. Of course, such a circumstance would not bode well for growth-oriented enterprises. Therefore, arguably most signs point to cynical relevancies brewing for boring but reliable companies. With that, below are consumer goods stocks to add to your portfolio.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsConsumer Goods Stocks: Procter &amp; Gamble (PG)Procter &amp; Gamble Union Distribution Center. P&amp;G is an American Multinational Consumer Goods CompanySource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comA multinational giant and one of the most recognizable names among consumer goods stocks, Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) needs no introduction. Generally, P&amp;G makes a solid case for retirement-based portfolios. It offers a consistent, relatively predictable business with consistent profitability. Should a recession materialize, the company should be a top idea to consider.On the financials, P&amp;G prints a three-year revenue growth rate of 6.9%, better than 51.55% of other consumer goods stocks. That’s really nothing special. However, here’s the main takeaway: the enterprise’s net margin clocks in at 17.87%, above 92.73% of the competition. It has posted net income over at least the past 10 years, making it a reliable investment.Story continuesRegarding passive income, P&amp;G prints a forward yield of 2.58%. While not especially remarkable, the company has a track record of 68 years of consecutive dividend increases.Finally, analysts rate PG a consensus moderate buy with a $169.50 price target, implying over 16% upside potential.Colgate-Palmolive (CL)Colgate toothpaste and mouthwash in a cup with a toothbrushSource: monticello / Shutterstock.comAnother name among consumer goods stocks that requires no introduction, Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) offers a promising framework. Essentially, the company cynically provides a trade-down effect from going to the dentist. Let me just clarify that I’m not a health professional and you should always abide by their guidance regarding your wellbeing. Still, skipping out on certain procedures has long been a reality.As an op-ed from The Washington Post revealed, people skipped out on going to the dentist during the Covid-19 pandemic. To be fair, that was for understandable public health concerns. Nevertheless, an economic pressure point can yield similar results. Therefore, CL could move higher based on this rather dubious narrative.On the more pleasant side, Colgate offers a forward yield of 2.7%. Further, the payout ratio is reasonable at 55.5%. Also, the company has a history of 61 years of consecutive dividend increases. Lastly, analysts peg CL as a moderate buy with an $84.70 target, implying over 19% growth.Consumer Goods Stocks: Kraft Heinz (KHC)Heinz (KHC) ketchup bottle about to squeeze out ketchupSource: SSokolov / Shutterstock.comA multinational food company, Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) makes an enticing case for consumer goods stocks to buy. For one thing, it’s one of the holdings of legendary investor Warren Buffett via his Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) conglomerate. I’m not saying that the Oracle of Omaha is the end-all, be-all of deciding what to buy. Still, it’s a nice confidence booster.Fundamentally, the other factor that drives Kraft Heinz is the aforementioned trade-down effect. Increasingly, if economic pressures build, people will stop going out to restaurants to eat. Instead, they’ll head over to their local grocery stores more often. Thanks to metrics like economies of scale and other competitive advantages, Kraft Heinz has a chance to attract these dollars.Enticingly, Kraft Heinz offers a forward yield of 4.76%. That’s well above the average for consumer goods stocks at 1.89%. As well, the payout ratio is reasonable at 53.57%. To close, analysts peg KHC as a moderate buy with a $40.13 target, implying over 19% upside.Mondelez (MDLZ)The Mondelez website magnified by a magnifying glassSource: ShutterstockA multinational confectionery, food, and beverage company, Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ) symbolizes an intriguing idea for consumer goods stocks to buy. As stated before, Mondelez – as a food and snack manufacturer – should benefit from the trade-down effect. Basically, fewer people will likely go to eateries to feed themselves. Instead, they’ll spend more dollars at grocery stores.In fairness, I must admit that Mondelez’s three-year revenue growth rate of 8.6% isn’t all that impressive. Per investment data aggregator Gurufocus, that’s ranked better than only 57.2% of its peers. However, should economic conditions worsen, I expect the top line to expand due to financial realities.Another reason to stay with MDLZ is its forward yield of 2.45%. While it’s not dramatically high, the payout did increase recently. Also, the payout ratio sits at 48.06%, providing confidence in terms of yield sustainability. Also, analysts peg shares as a consensus strong buy with an $83.18 target, implying nearly 20% upside.Consumer Goods Stocks: Coty (COTY)The Coty (COTY) logo on a glass office in Poland.Source: Konektus Photo / Shutterstock.comOne of the riskiest ideas among consumer goods stocks, investors will need high conviction with Coty (NYSE:COTY). A beauty care specialist, Coty in my opinion offers a fundamentally relevant business. So far, the print agrees with me. Since the beginning of the year, shares gained about 25%. However, over the past six months, COTY has been conspicuously muted.As a premium beauty care company, one could make the argument that Coty is not necessary. Thus, Coty could suffer from the trade-down effect, not benefit from it. At the same time, the enterprise’s core customers recognize how important the products are for holistic well-being. Further, the push among many companies to return to the office may lift COTY.Let’s face reality here – companies aren’t necessarily their employees’ friends. Instead, they’re trying to get work done. And if mandates are required, folks have to return to the office or face heavy consequences. Therefore, I like COTY on the cynicism, even if it doesn’t pay a dividend right now. To make up for it, analysts rate shares a moderate buy with a $13.33 price target, implying almost 22% upside.Coca-Cola (KO)KO stock PEP stock: a can of Coca-cola and a can of Pepsi on either side of a glass of brown soda and sitting on top of a pile of iceSource: monticello / ShutterstockAn easy choice among consumer goods stocks to buy in my opinion, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) makes plenty of sense. Yes, it’s one of Warren Buffett’s favorite holdings – and favorite products to consumers – but that’s not where I’m going. Rather, as society gradually normalizes (especially in the workplace as mentioned above), the search for caffeine will be intense.Scratch that, the search for cheap caffeine will be intense, which is why Coca-Cola is so compelling. Yes, both consumers and worker bees can get their favorite lattes at a certain coffee shop that will not be mentioned. However, with inflation remaining stubbornly high, shopping at the coffee shop that shall not be named is getting incredibly expensive.At some point, I believe folks will start conducting a serious cost-benefit analysis. Even if you can afford the luxury of caffeine, it just doesn’t seem worth it. Therefore, I’m digging KO, especially with its 3.29% forward yield and 62 years of consecutive dividend increases. Lastly, analysts peg KO as a strong buy with a $70.91 target, implying almost 27% growth.Newell Brands (NWL)A photo of a sign showing the Newell Brands (NWL) logo outside a building.Source: JHVEPhoto/Shutterstock.comAn American manufacturer, marketer, and distributor of consumer and commercial products, Newell Brands (NASDAQ:NWL) offers an interesting case for consumer goods stocks. Per its public profile, Newell brands and products include Rubbermaid storage and trash containers, Contigo and Bubba water bottles, and Coleman outdoor products. It even offers writing instruments, children’s products, and cookware.Basically, whatever you need, Newell has. And that’s going to be particularly important as consumers ditch premium-level services and begin shopping for their own needs; for example, shopping for food products and accessories rather than ordering takeout. With Newell offering a wide range of critical consumer products, it should see a relevance boost.Just as well, Newell offers a forward yield of 3.1%, which is notably higher than the underlying sector average. Also, the payout ratio sits at 25.97%, providing confidence regarding yield sustainability. Finally, analysts rate NWL a moderate buy with a $12.89 target, implying nearly 43% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with C. Click here to check it out. UPS 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of UPSAs of 2023-10-09, United Parcel Service Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $277.35. It's currently trading at a price of $154.27. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is 44.38%. The company is significantly undervalued.Beyond Market Price: Uncovering United Parcel Service Inc's Intrinsic ValueThe modelThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. United Parcel Service Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.AssumptionsTermValueExplanationEPS without NRI$11.53GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.Discount Rate11%An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.8%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.Growth StageGrowth rate (g1) = 16.10% Years of Growth Stage = 10We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.Terminal StageGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.CalculationGrowth Stage=EPS without NRI*[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)*(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=148.85Terminal Stage=EPS without NRI*(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10*[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)+(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=128.5Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)=Growth Stage+Terminal Stage=277.35Discounted Free Cash Flow ModelGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $223.75. This valuation indicates that the United Parcel Service Inc is significantly undervalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of 31.05%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.Story continuesThe Bottom LinePlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation.  Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:Future Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.Navigating with GuruFocus:Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

However, macroeconomic headwinds continue to affect the stock. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).ResMed continues to see robust demand for its market-leading mask portfolio despite being faced with challenges related to lower new patient setups from a competitor recall. Continued product development is driving growth within this business globally. The company successfully introduced a full suite of masks in AirFit, AirTouch and other ranges. Further, to promote greater patient adherence, ResMed offers advanced and expanded integrations of its therapy-based software solutions, including AirView.ResMed’s increased device sales continue to drive overall revenue growth, reflecting the ongoing combined availability of AirSense 10 and AirSense 11 sleep devices to support strong underlying global demand. The company has consistently witnessed strong sales within this business since fiscal 2021 with the launch of its new platform of connected CPAP and APAP devices, AirSense 11, which now comes with features such as a touch screen, algorithms for patients new to therapy and digital enhancements, such as over-the-air update capabilities.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchResMed’s respiratory care business continues to drive growth and the adoption of bilevel and other non-invasive ventilator solutions worldwide. The company is investing in newer-to-market technologies for patients, including home-based high-flow therapy (“HFT”) for treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD at home.Although still early for market development, ResMed continues to generate clinical evidence and economic outcomes to support the broader adoption of these technology innovations for treating lung disease at home. Investing in these opportunities enables the company to address COPD, one of the top global diseases for hospitalization and the principal cause of re-hospitalization in the United States.Story continuesOn the flip side, the company’s high debt level remains a concern. As of Jun 30, 2023, long-term debt was $1.43 billion, while the cash and cash equivalents balance was only $228 million. A higher debt level induces higher interest payments, which come along with the risk of failure to pay the same. At the end of fiscal 2023, the company had a times interest earned ratio of 24.3%, sequentially lower than the fiscal third quarter’s 29%.Global macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, supply chain disruptions and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and volatility in capital markets could continue to adversely impact ResMed’s results of operations.  Decline in the global economic environment may reduce demand for the company’s products, resulting in lower sales, lower product prices and reduced reimbursement rates by third-party payers, while increasing the cost of operating the business.These factors have affected ResMed’s supply chain operations globally, as evident from the constraints on raw materials and electronic components. Furthermore, with the sustained inflationary pressures in the future, the company may struggle to keep in check its operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues. We are worried that this might dent ResMed’s profitability.Shares of ResMed have plunged 33.1% over the past year compared with 2.5% decline of the industry.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are DaVita Inc. DVA, Quanterix QTRX and Align Technology ALGN, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).DaVita has an estimated long-term growth rate of 12.7%.

The company has also been reaping benefits from its proactive pricing strategies.These upsides have been helping this snack food and beverage products company stay resilient amid cost-related headwinds. Mondelez expects organic net revenue growth of more than 12% for 2023, wherein it envisions adjusted earnings per share growth of more than 12% on a constant-currency basis.The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has rallied 16.6% in the past year against the industry’s decline of 8.2%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat’s Backing MDLZ?Mondelez has consistently shown dedication to expanding its business through acquisitions. The acquisition of Ricolino (completed in the third quarter of 2023) is expected to double the size of MDLZ's Mexican operations, and the purchase of Clif Bar (in August 2022) has bolstered the company's market presence. These acquisitions made meaningful contributions to net revenues in the second quarter of 2023. Additionally, the integration of Chipita S.A. and Grenade (in 2022) underscores Mondelez's commitment to expanding its product offerings. The company's acquisition spree, further underlined by Gourmet Food Holdings and Hu Master Holdings, has diversified its portfolio and enhanced its distribution capabilities.On the other hand, Mondelez is committed to increasing focus on areas with higher growth potential through meaningful divestitures. On Oct 2, the company concluded the divestiture of its developed-market gum business in the United States, Canada and Europe (excluding Portugal) to Perfetti Van Melle Group. The divestiture marks another step toward MDLZ’s commitment to strengthening its core categories, including chocolates, biscuits and baked snacks.The company’s core categories — chocolates and biscuits — have historically depicted resilience to economic downturns and pricing actions. Consumers in developed countries consider chocolates and biscuits as affordable indulgences and one of the most-valued snacking products.Both these categories registered double-digit growth in the second quarter. Management is focused on expanding these categories and expects solid volume momentum for both these categories as it moves forward in 2023. In fact, Mondelez aims to generate 90% of its revenues from these core categories.Story continuesAddressing Cost ChallengesMondelez has been contending with cost inflation. In the second quarter of 2023, the adjusted gross profit margin contracted by 50 basis points (bps) to 37.5% due to increased raw material and transportation costs. Furthermore, inflated input costs partially impacted the adjusted operating income margin. In its second-quarter 2023 earnings release, Mondelez stated that it still expects a double-digit increase in inflation stemming from the continued elevated cost of packaging, ingredients and labor.Nonetheless, Mondelez’s hands-on pricing strategies have been helping it counter these challenges. The favorable outcomes of these initiatives were evident in the organic net revenue growth achieved in the second quarter of 2023. During the quarter, the top and bottom lines increased year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Mondelez's strategic expansion efforts, coupled with its commitment to core snacking categories and cost-control measures, position the company strongly for consistent growth in a dynamic business environment.3 Other PicksCelsius Holdings CELH, which offers functional drinks and liquid supplements, currently flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores.

The company's Altman Z-Score is just 2.03, which is below the safe threshold of 2.99. Although this does not imply immediate danger of financial distress, the stock may face some financial struggles if the Altman Z-score drops below 1.81. Additionally, the company's low cash-to-debt ratio at 0.02 indicates a struggle in handling existing debt levels.ConclusionGiven the company's financial strength, profitability, and growth metrics, the GF Score highlights the firm's unparalleled position for potential underperformance. While Occidental Petroleum Corp has a rich history in the Oil &amp; Gas industry, its current financial indicators suggest that it may struggle to maintain its past performance.

Tematica Research CIO Chris Versace joins Yahoo Finance Live to make sense of the market's reaction.The Israel-Hamas conflict is “another layer of uncertainty that the market’s dealing with,” Versace says, listing off multiple labor strike movements, the economic narrative behind the Fed's next interest rate move, and upcoming CPI and PPI data prints as other market-moving events. “[There's] a lot of uncertainty coming into this week, but even more so as we start the week off,” Versace notes.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Defense stocks on the rise amid the deadly conflict between Israel and Hamas. Now shares of Lockheed Martin and RTX among the names in the green ahead of the open. Overseas, Europe's defense stocks are among the best performers on the day. And energy stocks are also higher as crude prices spike.Here to talk about that and more, we want to bring in Chris Versace. He is Tematica's research chief investment officer. Chris, it's great to see you. So first, let's just talk about the rise in geopolitical tensions right now. The threat that this potentially poses to the market. How are you assessing this risk?CHRIS VERSACE: Well, clearly it's an evolving risk. Details over the weekend I think caught some folks understandably by surprise. And we're watching the developments. But I think we got to step back a little bit because this is really just another layer of uncertainty that the market's dealing with.Obviously here at home, we've got the extended UAW strike. We've got the strike that's going on in Las Vegas. We're hearing reports, we're going to see additional strikes perhaps from Walgreens employees. There's the big uncertainty about what the Fed is going to do. And we've got some big economic reports coming out this week-- CPI, PPI, and about a dozen Fed speakers.Story continuesSo when you come into today, what we saw unfold over the weekend is another reason that we're going to see the market start a somewhat shortened week, if you will, given today's holiday, in a risk off mode. And I think that explains exactly why we're seeing folks flock to the dollar, why treasuries are going higher, and subsequently the market's selling off. Again, just a lot of uncertainty coming into this week. But even more so as we start the week off.BRAD SMITH: Chris, when we talked about some of those top exports that come out of Israel and the importance there in terms of the international business community, when you think about what investors might look towards to try and figure out or get a gauge on how isolated this is and to what extent as well it may play out, what could investors look towards?CHRIS VERSACE: Well, I think the comment that was made earlier about this likely to take some degree of time is spot on. And as a result, I think one of the biggest markets that we're going to have to watch is oil. It is trending higher.Remember we had renewed concerns as we move towards the end of the year that if China's economy actually starts to pick up, that we might see some supply constraints. This could obviously not-- I won't say impact it. But it could obviously make it even worse. So we could see oil prices move even higher over the near to medium term.In terms of some of the other end markets that you talked about, Brad, you were talking about chips, particularly for autonomous driving, that sort of thing. It is going to be something to watch. I think the big question is, how long does this really go on for? Typically, when we're tracking the larger global economy, the four horsemen that we tend to watch are going to be the US, China, the eurozone, and Japan. So seeing how this impacts their imports, their exports will probably be the first sign that'll tell us what the real impact is going to be.]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of the global alcohol industry, the new RTDs in the market, and the comeback of flavored vodka, and go directly to 10 Best Alcoholic Drinks that Don’t Taste Like Alcohol. Alcohol occupies such a central place in the human experience that Galileo Galilei, the father of modern science, once compared wine to sunlight itself. Since booze has been a part of human history for thousands of years, it has always been in a constant state of change, trying to keep up with the evolving tastes of its consumers. Adding a hint of flavor has always been the norm, and even the Greeks flavored their beloved wine with everything from honey to seawater. From beer spiked with intoxicants such as henbane to wine infused with rosemary, it’s fair to say that the desire both to enhance the mood-altering effects of alcohol and to improve the taste of an indifferent raw product have been with mankind for millennia. The Global Alcohol Industry:In 2019, the global alcohol consumption, measured in liters of pure alcohol per person of 15 years of age or older, was 5.5 liters, which is a 4.7% relative decrease from 5.7 liters in 2010.  As we mentioned in our article – 25 Largest Alcohol Companies in the World in 2023 – the global alcoholic beverages market size was valued at $1.62 trillion in 2021, and the market is projected to reach $2 trillion by 2031, with a CAGR of 2.2% during the forecast period. The market is likely to be driven by the increasing global young-adult demographic, coupled with high disposable income and consumer demand for premium/super-premium products. Globally, beer drives the market for alcoholic beverages. Regionally, North America and Asia-Pacific are expected to dominate the market during the forecast period.New RTDs in the Market: Ready-to-drink beverages continue to make headlines as the fastest-growing alcohol beverage category. RTDs’ strong growth has been driven by many factors – including consumer’s taste trends and desire for high-quality, portable cocktails, as well as flavor innovation. Story continuesA great example of the best store bought alcoholic drinks that don’t taste like alcohol is the good ol’ Jack &amp; Coke. Although the beloved cocktail has been a quintessential serve at every bar for a long time, it is now also available in the form of a pre-mixed, canned RTD – courtesy of a joint venture between the Brown-Forman Corporation (NYSE:BF-B) and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO). Jack Daniel’s and Coca-Cola RTD made its U.S. debut in March this year in 12-oz. cans (7% ABV), and Jack Daniel’s and Coca-Cola Zero Sugar also became available in May. Brown-Forman Corporation (NYSE:BF-B) and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) took a test-and-learn-approach for the initial launch, applying lessons from a single-country rollout in Mexico to a global scaling strategy, bringing the product to 13 countries in 12 months. Stocks of Brown-Forman Corporation (NYSE:BF-B) were held by 30 hedge funds at the end of Q2 in the Insider Monkey database, with Fundsmith LLP holding the largest stake of over 12.19 million shares, valued at $814.41 million. Both the Brown-Forman Corporation (NYSE:BF-B) and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) rank among the Largest Beverage Companies in the World in 2023. Another classic cocktail that recently got its own RTD version is the iconic Strawberry Daiquiri. Earlier this year, the Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO)-owned Captain Morgan rum brand introduced Captain Morgan Strawberry Daiquiri pre-mix can to its ready-to-drink portfolio. This smooth cocktail mixes the brand’s Spiced Caribbean Rum with sweet ripe strawberries, juicy lime, and rich notes of vanilla and rum spice. Tapping into the burgeoning pre-mix RTD category, which has grown 16.7% in value over the last year, the new Captain Morgan Strawberry Daiquiri pre-mix is one of the best canned alcoholic drinks that don’t taste like alcohol. Warren Buffett initiated a position in Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) in the first quarter of 2023 with 227,750 shares worth $39.510 million and his position in the company remained unchanged in the second quarter. In Q2, the spirits giant represented 0.1% of Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio.  Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) sits among the Best Alcohol Stocks to Own According to Hedge Funds. The Comeback of Flavored Vodka: A quick scan of any retailer’s shelves reveals how important flavors are to the modern spirits market. You’ll see rows upon rows of vodkas, rums, whiskeys and brandies, made with every conceivable flavor.The vodka industry has also gained some much-needed traction through the recent reincarnation of flavored vodkas. Gone are the days of the overly sweet artificial flavors and cheap plastic bottles -- we are currently going through a flavored vodka renaissance where brands are reimagining the category with high-quality bottles and natural botanicals and extracts -- that expand the drink’s flavored expressions from subtle to overt. Many flavored vodka brands are also moving towards making spirits that are lower in sugar and alcohol than other flavored alcoholic beverages, thus making them popular among the modern health-conscious consumers. Flavored vodka also typically costs less than premium vodka, making it an attractive pocket friendly option. The flavored vodka segment represented 21.85% of the total vodka market share in the U.S. in 2021. Owned by Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ), SVEDKA is a popular flavored vodka brand that is a great choice for mixing cocktails. Its smooth and clear taste makes it a versatile base for classic and modern cocktails alike. Plus, its affordable price point makes it a great option for home bartenders on a budget. SVEDKA was acquired by Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ) in 2007 in a deal worth $384 million. The alcohol company made headlines this summer when its Mexican beer brand, Modelo Especial, became the Top-Selling Beer in America after dethroning Bud Light. Stocks of Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ) were held by 48 out of 910 hedge funds in the Insider Monkey database at the end of the company’s Q2, with Holocene Advisors holding the largest stake of 796,935 shares, valued at $196.15 million. With that said, here are the Best Easy Drinks that Don’t Taste Like Alcohol. 29 Best Alcoholic Drinks that Don’t Taste Like AlcoholMethodology:To collect data for this article, we have referred to a number of sources, such as Liquor Laboratory, BuzzFeed, and various subreddits on Reddit, looking for the Best Tasting Alcoholic Drinks that Don’t Taste Like Alcohol.

However, macroeconomic headwinds continue to affect the stock. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).ResMed continues to see robust demand for its market-leading mask portfolio despite being faced with challenges related to lower new patient setups from a competitor recall. Continued product development is driving growth within this business globally. The company successfully introduced a full suite of masks in AirFit, AirTouch and other ranges. Further, to promote greater patient adherence, ResMed offers advanced and expanded integrations of its therapy-based software solutions, including AirView.ResMed’s increased device sales continue to drive overall revenue growth, reflecting the ongoing combined availability of AirSense 10 and AirSense 11 sleep devices to support strong underlying global demand. The company has consistently witnessed strong sales within this business since fiscal 2021 with the launch of its new platform of connected CPAP and APAP devices, AirSense 11, which now comes with features such as a touch screen, algorithms for patients new to therapy and digital enhancements, such as over-the-air update capabilities.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchResMed’s respiratory care business continues to drive growth and the adoption of bilevel and other non-invasive ventilator solutions worldwide. The company is investing in newer-to-market technologies for patients, including home-based high-flow therapy (“HFT”) for treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD at home.Although still early for market development, ResMed continues to generate clinical evidence and economic outcomes to support the broader adoption of these technology innovations for treating lung disease at home. Investing in these opportunities enables the company to address COPD, one of the top global diseases for hospitalization and the principal cause of re-hospitalization in the United States.Story continuesOn the flip side, the company’s high debt level remains a concern. As of Jun 30, 2023, long-term debt was $1.43 billion, while the cash and cash equivalents balance was only $228 million. A higher debt level induces higher interest payments, which come along with the risk of failure to pay the same. At the end of fiscal 2023, the company had a times interest earned ratio of 24.3%, sequentially lower than the fiscal third quarter’s 29%.Global macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, supply chain disruptions and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and volatility in capital markets could continue to adversely impact ResMed’s results of operations.  Decline in the global economic environment may reduce demand for the company’s products, resulting in lower sales, lower product prices and reduced reimbursement rates by third-party payers, while increasing the cost of operating the business.These factors have affected ResMed’s supply chain operations globally, as evident from the constraints on raw materials and electronic components. Furthermore, with the sustained inflationary pressures in the future, the company may struggle to keep in check its operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues. We are worried that this might dent ResMed’s profitability.Shares of ResMed have plunged 33.1% over the past year compared with 2.5% decline of the industry.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are DaVita Inc. DVA, Quanterix QTRX and Align Technology ALGN, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).DaVita has an estimated long-term growth rate of 12.7%.

INGN is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its high prospects in the portable oxygen concentrator (POC) space. The optimism led by solid second-quarter 2023 and a strong product portfolio also looks promising. However, issues like stiff competition and macroeconomic concerns are major downsides.Over the past year, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 77.5% against the 1.8% rise of the industry and 19.7% growth of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned provider of POCs has a market capitalization of $111.1 million. The company projects 7.2% growth for 2024 and expects to witness continued improvements in its business. Inogen surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, delivering an earnings surprise of 28.4%, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.High Prospects in the POC Space: We are optimistic about the POCs’ superiority over conventional oxygen therapy (known as the delivery model). Inogen primarily develops, manufactures and markets innovative POCs to deliver supplemental long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) to patients suffering from chronic respiratory conditions. Inogen’s proprietary Inogen One and Inogen Rove systems concentrate the air around the patient to offer a source of supplemental oxygen anytime, anywhere, with a battery that can be plugged into an outlet.Product Portfolio: We are optimistic about Inogen’s expanding product portfolio. The company completed the acquisition of Physio-Assist SAS in September. Following the close of the transaction, it owns Physio-Assist and will now market the Simeox device outside of the United States.Inogen launched the Rove 6, its latest POC, in December 2022. It has also received the FDA’s 510(k) clearance for the Rove 4 that will be launched in 2023.Strong Q2 Results: Inogen’s robust year-over-year uptick in overall, as well as rental and domestic business-to-business sales in second-quarter 2023, buoy optimism.Story continuesDownsidesStiff Competition: The LTOT market is a highly competitive industry. Inogen competes with several manufacturers and distributors of POC and providers of other LTOT solutions, such as home delivery of oxygen tanks or cylinders. Given the relatively straightforward regulatory path in the oxygen therapy device manufacturing market, Inogen expects that the industry will become increasingly competitive in the future.Macroeconomic Concerns: Public health outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics of contagious or infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, may significantly disrupt Inogen’s business. Business disruptions could include temporary closures of Inogen’s facilities or the facilities of its contractors, suppliers and other partners. Inogen’s business could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy and the global financial markets.Estimate TrendInogen has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. Over the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its loss per share has narrowed from $2.41 to $2.35.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $80.9 million, suggesting a 23.3% decline from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are DaVita Inc.

The company's recent announcement to expedite the development of enVVe is a significant milestone in this regard as currently millions of patients worldwide are battling chronic venous insufficiency (CVI).Severe CVI is a debilitating disease that primarily occurs when valves inside the veins of the leg fail, causing blood to flow in the wrong direction (reflux) and increased pressure within the veins of the leg. Symptoms of severe CVI include leg swelling, pain, edema and recurrent open sores known as venous ulcers. There are currently no effective treatments for severe CVI of the deep vein system caused by valvular incompetence.More on enVVeenVVe is a non-surgical, replacement venous valve, made from specially formulated biocompatible nickel and titanium alloy, which self-expands once deployed, and has a delivery profile of only 13 Fr when crimped. It is delivered via a minimally invasive procedure requiring no general anesthesia or overnight hospital stay. This valve is designed to accommodate the natural dilation and contraction of the vein and will be available in three sizes to ensure a proper fit across a broad range of vein sizes.According to the company, leveraging insights from VenoValve, the company’s successful pre-clinical testing for enVVe coupled with FDA feedback, enVVeno is poised to be a leading player in both surgical and non-surgical replacement venous valves. enVVeno noted that its strong capital position is now sufficient to begin the enVVe pivotal study.Consequently, the company has decided to expedite enVVe’s development and immediately begin preparations for the enVVe pivotal trial.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn a recent release, enVVeno announced completion of enrollment for the SAVVE U.S. pivotal trial for the VenoValve, with top-line safety data expected in the fourth quarter of 2023. The top-line efficacy data is expected in the second quarter of 2024. enVVeno expects to have sufficient data to be eligible to file a PMA seeking FDA approval for VenoValve in the third quarter of 2024.Story continuesMarket ProspectsGoing by a 2022 Bloomberg report, the global venous disease treatment market was valued at $5.9 billion in 2021 and is expected to exhibit a CAGR of 6.8% from 2022 to 2031. By 2031, the market for varicose vein treatment alone is projected to exceed $ 11.3 billion.Several factors are fueling this growth, including an aging global population, advancements in treatment technologies and the rise of specialized medical fields that require more venous therapy. Furthermore, increased awareness of venous disorders and their treatments is contributing to market expansion. Access to treatment is also increasing, thanks to the proliferation of private rehabilitation facilities.Share Price PerformanceShares of NVNO have plunged 18.8% over the past year against the industry’s 3.1% growth.Zacks Rank and Key PicksenVVeno currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are DaVita Inc. DVA, Quanterix QTRX and Align Technology ALGN, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).DaVita has an estimated long-term growth rate of 12.7%.

This company, which is in the Zacks Building Products - Concrete and Aggregates industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This construction materials company has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 34.17%.For the last reported quarter, Vulcan came out with earnings of $2.29 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.91 per share, representing a surprise of 19.90%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.64 per share and it actually produced earnings of $0.95 per share, delivering a surprise of 48.44%.With this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Vulcan. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Vulcan currently has an Earnings ESP of +2.74%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on October 26, 2023.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for General Electric Crunching The NumbersWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$6.25bUS$7.61bUS$8.66bUS$9.19bUS$9.61bUS$9.98bUS$10.3bUS$10.6bUS$10.9bUS$11.2bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 4.52%Est @ 3.81%Est @ 3.31%Est @ 2.96%Est @ 2.72%Est @ 2.55% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.4% US$5.8kUS$6.6kUS$7.0kUS$6.9kUS$6.7kUS$6.5kUS$6.2kUS$6.0kUS$5.7kUS$5.5k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$63bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.4%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$11b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.4%– 2.2%) = US$217bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$217b÷ ( 1 + 7.4%)10= US$106bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$169b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$110, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 29% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at General Electric as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.054. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for General ElectricStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Industrials market.OpportunityGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

PGR recently experienced a ""golden cross"" event, which saw its 50-day simple moving average breaking out above its 200-day simple moving average.Considered an important signifier for a bullish breakout, a golden cross is a technical chart pattern that's formed when a stock's short-term moving average breaks above a longer-term moving average; the most common crossover involves the 50-day and the 200-day, since bigger time periods tend to form stronger breakouts.There are three stages to a golden cross. First, there must be a downtrend in a stock's price that eventually bottoms out. Then, the stock's shorter moving average crosses over its longer moving average, triggering a positive trend reversal. The third stage is when a stock continues the upward momentum to higher prices.This kind of chart pattern is the opposite of a death cross, which is a technical event that suggests future bearish price movement.Over the past four weeks, PGR has gained 5.2%. The company currently sits at a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, also indicating that the stock could be poised for a breakout.The bullish case solidifies once investors consider PGR's positive earnings outlook. For the current quarter, no earnings estimate has been cut compared to 8 revisions higher in the past 60 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased too.Given this move in earnings estimates and the positive technical factor, investors may want to keep their eye on PGR for more gains in the near future.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But in three years the returns have been great. In fact, the share price is up a full 195% compared to three years ago. So the recent fall in the share price should be viewed in that context. If the business can perform well for years to come, then the recent drop could be an opportunity.In light of the stock dropping 8.1% in the past week, we want to investigate the longer term story, and see if fundamentals have been the driver of the company's positive three-year return. See our latest analysis for Valero Energy To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During three years of share price growth, Valero Energy achieved compound earnings per share growth of 128% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 43% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems investors have become more cautious about the company, over time. We'd venture the lowish P/E ratio of 4.11 also reflects the negative sentiment around the stock.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Valero Energy has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? If you are thinking of buying or selling Valero Energy stock, you should check out this FREE detailed report on its balance sheet.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Valero Energy, it has a TSR of 236% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveValero Energy shareholders have received returns of 18% over twelve months (even including dividends), which isn't far from the general market return. That gain looks pretty satisfying, and it is even better than the five-year TSR of 9% per year. It is possible that management foresight will bring growth well into the future, even if the share price slows down. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

However, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.1% in the same period. Uncertainty over the Federal Reserve’s interest rate outlook and rising tension between Israel and Palestine have forced investors to seek safer asset classes over equity. A rise in long-dated treasury yield and mixed movement in the major indexes suggest market indecisiveness.Following stronger-than-expected job data, the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield rose to 4.9% on October 6, the highest in 16 years. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 336,000, the unemployment rate rose 3.8%, and average hourly earnings grew by 0.2% compared to the street expectation of 170,000, 3.7% and 0.3%, respectively.  Investors fear that a strong labor market could prompt the Federal Reserve to keep the interest rate high for a prolonged period or raise it as inflation remains above its target. High interest rates, labor conflict and a dysfunctional federal government added to the worries.On the international front, geopolitical risks increased due to the recent conflict between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas. The ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine has also impacted global supply chain and corporate profitability, thus impacting investor sentiment.Regardless of market conditions, we, here at Zacks, provide investors with unbiased guidance on how to beat the market.As usual, Zacks Research guided investors over the past three months with its time-tested methodologies. Given the prevailing market uncertainty, you may want to look at our feats to prepare better for your next action.Here are some of our key achievements:Sovos Brands and Lincoln Educational Services Surge Following Zacks Rank Upgrade Shares of Sovos Brands, Inc. SOVO have gained 21.8% (versus the S&amp;P 500’s 5.1% decline) since it was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) on July 27.Another stock, Lincoln Educational Services Corporation LINC, which was also upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) on July 28, has returned 21.4% (versus the S&amp;P 500’s 4.5% fall) since then.Story continuesZacks Rank, our short-term rating system, has earnings estimate revisions at its core. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.This stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +24.8% since 1988.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;A hypothetical portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks returned +12.02% this year (through September 4th) vs. +18.2% for the S&amp;P 500 index and +7.6% for the equal-weight S&amp;P 500 index. The portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 stocks is an equal-weight portfolio, while the S&amp;P 500 index is a market-cap-weighted index that has been notably distorted by the strong recent performance of mega-cap stocks.We are not trying to cherry-pick here. But since this Zacks Model portfolio, consisting of Zacks Rank #1 stocks, is an equal-weight portfolio, the equal-weight S&amp;P 500 index is the appropriate benchmark for comparison. Looked at this way, this portfolio has outperformed the index this year.The Zacks Model Portfolio - consisting of Zacks Rank #1 stocks – has outperformed the S&amp;P index by more than 13 percentage points since 1988 (Through September 4th, 2023, the Zacks # 1 Rank stocks has generated an annualized return of +24.17% since 1988 vs. +10.82% for the S&amp;P 500 index).Check Sovos Brands’ historical EPS and Sales here&gt;&gt;&gt;Check Lincoln Educational Services’ historical EPS and Sales here&gt;&gt;&gt;Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Recommendation Upgrades Consolidated Huron Consulting Group and Quanterix Corporation  Shares of Huron Consulting Group Inc.

It'll be another critical cycle, particularly as the market tries to extend impressive YTD gains.Outside of the big banks, notable companies scheduled to unveil quarterly releases next week include PepsiCo, Delta Air Lines and UnitedHealth Group. Let's take a deeper dive into what's expected out of each.PepsiCoPEP shares have faced adverse price action over the last several months following an impressive start to 2023, down roughly 13% during the period. Analysts have primarily kept their earnings expectations unchanged for the upcoming release, with the $2.17 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate down just a penny over the last several months.The consumer staples giant regularly beats quarterly expectations, exceeding both Zacks Consensus earnings and revenue estimates in six consecutive releases.Still, negative sentiment has taken hold of near-term price action, with shares recently being rejected at the 200-day moving average and heading lower.It's worth noting that the company upped its FY23 view following its latest quarterly print, citing continued strong business momentum. Our consensus quarterly revenue estimate for PEP stands at $23.4 billion, 6% higher than the year-ago figure.PepsiCo, a current Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), will report on Tuesday, October 10th, before the market's open.Delta Air LinesDelta Air Lines shares have traded somewhat similarly to PEP over the last three months, facing adverse price action following a melt-up during early summer. Analysts moved their expectations lower following a filing on September 14th, with the $1.96 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate down 17% over the last several months.Story continuesDAL shares sold off following its latest release despite posting record quarterly revenue and profitability, likely a reflection of profit-taking following the above-mentioned summer melt-up.Rising fuel costs throughout the period undoubtedly impacted DAL's quarter to be released. As mentioned above, in September, the company updated previous guidance given in the latest earnings call, now expecting fuel prices of $2.75 - $2.90 per gallon ($2.50 -$2.70 per gallon previously). Our consensus estimate for average fuel price per gallon presently sits at $2.88, 14% higher than $2.52 per gallon in 2023 Q2.Delta Air Lines, a current Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), will report on Thursday, October 12th, before the market's open.UnitedHealth GroupUnlike those above, UNH shares have seen favorable action over the last several months, tacking on 14% in value and outperforming the general market. Analysts have taken their expectations modestly lower for the quarter to be released, with the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate down 2% since July.The company posted strong balanced growth in its latest release, with both segments posting double-digit percentage year-over-year growth rates. Regarding expectations, UNH exceeded both Zacks Consensus earnings and revenue forecasts, continuing its consistent nature. And given its first-half performance, UNH upped its full-year adjusted EPS outlook to $24.70 - $25.00 per share.UnitedHealth, a current Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), will report on Friday, October 13th, before the market's open.Bottom LineEarnings season is always an exciting time to be an investor, with companies pulling the curtain back and unveiling what's transpired behind closed doors.And next week, the quarterly reports will really start rolling in.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the impact of gender and income equality on the national economy, you can directly look at the 5 Most Gender and Income-Equal Countries in the World.According to various studies, the participation of women in the job market can significantly improve the economy. A study by CFR showed that closing the gender gap could lead to an additional $28 trillion in the global GDP. However, this can only happen if policymakers and those in authority are aware of what steps to take. Multiple international indices are utilized to compare the living standards between various countries, each focusing on an equally important parameter. Gender and income equality are both essential metrics to determine when it comes to countries because they each give us a different set of information regarding the living standards in that particular state. Gender equality is usually measured through the Gender Inequality Index or the Gender Development Index, both of which are calculated by the United Nations Development Programme or UNDP. The GII focuses on any disparities between the genders in terms of the labor market, health, or empowerment. Each dimension is further measured by sub-factors that determine these differences. This index aims to determine how hurdles related to gender impact human achievements across various countries. Based on GII values, countries can further develop policy recommendations that may aid in alleviating gender disparities or at least accounting for them. The GDI also works in a similar format, informing policymakers of the social areas that need more work to create equality across genders. While there is no one standard for measuring income equality across households, various international methodologies are deployed by different sources, one of which is the Gini Coefficient. The purpose behind each of these is to understand how income is spread across different economic classes and how this impacts other standards of living within a society. Story continuesDetermining income equality is essential because it helps policymakers understand the wealth distribution in society, enabling them to determine points of contention across the economy. In order to curate a more egalitarian society for all population segments, both income, as well as gender equality are critical factors to be determined. Economic standing and gender are both elements that may disadvantage particular groups from advancing forward in life. Hence, policymakers need to be aware of where their country stands in both these regards.In addition to the impacts of gender equality on the economy, income equality has also shown a direct relation with economic growth. An OECD research has shown that economic growth tends to fall when income inequality arises. This happens because many of the poorer members of society find themselves unable to invest in their education, as a result of which, many potentially productive members fail to enter the workforce. Working to achieve income equality across various classes can significantly improve how our local and international economies are structured. Even as we rank some of the most income-equal countries in the world, it’s important to note that research has shown that income inequality has risen worldwide in the past few decades amongst advanced economies and the developing world. Research has also shown that a higher number of women in managerial roles can bring in better profits for a company. As much as gender and income equality are essential for national economies, they also play a significant role in business decisions across big corporations. A meta-analysis by the Stern School of Business involving a 1000 studies on ESG showcased that ESG and corporate financial performance showcased a positive correlation for 58% of the studies, with corporate investments in sustainability also being advantageous in the long term. Companies are now much more adamant about complying with ESG standards as these make them look much better off in the eyes of socially and environmentally concerned investors. One of these companies is Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C), which increased the gender diversity on its board from 50% to 58% in 2022. The corporation has six different board committees, each with at least one female member. This diversity is not limited just to the board members; Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C) has also achieved a broader goal of having 40% of their global leadership roles belong to female employees. Numbers like these were achieved because Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C) prioritized ESG compliance, with a specific committee that focused on improving ESG performance headed by a woman. The corporation is also ranked top in the banking industry for its treatment of workers as stakeholders. Another multinational corporation that has performed well in terms of gender equality is the industry leader, Procter &amp; Gamble Co (NYSE:PG). With 50% of its board members being women, this corporation also has an ESG-specific committee chaired by a female board member. Procter &amp; Gamble Co (NYSE:PG) also ranks second in its industry for customer privacy. 71% of the employees at Procter &amp; Gamble Co (NYSE:PG) have mentioned that the company is a great place to work, which is a significant number as compared to the national US average of 57%. The corporation has also recently launched multiple initiatives that focus on improving the mental well-being of its employees. Recent trends in the labor market have also pushed corporations to treat blue-collar employees with better standards. Studies have shown that almost 80% of employees would perform better if they felt more appreciated in their workplaces, with this appreciation also including monetary benefits. Once gender and income equality is achieved at the level of private businesses, it can have a ripple effect on the rest of the economy at a national scale. For this reason, it is important to look into the most gender and income-equal countries in the world so one may take lessons from the policies they have implemented. 25 Most Gender and Income Equal Countries in the Worlddean bertoncelj/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyIn order to generate the list of the most gender and income-equal countries in the world, we have taken three indices into consideration. The countries have been ranked based on the average of their performance in the Gender Inequality Index (GII), the Human Development Index (HDI), and the income equality list as determined by US News. Only the countries that have reached the top 25 rankings in at least two of these lists have been included in this article. For companies with equal averages across these lists, their GII values have been used as a tiebreaker since they contain elements of both employment and income equality. The ranking is in descending order, with 1 being assigned to the country with the most income and gender equality. Based on this methodology, here are the 25 most gender and income-equal countries in the world: 25. Slovenia Average Ranking: 21The literacy rate for both men and women touches almost 100% in Slovenia, with the female literacy rate being slightly higher. The percentage of women subjected to intimate-partner violence is 3.4%, which is significantly low compared to many other nations worldwide. 91% of the legal frameworks promoting gender equality compared to SDG indicators are in place in the country. While there are data gaps in certain areas, the overall performance of Slovenia makes it one of the most gender-equal countries in 2023. 24. France Average Ranking: 20.5While income equality in France has increased a bit in the past few years, the country still showcases a significant position compared to others in the world. Currently, France ranks 19th in the list of the most income-equal countries in the world. The country also has a noteworthy record of gender-related legislation, with 67% of French individuals believing that investment in gender equality is worthwhile. 23. JapanAverage Ranking: 19.3 Income equality can be a complicated topic to sift through because there are a plethora of factors to look at. Despite that, the UN considers Japan to be one of the most income-equal countries in the world, with a high level of equal wealth distribution. While Japan still makes it to the list of the most gender-equal countries in the world, it has one of the lowest rankings amongst the G7 countries, with experts mentioning that the country still has significant gender-related issues to tackle. 22. Italy Average Ranking: 18 Italy managed to achieve a much higher gender balance in domains of economic decision-making after a legislative quota of 33% women on company boards was introduced in 2011. Similarly, a legislative quota of 40% was introduced for the parliament in 2017. Despite such policies in theory, experts still consider Italy to be amongst the European countries that are least committed to gender equality policies. 21. South KoreaAverage Ranking: 17.5GII Ranking: 15thSouth Korea has come a long way in terms of gender equality in the past few decades, achieving its place as one of the most gender-equal countries in Asia. The country has also earned a good position in the list of growing global economies, which is considered a success story due to its history of war and conflict. The size of the Korean economy has grown 800 times in the past six decades. 20. UAEAverage Ranking: 17.5GII Ranking: 11thAmongst Arab nations and the Gulf Cooperation Council, UAE is ranked the highest in terms of gender parity, especially across the labor force and higher education domain. The country performs significantly well on the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap report as well. 19. United KingdomAverage Ranking: 17While the UK is not the best in the developed world regarding income equality, it has taken significant measures over the years that rank it as one of the most income-equal countries globally. Initiatives like raising the minimum wage, decreasing taxes, and increasing the minimum taxable income have somewhat improved inequality in the country. 18. Spain Average Ranking: 16GII Ranking: 14thSpain has showcased 100% achievement in terms of putting in place legal frameworks that prevent violence against women, which makes it one of the most gender-equal countries in the world. The country has also showcased significant progress in terms of living conditions and benefits for all population segments by expanding many social welfare provisions. 17. Austria Average Ranking: 16GII Ranking: 12thThe Austrian labor market is known to have a high female employment rate, much of which was achieved after the National Action Plan (NAP) on Gender Equality in the Labor Market came out in 2010. The capital city of Vienna has especially deployed gender mainstreaming policies to create public spaces and infrastructure that are much more conducive to gender equality. 16. New ZealandAverage Ranking: 15GII Ranking: 25thAccording to US News, New Zealand ranks sixth in terms of the most income-equal countries in the world. The export industry, tourism, and manufacturing are the most significant contributors to the national economy in New Zealand. The country showcases a high per capita income and has some of the highest educational expenditures when seen as a percentage of the national GDP. 15. Portugal Average Ranking: 15GII Ranking: 15thPortugal has showcased a rapid progress of women in the domain of formal education, with the number of female PhD holders surpassing the average of other EU countries. Compared with the past few decades, the country has also achieved an increasing proportion of women as part of the economically active population. A report by the European Commission praised Portugal for its ‘extraordinary success’ in incorporating women into the field of science. 14. IrelandAverage Ranking: 14.3 Ireland has managed to achieve net income equality close to the EU average due to policies of social transfers and low taxation. These initiatives show that the country is aware of where it falls short in income distribution and is actively fighting those disparities. 13. CanadaAverage Ranking: 14Canadian provinces perform very well in terms of intergenerational income mobility, with eight of them scoring A grades. A high income mobility is a good measure of equal opportunities. In Canada, the relationship between a family’s background and the adult income of its children is much lower when compared with many of the country’s peers. The intergenerational income elasticity in Canada is only 0.19, which is highly appreciable compared to countries like the US, where it goes up to 0.47. 12. LuxembourgAverage Ranking: 13GII Ranking: 9thWomen in Luxembourg tend to have higher education levels than men, meaning the country's highly specialized service sector favors women. On average, the gender pay gap in Luxembourg is pretty low, with women earning more than men in certain domains as well. Women have a significant presence in many high-earning branches of the economy, such as health, finance, legal, etc. 11. SingaporeAverage Ranking: 13GII Ranking: 7th Singapore has achieved significant milestones in terms of gender equality, so much so that the focus is now shifting towards gender equity, which is the next step. More women are taking up roles in leadership positions, with a higher number of fathers acquiring paternity leave as well. All in all, currently, 6 in every 10 Singaporean women are part of the economic workforce, which makes Singapore one of the most gender and income-equal countries in the world. 10. GermanyAverage Ranking: 12.3 Even when we take a look at the gender ranking by WEF, Germany has improved its place in terms of gender equality over the years. Most of Germany’s gender empowerment comes through political measures, with the number of women in politically influential roles increasing significantly. 9. BelgiumAverage Ranking: 11.6One of the biggest ways that Belgium has implemented better gender equality is through the strict administration of legal quotas that favor women, especially in political roles. These steps have enabled female participation in political forums to rise significantly. The government has also extended these quotas to listed companies in the private domain. 8. AustraliaAverage Ranking: 10.6The Australian government committed a whopping $65 million for gender equality initiatives for the year 2022-2023. The country has 100% of legal frameworks in place that promote gender equality in the domains of violence against women and economic benefits. This is why Australia is 8th on the list of the most gender and income-equal countries in the world. 7. FinlandAverage Ranking: 6.6GII Ranking: 6thFinland is considered one of the top examples in the world regarding income and gender equality. Men and women have almost equal representation in the Finnish workforce, a statistic that can be seen due to policies like affordable and good-quality child care. Female decision-makers are also seen abundantly in positions of power in politics and business. 6. The Netherlands Average Ranking: 6.6GII Ranking: 5thThe Netherlands has one of the world’s most considerable funds to fight inequality across the genders, with a value of more than $500 million from 2021-2025. This is another country that deploys the policy of gender mainstreaming to improve gender parity. The Netherlands also recently announced a feminist foreign policy that strengthens its position as one of the most gender-equal countries in the world. Click to continue reading and see the 5 Most Gender and Income-Equal Countries in the World.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 Easiest and Affordable Commuter Towns to NYC in 2023.Commuter TownsCommuter towns, also commonly referred to as bedroom towns, include the residential area outside a major urban area which is usually not commercially developed. People living in these towns thereby commute to the city for their jobs hence the name, commuter towns.The concept of commuter towns is not new in the United States. Commuter towns in the country have formed as a result of employees not having access to affordable living in the area of their work. For instance, the high cost of living in California has led to the settlement of people in nearby counties. Commuter towns typically emerge in the suburban or less rural parts close to a main city where the housing is comparatively cheap. Thus, the town needs access to freeways and public transportation to facilitate the commute requirements. Life in these towns is ideal when people are more willing to dedicate extra hours of commute to work since the town offers low crime rates, a good education system, and better housing amenities.

(NASDAQ:LYFT) and public transportation form important aspects of daily commuter life around New York City. Let’s take a look at each of them.Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) and Lyft, Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT) are leading ride-hailing services in the United States. These rides are available in the suburbs of New York City from where they can be used to reach the main city. The services have emerged to transform the transportation landscape in the city which was culturally identified by yellow cabs. On July 15, CNBC reported that these yellow taxis account for only 10% of the total drivers in New York City as Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) and Lyft, Inc. (NASDAQ:LYFT) outnumber them in a ratio of 9 to 1. This taxi industry crisis has been powered by the long working hours, huge debt from owning or leasing medallions, and comparatively much lower revenues from the streets due to a saturated transport market.Story continuesOne of the largest subway systems in the world, MTA Subway, is also a major public commuter network that operates around the boroughs of New York including Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and the Bronx. This subway is known to be one of the busiest rapid transit systems in the world. On March 1, the American Public Transportation Association reported that 1,793,073,000 passengers are carried by the MTA Subway, as of 2022. This subway is run by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) which also owns buses and commuter rail cars for public transport in the city and serves 15.3 million people across a 5000-square-mile travel area around New York City, southeastern New York state, Connecticut, and Long Island.  In July, MTA reported that the paid average daily subway ridership was recorded at 3.608 million in June 2023, 10% higher than in June, 2022.New York Subway as a Source of RevenueOutfront Media Inc. (NYSE:OUT) is a dominant outdoor media company in America that earns a major revenue from its transit displays and billboards in New York City and the surrounding Westchester, Rockland, Fairfield, Nassau, and Suffolk counties. The firm drives the attention of subway commuters in the New York City Subway system through its 50,000 digital screens. Outfront Media Inc. (NYSE:OUT) claims that more than 8 in 10 commuters on the MTA subway station recall the station's ads while more than half tend to remember the ads displayed on their subway train. 41% of them even scan a QR code displayed on a subway ad. On August 3, Outfront Media Inc. (NYSE:OUT) reported its earnings for the fiscal second quarter of 2023. The company reported earnings per share of $0.20. The company’s revenue for the quarter amounted to $468.8 million, up 4.1% year-over-year. The year-over-year growth in billboard revenue was 5% while transit and other revenues experienced a 1% year-over-year increase. The company also reported that the second quarter results had been impacted by the ongoing strikes in the media industry during the quarter.Booming NYC Real Estate StocksEmpire State Realty Trust, Inc. (NYSE:ESRT) manages office and rental spaces in the greater New York metropolitan area and Manhattan. The company’s office stock is located in Manhattan, accessing a mass transit network which makes it attractive. Real estate properties located close to public transit systems tend to hold a higher property value as well. On October 5, the company announced that it has achieved the highest rating on the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark. This has been possible by achieving carbon neutrality in its commercial real estate portfolio in January 2022. The firm is also striving to reduce carbon emissions at the Empire State Building in Manhattan, a popular borough of New York City, located close to many subway stations, bus stops, and train stations.SL Green Realty Corp. (NYSE:SLG) is another renowned real estate investment trust that invests in commercial properties such as office buildings and shopping centers in New York City.

AAL need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Nov 17, 2023 $3.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for American Airlines shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, American Airlines is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Transportation - Airline industry that ranks in the Bottom 10% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while eight analysts have revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 89 cents per share to 33 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about American Airlines right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Aflac (AFL), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Aflac currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?In order to see if AFL is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this insurer holds up.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.For AFL, shares are up 0.58% over the past week while the Zacks Insurance - Accident and Health industry is down 1.03% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 3.7% compares favorably with the industry's 0.18% performance as well.Story continuesWhile any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Over the past quarter, shares of Aflac have risen 11.53%, and are up 34.51% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved -1.94% and 16.89%, respectively.Investors should also take note of AFL's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, AFL is averaging 2,288,043 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with AFL.Over the past two months, 3 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost AFL's consensus estimate, increasing from $5.92 to $6.01 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 3 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that AFL is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of A. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Aflac on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

AerCap is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Over the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for AER's full-year earnings has moved 11.8% higher. This shows that analyst sentiment has improved and the company's earnings outlook is stronger.According to our latest data, AER has moved about 4.2% on a year-to-date basis. Meanwhile, the Finance sector has returned an average of 3.1% on a year-to-date basis. As we can see, AerCap is performing better than its sector in the calendar year.Another Finance stock, which has outperformed the sector so far this year, is Aflac (AFL). The stock has returned 7.9% year-to-date.The consensus estimate for Aflac's current year EPS has increased 3.5% over the past three months.

372,d080e783-732c-4ab2-a2d3-fd7de328bc5b,GPS,2023-10-10,"Why Starbucks, Whole Foods, and others are closing stores in downtown San Francisco",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-starbucks-whole-foods-and-others-are-closing-stores-in-downtown-san-francisco-205713063.html,1696885033,STORY,"['SBUX', 'AMZN', 'URBN', 'JWN', 'ODP', 'GPS']","[Starbucks (SBUX) is the latest company to rethink its presence in San Francisco.Effective Oct. 22, the coffee giant plans to close seven stores in San Francisco. Following these closures, there will be 52 remaining Starbucks locations in the city.Starbucks did not disclose the reason for the closures. In a letter to employees, Jessica Borton, the Northern California regional vice president, stated: ""There are several factors Starbucks considers when tasked with the tough decision of closing a store, but it is all part of ensuring a healthy store portfolio.""Starbucks isn't the only consumer-facing giant to take a second look at its San Francisco portfolio this year.Other companies that recently closed locations in San Francisco include Amazon (AMZN), which closed a Whole Foods Market just 13 months after opening it earlier this year and all four Amazon Go Stores in March; Office Depot (ODP), which closed a store in April; and Anthropologie (URBN), which left Union Square after two decades in May.Gap (GPS) also shuttered Old Navy, Banana Republic, and Athleta stores this year, while Nordstrom (JWN) closed its flagship store in August, and Saks Off 5th shut its doors this fall.The Starbucks stores being added to this list are located on Mission and Main, Geary and Taylor, 425 Battery, 398 Market, 4th and Market, 555 California, and Bush and Van Ness. It's worth noting that none of the stores set to close are unionized and employees at the stores will be offered the opportunity to transfer to other locations.San Francisco sluggish in returning to officesWhat's behind the exodus? Hybrid and fully remote companies may be partly to blame.""A big component for sure is that people are remote working and not coming into those offices as much,"" John Zolidis, president of Quo Vadis Capital, told Yahoo Finance. ""That's got to be one of the driving forces — just less traffic from office workers.""Story continuesA customer leaves a Starbucks coffee shop in San Francisco, Calif., on Sept. 13, 2018. (Robert Alexander/Getty Images) (Robert Alexander via Getty Images)Per foot traffic analytics platform Placer.ai, San Francisco has the lowest number of visits to offices of any major US city. In August 2023, office visits were down 52.7% compared to August 2019, before the pandemic disrupted workplaces.San Francisco is ""by far the slowest to come back,"" Ethan Chernofsky, senior vice president of marketing at Placer.ai, told Yahoo Finance. ""When you think about what that means for retail more broadly ... lots of people work there and then shop there and eat there, so that's obviously going to have an impact. ... Then, even [the] people who are coming back to the office [are] not doing so five days a week.""Migration patterns — such as people moving out of the city — are a factor too, Chernofsky said, affecting cities across the US as well as San Francisco. And if retailers leave a city, it can lead to fewer visits to that area as well, causing companies to further reconsider their real estate portfolios.""We see significant headroom for new store growth in underpenetrated areas in the US, including smaller cities, as well as new formats in larger metros,"" Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan said on a call with investors following its Q3 earnings results.However, the tide may be turning for San Francisco, with the artificial intelligence boom acting as a bright spot for activity. Just as the tech industry was the first to move to remote work during the pandemic, it may be a leader in bringing workers back to offices.""San Francisco and the Bay Area in general is really a market that's led by the tech industry,"" Colin Yasukochi, executive director at CBRE’s Tech Insights Center, told Yahoo Finance. ""Over the last six months ... they're starting to see growth perk up in the tech industry. Artificial intelligence is one of those particular areas where the companies are actually looking to expand — they're looking to upgrade the [office] space that they currently have to provide a better experience for their employees.""Pedestrians and vehicles are visible at the base of the Salesforce Tower in San Francisco, Calif., on May 5, 2022. (Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images) (Smith Collection/Gado via Getty Images)A 'difficult operating environment'Crime and safety may also be playing a role.On Sept. 26, Target (TGT) announced plans to close nine stores at the end of October, including three in the San Francisco and Oakland area. Target said crime and retail theft were the reasons behind the decision to close stores.""We cannot continue operating these stores because theft and organized retail crime are threatening the safety of our team and guests, and contributing to unsustainable business performance,"" the company said in a statement.According to crime data on the city's website, theft has been the top issue, followed by burglary. That has affected not only whether companies open retail space in the city but also where they choose to expand.""On-the-ground type of issues have probably impacted where companies are willing to be located in terms of their office space,"" Yasukochi said, ""which is why we've seen a greater concentration of companies looking for space in the central business district and less so in the South of Market or mid-market areas.""For Starbucks, though, it's a bit harder to understand if crime truly was a factor. A spokesperson for the company declined to comment on whether safety played a part in the decision in particular.""There's not large quantities of merchandise to steal and resell,"" Zolidis said about Starbucks stores, though he added: ""It's just a difficult operating environment from an employee safety perspective.""Another factor affecting how companies position themselves in the Golden State could be the approach of a minimum wage law that goes into effect on April 1. The law, which raises starting pay for fast food workers to $20 an hour, is one to watch, Zolidis said.But, he added, ""if that were a deciding factor [for Starbucks], it wouldn't be seven stores in San Francisco [but] a much broader group of stores.""Meanwhile, San Francisco Mayor London Breed remains optimistic about the city's future, despite its challenges.""People still want to be here,"" Breed told Yahoo Finance in a recent interview at Salesforce's annual Dreamforce conference. ""They're starting their companies, their businesses here.""—Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

373,0d7a0046-5513-350d-90da-da801b2cb5f8,GPS,2023-10-10,"Gap (GPS) Gains 14.5% in 3 Months on Lower Freight, Cost Savings",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gap-gps-gains-14-5-135400393.html,1696859640,STORY,"['GPS', 'WMT']","[Gap GPS has been witnessing lower airfreight and improved promotional activity. Moving on, its aggressive cost-management actions bode well. Also, the company is on track with the execution of its Power Plan 2023 plan.Driven by these factors, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 14.6% in the past three months against the industry’s decline of 2.6%.That said, let’s delve deeper into the factors that are driving the stock. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Factors Narrating GPS’s Growth StoryGap has been on track with aggressive cost-management actions in the fiscal second quarter. The company has been making efforts to simplify and optimize its operating model and structure, including increasing spans of control and decreasing management layers to improve the quality and speed of decision-making, as well as creating a consistent organizational structure across all four brands. These actions are expected to generate $300 million in annualized savings, of which half is expected to be realized in the latter half of fiscal 2023.The company is also likely to incur severance and other related costs from the optimization plan. Apart from these efforts, it is expected to realize $250 million in annualized savings, as announced in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Gap revealed plans to further optimize its marketing spend and rationalize its technology investments over the next few years.The company is on track with the execution of its Power Plan 2023, which focuses on opening highly profitable Old Navy and Athleta stores, while closing the underperforming Gap and Banana Republic stores. As part of its 350-store closure plan, the company expects to close 50-55 Gap and Banana Republic stores this year. It is likely to fulfill its 350-store closure plan by the end of 2023. It has already achieved 90% of the target in 2022.With the closing of underperforming Gap and Banana Republic stores, the company expects to realize $100 million in EBITDA savings on an annualized basis by the end of 2023. Further, it expects to leverage its powerful platform to deliver competitive omni capabilities to meet customers’ needs, all fueled by its scaled operations. It targets the e-commerce business to contribute 50% of sales by the end of 2023. Through the plan, the company expects to deliver consistent sales growth, margin expansion and strong operating cash flow.Lower airfreight and improved promotional activity contributed to margins in second-quarter fiscal 2023. The gross margin of 37.6% expanded 310 basis points (bps) year over year while adjusted gross margin expanded 160 bps year over year. Meanwhile, the adjusted operating margin expanded 170 bps to 3.4%, driven by an improved gross margin and adjusted SG&amp;A leverage.Adjusted SG&amp;A expenses declined 8% year over year. Adjusted SG&amp;A, as a percentage of sales, leveraged 10 bps to 36.6% due to lower advertising expenses, payroll and technology investments resulting from cost-saving actions. Owing to these factors, adjusted earnings of 34 cents per share significantly improved from the 8 cents reported in the second quarter of fiscal 2022.Management expects the gross margin to expand in fiscal 2023. This is likely to result from a 200-bps leverage due to the lapping of elevated airfreight costs in the prior year and a 100-bps margin gain from improved inventory position and promotional activity, offset by a 10-bps deleverage from inflationary costs.Also, the company expects inflationary deleverage to turn into leverage in the second half of fiscal 2023 due to gains from improved commodity costs and ocean freight rates. ROD, as a percentage of sales, is expected to deleverage 70 bps year over year.For third-quarter fiscal 2023, Gap anticipates the gross margin to be in line with the 38.7% reported last year. It envisions lower inflation and airfreight costs to be offset by 150 bps of ROD deleverage.Story continuesHurdles on the WayGap has been reeling under uncertain macro and consumer environments, as well as the sale of the Gap China business. This led to sales decline of 8% year over year while comps fell 6% in second-quarter fiscal 2023. Management anticipates fiscal 2023 sales to decline in the mid-single digits compared with the low to mid-single-digit decline mentioned earlier. The guidance is in line with our estimate of a 5% decline.For third-quarter fiscal 2023, Gap expects a sales decline in the low-double digits, in sync with our estimate of a 10.8% decline. This can be attributed to the sale of Gap China, which is expected to impact net sales by $70 million in the fiscal third quarter.Bottom LineAlthough uncertain macro and consumer environments are likely to linger in the near term, solid merchandise margins, cost-saving efforts and reduced air freight expenses are likely to help GPS drive growth ahead. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GPS’s fiscal 2023 earnings for the current financial year has moved up 7.7% in the past 60 days.
