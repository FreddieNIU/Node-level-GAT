It's an investment approach where the focus is on companies that consistently increase their dividends over time. This means they're not just paying dividends, but actively growing them, which signals financial health and stability. According to a report by ProShares, dividend growth strategies have shown impressive resilience, outperforming the broader market over the years. They've not only weathered turbulent times but also thrived in upward-trending markets. The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some of the best examples of dividend growth stocks as these companies maintain decades-long dividend growth streak."", ""Dividend-paying stocks serve a crucial role beyond just providing dividends. They often demonstrate a defensive quality, which becomes valuable when safeguarding wealth is necessary to maintain a consistent income. Eagle Asset Management's report studied periods when the S&P 500 experienced significant declines of at least 15%, followed by a return to its previous high. The report utilized three benchmarks centered on dividends to highlight the significance of investing not only in dividend-yielding companies but also in those that consistently increase their dividends over time. Upon analyzing the data closely, it was evident that indexes comprising dividend-paying companies typically outperform the broader market, such as the S&P 500, specifically during extended downturns. This illustrates the resilience and potential for better performance of dividend-oriented investments during challenging market phases."", ""Dividends hold a significant role in the global stock market landscape, constituting a substantial portion of the MSCI World Index's yearly returns, amounting to about 34% since February 1, 1970. Engaging in extended ownership of companies focused on dividend growth has offered various notable benefits historically. These advantages encompass robust returns both in absolute terms and concerning risk-adjusted performance across entire market cycles. Such investments have showcased lower volatility compared to the broader MSCI World Index, demonstrating an ability to preserve capital even amidst challenging market conditions. Additionally, they present a diversified income source that has the potential for both income growth and appreciation of capital."", ""Nuveen's report stressed how increasing dividends over time is important for shareholders. It found that companies worldwide that regularly raised their dividends did better than those that didn't pay dividends when markets got uncertain, especially when measured by the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX). Since interest rates and prices for things are going up and the stock market might stay uncertain for a while, companies that are good at handling their money and can keep increasing their shareholder return could be a good way to make money and protect against this uncertainty.

The new tax reforms directly impact multinational companies across the globe. The Pillar Two tax reform, signed by 138 countries, accounts for 90% of global economic activity. As per the Pillar Two tax reform, the primary goal is to establish a level playing field for companies across countries. This will primarily be done by discouraging companies from lowering their corporate income taxes in a bid to attract foreign investment. Under the supervision of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), companies with €750 million or more in revenue, are obliged to pay a global minimum tax of 15% on earned income in each country they operate in. OECD suggests that the reform will push corporate taxes globally by $220 billion per year, almost 9% of global corporate income tax revenues. Deloitte further highlights that the Pillar Two tax reform does not limit itself to just taxes, instead, it shapes how multinationals operate their supply chain networks, execute acquisitions, and strategic decisions.', 'Moreover, the system and compliance data are not only difficult to adhere to, but they also demand a complex infrastructure, that businesses need to establish. Under the reform, multinationals will be required to provide data for 100 separate data points for each entity in an organization. Not only do companies have to remodel their organizational structure, but they also have to revisit their financial reporting timelines. Therefore, to address the need for a complex infrastructure, companies will not be expected to report 2024 returns until after 18 months, which provides ample time for companies to adapt and restructure.

And I think it applies to here. When you take a look at Walmart, some of the trends that they are seeing. The fact that so many consumers have been trading down for their goods, for their shopping over the last several months. Walmart has stand to benefit. We have seen that outperformance, especially when you compare Walmart's numbers to Target."", ""We know Target much more heavily relies on some of those consumer discretionary purchases, which has pressured Target in recent quarters. Walmart has, pretty much by a wide margin, really been beating the Street's expectations much better than what we had initially anticipated in terms of the resilient consumer, and the consumer who is out there still spending. They're choosing to do it in maybe a more budget-friendly type manner. So they're making more trips here to Walmart."", ""But when it comes to some of those other reasons why Oliver Chen here at TD Cowen likes Walmart here, he talks a lot about their AI investments. Their efforts surrounding generative AI, and what exactly that could potentially do in terms of securing and generating more data here for the company, and also just tailoring their content and their offerings in the future, just the edge that that could really give Walmart here over the coming years. I think it's something that we're going to be hearing a little bit more about from other retailers in the coming quarters."", ""BRAD SMITH: I mean, they really look at everything within this, all the way down to people's hair lines. They talk about company stores offering a variety of merchandise, grocery, household goods, electronics, health, wellness, hair lines. They go on to say apparel and home products here. And so across that kind of inventory mix, they're really leaning into that as part of the defensive play here."", ""You mentioned the AI investments. And that will be priced in, perhaps, to some of, even the downside scenario that they have to get right. And they say price investments increase and become increasingly more dilutive to gross margin as part of their downside scenario.

But at the same time, there's much more in the base case and upside scenario that this team is pointing out that leads them to be pointing towards Walmart as their top pick for 2023."", ""SEANA SMITH: Let's talk about the fact that Walmart has a very sticky ecosystem, which is going to help traffic growth here in 2024.""]"

And if he\'s right, countless U.S. households may get relief.', ""But general deflation aside, you can take a few steps to save money on groceries. Here are some strategies to employ if you've been struggling with the cost of putting food on the table."", ""For a discount grocer like Aldi to work for you, you need to be willing to step outside of your comfort zone with brand names. But if you're willing to go off-brand to save some money, then shopping at discount grocers is a smart strategy."", ""In many cases, buying pantry staples made by a company you've never heard of won't mean compromising on taste or quality. For example, let's say your family eats a lot of pasta. Pasta, by nature, is going to taste like whatever sauce you put on it. So if you can spend $1.05 per box at a store like Aldi versus $1.49 at your regular grocery store, why not go with the former?"", ""If there are food products your family eats regularly, then it pays to seek out opportunities to buy those items in bulk.

Based on this payment, the dividend yield on the company's stock will be 5.2%, which is an attractive boost to shareholder returns."", ' See our latest analysis for Huntington Bancshares ', ""We like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable."", ""Having distributed dividends for at least 10 years, Huntington Bancshares has a long history of paying out a part of its earnings to shareholders. Taking data from its last earnings report, calculating for the company's payout ratio shows 40%, which means that Huntington Bancshares would be able to pay its last dividend without pressure on the balance sheet."", 'Over the next 3 years, EPS is forecast to fall by 16.8%. Despite that, analysts estimate the future payout ratio could be 49% over the same time period, which is in a pretty comfortable range.', ""The company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $0.16 total annually to $0.62. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 15% a year over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time."", ""Investors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. Earnings per share has been crawling upwards at 3.2% per year. Huntington Bancshares is struggling to find viable investments, so it is returning more to shareholders. While this isn't necessarily a negative, it definitely signals that dividend growth could be constrained in the future unless earnings start to pick up again."", ""In summary, it is good to see that the dividend is staying consistent, and we don't think there is any reason to suspect this might change over the medium term. The distributions are easily covered by earnings, and there is plenty of cash being generated as well. If earnings do fall over the next 12 months, the dividend could be buffeted a little bit, but we don't think it should cause too much of a problem in the long term. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock."", ""It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. For example, we've picked out 1 warning sign for Huntington Bancshares that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

We've put together a brief outline of industry analyst expectations for the company, its year of breakeven and its implied growth rate."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Greatland Gold ', 'According to some industry analysts covering Greatland Gold, breakeven is near. They expect the company to post a final loss in 2024, before turning a profit of UK£1.0m in 2025. The company is therefore projected to breakeven around 2 years from today. What rate will the company have to grow year-on-year in order to breakeven on this date? Using a line of best fit, we calculated an average annual growth rate of 103%, which is rather optimistic! Should the business grow at a slower rate, it will become profitable at a later date than expected.', ""Underlying developments driving Greatland Gold's growth isn’t the focus of this broad overview, though, keep in mind that by and large a metal and mining business has lumpy cash flows which are contingent on the natural resource mined and stage at which the company is operating. So, a high growth rate is not out of the ordinary, particularly when a company is in a period of investment."", ""Before we wrap up, there’s one issue worth mentioning. Greatland Gold currently has a relatively high level of debt. Typically, debt shouldn’t exceed 40% of your equity, which in Greatland Gold's case is 79%. A higher level of debt requires more stringent capital management which increases the risk around investing in the loss-making company."", ""There are too many aspects of Greatland Gold to cover in one brief article, but the key fundamentals for the company can all be found in one place – Greatland Gold's company page on Simply Wall St. We've also put together a list of key aspects you should look at:"", ""Historical Track Record: What has Greatland Gold's performance been like over the past?

The game-changing technology is expected to usher in a wave of productivity and efficiency gains. Businesses that can harness AI's power, in turn, stand to see their profits soar."", 'Read on to learn about three companies that are working to bring the potential of AI to their customers and, by extension, wealth-building gains to their shareholders.', ""Many businesses want to integrate artificial intelligence into their operations, but they don't know where to start. Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) makes this process easy by serving as an AI hub for its customers."", 'The leading provider of cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) software is helping its clients add cutting-edge AI and powerful data analytics tools to their sales and marketing platforms. These businesses, in turn, are better able to harvest actionable, AI-driven insights that can boost revenue and improve customer experiences.', ""As part of this process, Salesforce connects its clients to the latest and greatest large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's ChatGPT. But it does so in a way that protects their proprietary data. This is key, as the cost of data breaches -- and the corresponding loss of customer trust -- can be crippling."", ""By serving as a trusted partner for countless companies' AI-powered growth initiatives, Salesforce is set to cash in on the AI revolution. Buy shares today, and you can position yourself to profit alongside this AI leader."", ""An AI model's value is derived from the data on which it is trained. And data is Snowflake's (NYSE: SNOW) specialty."", ""Snowflake aggregates data from a wide array of sources and makes it easily accessible in a single, cloud-based platform. This secure and unified approach to data collection enables its customers to run more effective analytics and machine learning processes. Unsurprisingly, given the rapidly rising need for these services, Snowflake's business is booming."", ""Snowflake's revenue leaped 32% year over year to $734 million in the quarter ended Oct. 31. This impressive growth was driven by strong customer gains and higher sales to existing clients."", 'Better still, Snowflake is growing more profitable as it scales its operations.

Its adjusted operating margin also improved from negative 27.7% in 2014 to positive 9.8% in 2022.', ""HubSpot's stock has risen by a whopping 1,868% from its IPO price of $25 -- which would have turned a $2,000 investment into over $39,000. But with an enterprise value of $24 billion, it's still only a tenth as valuable as cloud-based CRM leader Salesforce, which has an enterprise value of $241 billion. Can HubSpot keep growing over the next few decades and become as big as Salesforce one day?"", 'Cloud-based CRM platforms like those offered by HubSpot and Salesforce make it easier for companies to store, organize, and analyze information about their individual customers. Putting all of that information in a centralized cloud-based location also enables companies to analyze sales trends and make faster, data-driven decisions.', 'HubSpot and Salesforce also provide marketing tools for crafting lower-cost ""inbound"" marketing campaigns -- such as social media campaigns, viral videos, or blogs -- which drive consumers to seek out brands on their own. They also provide lead generation and search engine optimization (SEO) tools to boost a company\'s online exposure.', ""Their two business models sound similar, but HubSpot primarily targets smaller businesses while Salesforce focuses on larger enterprises. HubSpot's CRM platform is a lot simpler than Salesforce's platform, but HubSpot offers it as a free service to tether more customers to the marketing and analytics services it charges for. Salesforce's CRM platform is a paid service that serves as a launchpad for its other cloud-based marketing, analytics, data visualization, app development, and collaboration services."", 'Simply put, HubSpot is a smaller CRM and marketing play, while Salesforce is a cloud software giant that competes more intensively against other enterprise software heavyweights like Microsoft and Adobe.', ""According to IDC, Salesforce controls 23% of the global CRM market, while its closest competitors -- Microsoft, Adobe, SAP, and Oracle\xa0-- each hold mid-single digit shares. HubSpot doesn't even make the top-five list."", 'HubSpot expects its revenue to rise by 24% to $2.1 billion this year as macroeconomic headwinds curb its near-term growth. From 2022 to 2025, analysts expect its revenue to continue rising at a compound annual rate of 21% and reach $3.04 billion by the final year.', 'That would be comparable to the $3.05 billion in revenue that Salesforce booked in its fiscal 2013 (which ended in January 2013). From its fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2023, Salesforce grew its revenues at a compound annual rate of 26% to reach $31.4 billion. But from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026, analysts expect its revenues will only rise at a compound annual rate of 11% as its business matures.', ""That growth slowdown highlights another key difference between the two companies. Salesforce leveraged its first-mover advantage to become the top CRM company, but that market's growth is cooling off. HubSpot carved out a niche for itself that allowed it to avoid going toe-to-toe against Salesforce, but it probably can't grow as rapidly as Salesforce did over the past decade given the state of the CRM market."", 'However, HubSpot believes it can continue to grow as smaller businesses continue to scale up their cloud-based CRM systems and marketing campaigns. It also expects its development of new artificial intelligence (AI) tools for generating digital content, summarizing calls and emails, creating chatbots, analyzing data, and optimizing marketing campaigns to boost its revenue per customer and widen its competitive moat. It could also acquire smaller companies to expand its ecosystem.', ""According to a forecast from Grand View Research, the global CRM market could still grow at a compound annual rate of 14% from 2023 to 2030. If HubSpot's sales simply keep pace with that market, it could generate $5.2 billion in revenue in 2030. If it continues to grow at a slower compound annual rate of 13% over the following 15 years, it could generate $31 billion in revenue by 2045 -- which would make it comparable to today's Salesforce."", ""But a lot of things could prevent HubSpot from ever reaching that lofty target. Salesforce, Microsoft, and the other enterprise CRM leaders could launch more free CRM services for small businesses, challenging HubSpot in its niche. Recessions, geopolitical conflicts, and other macro headwinds could stunt HubSpot's growth. The rise of new AI-driven services could disrupt older CRM and inbound marketing services."", ""How those longer-term challenges might play out is impossible to predict, so investors should instead focus on HubSpot's core strengths: It is still growing rapidly, its margins are expanding, and analysts expect it to turn profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis by 2025. In other words, HubSpot still has plenty of room to grow -- even if it never becomes a megacap cloud software giant like Salesforce."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in HubSpot right now?', 'Before you buy stock in HubSpot, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and HubSpot wasn't one of them.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed.

Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Marathon Oil's (NYSE:MRO) returns on capital, so let's have a look."", ""Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Marathon Oil is:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.13 = US$2.2b ÷ (US$20b - US$2.9b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""Thus, Marathon Oil has an ROCE of 13%.

The figures show that over the last five years, ROCE has grown 220% whilst employing roughly the same amount of capital. So our take on this is that the business has increased efficiencies to generate these higher returns, all the while not needing to make any additional investments. On that front, things are looking good so it's worth exploring what management has said about growth plans going forward."", ""As discussed above, Marathon Oil appears to be getting more proficient at generating returns since capital employed has remained flat but earnings (before interest and tax) are up. Since the stock has returned a solid 81% to shareholders over the last five years, it's fair to say investors are beginning to recognize these changes. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if Marathon Oil can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead."", ""One more thing: We've identified   5 warning signs  with Marathon Oil (at least 1 which is a bit concerning)  , and understanding these would certainly be useful."", ""While Marathon Oil may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

Various sectors experienced contrasting outcomes, influenced by ongoing political and economic factors. The energy sector in the US maintained stability throughout 2022, largely attributed to elevated prices and limited supplies. Closing the year with remarkable growth, it surged by 58% by December 30, a stark contrast to the S&P 500's approximately 20% decline. Notably, according to Dow Jones Market Data, this marked the first instance of the energy sector standing out as the sole victor in the S&P 500 annual performance, and it was the only sector that didn't witness a decline throughout the year. This year, the situation has reversed, as energy stocks are now trailing behind the overall market performance. The S&P 500 Energy is down by 7.31% in 2023 so far, compared with a 20.40% gain of the S&P 500."", 'In addition to this, the largest American exchange-traded fund (ETF) that follows clean energy stocks was set to mark its highest yearly outflows ever due to several factors. Rapidly increasing interest rates, rising prices of raw materials, and disruptions in the supply chain have diminished the appeal of this fund for investors. As per Lipper data, the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF has recorded more than $1 billion in net outflows as of November 2023. This ETF, which was once favored during the pandemic, had experienced substantial net inflows of over $2 billion annually in both 2020 and 2021. However, investors have been pulling out of this ETF amid the escalation of interest rates. Moreover, more investors are heavily invested in technology stocks compared to energy stocks than they have been since September 2021, according to a Bank of America survey. The report mentioned that the managers have allocated the least amount of money to energy shares since December 2020.', ""Despite a recent slowdown, energy stocks have proven advantageous for investors over the past three years, soaring by more than 200%. This growth aligned with the rise in oil prices from their low points over multiple years. These years serve as a valuable lesson for investors, illustrating the correlation between energy stock performance and substantial fluctuations in oil prices. Moreover, the energy sector has changed notably, with many companies allocating more funds to dividends for investors while cutting back on new drilling. This shift has reshaped how energy investments work, underscoring these companies' evolving strategies focused on boosting returns for shareholders."", ""Analysts are also positive about the sector’s outlook. Todd\xa0 Sohn, a managing director in ETF and technical strategy, mentioned in an interview that there's a slight improvement in energy's performance despite the outflows. This doesn't stand as a clear signal on its own, but it hints at a positive change in sentiment. He suggests that this situation could now be seen as an opportunity for a contrarian move. Investors are attracted to energy companies because their stock prices are relatively low compared to some of the major technology stocks that drove the market's growth this year. They're seeking to expand their investments beyond the dominant tech stocks and see potential in the energy sector."", 'Another reason for investors’ inclination toward energy stocks is their commitment to shareholder return. Over the years, energy companies have maintained a practice of sharing profits with shareholders in the form of dividends, making their stocks attractive for income-focused investors. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) are some of the best dividend stocks from the energy sector.

The new tax reforms directly impact multinational companies across the globe. The Pillar Two tax reform, signed by 138 countries, accounts for 90% of global economic activity. As per the Pillar Two tax reform, the primary goal is to establish a level playing field for companies across countries. This will primarily be done by discouraging companies from lowering their corporate income taxes in a bid to attract foreign investment. Under the supervision of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), companies with €750 million or more in revenue, are obliged to pay a global minimum tax of 15% on earned income in each country they operate in. OECD suggests that the reform will push corporate taxes globally by $220 billion per year, almost 9% of global corporate income tax revenues. Deloitte further highlights that the Pillar Two tax reform does not limit itself to just taxes, instead, it shapes how multinationals operate their supply chain networks, execute acquisitions, and strategic decisions.', 'Moreover, the system and compliance data are not only difficult to adhere to, but they also demand a complex infrastructure, that businesses need to establish. Under the reform, multinationals will be required to provide data for 100 separate data points for each entity in an organization. Not only do companies have to remodel their organizational structure, but they also have to revisit their financial reporting timelines. Therefore, to address the need for a complex infrastructure, companies will not be expected to report 2024 returns until after 18 months, which provides ample time for companies to adapt and restructure.

It's one of the few AI segments already bringing in revenue thanks to its ability to instantly create text, images, videos, and computer code, which consumers and businesses are finding incredibly valuable."", ""Startups like OpenAI (the creator of ChatGPT) and Anthropic have led the way on generative AI, but it's spreading through the technology sector like wildfire, with some of the world's largest companies investing billions of dollars in development. Two publicly traded companies emerging as superpowers in the generative AI industry are Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) and C3.ai (NYSE: AI)."", ""Here's why investors should consider buying stakes in both of them right now."", 'Alphabet has been working on AI for years. In fact, Google purchased DeepMind, a research and development company focused on building AI responsibly, way back in 2014. Nevertheless, investors still believed Alphabet was behind the curve when Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) swooped in to acquire a $10 billion stake in OpenAI roughly a year ago.', 'Microsoft quickly integrated ChatGPT into its Bing search engine. It was initially perceived as a threat to the dominance of Google Search, which has a 91% market share. Simply put, prompting an AI chatbot for answers is a more convenient way to find information than entering a query into a traditional search engine and sifting through web pages.', 'Alphabet launched a speedy response to that threat. It now has a chatbot of its own called Bard, but the company also embedded AI into the traditional Google Search experience. Now, when users enter a query, the search engine often provides a text-based response at the top of the page to save them from clicking through to different web results.', ""Alphabet also just launched Gemini, the company's most powerful generative AI model yet. According to the company, it's the first model ever to outperform human experts on an MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding) basis. In other words, it's smarter than humans in many academic disciplines like elementary mathematics, U.S. history, and computer science (among others)."", ""Most importantly, Alphabet management says Gemini outperforms OpenAI's most advanced GPT-4 model across most text-based and multimodal (image, video, and audio) tasks. In a series of demonstrations, Gemini displayed an ability to understand all of those media formats with powerful reasoning. For example, when shown a drawing of a guitar, Gemini identified it and played its sound. When the user added a drawing of an amplifier, Gemini understood how that changed the guitar's sound."", 'Alphabet is monetizing its AI technology through its cloud computing platform for businesses, Google Cloud. But Microsoft is already seeing success embedding AI into applications like Word and Excel in exchange for an additional monthly fee. Considering there are an estimated 1.8 billion Gmail users and over 1 billion Google Docs users worldwide, Alphabet has a substantial monetization opportunity ahead.', ""Alphabet is on track to deliver $5.74 in earnings per share in 2023 (ending Dec. 31), giving its stock a price to earnings (P/E) ratio of just 23.4. That's cheaper than both Microsoft stock and the Nasdaq-100 index, which trade at P/E ratios of 36.2 and 28.3, respectively, making Alphabet one of the best value plays in the AI space."", 'C3.ai was founded in 2009 and it was an early provider of enterprise AI solutions. Today, it offers businesses over 40 different turnkey AI applications to help them harness the power of the technology without having to build it from scratch, which takes considerable time and resources. C3.ai specializes in predictive AI; its models help banks fight fraud, and they help oil and gas companies monitor thousands of pieces of equipment to help prevent failures.', ""The company launched C3 Generative AI earlier this year to capture the growing opportunity created by applications like ChatGPT. It's a highly advanced tool specifically designed for enterprises; almost any organization within any industry can embed it into their operations to create a powerful virtual assistant tailored to the specific needs of their business."", ""C3 Generative AI can ingest both structured and unstructured data, the latter of which is found in Word documents, PDFs, invoices, contracts, and other mediums. The company says two-thirds of data within most organizations is never utilized primarily because it's unstructured, but users can upload almost any document type to this new platform.\xa0From there, they can use the intuitive search and chat interface to generate more valuable and actionable insights than ever before."", ""C3.ai sells its AI applications to businesses directly, but it also has an extensive partner network that includes cloud giants like Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). It just expanded its collaboration with AWS by creating C3 Generative AI: AWS Marketplace Edition, which will make C3.ai's generative AI directly available to millions of businesses on the world's largest cloud platform."", 'C3.ai is currently transitioning away from a subscription-based revenue model toward a consumption one instead, so that businesses only pay for what they use. This will dramatically reduce the time C3.ai spends negotiating with new customers, allowing them to sign up far more quickly.', ""This shift initially caused a slowdown in C3.ai's revenue growth (by design) while existing customers converted, but in the recent fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Oct. 31), the company's sales jumped 17% year over year, which was the fastest pace in more than a year."", 'It could accelerate even further in the coming quarters, so investors have an opportunity to buy C3.ai stock right now ahead of a potential upswing in its business.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years."", 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

What’s more interesting is that, Parker-Hannifin’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future.

This SWOT analysis delves into the details of the filing to provide investors with a comprehensive understanding of the company's current position and future prospects. In fiscal year 2023, Synopsys Inc reported a total revenue of $5,842.62 million, a notable increase from the previous year's $5,081.54 million. The company's net income also saw a substantial rise to $1,229.89 million, compared to $984.59 million in 2022. These figures underscore the company's financial strength and its ability to generate profit in a competitive market."", ""Revenue Growth and Market Leadership: Synopsys Inc's revenue has consistently increased over the past three years, with a significant jump in the fiscal year 2023. This growth is a testament to the company's strong market position, particularly in the electronic design automation (EDA) and semiconductor intellectual property (IP) segments. Synopsys Inc's comprehensive product offerings and services have enabled it to become a trusted partner for engineers and product teams across the Silicon to Software spectrum."", ""Technological Innovation and Diverse Portfolio: The company's commitment to innovation is evident in its extensive patent portfolio, with more than 3,300 U.S. and foreign patents issued. Synopsys Inc's ability to anticipate technological shifts and deliver cutting-edge solutions has cemented its reputation as a leader in the industry. Its diverse portfolio, which spans design automation, IP products, and software integrity tools, provides a competitive edge by catering to a broad range of customer needs."", ""Competitive Pressure and Rapid Technological Change: Despite its strong market position, Synopsys Inc operates in a highly competitive industry where rapid technological advancements can quickly alter the landscape. The company faces stiff competition from other EDA vendors, such as Cadence Design Systems, Inc. and Siemens EDA, as well as from customers' own internal design tools and capabilities. To maintain its competitive edge, Synopsys Inc must continuously innovate and adapt to changing customer demands."", ""Dependence on Continuous R&D Investment: Synopsys Inc's success hinges on its ability to deliver innovative products that meet the evolving needs of the semiconductor and software industries. This requires substantial and ongoing investment in research and development, which can strain financial resources and impact operating margins. The company must manage its R&D expenditures carefully to ensure that they yield profitable outcomes."", ""Expansion in Software Integrity and AI Solutions: The growing demand for software security and quality testing presents a significant opportunity for Synopsys Inc to expand its Software Integrity segment.

By leveraging its expertise in these areas, Synopsys Inc can tap into new markets and customer segments."", ""Digitalization and Smart Everything Trend: The digital transformation of various end markets and the rise of the Smart Everything era offer vast opportunities for Synopsys Inc. The company's products and services are essential for the development of advanced semiconductors and electronic systems that power a connected landscape of smart devices. Synopsys Inc is well-positioned to benefit from this trend by providing the tools and technologies that enable innovation in this space."", ""Global Competition and Market Consolidation: The global nature of the semiconductor and software industries means that Synopsys Inc faces competition not only from established players but also from new entrants, particularly in regions like China. Government policies and investment funds in these regions may favor local companies, posing a threat to Synopsys Inc's international market share. Additionally, industry consolidation could lead to a reduction in the number of potential customers and increased bargaining power among the remaining players."", 'Intellectual Property and Legal Risks: While Synopsys Inc has a robust portfolio of patents, the risk of intellectual property infringement and related legal challenges is an ongoing concern. The company must navigate complex legal landscapes and protect its proprietary technologies from unauthorized use, which can result in costly litigation and potential damage to its reputation and financial standing.', ""In conclusion, Synopsys Inc (NASDAQ:SNPS) demonstrates strong financial performance and strategic positioning in the market, as evidenced by its latest 10-K filing. The company's strengths lie in its revenue growth, market leadership, and technological innovation. However, it must address weaknesses such as competitive pressure and the need for continuous R&D investment. Opportunities for expansion in software integrity services and AI solutions, along with capitalizing on the digitalization trend, are promising. Yet, threats from global competition, market consolidation, and intellectual property risks must be carefully managed. Synopsys Inc's forward-looking strategies indicate a commitment to leveraging its strengths and opportunities while addressing its weaknesses and threats, positioning it for continued success in the dynamic tech landscape."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Whether it's everyday stimulants such as coffee or illegal substances such as anabolic steroids, there are several substances that enable people to concentrate more and improve their productivity or athletic performance."", 'One such product category is the functional beverages segment. Functional beverages are a broad category, and some individual products that they include are energy drinks, tea, coffee, vitamin supplements, and even mineralized water. The premise behind these beverages is to supplement human nutrition and provide micronutrients, minerals, and vitamins that might be absent from a regular diet.', 'In terms of monetary value, the functional beverages market is quite sizeable. Research from Future Markets Insights shows that this market was worth a whopping $156 billion as of 2022 end and it is slated to grow to $164 billion by the end of this year.

This makes the functional beverage market one of the biggest in the world, and some drivers behind this rapid growth include a rising health trend in younger generations such as millennials and Gen Z. Additionally, an aging global population is also expected to stimulate demand, but constraints such as the need to ensure end to end supply chain visibility are some risks that can hamper market performance.', 'One of the more popular segments of the functional beverage market is the energy drink market.

Combining this with our analysis of the functional beverage market above, the energy drink segment accounts for more than a third of the broader revenue pie and its growth rate is also significantly faster than the broader market. Additionally, and as is the case with other industries such as construction and travel, Asia Pacific is expected to lead the energy drink market growth in the future. In particular, China is expected to post a 10% CAGR between 2020 and 2027, with a final market value of $33.7 billion by 2027.', ""But what about stocks?

(NASDAQ:GOOG). This is unsurprising as larger firms have considerable resources at their disposal, and they can often match the operational scale of smaller companies by setting up smaller business divisions."", ""Functional drinks are discretionary products, which means that their business operations are sensitive to high inflation.

The move is the latest in the mounting tensions between cabin crew and U.S. airline management that could result in the industry’s first labor action in more than a decade.', 'The agreement that Southwest’s nearly 19,000 flight attendants rejected included pay increases of 36% over five years and other quality of life improvements. The offer clearly was not enough: 64% of those who voted rejected the agreement.', '“The flight attendants of Southwest Airlines have made it clear that this proposed contract is not going to heal the hurt,” said Lyn Montgomery, president of the Transport Workers Union Local 556 that represents the crew members. “We will go back to the table to achieve the collective bargaining agreement that meets the needs of the hardest-working flight attendants in the industry.”', 'The union declined to comment further.', 'One area of disagreement concerns boarding pay. Almost all U.S. flight attendants are paid only when an aircraft door is closed, rather than during the boarding and deplaning process. Delta Air Lines is the sole U.S. carrier that pays cabin crew for boarding, a policy it added last year amid a drive to unionize (the airline’s cabin crew is currently not unionized).', 'Cabin crew unions at Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Spirit Airlines, and United Airlines are all in active contract negotiations. American flight attendants have gone as far as to authorize a potential strike.', 'Labor is having a moment in the U.S. Strikes have been successful in a number of high profile industries from the big auto manufacturers to actors and screenwriters in Hollywood. And the threat of strikes helped freight railroad employees reach long-sought deals. Organizing campaigns have succeeded at historically non-union companies like Starbucks.', '“People, they’re furious,” said Sara Nelson, president of the largest flight attendants union, the Association of Flight Attendants. “They’re furious that they haven’t been recognized, and their demands are very high.”', 'Flight attendants were on the frontlines of the pandemic. That included dealing with a surge in unruly fliers and having to enforce controversial rules like the mask mandate.', 'In addition to the ground pay issue, another issue concerns the work rules that govern when flights are delayed and canceled, said Embry-Riddle Professor Blaise Waguespack. This was top of mind for many Southwest crews following the airline’s meltdown last December when it “lost” many of its pilots and flight attendants.', 'Some airline executives have received big pay increases as their carriers have returned to profitability post-Covid. And pilots across the industry — even among historically lower-cost regional airlines — have ratified contracts with historic pay levels.', '“It’s a busy season for labor relations,” Waguespack said.', '“Flight attendants across the industry are tired of waiting,” said Julie Hedrick, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, which represents crews at American, in a September virtual town hall.', 'That is especially true of flight attendants at American. Their contract became amendable in January 2019 and cabin crew have not received a pay raise since then, Hedrick said.', 'The flat pay has come even as inflation has driven prices 18% higher than in 2019.', 'Strikes at airlines are governed by the U.S. Railway Labor Act. The law lays out strict rules: mediated talks, a strike authorization vote, followed by a release from mediation, and finally a 30-day so-called cooling off period before a strike can begin. There are typically several months between each step. And then, the president can still intervene and stop a strike.', 'The more than 23,000 flight attendants at American authorized a strike in August, and then sought a release from mediated talks in November. The request was denied by the National Mediation Board.', 'If flight attendants at American did strike — a big if — it would be the first at a U.S. airline since pilots at Spirit Airlines struck in June 2010. The scale of such an action at American, however, would be several orders of magnitude greater: Spirit flew less than 1% of all U.S. domestic flights in 2010 whereas American flies nearly 23% today, according to Cirium Diio data.', 'One needs to go back to 2005 to find the last time staff at a major airline went on strike – that’s when mechanics at Northwest Airlines walked off the job.', 'Even a “CHAOS,” or Create Havoc Around Our System, strike that only targets a few flights could be very disruptive. Neither the airline nor passengers know what flights will be affected in a CHAOS action until it happens, which could leave planes full of passengers stranded at the gate without crews.', 'The Association of Professional Flight Attendants asked American for a 35% pay increase at the date of signing and annual increases thereafter, while American offered just an 11% increase at signing, Hedrick said in September. The union declined to comment on the current status of negotiations.', '“There’s no way we’re getting the flight attendant contracts done across the industry without a credible strike threat,” Nelson said when asked if she thought a strike is needed to achieve the gains flight attendants seek. “One of the airlines is going to have to face that, [and] the rest are going to have to know that’s coming.”', 'Inflation hit every airline during the pandemic. During the first nine months of the year, unit costs excluding fuel — a measure of how much it costs an airline to fly a seat one mile — were up 15-23% at American, Delta, and United compared to 2019. And that was after they largely eased the run up in expenses after double-digit increases last year.', '“We are facing sizable [cost] headwinds with labor and [the] expectation of a new flight attendant agreement” next year, United Chief Financial Officer Michael Leskinen said in October.', 'That sentiment was shared by his counterparts at Alaska and American, who have all mentioned the potential for labor cost headwinds to Wall Street analysts in recent months.', 'Melius Research analyst Conor Cunningham estimates that a 20% pay increase for flight attendants would cost U.S. airlines roughly $1.9 billion annually, and increase industry unit costs excluding fuel by 1.3%. Add in the boarding pay sought by flight attendants, and expenses would jump another $718 million and unit costs another 0.5%. Southwest would face the largest increases among U.S. airlines.', '“Cost pressures continue to mount in the U.S. airline industry,” Cunningham wrote Monday. “Airlines have slowly been revising down January and February schedules to better match supply with demand in hopes of regaining pricing power … [But] the reduction in supply will further highlight the core cost issues.”', 'Southwest is alone among U.S. airlines as having factored a potential new flight attendant contract into its financial outlook.', 'Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.']"

Citi is one of three large American banks to be designated in “bucket 3 or 4” of the “global systemically important bank” (“G-SIB”) framework by The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The other banks in this group are J.P. Morgan and Bank of America.', 'As a G-SIB, Citi is subjected to increased regulatory supervision by global bank regulators and central banks. Enhanced regulatory supervision was an important post-crisis reform to strengthen the global financial system by increasing bank capital ratios, transparency, and decreasing risk-taking. These reforms resulted in the largest G-SIBs moving away from risk-oriented banking activities such as advisory, high-yield lending, and trading, towards lower-risk activities. Indeed, Citi’s most valuable, high-growth segment, Treasury and Trade Solutions, is in lower-risk and entrenched activities such as liquidity and cash management, payments, trade solutions, and automated receivables processing. In our view, somewhat unintuitively, Citi’s increased regulatory supervision contributes to the company’s less risky banking business model, and thus its attractiveness as a downside-oriented investment opportunity.', 'Citi’s market perception suffers from the bank’s negative historical reputation. In 2008 during the Great Financial Crisis, Citi received the most TARP funding (the largest “bailout”) of the U.S. banks. TARP funding was provided by the U.S. government to forestall a liquidity problem that threatened to become a solvency problem. More recently, Citi mistakenly used its own capital to pay lenders when acting as Revlon’s loan agent, resulting in a $400M fine by the Federal Reserve and orders to resolve internal controls (which Citi fulfilled). Citi’s large global consumer bank was assembled by prior management in the early 2000s to attract and service high-end global consumers. Unfortunately, this pivot was costly and ill-timed in the context of increasingly complex multi-jurisdictional regulation to prevent money laundering and tax evasion.

We've got a tribute to one of the greatest investors of all time, an early look at the holiday shopping trends and of course, stocks on our radar. But we're going to kick off today reflecting on November. Matt, it's a month of thanks and I think a lot of investors very thankful for the month that was."", 'Matt Argersinger: Very thankful, Dylan. What a month it was indeed. The S&P 500 up more than 9%, Nasdaq 100 which has already been on a super tear this year, was up another 11% in November. Russell 2000 by the way. Small caps which have really not participated finally had a good month up 9% and one of my favorite parts of the market, Real Estate Investment Trust which you have had a horrible year up 12% in November. This is probably the kicker for me guys. This is according to a report from Bank of America, the classic 60, 40 portfolio, 60% stocks, 40% bonds. The much belign 60, 40 portfolio, is least recently that was up 9.6% in November. That was the best month for that strategy in more than 32 years going back to December 1991, the month the USSR dissolved, by the way. That is quite a historic record right there. How about that? It seems like everything did well in November.', ""Dylan Lewis: Nice to see stocks not alone in the rally bonds in on the action as well. Jason, we typically see a little bit of a Santa rally in December. This one's coming in a little bit earlier for us. What do you see as you look at the past month?"", ""Jason Moser: Well, I think what we saw, we saw a relatively decent earning season. I mean, we saw a lot of companies that there was continued language in regard to scrutinize spending, I heard a couple of elongated sales cycles in there. Still companies are doing a very good job of focusing on the money that's going out. I mean, it's not just about growing that revenue anymore, but a lot of companies are really focused on the money that's going out and they're really doing a good job of pairing that back, making the businesses a little bit more efficient. We're seeing margins expanding in some cases. It's not across the board. There are some pockets of weakness there and some questions. I think it's going to be an interesting holiday season from a retail perspective. But generally speaking, I think particularly considering tech, because that's really been most under the microscope, we are seeing that these companies are taking a look at this and saying, let's focus a little bit more on actually making some money and it's amazing what just shifting that narrative a little bit can really do to investor sentiment."", 'Dylan Lewis: That was November, and we are here taping on December 1 and as we were heading into production, Fed Chair Jerome Powell turned the lights on at the party and said, hey, we may not be totally done here yet, Matt. [LAUGHTER].', ""Matt Argersinger: That's right. He gave a speech on a Friday morning and it's something Powell has done a few times, I think over the past, say, year and a half, where he's come on and said, hey everyone, like you said, turn on the lights of the party. Isn't that the worst the music goes out, lights go on, it's awful."", ""Dylan Lewis: We're here to hang out for a while."", ""Matt Argersinger: I know, but no, he said hold on. Way too early to say that we're done actually raising rates, which I think is surprising. He says not until we have the full confidence, the Fed has the full confidence that inflation is heading back to our target of 2%. Basically, he said this without saying it. But he said the Fed is not even thinking about lowering rates, which is very in contrast to what we're seeing. Because if you look at, for example, the CME's Fed Watch Tool, looking at the March Fed meeting, they're looking at a 53% chance of a cut. If Pals come out and said we're not even thinking about thinking about cutting, there is a little bit of a conflict here. Now, I would say for all the things Jason said about corporate earnings, I think corporations have done a magnificent job managing their margins, especially during this. But I think one of the reasons the market rallied so much is because there's a sense that, even if the Fed is it might not be lowering, at least they're probably done hiking. We can sort of have a little more confidence in the level of interest rates and we can manage our balance sheets and our credit needs accordingly, that's a big thing. But now, if you're telling me that investors are actually thinking of a Fed cut is coming early in the year, that makes me a little more nervous."", ""Dylan Lewis: Matt, I'm just impressed that you got through thinking about twice. [LAUGHTER]. Well, cleanly, I struggled through it. Just trying to get out of that once from the big macro, we are going to check in on two big brands. Jason, Apple will be exiting its credit card relationship with Goldman Sachs. The tech firm reportedly submitted a proposal that would end the relationship in the next year. A bit of a change in strategy for both these businesses. This was the culmination of two initiatives for each of them and a new brand of business or a new type of business for both of them. What do you make of this partnership dissolving?"", ""Jason Moser: It feels like it's probably the best solution for both parties involved. This is an interesting story because it brings a lot of companies into play here. You've got Apple and Goldman Sachs of course, but then you've got other companies that are interested in perhaps taking over that Apple business like American Express, or even synchrony. A lot of parties in play here. I think Apple's card aspirations on the one hand it can be seen as an acquisition tool. It's a way for them to give consumers access to more Apple devices. It's an easier way for consumers to be able to finance those devices, give it to you interest free over time, whatever it may be. And for Goldman at the time, it seemed like a reasonable bet in their consumer aspirations. You're saddling up with Apple, one of the biggest networks out there with billions upon billions of users, it feels like. But it just, it hasn't worked out that well and I think it's probably something that was a little bit, both parties were at fault here. I think when you saddle up with Apple, the idea is that you're saddling up with one of the biggest, most important companies in the world. Now, the other side of that coin is that Apple, because of their size, they can really command a lot out of that relationship as well. That typically means lower pricing. Granted, there's higher volume there. But I think also with Apple, this was a way for them to continue increasing engagement. Give people who want to be a part of that Apple universe a reason to stay in that Apple universe. You have your finances with them that means that you're going to find more value in the devices with Apple that you're using, it all makes sense when you look at how this relationship was born and the concessions that Apple demanded from Goldman. They were calling for essentially all applicants to be approved. They want to essentially 100% approval rate, and they went with an atypical billing cycle that essentially was the beginning of the month, whereas all other card companies do it on a rolling basis. That helps smooth out those finances, and so I think Goldman maybe felt like, you know what, this is far more trouble than it's worth. Apple looked at it and saying, well, if it's not going to be Goldman, I'm sure we can find another partner and I think that's ultimately what happens. I think Apple probably continues to try to make this work just with another partner. I would say that other partner better take a look at this example here and maybe push back on some of those demands that Apple's thrown out there."", ""Dylan Lewis: We've heard for years exactly how difficult it is to be a supplier of Apple. Usually we're talking about small chip companies going into business with them and how those contracts are incredibly demanding. Wind up straining some of the financials of those businesses because Apple can get such favorable terms. Funny to see a company like Goldman Sachs wind up in that same spot."", ""Jason Moser: Again, I think this is something that for Apple, it's not really a needle mover on the business. It's another service that they can offer and this is clearly becoming more and more of a services business as they work to diversify that revenue away. I don't think Apple card users really care what bank is behind all of this. Most of the time they're not really worried about the issuer of the bank as long as they are still affiliated with that Apple brand, that Apple card. I don't think Apple's going to have any problem finding another partner. But I think it'll be noteworthy how that new relationship is actually structured. Switching gears. It was a busy week for Elon Musk and we're going to maybe sidestep some of the deal book comments and discussion because we did see our first look at some of the details on Tesla's cyber truck. Matt, this was something that was first unveiled as an idea back in 2019. It is now 2023. We have a sense of what this product looks like, some of the costs, some of the specs. What did you think of the announcement?"", 'Matt Argersinger: Well, first of all, I have to say the last few days, it feels like such a perfect representation of Elon Musk\'s personality. He goes from, like you said, this, let\'s be fair, bizarre, confusing, maybe even uncomfortable at times interview at Deal Books Summit in New York to the very next day giving this exciting almost Steve Jobs-esque unveiling of the cyber truck in Austin, Texas, or as he put it, the biggest product launch of anything by far on Earth this year. He might be right cause whatever you want to say, I think about Elon Musk the person and I have a lot of things to say, but Elon Musk, the engineer, the product designer, the salesman, is truly something entirely different and I do think the demand for the cyber truck is going to be huge. We can get into the specs, but it has more than one million reservations. It\'s a product that I think a lot of people four years ago certainly thought there was no chance in heck that this thing was going to roll off the production line anytime soon yet they are really rolling it off beginning this year. I have to say it\'s such a unique design, you have such a big Elon musk fan base and I really do believe him when he says, ""The future looks like the future with this thing"". I find myself intrigued and I do feel like it\'s going to be a success as is often the case with Musk. Some of the details they announced in 2019. A little bit different when they come to real reality here in 2023. I believe the base model will cost around $61,000. The upscale cyber base model, 100K. One of the things that I think is interesting here, Jason, is we saw this announced in 2019. It is now being revealed in 2023 and we\'ll probably see people really drive them on the roads in 2024 and 2025. The market for EVs and in particular truck EVs has changed pretty dramatically in that time.', ""Jason Moser: It has, and EVs are going through their own little moment right now where there are some questions as to the value proposition and there's consumer reports data out there showing that people are having more problems with EVs than ICs or even other vehicles."", ""Jason Moser: Whether that's the case or not, I think with Tesla, when you look at these trucks, it's very difficult to understand exactly what kind of driver wants this cybertruck. I think the cybertruck is a niche product that will probably do OK. I don't know how the company is ultimately defining success. For me, success is this is a contributor to the business. It sounds like for the immediate future, for the near future, at least for the foreseeable future, it's going to be something that loses money until they actually figure this whole thing out, because just making the truck on its own is a really difficult and arduous process. For most people that are driving these big trucks, the trucks are a tool of their trade. It's something that matters, that needs to be reliable. They need to know that it's going to work and how to fuel it up and use and whatnot. I don't know that they're necessarily going to be the ones making the leap to a cybertruck in the near term. Now, I think that as this iterates, as it evolves, there will be more opportunities to open that market opportunity up to more of those types of truck owners. For now, I think you probably see a few on the road, and we'll see how this develops."", ""Dylan Lewis: Coming up after the break, we've got a tribute and some of our favorite Mungerisms.

It is Mount Rushmore, for sure. If you're talking about, as the young people say, goat, greatest of all time, Warren Buffett is the goat when it comes to investing. But I'm not sure he's quite the goat without Charlie Munger. If you look at Berkshire Hathaway's market value per share, 57 years ago, when he took over the textile mill in Massachusetts and turned this into one of the most successful businesses and companies of all time, he and Munger compound market value per share for Berkshire just under 20% a year for 57 years. Almost six decades. More than double the annual compound return of the S&P 500. Just to put that in dollar terms, if you had invested $100 in Berkshire Hathaway the moment after Buffett took over, that $100 would have turned into $2.96 million today."", ""Dylan Lewis: Matt, to your point about the duo, I think of Buffett and Munger as Brady and Belichick. They're both individually great, but what they've done together, just absolutely incredible, and I don't know that we're going to see it again."", ""Matt Argersinger: No, I don't think so. If I could tell a quick story, J. Mo was involved in this too, is early 2015, Jason and I took over a million-dollar portfolio, which is the service we had here at the Motley Fool. As we were thinking about how to run this service, the first thing that came to mind was a quote by Charlie Munger. It goes something like this: If you buy something because it's undervalued, then you have to think about selling it when it approaches your calculation of its intrinsic value. That's hard. But if you buy just a few great companies, then you can sit on your butt. That's a good thing. Now, Charlie used a little bit more colorful language than I just did. But that to me was such more than any quote from Charlie Munger has told me. It really isn't about trying to always constantly massage your portfolio. Deciding what to buy, when to buy, what to sell, when to sell. Find great companies, buy them, hold them. I think that was the lesson he also gave to Buffett six decades ago as well."", ""Jason Moser: Well, I was going to say you're right because Buffett was the cigar-butt guy."", 'Matt Argersinger: Absolutely.', 'Jason Moser: He is the Graham cigar-butt guy. Munger was the guy that came in today. What about just buying good businesses at fair prices?', 'Matt Argersinger: Yes.', ""Jason Moser: Buy good businesses at reasonable prices and then Matt says, sit on our butts and just go about this. Now, I think one interesting thing, and the returns numbers you quoted there are phenomenal, it's fascinating to think, and Munger is on record as saying this, he said, you know what? We could have doubled the size of Berkshire, had we done just one thing; used the leverage. It's something we talk about leverage a lot here because leverage can be a very dangerous tool. It can be a helpful tool for certain investors if you know what you're doing, but it raises the degree of difficulty when it comes to investing. He said, we could have used leverage and Berkshire would have been worth twice as much. He said the reason why they didn't do it, was because they didn't want to disappoint the people that had been with them for so long. They generated a lot of wealth. He's like if we lose three quarter of our money, we're still rich. But a lot of these people that have made all this money along the way with us, they're just individual investors. We would have let them down in a big way in understanding the nature of leverage in the fickle nature of markets. Using leverage boils down to market timing in some senses. They made that conscious decision; no, we're not going to do that, we've got our process in place. I think that's a great lesson for investors is, know what you don't know, get your process in place, and trust the process. What? Bell check, right?"", 'Dylan Lewis: As a testament to the process and really just by keeping it simple, how easy they were able to make things for themselves, one of the top 10 largest companies in the United States, even without the benefit of using leverage, so even doing things the right way, doing things simply, and not exposing themselves to too much risk, I think they did just OK. [laughs]', ""Matt Argersinger: I think they did more than OK. I would say, and beyond also just buying wonderful businesses. One of the hardest things we do as investors is holding great businesses. It's one thing to identify a wonderful business, buy a wonderful business at a fair, reasonable price. Most of us just don't hold those businesses long enough. If you look at their holdings in Coca-Cola, American Express, even Apple, which is more recent purchase they've held that for almost a decade now, a lot of us just have a hard time doing that. As an individual investors, we see a stock we own go up 50%, we're like, hey, should I think about selling? Is the market at the top? What if I don't sell and the dry stock drops 20%? That is also part of the genius, it's part of the goating, which was not just buying wonderful businesses, but holding them, which is such a hard thing to do if you're an individual investor."", ""Dylan Lewis: I think, Matt, modeling that behavior, talking about that, and being very open about it as such great investors probably helped investor outcomes on the retail side, almost more than anybody else. I think it's probably Jack Bogle, Warren Buffett, and Charlie Munger, in terms of like good investing behavior and lessons."", ""Matt Argersinger: Exactly. Lessons that any investor could follow. These were the lessons. What's amazing to me is, I think it was Jeff Bassos who asked Buffett once, why aren't there more investors like you? Why don't they just copy you and do what you do? The whole refrain was, well, because people, they want to be rich fast, they don't want to get rich slowly, and that's what we did, and they did it better than anyone else."", 'Dylan Lewis: J. Mo, Matt mentioned a Mungerism that he particularly enjoys. Anything jump out to you?', ""Jason Moser: Yeah. The one that I noted earlier this week and the impact I think that Munger has had on my life from reading and the listening to him speak overall is just patience. It goes back to what you were saying. One of my favorite quotes, the big money is not in the buying and selling, but in the waiting. That really is what it boils down to. A lot of people don't want to hear that because like Matty said, they want to get rich quick. That's not the way it works. You determine your process, you do what works best for you. But I think over time, what we found is that Munger and Buffett came up with something pretty special there. It's not a bad idea to try to mirror that patience. It's not easy all the time, but it matters."", ""Dylan Lewis: Gentlemen, we're going to see you a little bit later in the show. Up next, we've got to check in on holiday spend and places we're seeing deflation in pricing. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money."", ""Vera Lynn: We'll meet again. Don't know where, don't know when. But I know we'll meet again some sunny day. Keep smiling through just like you always do 'til the blue sky drive the dark clouds."", ""Dylan Lewis: Welcome back to Motley Fool Monday. I'm Dylan Lewis. The holiday season is in full swing and we've got an early read on results from Cyber Monday and Black Friday, thanks to Adobe. The firm is the source for online holiday spend data. We caught up with the Vivek Pandya, their lead insights analyst to get a sense of the trends he's seeing in the numbers this winter and whether it makes sense to buy now or wait for some of the items on your list. Let's dive right in. Your firm reported a record $9.8 billion in Black Friday online sales and over 12 billion in Cyber Monday sales. How do you think online retailers and shoppers are looking so far this holiday season?"", ""Vivek Pandya: It's been, I think, something that they've been anticipating in terms of where they would land for these major days. Buyer propensity is the strongest on Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday. I think they're probably feeling pretty good about the momentum that they've experienced through these five days. I think what we're going to have to keep a closer eye on is how the demand continues to persist from where we are post Cyber Monday through the rest of the season. I also think they'll have to think a little bit more about how they approach early seasonal discounts, which they did in late October all the way into early November. In the past, that has done well for them. But this season, with the consumers priority around price and discount magnitudes, they really return back to Black Friday and Cyber Monday for their shopping. That's something the retailers are going to have to continue to think about in 2024."", ""Dylan Lewis: If I'm not mistaken, I think Black Friday spend was up somewhere around 7% year over year. We saw, I think, Cyber Monday results up nearly 10% over 2022. There are a lot of different reasons why those numbers could be going up. I think inflation is probably top of mind for a lot of people. Do you feel like we're seeing a mix of inflation and increases in demand and volume a little bit more, one or the other?"", ""Vivek Pandya: It's a great question because with online retail prices, those have actually been coming down year on year for the past couple of years because we did see prior to the pandemic, we would continue to see online deflation. The reason for that is you'd have more and more online retail merchants enter the space. That gives the consumer much more choice and there's more competition, and that puts a downward pressure on prices. We also saw with categories like electronics, you have the newer products coming out and that pushes prices down on the older versions. That deflation was pretty apparent pre-pandemic. Then we had these supply chain issues that really put consumers in a position where they were seeing much higher prices across the board. Even for online goods, the demand was so high. But then as we got to 2022, the summer where gas prices started going up and durable and goods demand started coming down, that put online prices back on this deflationary trajectory. A lot of the growth that we're seeing is purely because people are buying more goods and buying more items. I think online retailers can really take a lot away from that. I will say that especially in certain categories like electronics, apparel prices and discounts are in the range of 20%-30% That puts a lot of impact in terms of good demand because of just people buying more goods."", ""Dylan Lewis: Let's talk a little bit about what people are buying. You mentioned a couple of different categories there, where are you seeing a lot of interest and are there any particular products that you're seeing really spike this holiday season?"", ""Vivek Pandya: Well, the good news is we've seen strong boosts in categories across the board. Even categories like apparel that had softer, flat to negative growth in the off season and the rest of the time in 2023, had a bit of a boost through the Cyber Five. With apparel, you really have products that have gone viral on TikTok, things like that. The Birkenstocks, the UGG Tasman slippers, and then we have cosmetic products that have done well because the gift sets and all that are really popular this season. Electronics are massive this time of the year. With the supply chain issues easing, it's a lot easier for people to get a hold of PS5s and Xbox Series X and things like that this season than previous seasons. That's helping. We've also had the iPhone 15 release, which had an initial launch and that picked up some demand. But usually the consumer continues to want some of these goods into Christmas. It has the momentum through the gift giving season. Then obviously, toys are pretty massive this time of the year. You end up seeing the perennial favorites like the Lego and the Barbie products, but you end up seeing variations. I think about Tamagotchis, which have been around for decades, but now you have the Tamagotchi Nano, Harry Potter version, which is a much more advanced version than probably we grew up with as kids. These types of items continue to be popular and we see an uptick, especially this time of year."", 'Dylan Lewis: Everything old is new again, right?', 'Vivek Pandya: Exactly.', ""Dylan Lewis: Exactly. You mentioned the Cyber Five earlier and I think Black Friday and Cyber Monday continue to be the main events and they get a lot of the headlines. But it does seem like, at least anecdotally, the individual days are being blurred a little bit more. Those big days are still important, but is that what you guys are seeing in the data where it's more of a season of shopping rather than these big tent pole days?"", ""Vivek Pandya: Well, in previous years it definitely became the early season, blurring into Thanksgiving. But this season, it's been very much the discount magnitude strengthened within the 5%-10% range to the 20-35% range as we got into Thanksgiving week. You had Thanksgiving all the way up to Cyber Monday, have really strong discounts and those ones were blurring into each other. The Black Friday deals were transforming into early Cyber Monday deals. You saw that transition. But what was interesting was something like Thanksgiving, where consumers are used to going out to the shops. Five, 10 years ago, they'd go out to the shops after Thanksgiving meal and get another deal on a TV or something like that. But then with the pandemic, those stores closed on Thanksgiving and they remain closed, but the buyer propensity and that buy mode that they're in continues to persist. That's when they just turn to their smartphones after eating or while they're talking to family and then start doing their shopping. That's where we saw a lot of spending velocity kick up and that's where we saw $5.5 billion. That really set the tone for what we would see from Black Friday to Cyber Monday."", ""Dylan Lewis: Earlier you mentioned people looking at their phones and doing some shopping. By my count, I think for e-commerce desktop is still king. But it seems like it's barely still king. What are we seeing in terms of mobile and desktop shopping this year?"", ""Vivek Pandya: It's exactly right, because we're crossing this threshold where mobile devices will make up about 51% share for the season and become technically the majority way that people buy online goods. However, when we think about certain days like Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday, it's already surging beyond that 51%. We almost hit 60% on Thanksgiving because as I said, there's just so much of a shift to smartphones. Well, when you're around with family, you don't want to pull out your laptop and then start shopping. But you might pull out your smartphone and be comfortable doing some shopping there. It's been really important for retailers to ensure that their mobile experiences are state of the art and are seamless and frictionless so that when the consumer does that impulse buying, they can support that demand. Because what we still see is online conversion rates and buyer rates being stronger on online desktop. We really need to see that level of strength in mobile device conversion because that's where all the momentum is going."", 'Dylan Lewis: Are there any retailers that are doing anything particularly interesting or novel with mobile to try to boost those conversion rates?', ""Vivek Pandya: Well, we think about a lot of these online retailers across the board leveraging these initiatives to get consumers to download the mobile apps, provide additional value and discounts if they download the mobile app because that strengthens the relationship, it becomes less cost prohibitive to engage them once they've downloaded the mobile app and the conversion is stronger. We see constant encouragement to download mobile apps to leverage certain types of deals, to scan QR codes. All these types of things are designed to have consumers who are very mobile first continue to think about e-commerce from a mobile first lens too. You see it also with social media apps. TikTok has been quite the social media story these past couple of years. There's been a lot of investment into these social media advertising platforms so that they can extract the value and have the consumer who's maybe going to these apps just to browse videos and things like that to quickly be shifted into the buy mode too."", ""Dylan Lewis: I think one thing a lot of consumers have gotten used to over the last couple of years is seeing the option to buy now pay later as they are checking out. I look at the consumer, and we've talked about this a lot on our show. It feels like we have stretched consumers between inflation, interest rates rising, student loan payments going up. It seems like there is probably going to be a decent number of people who are looking for either holiday spend to go on credit card spend or buy now pay later options. What are you seeing over there?"", ""Vivek Pandya: The buy now pay later growth has been quite something even prior to getting into the holiday season. We're expecting about 17% growth for the season in terms of buy now pay later utilization. That will mean out of the $222 billion spent this holiday season, about $17 billion will be processed specifically through buy now pay later. We're already hitting that growth momentum right now. We've seen over eight billion dollar spent. It's definitely something consumers are leaning on. I would say multiple consumers and different audiences are leveraging it for different reasons. Some of them are maybe social savvy, younger consumers and they're going through the payment checkout process and they see, I thought I was going to spend $200. They're saying, I can just do $50 and just break it up into payments. It entices them to just jump on that bandwagon very quickly. Other consumers are in more of a financially strained position and they're having to lean on buy now pay later in order to support their gift giving budget. Really that's one of the things where we're going to have to just continue to see how that moves in the context of larger online growth. What I will say is you have that utilization. You've seen growth in integrations with buy now pay later. It's been a growth factor, but I think we'll have to see in the off season, so coming into 2024, how those growth rates continue to persist."", ""Dylan Lewis: One of the other consumer stories we've been seeing as a result of some of those pressures is this idea of consumers trading down a little bit and looking for lower priced items or maybe moving from one retailer to more of a discount retailer. Do you see any of that in the data that you're looking at?"", ""Vivek Pandya: Well, it's something that we've kept a close eye on, I had mentioned earlier that since we started to see online inflation turn to online deflation."", ""Vivek Pandya: That really started kicking off as we look at how the prices shifted from 2021 into to mid 2023. What we're finding is, yes, people have absolutely downshifted to the cheaper goods. We've seen people go from organic products to non organic to save money there. We've seen people go from the higher end luxury version of a cosmetic item or apparel to the cheaper version. The exception a little bit is you see consumers being a little less price sensitive to that during the holiday season. Because A, discounts are helping bring down prices overall, and B, they're usually giving gifts to other people. They're very conscientious of how, the gifts will appear, that they got the person, the premium gift they were looking for versus a cheaper substitute. That's where we see a little bit more of a return to the premium luxury. But in the off season and when we're not in the holiday season, Bonanza, that's when we see people downshifting a lot to the cheaper versions. Cheaper, is sometimes they go for a completely different alternative altogether to make the most of their budget within these categories."", ""Jason Moser: You mentioned the discounting there, and my last question for you, Vivek is really, in service of our listeners, we saw the huge discounting happen as we would expect during the Cyber 5, and ahead of the Cyber 5. Based on what you're seeing, is this where we're going to see discounts bottom out, or should people wait a little bit on some of these purchases for the holidays?"", ""Vivek Pandya: I would say for the most part, they have bottomed out. Especially in the key categories like apparel electronics. We do expect to see a bit more stronger discounting on December 4th for sporting goods. That's just how that particular category has. We've seen the pricing trends over the years. A bit in early December, maybe a bit more of a deal on sporting goods, but outside of that we're starting to see the discounts we can dissipate across a lot of the products. That's, again, almost seasonally how it's worked in previous years. Credit to retailers, they've had to train consumers that this is the moment and then that's why we also see a lot of spend velocity in the six to 11:00 PM. PST time on Cyber Monday, we see about over $4 billion spent that way because everyone's trying to get the discounts and get their shopping out of the way."", ""Dylan Lewis: Listeners, we'll put a link to Adobe's holiday shopping tracker in our show notes Coming up after the break, Jason Moser and Matt Argersinger return with a couple stocks on their radar. Stay right here, you're listening to motley money."", ""As always, people in the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about in the motley fool. May have formal recommendations for or against, start, buy, sell, anything based solely on what you hear. I'm Dylan Lewis joined again by Jason Moser and Matt Argersinger. We tend to focus on stocks here at the motley fool, but this week we are profiling a different investment. NBA owner and Shark Cubin is selling his majority stake in the Dallas Mavericks to Miriam Adelson, the largest shareholder in Las Vegas Sands. Matt, Cuban will remain in charge of basketball operations and he'll keep a small stake in the business. But this seems like an interesting choice in an interesting moment."", ""Matt Argersinger: Yes, it was a surprise to me and that's because, I think of Mark Cuban as a pretty successful businessman and investor. Well a highly successful businessman and investor, but at the same time he's this, highly passionate sports fan and team owner. Him selling his majority stake in what I thought was his passion makes me think he's calling a little bit of a medium term top in the market, in terms of professional sports team valuations, especially for non NFL franchise. I think if you look at the Jason and we were talking about this earlier in the week, NBA Major League Baseball, anything not in the NFL. I feel like we might be a little bit of a top and I think Mark Cuban actually might be calling that Cuban."", ""Dylan Lewis: Cuban timed it pretty well when it came to the.comboom. I think he may be able to time this one and we'll see."", 'Matt Argersinger: I think so.', ""Dylan Lewis: Let's get over to stocks on our radar. Our man behind the glass, Dan Boyd, is going to hit you with a question. Jason, you're up first. What are you looking at this week?"", ""Jason Moser: Yeah. Keep an eye on Docusign. Ticker is DOCU. Earnings come out Wednesday after the market closes. They've got new Ish CEO Alan Tiger said he's been there about a year now, a little over a year. We should continue to hear more and more about CLM. Contract life cycle management. That's really the key to the long term strategy here, is taking that core specialty and E signature and just, expanding it out to that full life cycle management. They're adding features and capabilities that are working out. Last quarter reported a total customer base of 1.44 million. That was up 12% from a year. They also saw 6% year over year increase in customers with annualized contract value exceeding $300,000. A total of 1047 customers there. Those are metrics to keep an eye on. They tell us that not only are they landing new customers, but they're expanding the relationships with those customers, even in a time of scrutinized spending and elongated sales cycles. But listen, this is a company, they're going through a tough time, but they've grown revenue at a compound annual rate of 45% over the last five years. Good balance sheet, you want to see that stock based compensation continue to come down, but I think they're doing a good job of keeping the hyperbole to a minimum getting out of this pandemic, stay at home stock mentality and just getting back down to brass tacks. I'll be interested to see what one day brings."", 'Dylan Lewis: Dan a question about Docusign?', ""Dan Boyd: So the Docusign stock price is flat. If you don't count the pandemic, it's like the pandemic never happened. It's back to pre pandemic levels. Does this company have enough of a Mote?"", ""Jason Moser: Man, I tell you, I think Mote is a very overused term. I don't know that they necessarily have a mode. There's competition out there, primarily in the form of Adobe. But again, I think this boils down to contract life cycle management. The more they can build out capabilities beyond a signature, the more of a competitive advantage they can build through."", 'Dylan Lewis: Matt, what is on your radar this week?', ""Matt Argersinger: Epr Properties. Dylan ticker, EPR. This is a real estate investment trust. You know, I love my reads. For all intents and purposes, this company was dead man walking after the pandemic, their biggest real estate holding movie theaters. Tough business. Well, and especially after one of their largest tenants, Regal Entertainment, filed for bankruptcy last year. Business is far from dead though, thriving this year, revenue in the third quarter is up 17%. Most of the theaters that were closed as part of the Regal bankruptcy have reopened with two operators portfolio was 99% lease at the end of the quarter, great balance sheet, eight times earnings and a 7% dividend yield. I can't turn away from this one. I'm looking to actually add to my position.Dan, a question about EPR properties."", ""Dylan Lewis: Matt, you go into movie theaters because I haven't been to one since 1919."", ""Matt Argersinger: I have it, but that's mainly because I have a four year old son at home, but I plan to get back there pretty soon. All right. Dan, which one are you putting on your watch list?"", ""Dan Boyd: I got to tell you, I feel like docusign is becoming a verb like Xerox and Kleenex out there. It's like someone's going to send me a Docusign because."", ""Matt Argersinger: I'm going to go Docusign."", ""Dylan Lewis: That's usually a sign of brand strength. I'm right there with you, Dan.

They're now expected to see 13% to 15% revenue decline for the entire year. So yes, toy sales have been sluggish."", ""They have been struggling now for quite some time. Consumers under a tremendous amount of pressure. They're being forced to make some of these tough decisions like not spending on toys. And as a result, a number of companies are suffering. And you're seeing Hasbro making that tough decision here with announcing the fact that it's going to slash nearly 20% of the workforce."", ""But Brad, I also want to get to the point that this is part of a broader narrative that we're starting to see play out here as we enter in or get ready for the end of the year. A number of companies have come out in recent weeks talking about layoffs, plans to announce layoffs, or they are announcing layoffs here ahead of the end of the year."", ""And also EY out with some news here this morning saying that they are going to be cutting more jobs here in the US amid a very challenging economic environment here for the company. Some of those layoffs are going to include more partners than usual. Now, this is something that we've seen from some of the other big four, other consulting firms out there in the street."", ""KPMG laid off staff over the summer. It was nearly 2% of the US staff earlier in the year, as well. Deloitte also cutting some of its staff. So what we're seeing here from EY and more broadly speaking, some of these layoffs here ahead of the end of the year. Companies are really trying to right-size to better position themselves as you look ahead to a very uncertain 2024."", ""BRAD SMITH Yeah, and that uncertainty weighs on the prospects for deal making, too, at the end of the day. And those consultants very much present within those deal-making conversations, and ultimately coming off of this year in 2023 where we've seen a major slip up in the amount of M&A activity. I think that's one area where, of course, EY is going to be impacted, as well, and making some cuts to try and get ahead of that.""]"

This payment means that the dividend yield will be 3.1%, which is around the industry average."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Packaging Corporation of America ', ""We like to see a healthy dividend yield, but that is only helpful to us if the payment can continue. Prior to this announcement, Packaging Corporation of America's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This indicates that quite a large proportion of earnings is being invested back into the business."", 'The next year is set to see EPS grow by 14.5%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 56% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.', ""Even over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $1.25 total annually to $5.00. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 15% per annum over that time. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable."", ""Investors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. Unfortunately, Packaging Corporation of America's earnings per share has been essentially flat over the past five years, which means the dividend may not be increased each year. Packaging Corporation of America is struggling to find viable investments, so it is returning more to shareholders. This isn't necessarily bad, but we wouldn't expect rapid dividend growth in the future."", 'Overall, we like to see the dividend staying consistent, and we think Packaging Corporation of America might even raise payments in the future. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.', ""It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

On Tuesday, it dropped a dataset of 18,000 shows and movies (which make up 99% of its catalog), listing how many hours of viewership they each amassed in the first six months of 2023. And it plans to continue releasing this information every six months.', ""Ginny & Georgia was one of the top-performing series during the January to June period, with nearly 1 billion hours watched, the equivalent of 110,410 years. Other top performers were The Night Agent and Suits, with a respective 93,000 and 68,000 years' worth of hours viewed."", '“This is the actual data we use to run the business,” co-CEO Ted Sarandos said in a press briefing on Tuesday. Altogether, Netflix’s 238.4 million subscribers (as of June 30) spent nearly 100 billion hours watching Netflix over the six-month period.', 'Throughout Netflix’s existence, “the one constant is that people are asking for more viewing information,” Sarandos said. By not providing it, the company took pressure off creators to produce breakout hits, but it also unintentionally built an atmosphere of mistrust that the company is now looking to repair, he said. The announcement follows months of negotiations with labor unions representing Hollywood writers and actors, in which the unions demanded greater transparency from studios.', 'Netflix is publishing the raw data in the name of such transparency, which “creates a better environment for the [writers’ and actors’] guilds, for us, for the producers, and for the press,” according to Sarandos. While advertisers might find this data useful in making decisions on how to spend their budgets, Netflix will continue to use third-party data to determine the cost of ads.', 'But the data, while informative, doesn’t give a total picture of the company. Since it has set six-month parameters, it isn’t an objective gauge of popularity. Wednesday, for example, premiered in November, while the hours-viewed metric begins in January. The show ranks lower than season two of Ginny & Georgia, which launched in early January and benefits from its early watchers being included in the metric. Netflix also has no plans to break down the data into month-by-month or country-level lists, Sarandos said, because that would offer intelligence to its competitors.', 'Other streaming services have largely followed Netflix’s example in guarding title-level viewership data, so Netflix’s move could lead others to follow suit. “It will be up to them,” Sarandos said, adding that competitors are in a different phase of the streaming business and that 10 years ago, Netflix thought differently about sharing data as well.', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

(NYSE:M) will pay a dividend of $0.1654 on the 2nd of January. The dividend yield will be 3.5% based on this payment which is still above the industry average."", ""While the dividend yield is important for income investors, it is also important to consider any large share price moves, as this will generally outweigh any gains from distributions. Investors will be pleased to see that Macy's' stock price has increased by 68% in the last 3 months, which is good for shareholders and can also explain a decrease in the dividend yield."", "" Check out our latest analysis for Macy's "", ""A big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. However, based ont he last payment, Macy's was earning enough to cover the dividend pretty comfortably. The business is earning enough to make the dividend feasible, but the cash payout ratio of 81% shows that most of the cash is going back to the shareholders, which could constrain growth prospects going forward."", 'Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 56.4% over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 16%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.', ""The company has a long dividend track record, but it doesn't look great with cuts in the past. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.80 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $0.662. Doing the maths, this is a decline of about 1.9% per year. Declining dividends isn't generally what we look for as they can indicate that the company is running into some challenges."", ""Given that the dividend has been cut in the past, we need to check if earnings are growing and if that might lead to stronger dividends in the future. Macy's' EPS has fallen by approximately 15% per year during the past five years. Such rapid declines definitely have the potential to constrain dividend payments if the trend continues into the future. Over the next year, however, earnings are actually predicted to rise, but we would still be cautious until a track record of earnings growth can be built."", ""Overall, it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment, but we think that longer term, the current level of payment might be unsustainable. While Macy's is earning enough to cover the dividend, we are generally unimpressed with its future prospects. Overall, we don't think this company has the makings of a good income stock."", ""It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. For instance, we've picked out 3 warning signs for Macy's that investors should take into consideration. If you are a dividend investor, you might also want to look at our curated list of high yield dividend stocks."", 'Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?

The deal would pay shareholders a 32% premium above Macy’s closing price Friday.', 'The takeover bid is a sign that investors believe Macy’s is undervalued on the public market. Retail analysts say Macy’s valuable real estate, including its flagship store in New York City, is a coveted asset to the investors.', '“Years of chronic underperformance has put downward pressure on Macy’s share price and means that the iconic department store chain is now a relatively attractive prospect,” Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData Retail, said in a note to clients.', 'It isn’t clear how Macy’s executives and board members view the proposal.

Macy’s stock price has dropped 75% from a peak of $73 a share in 2015. Since then, it has closed nearly 300 stores — one third of its stores — and lost $3 billion in annual sales.', 'Macy’s fortunes have declined alongside the department store industry.', 'Since 2000, retail sales at department stores have dropped by half, according to the Census Bureau. The dropoff has tipped some department stores such as Sears, Neiman Marcus, JCPenney, Lord & Taylor and others into bankruptcy.', '“The whole concept of department stores has been under tremendous pressure,” said Venkatesh Shankar, a professor of marketing and e-commerce at Texas A&M University’s Mays Business School. “Any retailer that thrived under the old department store concept is struggling to grow.”', 'Amazon has cut into Macy’s sales in recent years, but Amazon is just one reason why Macy’s has struggled. Macy’s is stuck in the middle, squeezed by luxury retailers at the high end of retail and discount stores offering lower prices on the other end.', 'Over the past decade, direct-to-consumer online fashion brands have grown, aided by Instagram and TikTok. Big-box stores such as Target, Walmart and Costco have expanded. Fast-fashion giants like H&M, Uniqlo and, more recently, Shein and Temu have taken aim at Macy’s. And discount clothing stores like TJ Maxx and Burlington have become larger competitors.', 'Macy’s has also been hurt by its large presence in regional malls.', 'Macy’s for decades was a reliable anchor tenant for mall owners and a draw for shoppers, but lower and mid-tier regional malls are struggling to compete against the growth of online shopping and discount chains. As consumers stopped going to these malls as frequently and neighboring stores closed inside malls, Macy’s suffered.', '“All these trends are making it harder for legacy department stores to thrive,” Shankar said.', 'Some analysts say the investor group’s offer is too low for Macy’s.', 'In 2015, activist investor Starboard said Macy’s properties were worth $21 billion, including $4 billion alone for its flagship Herald Square store in New York City, In 2017, Hudson’s Bay, the owner of Saks, said Macy’s could be worth $14 billion.', 'If a deal does go through, however, it could mean trouble for Macy’s retail business.', 'Investor groups such as private equity funds and hedge funds have been active in recent decades in buying struggling or under-performing retailers, with the stated goal of taking them private, improving their operations and selling them for a profit.', '“An investor group that sells off real estate and perhaps takes other actions such as spinning off the ecommerce business would certainly make some short-term gains,” Saunders said. “But unless some of those profits were reinvested in revitalizing the core retail business, it would leave Macy’s in the worst of all worlds.”', 'The results have often led to bankruptcies for many well-known companies, such as Lord & Taylor, Toys R Us, Payless, Sears and others.', 'For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com']"

However we are not very impressed because the share price is only up 36%, less than the market return of 98%. Unfortunately not all shareholders will have held it for the long term, so spare a thought for those caught in the 32% decline over the last twelve months.', ""Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns."", ' View our latest analysis for NextEra Energy ', ""In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS)."", 'During five years of share price growth, NextEra Energy actually saw its EPS drop 3.5% per year.', ""So it's hard to argue that the earnings per share are the best metric to judge the company, as it may not be optimized for profits at this point. Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics."", ""In contrast revenue growth of 7.0% per year is probably viewed as evidence that NextEra Energy is growing, a real positive.

So we recommend checking out this free report showing consensus forecasts"", ""When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for NextEra Energy the TSR over the last 5 years was 53%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!"", ""While the broader market gained around 17% in the last year, NextEra Energy shareholders lost 30% (even including dividends). However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 9%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

This week, Crowdell cut his firm's price target from $40 to $33, but reiterated a buy rating. That's because that still represents more than 20% upside for the shares."", 'Prior to the late September update, NextEra Partners told investors it expected to grow distributions to shareholders at an annual rate of 12% to 15% through 2026. In the second quarter, it did in fact declare a distribution boost of about 12% compared to last year. But it surprised investors in September by announcing a revision saying it would now target just 6% annual growth through at least 2026.', 'You can blame interest rates for the change. NextEra Partners is a limited partnership that acquires and owns clean energy projects for its parent company, NextEra Energy. It pays out its funds from operations to shareholders as a distribution. So it taps the debt and equity markets for capital to support its growth. With interest rates at the highest level in more than a decade, more money needs to go to debt repayments.', ""The Mizuho analyst reacted to that change by slashing his price target to $40 from $86 when NextEra Partners announced the change in distribution growth expectations. This week's cut to $33 per share reflects the feeling among investors that interest rates will remain higher than what has been the norm for the past decade."", ""But individual investors can take advantage of that feeling. That's because while still higher than in the recent past, there is also an overwhelming expectation that the direction for rates will be down from here. Inflation slowed to an annual rate of 3.1% in November, and many market followers expect the Federal Reserve to begin cutting rates next year."", ""Don't lose track of the fact that the distribution wasn't cut -- only the growth rate was cut. That means now is the time to get into income-oriented investments like NextEra Energy Partners. It may not take much good news on the interest rate front to see the gain of 20% or so that Mizuho predicts."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in NextEra Energy Partners right now?', 'Before you buy stock in NextEra Energy Partners, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and NextEra Energy Partners wasn't one of them.

', ""The solar energy industry is one of the most important when it comes to reducing global emissions. Solar panels convert the Sun's energy into electricity, providing humanity with a limitless source of energy. Naturally, this means that the industry itself is quite lucrative. Market research shows that the renewable energy industry as a whole was worth $881 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.4% until 2030 to have a final value of $2 trillion."", 'As is the case with oil, solar power generation is also dominated by a handful of countries. Solar power production requires hefty investment into solar panels, batteries, and associated products. Additionally, while solar power provides free energy if the investment costs in the equipment are ignored, its very nature makes it unfeasible as a complete alternative to fossil fuels. This is because fossil fuel power plants can run 24/7, while solar panels are limited to generating power during the day only. As a result, solar panels cannot provide adequate baseload power particularly at night time and during high energy usage periods such as summer seasons. Therefore, it has to be paired up with other sources to ensure there are no power outages.', 'Developments in solar power are taking place primarily in the developed world due to aggressive emissions targets. For instance, the U.S. is expected to expand its solar energy production by 32 gigawatts by 2023 in a positive development for the industry. This is because the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine was one of the most serious crises that the conventional energy sector had to deal with, particularly in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic that had sapped demand for fossil fuels due to lockdowns. Following the invasion, global oil prices shot up due to supply disruptions, and in a blow for solar, this also led to a drop in investments in solar energy. So, the 32 GW U.S. added solar energy production in 2023, which marks a 52% annual growth came after 13% contraction in the sector in the previous year, showing that the focus was reorienting itself towards going green.', ""Another key incentive for solar power in America has been the Biden-Harris Administration's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The IRA is a sweeping set of reforms that earmarks billions of dollars in incentives for both firms and consumers to reshape their energy production and consumption habits. Its scope and scale have also led reports to predict that from the 32 GW of solar production in 2023, America's solar power output will rise to 375 GW in 2028 from 153 GW as of November 2023."", 'Shifting gears to focus on solar power companies, they are primarily made of firms that generate solar energy and those that make the panels and other equipment. Starting from the former, we took a look at the 10 Biggest Solar Companies In The World in terms of their installed capacity as of 2019. The data shows that the three biggest solar power companies in the world were Adani Renewables, GCL, and SB Energy. Combined their installed energy capacity stood at roughly 28,000 megawatts.', ""However, moves in the solar space are not limited only to established industry players. Big tech has also been making waves, particularly due to the onset of cloud and data center computing. Data centers use large amounts of electricity and they add to the carbon footprint of their operators - which incentivizes firms such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) to go green. Another tech mega cap that's making moves in the industry is Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).

"", ""Mario Gabelli is a billionaire American hedge fund investor who is at the helm of affairs at GAMCO Investors. GAMCO is a multi billion dollar hedge fund headquartered in Rye, New York. According to Insider Monkey's research, the firm's latest investment portfolio is worth $8.6 billion - making it one of the largest financial firms in the world. It was set nearly five decades back in 1976, and it went on to beat the S&P 500 index by more than 2% each year in 1986. The investment firm offers its clients a variety of portfolios and vehicles to park their money in via its Gamco Funds division. These include open and closed end mutual funds, as well as exchange traded funds (ETFs) and money market investments. Additionally, GAMCO also has its own asset management division called GAMCO Asset Management. This division is quite important in the firm's history since Mr. Gabelli's fund was previously called\xa0 Gabelli Asset Management Company and then changed its name to GAMCO in 2005."", ""The GAMCO Asset Management business division identifies itself as a value investor. This approach is practiced by industry behemoths such as Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Seth Klarman of Baupost Group. Fundamentally (no pun intended) value investing determines a stock's fair value based on its ability to earn revenue in the future. This value is then compared to the current market price of a security, typically a stock. If the fair value is higher than the market value, then a buying decision is made based on the percentage difference between the two values called the margin of safety."", 'Additionally, the asset management arm of the hedge fund also focuses on growth stocks. GAMCO claims to invest ""in companies with above average growth in earnings, cash flow or asset values which we believe will provide excellent investment returns over time. These companies typically have strong balance sheets, leading market positions and visible long term growth prospects."" The stated objective of the GAMCO Asset Management growth division is to outperform the Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks by 2%.', ""On the flip side, the value division uses an equity research team of 40 analysts to pick out value stocks. However, GAMCO doesn't invest in any value stock. Instead, a fundamental condition for investment is the presence of a catalyst that will generate value in the future. A catalyst can be anything. For instance, if company A is a rocket company making engines, then its catalyst can be an advanced composite material that can increase chamber pressures in a rocket engine's combustion chamber to improve power output.

Its ticker name is GAMCO Investors, Inc. (OTC:GAMI) and the firm's latest market capitalization at the time of writing is $476 million. Since it's a publicly traded firm, GAMCO Investors, Inc. (OTC:GAMI) has to post its earnings reports regularly and the latest set of results are for the firm's third quarter. This quarter, which saw the stock market continuously readjust itself to the Fed's future interest rate policies, saw GAMCO post $59.4 million in revenue and $13 million in net income. While the revenue dropped by 3.9% annually, the net income jumped by 39.4% as the year ago quarter had seen the firm take a $2.4 million non operating loss. GAMCO Investors, Inc. (OTC:GAMI)'s Class A and B investors are also entitled to a dividend, with the latest dividend being 4 cents."", ""Since 2023 is ending with lingering worries of a recession and global slowdown, here's what Mr. Gabelli believes is happening in the economy:"", ""But when you step back and say okay, what is the world like for investing. Forget about short termism in the market which is dominant because of a variety of things. Basically the International Monetary Fund says there's a $110 trillion of - trillion - dollars of global GDP. The United States is 25%, China is 17%, Europe is about 17-8, a lower number. So what's going in China. What's gonna be the implications of that on the global market place. What's going on in United States. You break the U.S. down, consumer 70% plus or minus, then you've got industrial, then you've got government spending and blah blah blah."", ""The consumer's net worth, when you get the numbers given this rally in the month of November, given the elevated housing prices, that's going to be at least a $150 trillion dollars. Ten years ago, ten years ago not ten weeks ago, it was $75 trillion. The consumer debt is gone from 14 to 20. Up six, but the asset, the net worth is up 75. You have an income disparity and that's why the screen actors did, what the UAW did, and what the others are doing trying to raise wage parity and help pay the bills of electricity, housing, um, food. That has a major 'regressive impact'. So from our end, this recession, we've gone through so many cycles. So the consumer's okay, autos, UAWs on strike, that's recovering. Car sales will be up this week."", ""So, what stocks are Mario Gabelli and billionaires buying? We took a look and some notable names are Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON), Lands' End, Inc.

Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock.

While high-flying growth stocks generate all the hype these days (and deservedly so), defensive dividend stocks remain essential to provide a steady stream of income, as well as stability. That’s particularly true when markets become volatile. And let’s face it, with inflation proving stickier than hoped and various global tensions simmering, we could see increased volatility ahead.', 'But this doesn’t have to derail our portfolios if we hold the right mix of stocks. Even in turbulent times, plenty of stalwart, cash-rich companies with established track records have kept increasing their dividends year after year. I’m talking about the Dividend Aristocrats, and other S-tier stocks that represent some of the most reliable long-term holds out there. These are the types of stocks you can confidently buy and forget about, all while your dividend distributions roll in.', 'I’ll highlight seven generous dividend stocks perfectly suited for building a lifetime of passive income. Additionally, I’ll explore some lesser-known names throwing off juicy yields and a few dividend stalwarts you likely already know. This also includes some undervalued dividend stocks you can snap up for a bargain after their selloffs. Let’s start!', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com', 'At first glance, Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) may appear like a risky option in the world of real estate investment trusts (REITs). However, this self-storage stalwart operates with far less volatility than most commercial or residential real estate funds. Demand for storage has grown steadily amid a booming U.S. economy and population growth. Physical storage needs will only intensify in the coming decades as more blue-collar sectors thrive.', 'Public Storage is perfectly positioned to capitalize as a leading storage provider. Shares have declined 40% from their peak, creating substantial upside from the stock’s current $269 price tag. The company’s generous 4.5% dividend yield also leaves income potential. Payouts should continue rising, given impressive profitability and growth trends. Thus, Public Storage represents a relatively safe, growing business that is undeserving of its selloff. The predictable nature of self-storage stands out against a turbulent real estate backdrop. Steady demand and pricing power should continue driving predictable cash flows. Therefore, the bottom appears to be in for this dividend stalwart.', 'Source: gvictoria / Shutterstock.com', 'Like Public Storage, Innovative Industrial Properties’ (NYSE:IIPR) cannabis-linked real estate focus makes it appear riskier than typical REITs. However, leasing industrial space to pot growers somewhat insulates IIPR from traditional property market swings. Highly volatile cannabis stocks dominate the headlines, but IIPR’s indirect approach looks opportunistic after its 75% plunge.', 'The REIT’s jaw-dropping yield says markets expect tenants to miss rent payments. But the trust’s substantial collection rate and rising payouts signal otherwise. While challenges exist industrywide, top multi-state operators seem to be on solid enough ground to easily cover rent. Preferred access to specialized growing facilities also gives tenants a major incentive to pay IIPR before other expenses.', 'Ultimately, fears around this stock appear to be overblown, given reasonable rent coverage ratios for most tenants. Providing an 8.25% yield effectively compensates investors for the risk they’re taking. Accordingly, from my perspective, this stock’s return profile looks very attractive for long-term, income-focused investors.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'AT&T (NYSE:T) seems poised for a long-awaited breakout after years of declines. While the telecom giant has constantly frustrated shareholders with drama and distractions, improving wireless and fiber trends signal a coming wave of growth and value creation. Trading at less than 7-times earnings, I believe T stock pricing largely reflects the negatives rather than enormous untapped potential.', 'The company’s generous 6.5% dividend yield adds stability for patient investors until catalysts gain traction. AT&T continues expanding its next-generation 5G and fiber networks to meet surging data demand. As those capital-intensive investments moderate, cash generation may explode higher. The company also expects to achieve $2 billion in cost savings within three years.', 'I believe AT&T makes for an ideal recovery and turnaround candidate at current levels. Management aims to pay down debt and return excess cash to shareholders once it hits target leverage ratios. With wireless competition easing and years of underperformance baked in, this telecom titan is positioned to deliver sustained capital appreciation alongside a rock-solid dividend.', 'Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com', 'Watsco’s (NYSE:WSO) modest 2.5% dividend yield seems relatively low at first glance. However, in my view, the stock remains a compelling buy based on its standout capital appreciation potential. Watsco has emerged as one of the strongest performers across the entire market, with WSO stock surging 55% this year. Strength is owed partly to the record summer heat, which drove demand for air conditioning products.', 'Looking ahead, climate change trends point towards sustaining tailwinds regardless of one’s views. Analysts also forecast healthy, accelerating long-term growth for Watsco’s niche AC distribution business. Thus, I believe the company’s modest starting yield could grow into a significant income stream when combined with an ongoing upside in stock prices. Of course, risks exist, but WSO seems poised to continue capitalizing on natural tailwinds from rising temperatures.', 'Watsco’s dividend growth and stock appreciation potential make it well worth holding for the long-run.', 'Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com', 'As one of the pharmaceutical sector’s largest players, AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) provides immense dividend reliability. Unlike more speculative names listed here, this stock prioritizes dividends over capital gains. After all, few industries boast cash flow consistency comparable to biopharma companies with diverse drug portfolios. Even with the U.S. Humira patent expiration in play, AbbVie has only strengthened its cash generation capabilities.', 'With its high 4.3% forward yield and Dividend King status, AbbVie seems poised to deliver years of payout growth ahead. Healthcare tends to endure recessions better than other sectors as well. Therefore, while the upside appears limited, I believe AbbVie remains a low-volatility, high-yield pick suitable for nearly any dividend-focused portfolio. AbbVie looks like an ideal pick for income and stability. The days of sky-high growth may have passed, but strong and growing dividends seem highly sustainable for long-term investors.', 'Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com', 'No energy stock provides immunity from oil and gas volatility, as recent years have repeatedly proven. Nonetheless, Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE:EPD) is slowly recovering to pre-pandemic valuation levels. Enterprise Products has delivered slow but steady share price progress since initial 2020 lows. And with revenue basically doubling from 2020 to 2022, the company’s operating business shows momentum that looks sustainable as well. Despite a projected 2023 revenue pullback, analysts’ models see top-line growth resuming in 2024 and beyond as higher oil prices persist.', 'EPD stock features a 7.5% dividend yield, which also leads its midstream peer group. With 26 consecutive annual payout hikes, the company clearly prioritizes dividend distributions through ups and downs. Ultimately, Enterprise Products’ combination of cash flow consistency, yield magnitude, and conservative operations warrant income investor consideration. In my view, Enterprise Products Partners remains a rock-solid midstream pick as energy markets stabilize.', 'Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com', 'Like many food producers, Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) has battled agricultural commodity volatility in recent years. Following a surge in meat and poultry prices, the company now contends with falling prices and resulting profit pressures. However, with shares having priced in the deceleration of earnings, Tyson seems poised to provide some nice upside as demand recovers.', 'The company’s valuation also looks highly attractive, with Tyson’s forward price-earnings ratio sitting below 12-times. Tyson also pays 4% dividend yield after 12 consecutive annual hikes, providing income as investors wait. So, while macro uncertainty lingers, I believe the stock’s risk/reward profile skews positively for long-term investors right now.

The new tax reforms directly impact multinational companies across the globe. The Pillar Two tax reform, signed by 138 countries, accounts for 90% of global economic activity. As per the Pillar Two tax reform, the primary goal is to establish a level playing field for companies across countries. This will primarily be done by discouraging companies from lowering their corporate income taxes in a bid to attract foreign investment. Under the supervision of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), companies with €750 million or more in revenue, are obliged to pay a global minimum tax of 15% on earned income in each country they operate in. OECD suggests that the reform will push corporate taxes globally by $220 billion per year, almost 9% of global corporate income tax revenues. Deloitte further highlights that the Pillar Two tax reform does not limit itself to just taxes, instead, it shapes how multinationals operate their supply chain networks, execute acquisitions, and strategic decisions.', 'Moreover, the system and compliance data are not only difficult to adhere to, but they also demand a complex infrastructure, that businesses need to establish. Under the reform, multinationals will be required to provide data for 100 separate data points for each entity in an organization. Not only do companies have to remodel their organizational structure, but they also have to revisit their financial reporting timelines. Therefore, to address the need for a complex infrastructure, companies will not be expected to report 2024 returns until after 18 months, which provides ample time for companies to adapt and restructure.

What a lot of people don't realize is that the other companies we're going to talk about like PayPal and Block, as well as a lot of these Fintech start-ups and a lot of the Crypto companies, it's not an either or. Visa wants companies Block to do well because guess what? Those little cash cards have a Visa logo on them. They want these companies to do well, these Fintech start-ups, it's a win win situation.

I think you make a very good point there in that you've got a lot of these new fangled Fintech companies, they're doing neat things. We'll talk about embedded finance to an extent here in a little bit as well. But they all rely on those rails at one point or another. You're seeing attempts at disruption there, you see things like Fed now and whatnot, trying to basically invent new sets of rails to give more choices, more options, quicker transmission of money finances. But it seems to boil down to the fact that these are two businesses, these rails in Visa and Mastercard are just inexorable parts of the value chain here when it comes to payments, no matter what the company."", ""Matt Frankel: It's also worth mentioning that Visa and Mastercard don't have their hands in some areas of finance yet especially person to person transfers, which PayPal and Block are both known for. That's a massive opportunity there. But you're right, they are the rails. It's not a complete duopoly, you have American Express and Discover in the US and in a lot of foreign markets, Visa and Mastercard are not the dominant players like they are here. If you go to some parts of the world, credit card acceptance isn't even that widespread yet."", ""Jason Moser: I've lived in a few of those places. [laughs]"", ""Matt Frankel: You don't want to go backpacking through certain parts of Latin America and not have cash, it doesn't really work out that well in a lot of cases. But they're very mature and profitable businesses, very profitable. They have net margins that would make pretty much any other company jealous, but they're not mature to the point where they don't have any room to grow. There's a lot of international opportunity, I mentioned person to person payments. There's business to business transfers that are very prevalent that no one's really figured out how to make money off of yet. But they are definitely the rails and they're not going anywhere."", ""Jason Moser: I'm glad you mentioned earlier that, we look maybe a little bit more like geniuses with this war on cash basket, maybe a couple of years back. Obviously the performance was significantly higher than. It is worth noting this war on cash basket of Mastercard, Visa, PayPal, Block in equal weightings. The inception date of July 24th, 2017 is worth noting. This basket is still up 130% versus the market's 105%. Even with this pullback specifically, I mean, I'd look at companies like Block and PayPal, even with the pullback in companies like those, the basket is still outperforming. Let's go to PayPal because I think this is an interesting story from a number of angles. PayPal, you talk about a business with so much potential, but one that's clearly going through some growing pains. There's new leadership, hopefully there's new renewed focus there. But Matt why is the market so glass half empty on PayPal these days?"", ""Matt Frankel: You mentioned the new leadership and that kind of is one of the things that I'm excited to see if their growth strategy is a little bit more like you said, focused. Their growth was very disjointed for a while. I don't know if you remember when they were trying to acquire Pinterest."", ""Jason Moser: I do. Well, it seems like it goes back to that phrase, everything app. They wanted to be this super app in doing everything for everyone. You know what, culturally, at least on this side of the world, it just doesn't seem like that's what consumers want."", ""Matt Frankel: I'm a big Pinterest shareholder, so I'll take it. But I was sitting there scratching my head like, what are they going to do with it? They were going to buy them out for $70 a share, it's also worth noting. It was a very disjointed growth strategy. I would call it all over the place. Some of their acquisition certainly made sense, like Honey definitely made sense as an acquisition whether or not they overpaid for is another conversation."", ""Matt Frankel: A lot of companies overpaid in 2021, 2022 for acquisitions just based on the valuation environment at the time. It's not that management made bad decisions. The other thing is PayPal had these very ambitious growth targets that it looked during the pandemic years like they were going to meet without any issue. For one, they have about 430 million active users right now. Their CEO, this was only a couple of years ago, said we're going to hit 750 million users in just a few years. Clearly that's been walked back a little bit since then. The strategy has definitely shifted from we're going to hit 750 million in a few years, then we're going to go on to one billion and we're just going to go from there. Now it's gone to we have 430 million good users let's figure out how to maximize them. The question is, can PayPal extract any more value out of its current user base. Venmo in particular, has been very slow to monetize, I would say. But the numbers look better than the stock price might lead you to believe. PayPal is growing. Not maybe as the market wants it to, the user base is actually declining a bit but the users that they have, they're doubling down on, they're more engaged. Total payment volume is up 15% year of a year. That's outpacing inflation. This isn't just inflation driven. Revenue is up 8% year every year. Non-transaction expenses, which has been a big focus area, there's down 12% year every year despite higher payment volume. That combination 20% earnings growth year over year, they're really engaging their members better. The average active PayPal account makes 56.6 transactions per quarter. That's 13% higher than a year ago. They're doing a great job of engagement. This is an absolute cash machine, this is a profitable business. A lot of people think of PayPal as a tech company, which in a lot of minds translates to unprofitable. They have roughly $15 million of cash on their balance sheet. They generate over $5 million of free cash flow annually, which right now they're putting it all into buybacks."", ""Jason Moser: I'm just going to say, we talk about how companies reinvest this capital, this cash flow. I mean, PayPal is really making a big effort here to buy back a lot of these shares right now. I mean, clearly they see at least some value in where the share is right now."", 'Matt Frankel: Yeah, I mean, they\'ve retired 5% of their shares in the past year. They\'ve spent $5.4 billion in buybacks during that period. Essentially, all their free cash flow is going into buybacks right now. Now my hope is that they find some bolt on acquisitions that could drive value. That\'s the preference. It\'s like Warren Buffett says, ""Our first priority is figuring out how to maximize our current business then we\'ll worry about buybacks and things like that."" But that tells me that they see a real deep value here if they\'re not doing anything else with their money. I mean, and I mentioned, they have a lot of cash on their balance sheet, so that gives them a cushion to spend their money on buybacks and still be able to pursue acquisitions or whatever if they arise. But this is a very cheap business. It trades for I think, less than 15 times forward earnings like 12 times for a while there. If you had told me that was going to be PayPal\'s valuation a couple of years ago, we would have both thought that was kind of a silly statement to make.', ""Jason Moser: It definitely seems like a bit of an overreaction to the downside there. I'm not saying that the market was necessarily rational in 2022 either. But yeah, it does feel like given, I mean, this is the company in a fundamentally a very good position, good financials, playing into a market where there are clear and obvious tailwinds that are not abating. Then it's going to really just boil down to new leadership. Seems like new leadership is some focus, they're trying to pull back from that super app aspiration. Really just dig down into what they do really well, which could work out very well for the company. I mean, these companies go through growing pains all the time. It's never a straight line up. Speaking of never a straight line up, I mean let's look at block here because this is another really interesting story to follow here. The Fintech formerly known as Square, now it's block and it's got Square, it's got cash app, it's got these crypto aspirations with Bitcoin. It's got title and music streaming. I'm not exactly sure what the focus there, so we talk about PayPal and maybe that we're a little bit relieved that it looks like this company is getting some focus back. I think it's a fair question to ask, at least with block, is this a company that is losing focus?"", ""Matt Frankel: Well, as you know, I've been a block shareholder for the long haul. I bought two days. I'm right, two days after the IPO, I've written block from $9 a share all the way up to $280 a share and back to where it is now. I've been a fan of this company for a long time. The last time I saw you in person, we were interviewing Block co founder Jim Mckelvey."", ""Jason Moser: Oh yeah, that's right, that was a fun interview."", ""Matt Frankel: Their growth strategy over the past few years. I could also describe like PayPals, It's like all over the place. But they weren't just talking about making acquisitions that didn't make sense. They actually did a couple. You mentioned title, which I'm not really sure what the point of that was."", ""Jason Moser: Now that felt like either he was appeasing Jay Z, trying to kind of get tight in that club, or maybe this was just like a gamble on NFT's, which clearly that had worked out so well. But any which way you cut it, I just don't see the logic in that deal. But thankfully, they didn't pay an arm and a leg for Judge."", ""Matt Frankel: Speaking of paying an arm and a leg, I'm glad you just used it."", 'Jason Moser: I knew where this was going.', 'Matt Frankel: They also acquired After Pay which made sense. That is definitely a fit in the business. Not for $29 million.', 'Jason Moser: That was a lot.', 'Matt Frankel: It thankfully, it was an all stock deal so as their stock went down, the essential price they paid for the acquisition went down as well. I think it would be something like $6 million if you look at their current stock price, stop doing that, focus. That\'s kind of my point with with Jack Dorsey. The first line of his recent shareholder letter really made me smile. It said, ""We\'ve been quiet lately because we\'ve been focused,"" and if you think about it, you really haven\'t heard any news from Block lately. You\'ve heard a lot from PayPal, the new CEO, the management, shake up the strategy shift. You really haven\'t heard much from Block. They\'re really focusing their efforts and they\'re doing a lot of things that are very non Jack Dorsey esque, in the sense that, number 1, they\'re really focusing on controlling costs. He\'s generally a growth at all costs type of guy. They capped the number of employees they\'re going to have. They implemented a $1 million buyback program, which that\'s the first time I\'ve ever heard the words buyback in block the same sentences. Unlike PayPal, their business is still growing very rapidly. Gross profit was up 21% year over year in the last quarter. Cash app is still growing. The payments ecosystem is still growing. The Afterpay integration actually looks like it\'s adding significant value to the business, but there is a long way to go when it comes to reaching profitability. Out of the four we\'ve talked about so far, this is the least profitable by a long shot. Now, they could be very profitable today if they would stop pumping so much money into growth run in their expenses. I mentioned that\'s just now becoming a priority. They\'re a little late to the party with that.', ""Matt Frankel: I mentioned they did a $1 billion buyback authorization, that's not even going to cover their stock based compensation for the year. That's just really to offset it. Their share account is not going to go down even if they buy back $1 billion worth of stock. Things like that really need to be brought under control for this to really return to the level it was at before."", ""Jason Moser: I think that makes a lot of sense. I appreciate you bringing up the buy now, pay later stuff because I think in the very beginning stages of that market, I think we all probably looked at it at least with the healthy dose of skepticism. It seems ultimately like BNPL is more or less just credit card in a different name. But when you look at it, clearly consumers are looking at that more and more as an option, and retailers are looking at that more and more as an option. I said it before, if it's something that enables consumers to spend and it enables retailers to sell, then it's a value. If you look at the Adobe Analytics, they're talking about for Cyber Monday alone, BNPL is going to grow nearly 19% close to $785 million in sales. It's clearly an option that consumers are gravitating more and more toward. So even if block overpaid, which is obviously something that's debatable though, I think we probably would all agree they paid a lot. Maybe that is something that does pay off down the road. You look at the tail ones in that market, maybe it is something that ends up paying off. Matt, I wanted to dig into a few other companies in this space, companies that we like to follow tangentially, ones we don't get to talk as much about, but companies that probably many listeners are very familiar. We wanted to start with Marqeta, and I think it's a nice segue from Block into Marqeta because Marqeta in Block, they're joined at the hip, aren't they?"", ""Matt Frankel: Yeah. Well, Block is their biggest customer, specifically the Cash App by far. Marqeta is a credit card infrastructure or a payment card infrastructure provider is the best way I could describe them. In addition to being the company that provides the technology behind the Cash App card, they also do things like they provide cards for Uber. If you ever do an Instacard grocery order, they're the company that allows your credit card to be used in store without you physically being there with your card. Your shopper can buy groceries on your behalf things like that. They provide the technology behind these things. Cash App makes up a big part of their revenue. It was a huge sigh of relief for investors when Cash App renewed its contract this year. That was up to expire. I think it's now renewed."", 'Jason Moser: Big deal.', ""Matt Frankel: That would have been a nail in the coffin. I think that's renewed through 2028, I believe."", 'Jason Moser: Four additional years, I believe.', ""Matt Frankel: As a result, the company reset this year. The renewal rates as is rather common when you sign a new contract, the initial rate goes down but you agreed to four more years. You saw their revenue decline by 43% year over year, but that doesn't tell the story about how the business is going. That's just because the Cash App rates went down quite a bit. If you look at the numbers, the payment volume through Marqeta's platform is up 33% year over year. They say, start judging our growth again in the third quarter of 2024. That'll be one year after the Cash App renewal. So you'll see year over year comparisons of revenue, they're really apples to apples comparisons. High gross margin business 67% gross margin. They have up $1.3 billion in cash, so they don't really have to worry about being profitable just yet. It's only a $3 billion market cap company, so that's a lot of cash on hand. On an adjusted basis, they're on the verge of profitability, but their growth has been very impressive. I'd like to see them continue to diversify their revenue away from Cash App. But really impressive business and it's a technology that is very much needed and is going to be increasingly needed as those type of businesses really expand."", ""Jason Moser: I suspect you're right. I mentioned embedded finance earlier in the show and that really is what Marqeta is. It's embedded finance. It's bringing those finance capabilities into apps that aren't necessarily Fintech companies. You mentioned Uber, DoorDash, companies like that that rely on drivers or delivery drivers going in there and picking up something and needing to charge it to a card then gets charged to the individual consumer buying the product or whatever. That embedded finance market, it's an interesting one. It really is growing as we see the mobile economy, the digital economy, the gig economy, continue to grow. It does feel like there's a lot of opportunity there for Marqeta and it was very good news to see them continuing that relationship with Block because I have a feeling that that should pay off down the road. Matt, Shift4 payments. This is not a business I'm as familiar with, one that you follow. What does Shift4 do and what do you like about them today?"", ""Matt Frankel: They do payment processing and software for businesses. They're specifically concentrated in restaurants and hotels. They're the actual consumer-facing software terminals and things like that that you'll see when you go to pay for a hotel stay or things of that nature. Pretty big and successful company. A little over $5 billion market cap. So bigger than Marqeta and profitable on a gap basis. They have a 6% net profit margin in the past 12 months. It's a really successful business so far, very strong growth, payment processing volume is growing 36% year over year, 23% revenue growth. They get a percentage of transaction volume and some software revenue, things like that. Over the past five years, they've grown at a 48% annualized rate sustained over four years, and including in this slowdown, they're still growing. Their main focus is restaurants and hotels. They've expanded that quite a bit in the past couple of years. Stadiums and sporting venues are a big focus area for them. They recently acquired a company called Appetize that gets them into a lot more sports venues. I believe, if I remember correctly, that you're a golfer, I'm sure you've heard of Pebble Beach Resorts."", 'Jason Moser: You remember correctly.', 'Matt Frankel: Pebble Beach Resorts is a recent big winner that added Shift4 as their payment processing partner and non-profit organizations are another big vertical of theirs like habitat for you matter to use the Shift4 as their payment software. Interesting software play on the payments industry.', ""Jason Moser: Well finally met one that most listeners are probably pretty familiar with. May have heard of this company, Mercado Libre. It's what we talked about on occasion here. [laughs] It's not just a marketplace, this really is a Fintech play as well. How does Mercado Libre continue to gain share because it really feels like they have just got everything going in the right direction?"", ""Matt Frankel: They keep building out their ecosystem and it's really impressive. Their profitability really has gotten much better in the past couple of years too. If I'm looking at some of these growth numbers, I'm thinking, what's the slowdown? On both sides of their business, you have the e-commerce platform, merchandise volumes up almost 60% year over year. It's not just inflation because let's be fair, they operate in some countries where inflation is way, Argentina, inflation is over 100% right now."", ""Jason Moser: That's such a bad deal what we've got going on here right now. [laughs]"", ""Matt Frankel: It puts ours into perspective. But the number of items sold on the platform is up 26% year over year, so it's not just inflation. On the payment side, total payment volume on the Mercado Pago is up over 120% year over year. What's slowdown? If you look at their numbers, you would have no idea that's going on. Their credit business is doing well, Mercado Credito is doing well. Forgive my terrible Spanish accent."", ""My high school Spanish teacher would be very upset at me right now. But their credit portfolio is growing and performing to expectations. On the bottom line, they're very profitable. It's really rare you find a company growing revenue at almost 70% year over year with great bottom line profitability. They have an 18% operating margin, so it's a powerhouse business. I'm not surprised, it just recently hit a 52 week high. One of my largest investments and I'm sure a lot of people listening and people at the Fool could say the same. People always throw around this is an early stage Blank but this really is like an early stage Amazon, PayPal all rolled into one."", ""Jason Moser: Sounds familiar Matt. Well, listen, that's a lot of Fintech in a short amount of time. We're going to leave it there. But hey, thank you for making some time for us this week."", ""Matt Frankel: Thanks for having me. It's always good to get back together with you for a fun episode."", ""Mary Long: As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about, and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear.

The new tax reforms directly impact multinational companies across the globe. The Pillar Two tax reform, signed by 138 countries, accounts for 90% of global economic activity. As per the Pillar Two tax reform, the primary goal is to establish a level playing field for companies across countries. This will primarily be done by discouraging companies from lowering their corporate income taxes in a bid to attract foreign investment. Under the supervision of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), companies with €750 million or more in revenue, are obliged to pay a global minimum tax of 15% on earned income in each country they operate in. OECD suggests that the reform will push corporate taxes globally by $220 billion per year, almost 9% of global corporate income tax revenues. Deloitte further highlights that the Pillar Two tax reform does not limit itself to just taxes, instead, it shapes how multinationals operate their supply chain networks, execute acquisitions, and strategic decisions.', 'Moreover, the system and compliance data are not only difficult to adhere to, but they also demand a complex infrastructure, that businesses need to establish. Under the reform, multinationals will be required to provide data for 100 separate data points for each entity in an organization. Not only do companies have to remodel their organizational structure, but they also have to revisit their financial reporting timelines. Therefore, to address the need for a complex infrastructure, companies will not be expected to report 2024 returns until after 18 months, which provides ample time for companies to adapt and restructure.

174,f6d93b72-0c20-343e-bf06-03ae6177c10b,JNJ,2023-12-13,Kenvue: A High-Quality Consumer Health Company on Sale,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kenvue-high-quality-consumer-health-195139961.html,1702410699,STORY,"['KVUE', 'JNJ']","['In May, Kenvue Inc. (NYSE:KVUE) successfully concluded its separation from Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ); however, its stock has experienced a decline about 25% since the completion of this process, likely driven by Investors nervousness about Tylenol litigation. The drop in value appears to be excessive even if the company may have to settle some lawsuits. I think this represents a good opportunity for investors to buy this high-quality company. It has a portfolio of leading brands, a solid balance sheet and large industry merger and acquisition and consolidation opportunities.', 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with KVUE.', ""Despite this share price downturn, the company's financial performance reveals consistent margins and decent growth, presenting an appealing future prospect for investors. Kenvue is presently trading at a discount compared to its peers, indicative of mispricing likely stemming from the separation from its former parent as well as litigation jitters. This situation implies a potential for future growth, making it an opportune moment for investors to consider the company."", ""Kenvue is the largest pure-play consumer health care company with sales of roughtly $15 billion in 2022. The company and its industry (consumer health care), which is still relatively new, holds a position at the intersection of fast-moving consumer goods companies like Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Unilever (UN), pharmaceutical companies like J&J and Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and beauty companies like Estee Lauder (NYSE:EL) and L'Oreal (LRLCY). Many of the companies and brands in this consumer health products industry emerged out of pharmaceutical companies as these companies divested non-core operations to focus on higher-margin patented prescription pharmaceuticals. Unlike pharma companies, which depend on patents for the their economic moats, these companies' moats depend on brands. The following are some of Kenvue's leading brands:"", 'Kenvue operates with three primary product segments : Self Care, Skin Health & Beauty and Essential Health, each encompassing well-known brands familiar to consumers.', 'The Self Care category includes cough, cold and allergy medicine, pain care and other self care (digestive health, smoking cessation). Notable brands in this segment include Tylenol, Nicorette and Zyrtec.', 'The Skin Health and Beauty division encompasses face and body care as well as hair, sun and other. Major brands in this category are Neutrogena, Aveeno, Lubriderm and OGX.', ""As for the Essential Health segment, this category includes oral care, baby care and other essential health (women's health and wound care), featuring brands such as Listerine, Johnson's Baby, BAND-AID, Neosporin and Stayfree."", ""These well-established brands have demonstrated a robust market presence, as reflected in the company's recent financial performance. In the most recent quarter ending in September 2023, the company generated approximately $3.91 billion in quarterly revenue, up about 3.3% from last year. This translates to around $710 million in operating profit. Out of this, about $438 million was reported as net income, reflecting impressive financials."", ""The adjusted operating margins stood at over 20%, with net income margins at 11%, showcasing commendable performance for a company operating in the consumer staples sector. Kenvue's return on equity is15.87% and the return on invested capital is 9.49%. The company has guided for about 5.5% revenue growth this fiscal year."", 'The company is also global in reach with operations around the world and approximately 22,000 employees.', ""Kenvue's balance sheet is well balanced with a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.78 and a debt-to-Ebitda ratio of 3.08."", ""The schedule of principal payments required on the company's long-term debt for the next five years, including 2023 and thereafter, is as follows:"", '$____', '$____', '$750', '$750', '$____', '$6,250', 'Source: 10Q', 'Cash flow is very healthy and above net income on a trailing 12-month basis.', ""Based on GuruFocus data, the company's forward price-earnings ratio is currently 15.56. Its closest competitor, Haleon (NYSE:HLN) (which itself separated from GSK (NYSE:GSK) last year), sports a multiple of 17.45. Other comparable companies, like Prestige Consumer (NYSE:PBH), has a forward price-earnings ratio of 13.5 while Reckitt Benckiser Group PLC (LSE:RKT) has a ratio of 15.17. Larger semi-competitors that also have a consumer health business, like Procter & Gamble, Unilever and Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL), sport comparable or higher forward price-earnings ratios. So based on the trading multiples, with comparable companies I think Kenvue is about 20% undervalued. I also think consumer health companies like Kenvue and Haleon are underpriced as compared to other FMCG companies like P&G and Colgate, even though they have brands with comparable strengths and operating margins."", ""I think these companies are most closely related to the S&P's consumer defensive sector. This sector has a price-earnings ratio of around 23. Kenvue's earnings multiple of 15.5 is about 33% lower. I honestly think it should be higher given the quality of its brands."", 'Financial Services', '67', '15.60', '13.60', 'Consumer Defensive', '37', '23.70', '23.00', 'Utilities', '30', '24.70', '22.00', 'Basic Materials', '22', '25.00', '18.10', 'Industrials', '73', '25.70', '20.90', 'Energy', '23', '27.70', '10.10', 'Healthcare', '65', '28.00', '24.40', 'Communication Services', '22', '30.90', '27.20', 'Real Estate', '31', '38.80', '39.70', 'Consumer Cyclical', '59', '42.10', '31.90', 'Technology', '74', '45.10', '40.30', 'S&P 500', '500', '31.1', '25.2', ""When I use the GuruFocus discounted cash flow calculator with a starting point of earnings per share of $1.31, I get a fair value comparable to the current stock price. On reflection, given the company's market-leading brands and global reach, this appears to be overly conservative. The stock should be trading at a premium."", 'One lingering concern affecting the stock is the apprehension surrounding litigation linked to the safety of Tylenol. Ongoing legal proceedings specifically focus on the potential impact of Tylenol on fetuses. Lawsuits allege that Kenvue is liable for neurological disorders in children born to pregnant women who took the painkiller during pregnancy. The plaintiffs contend the company failed to include a warning about these potential risks on the product\'s label. In response, Kenvue asserts that acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, is extensively studied and regarded as one of the safest medications in history by U.S. health regulators and medical organizations. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, for instance, deems acetaminophen as ""one of the only safe pain relievers for pregnant individuals during pregnancy.""', ""Despite this litigation being in its early stages, the plaintiffs have scored several procedural victories in recent months. The upcoming year will lap a crucial phase as the lawsuits advance, with courtroom battles over the admissibility of expert testimonies. If the judge approves the plaintiffs' chosen experts, investors will need to closely monitor developments. While Kenvue shares may experience short-term volatility, its expanding dividends and solid financial fundamentals are poised to provide a stabilizing effect amid the uncertainties."", ""Another issue investors have to contend with is the relatively anaemic top line (revenue) growth. Based on published figures, Kenvue's revenue has only grown by 1.44% per annum since 2019. While the company's recent growth has been in the mid-single-digits, this top line growth will have to be sustained and increased if the company hopes to attain a premium valuation."", ""Kenvue has lots to recommend it, even amid litigation concerns. The company recently initiated a quarterly dividend of 20 cents a share, which equates to a yield of about 3.95%. The company has inherited its former parent, Johnson & Johnson's, Dividend King status and is part of many dividend growth exchange-traded funds, like the SPDR S&P Dividend ETF (SDY) and ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NOBL)."", 'Several value-oriented guru investors like Yacktman, Tweedy Brown and the T. Rowe Price Income Fund have established positions in the company. Johnson & Johnson still owns about 9.52% of the outstanding shares and is currently the largest shareholder. It is expected that it will sell its holdings in the near future.', 'I also think it is undervalued by 20% to 30% based on a consumer packed goods company comparable. As a FMCG company with strong self medication/self care product profile and brand portfolio, it has recession-resistant characteristics and is a hedge against the gyrations of the economic cycle. Its not often you get to buy such a high-quality consumer staples company at a price-earnings ratio of around 15.', 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

If you want to skip our overview of the stock market and the latest news, then you can take a look at 5 A-Rated Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On. ', 'The stock market is made of thousands of companies whose shares trade hands daily. These trades are based on information or other signals that make investors buy or sell the stocks. The volume of data that is available to the retail investor, coupled with complex financial terms makes investing appear daunting.', ""This is particularly true in today's market environment which is markedly different from what investors were used to before the 2019 coronavirus pandemic. Back then, interest rates were low and investors had easy access to capital for their investments. Similarly, firms found it easier to grow as low rates meant that not only could they easily raise capital for expansion but their products also found willing buyers."", 'However, just four years later, the market is quite different. Now, even as indexes such as the NASDAQ Composite and the S&P 500 have managed to post gains, the broader economic climate makes investing trickier. Multi decade high interest rates have ensured that only the best companies can keep their balance sheets healthy. They have also provided potential stock market investors with alternatives to park their money, and also shaken the valuations of stocks. Stock valuations factor in interest rates as a loss of interest through stable investments such as ten year U.S. government bonds are often the opportunity cost of investing capital in a company.', ""Now, with 2024 coming to an end, investors are finding more reasons to be optimistic than not. This is because it appears that the Federal Reserve might not have a choice when it comes to reducing interest rates in 2024. So far, the central bank has pumped up rates to 5.25% to curtail inflation, and economic data released in November and December 2023 has provided hints that inflation is on a downward trend. At the same time, the key worry that high rates might tip America into a recession might not bear fruit either. The Fed, throughout its interest rate hiking cycle, has hoped that instead of falling into a recession, the economy will undergo what is called a 'Soft Landing.' A soft landing is when economic growth slows down but does not enter into negative territory. Given the pace and scale of the interest rate hikes, a soft landing is the best case scenario for stock market bulls and recent data shows that it might actually materialize."", ""For instance, the Labor Department's data for the non farm jobs market released in December 2023 shows that the economy added 199,000 jobs in November while the unemployment rate stood at 3.7%. Both these figures are important, since the number of jobs added in November outpaced the 150,000 jobs added in October. Similarly, the unemployment rate dropped from 3.9% showing that the labor market continues to improve. This data set supports the soft landing narrative because it shows that despite painfully high interest rates, companies continued to expand their hiring. More hiring leads to more output and is good for economic growth. On the flip side, had the job market contracted, i.e. the unemployment rate grew and the number of jobs added fell, then investors would have worried that the first signs of an economic slowdown were approaching. This could have made them panic, leading to the stock market trading lower and safe haven assets such as the U.S. dollar rising."", 'However, in reality, since the jobs report was robust, investors responded by betting in the opposite direction. After the report was released, the S&P 500 index and the NASDAQ closed at 4,604 and 14,403, respectively to mark their highest readings since March 2022 and April 2022. This bit is important, as while markets have had somewhat of a good year in 2023 mostly due to the boom in technology and artificial intelligence, they are yet to retake their 2021 close levels. The indexes effectively reversed all losses since the first quarter of 2023 provides early hints about investor hopes for the future, and if the data continues to walk a fine rope, then this strong performance can extend into the future as well.', ""At the same time, a strong labor market report also allows the Fed to keep rates higher for longer. It shows that the labor market continues to be robust, and if not closely monitored, then it can end up feeding into inflation to undo all the work done to bring down inflation. These worries are also on economists and analysts minds. For instance, here's what Stuart Cole, the head macro economist at Equiti Capital had to say to Reuters:"", '""Today’s employment report has come in hotter than expected, with the payrolls number and monthly average earnings figure printing above expectations and the unemployment rate unexpectedly falling. The picture being painted as far as the Fed is concerned will likely be one of a labour market that remains strong and showing no real signs yet of buckling under the weight of the interest rates rises that it has so far delivered.""', '""The drop in the unemployment rate in particular will assuage any concerns of a recession, and with payrolls and earnings both rising it keeps the ‘soft landing’ narrative very much in the ascendancy.""', '""The report will likely see some of those forecasting an early Fed cut next year re-evaluating their positions, and unless we get a surprisingly large fall in the CPI numbers next week, those Q1 rate cut expectations will probably now be priced out.""', ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at some A-rated stocks that billionaires are buying.

"", ""Mario Gabelli is a billionaire American hedge fund investor who is at the helm of affairs at GAMCO Investors. GAMCO is a multi billion dollar hedge fund headquartered in Rye, New York. According to Insider Monkey's research, the firm's latest investment portfolio is worth $8.6 billion - making it one of the largest financial firms in the world. It was set nearly five decades back in 1976, and it went on to beat the S&P 500 index by more than 2% each year in 1986. The investment firm offers its clients a variety of portfolios and vehicles to park their money in via its Gamco Funds division. These include open and closed end mutual funds, as well as exchange traded funds (ETFs) and money market investments. Additionally, GAMCO also has its own asset management division called GAMCO Asset Management. This division is quite important in the firm's history since Mr. Gabelli's fund was previously called\xa0 Gabelli Asset Management Company and then changed its name to GAMCO in 2005."", ""The GAMCO Asset Management business division identifies itself as a value investor. This approach is practiced by industry behemoths such as Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Seth Klarman of Baupost Group. Fundamentally (no pun intended) value investing determines a stock's fair value based on its ability to earn revenue in the future. This value is then compared to the current market price of a security, typically a stock. If the fair value is higher than the market value, then a buying decision is made based on the percentage difference between the two values called the margin of safety."", 'Additionally, the asset management arm of the hedge fund also focuses on growth stocks. GAMCO claims to invest ""in companies with above average growth in earnings, cash flow or asset values which we believe will provide excellent investment returns over time. These companies typically have strong balance sheets, leading market positions and visible long term growth prospects."" The stated objective of the GAMCO Asset Management growth division is to outperform the Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks by 2%.', ""On the flip side, the value division uses an equity research team of 40 analysts to pick out value stocks. However, GAMCO doesn't invest in any value stock. Instead, a fundamental condition for investment is the presence of a catalyst that will generate value in the future. A catalyst can be anything. For instance, if company A is a rocket company making engines, then its catalyst can be an advanced composite material that can increase chamber pressures in a rocket engine's combustion chamber to improve power output.

Its ticker name is GAMCO Investors, Inc. (OTC:GAMI) and the firm's latest market capitalization at the time of writing is $476 million. Since it's a publicly traded firm, GAMCO Investors, Inc. (OTC:GAMI) has to post its earnings reports regularly and the latest set of results are for the firm's third quarter. This quarter, which saw the stock market continuously readjust itself to the Fed's future interest rate policies, saw GAMCO post $59.4 million in revenue and $13 million in net income. While the revenue dropped by 3.9% annually, the net income jumped by 39.4% as the year ago quarter had seen the firm take a $2.4 million non operating loss. GAMCO Investors, Inc. (OTC:GAMI)'s Class A and B investors are also entitled to a dividend, with the latest dividend being 4 cents."", ""Since 2023 is ending with lingering worries of a recession and global slowdown, here's what Mr. Gabelli believes is happening in the economy:"", ""But when you step back and say okay, what is the world like for investing. Forget about short termism in the market which is dominant because of a variety of things. Basically the International Monetary Fund says there's a $110 trillion of - trillion - dollars of global GDP. The United States is 25%, China is 17%, Europe is about 17-8, a lower number. So what's going in China. What's gonna be the implications of that on the global market place. What's going on in United States. You break the U.S. down, consumer 70% plus or minus, then you've got industrial, then you've got government spending and blah blah blah."", ""The consumer's net worth, when you get the numbers given this rally in the month of November, given the elevated housing prices, that's going to be at least a $150 trillion dollars. Ten years ago, ten years ago not ten weeks ago, it was $75 trillion. The consumer debt is gone from 14 to 20. Up six, but the asset, the net worth is up 75. You have an income disparity and that's why the screen actors did, what the UAW did, and what the others are doing trying to raise wage parity and help pay the bills of electricity, housing, um, food. That has a major 'regressive impact'. So from our end, this recession, we've gone through so many cycles. So the consumer's okay, autos, UAWs on strike, that's recovering.

The problem for NextEra, and the transition broadly, is that this transformation is immensely capital intensive and many renewables projects offer lower returns on that capital. This requires high capital expenditures - often resulting in negative free cash flow - to meet the growth and financing needs of companies like NextEra. To help, the company leaned on financial engineering by using a publicly traded limited partnership called NextEra Energy Partners, providing further capacity for its parent to continue its development plans. NEP used layers of its own financial engineering to fund its own negative free cash flow and a large, growing dividend yield that we believe it could not sustain organically. Ultimately, the higher cost of debt from rising rates led NEP to lower its own growth ambitions, driving concerns about whether NextEra can execute on its extensive backlog.

The prospects of its redevelopment program and progress in technology measures are also likely to aid margin expansion. A solid balance sheet bodes well for the company’s long-term growth despite a high interest rate environment and elevated supply in certain markets.', 'MAA’s portfolio is set to gain from healthy operating fundamentals. The pandemic accelerated employment shifts and a population inflow into the company’s markets as renters sought more business-friendly, low-taxed and low-density cities. These favorable long-term secular dynamic trends are increasing the desirability of its markets.The high pricing of single-family ownership units amid a high interest rate environment continues to drive demand for rental apartments. Due to these positives, MAA is expected to continue maintaining a high level of occupancy in the upcoming period.Our projection for average physical occupancy in 2023 is 95.6%. For 2024 and 2025, the average physical occupancy is expected to remain elevated at 95.7% and 95.8%, respectively. Our projections for top-line growth point to an increase of 6.3% year over year in the current year.MAA continues to implement its three internal investment programs — interior redevelopment, property repositioning projects and Smart Home installations. These programs will help the company capture the upside potential in rent growth, generate accretive returns and boost earnings from its existing asset base.Along with the healthy operating fundamentals of the Sunbelt markets and a robust development pipeline, the prospects of its redevelopment program and progress in technology measures are likely to drive margin expansion. We expect a year-over-year increase of 6% in the company’s same-store net operating income (“NOI”) in 2023. For 2024 and 2025, the metric is projected to witness growth of 7.3% and 7.4%, respectively.MAA enjoys a solid balance sheet with low leverage and ample availability under its revolving credit facility. As of Sep 30, 2023, MAA had a strong balance sheet with $1.4 billion in combined cash and capacity available under its unsecured revolving credit facility and a historically low Net Debt/Adjusted EBITDAre ratio of 3.4. In the third quarter of 2023, it generated 95.8% unencumbered NOI, providing the scope for tapping additional secured debt capital if required. Hence, the company is well-positioned to bank on growth opportunities.Moreover, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticements for real estate investment trust (“REIT”) shareholders and MAA remains committed to the same. In the last five years, MAA has increased its dividend six times and its five-year annualized dividend growth rate is 8.74%. Moreover, it has a lower dividend payout compared with the industry. Backed by healthy operating fundamentals, we expect the company’s core funds from operations (“FFO”) to increase 8.5% year over year in the current year. Hence, with these factors in place, we expect its dividend distribution to be sustainable in the upcoming period.', 'However, the struggle to lure renters will persist as supply volumes are expected to remain elevated in some markets. This phenomenon is expected to put some pressure on rent growth in the upcoming period. Stiff competition in the residential real estate market with various housing alternatives like manufactured housing, condominiums and the new and existing home markets is concerning. This affects the company’s power to raise rent or increase occupancy and leads to aggressive pricing for acquisitions.Although the company’s robust development and redevelopment pipeline is encouraging for long-term growth, supply-chain constraints and inflationary pressure could lead to cost overruns and lease-up concerns. This is likely to weigh on the company’s profitability.Elevated rates imply a high borrowing cost for the company, affecting its ability to purchase or develop real estate. Moreover, the dividend payout might seem less attractive than yields on fixed-income and money market accounts due to high interest rates.Shares of this Zacks #3 (Hold) company have gained 5.7% in the past month, underperforming the industry’s growth of 8.2%.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Some better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are UMH Properties, Inc.

In other words, these enterprises presently lag the benchmark on a year-to-date basis. However, they could offer better bang for the buck over the intermediate to long term.', 'First, while the broader equities space has responded positively to strong holiday sales, it’s not entirely clear that the underlying consumer base can keep up the spending. For example, inflation remains stubbornly high while borrowing costs are elevated against prior norms. Therefore, it may be sensible to consider bargain stocks over already-hyped entities.', 'Second, major companies that are lagging the benchmark index offer a sensible starting point for stocks with potential for upside. Unlike other businesses, the securities mentioned below are part of the S&P 500. Therefore, red ink may have a better chance of turning black rather than a darker shade of crimson.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'On that note, check out these compelling bargain stocks with potential.', 'Source: mimohe / Shutterstock.com', 'According to Wall Street analysts, athletic apparel and equipment manufacturer Nike (NYSE:NKE) carries a moderate buy view. This assessment breaks down as 18 buys, 12 holds and zero sells. Overall, the average price target lands at $118.08, which is admittedly modest. However, the high-side target hits $150, which may give cautious speculators hope for a robust upside.', 'Looking at the financials, the $150 target isn’t something pulled out of a dark cavernous place. Despite the risks associated with the consumer discretionary sector, Nike has proven resilient. Yes, its total revenue slipped for its fiscal year ended May 2020 against the prior year. However, since then, it has consistently increased the top line.', 'Just as importantly, the company’s gross profit margin remains stable. In the quarter ended August 2023, this metric hit 44.21%, basically in line with the prior year’s result. Also, the long-term average stands around 44% to 45%. That implies Nike benefits from pricing power, making NKE one of the bargain stocks with potential.', 'Source: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.com', 'An aeronautics and defense company, Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) has been disappointing relative to the benchmark index. Since the start of the year, NOC is firmly in negative territory. However, analysts remain cautiously optimistic, pegging it a moderate buy. This assessment breaks down as seven buys, four holds and one sell. Overall, the average price target comes out to $500.17.', 'To be sure, that’s not a whole lot. However, the most optimistic analyst – Bank of America Securities’ Ronald Epstein – sees NOC hitting $615. If so, acquiring shares now would make it one of the compelling bargain stocks with potential. Fundamentally, the catalyst centers on the geopolitical tensions that have erupted in Eastern Europe and more recently, the Middle East.', 'Part of the bullish tale involves the losing of naïve arguments. With the world spiraling out of control, the U.S. simply needs to restore order. That’s a plus for Northrop Grumman. Also, company sales have witnessed a conspicuous spike in 2022 and in the trailing-12-month (TTM) period, aligning with the aforementioned flashpoints.', 'Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com', 'One of the biggest names in, well, public storage facilities, the aptly named Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) offers arguably permanent relevance. After all, irrespective of outside conditions, everyone finds themselves in need of extra storage. However, while the S&P 500 is enjoying solid double-digit returns, PSA sits in negative territory. Still, that could change according to the Street’s experts.', 'Right now, analysts rate PSA a consensus strong buy. This assessment breaks down as seven buys, two holds, and no sells. Overall, the average price target lands at $292.44. That’s an okay return over the next 12 months. However, the max price target comes in at $330, which symbolizes a very solid performance. Fundamentally, it’s not out of the question.', 'First, as I stated earlier, we all need storage at some point in our lives. Second and more importantly, the blistering costs of living (here and abroad) have forced many folks to downsize. Therefore, putting away bulky stuff that doesn’t see regular use could result in greater demand for PSA. I see it as one of the bargain stocks with potential.', 'Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com', 'A pharmaceutical and medical technologies giant, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) usually offers a reliable platform for positive returns. I anticipate a return to normal programming given the recent uptick in momentum for JNJ. But in the meantime, yeah, it noticeably lags the S&P 500. For some, that’s bad news. For others, it’s one of the underappreciated bargain stocks with potential.', 'Let’s check in with the analysts first. Currently, they peg JNJ as a consensus moderate buy with a $177.45 average price target. That’s a decent potential return because you’re also getting a dividend yield of 2.97% with a reasonable payout ratio of 44.8%. Further, the high-side target clocks in at $215, which comes from Cantor Fitzgerald’s Louise Chen.', 'Fundamentally, J&J symbolizes an insulated investment idea in that pharmaceuticals and medical tech don’t necessarily correlate with broader market and economic performances. Basically, when you need such innovations, you try to get them irrespective of the costs. Also, JNJ offers great value, trading at trailing-year earnings multiple of 11.76x, below the sector median of 23.42x.', 'Source: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock', 'Controversial for its tobacco business, Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) nevertheless deserves consideration for bargain stocks with potential. First, it meets the qualifications. It’s one of the S&P 500 companies yet it underperforms the benchmark index with a negative return this year. However, analysts remain hopeful about PM, rating it a consensus moderate buy with a $107.59 price target.', 'As I mentioned with J&J above, that’s a decent upside prospect because you’ve got to take into account the dividend. At 5.43%, that’s a strong rate of passive income, though you must watch the high payout ratio of 84.54%. Adding to the bullish sentiment, the maximum price target comes in at $120. That’s courtesy of TD Cowen’s Vivien Azer.', 'Fundamentally, I believe it’s a reasonable forecast. Yes, global smoking prevalence has declined over the past several years. However, in many countries, the prevalence either did not change or it actually increased. More importantly, Philip Morris develops heat-not-burn products and other alternative devices that appeal to tobacco aficionados.', 'And it’s a consistently profitable enterprise, warranting a second look despite the controversy.', 'Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com', 'Another somewhat controversial idea for bargain stocks with potential, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) doesn’t exactly put a smile on everyone’s faces due to the underlying big oil business. Plus, forward-looking relevance concerns exist as people shift their mobility to the electric platform. So, it’s definitely an underperformer to the S&P 500.', 'Still, Exxon Mobil deserves another look in my opinion. For starters, analysts peg XOM as a consensus strong buy with an average price target of $131. That’s a solid return during any market cycle. Additionally, the company features a dividend yield of 3.57% along with a low (sustainable) payout ratio of 35.24%.', 'Fundamentally, hydrocarbons are likely here to stay for the long haul. Fundamentally, very few energy sources command the energy density of fossil fuels. Additionally, population expansion and possibly worsening geopolitical tensions should shift emphasis toward energy diversification rather than complete transitions. Aside from an understandable blip in 2020, Exxon has been consistently profitable over the past several years.', 'Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com', 'Perhaps the riskiest idea on this list of bargain stocks with potential, automaker General Motors (NYSE:GM) should not be entered into lightly. Following a relatively brief but painful labor union dispute, General Motors has the unenviable task of restoring investor confidence. However, in recent sessions, GM stock has demonstrated significant signs of life.', 'Certainly, analysts remain optimistic about the auto giant, pegging shares a consensus moderate buy. Overall, their average price target stands at $45.33. Further, the high-side target is much more aggressive at $90. That’s a recent late-November call by Citi’s Itay Michaeli. Fundamentally, the company’s concerted effort to pivot to electric vehicles should pay off handsomely. After all, GM benefits from several iconic brands that it can pivot toward electric mobility.', 'However, it’s not giving up entirely on its racing heritage, as evidenced by the company’s eighth-generation Corvette. This car pumps out a mid-engine confirmation V8, which is unheard of at the price point GM is offering it. That should bring some excitement to the table. Finally, GM trades for a lowly forward earnings multiple of 4.81x. If you want to speculate on the blue chips, GM could be it.', 'On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

It's an investment approach where the focus is on companies that consistently increase their dividends over time. This means they're not just paying dividends, but actively growing them, which signals financial health and stability. According to a report by ProShares, dividend growth strategies have shown impressive resilience, outperforming the broader market over the years. They've not only weathered turbulent times but also thrived in upward-trending markets. The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some of the best examples of dividend growth stocks as these companies maintain decades-long dividend growth streak."", ""Dividend-paying stocks serve a crucial role beyond just providing dividends. They often demonstrate a defensive quality, which becomes valuable when safeguarding wealth is necessary to maintain a consistent income. Eagle Asset Management's report studied periods when the S&P 500 experienced significant declines of at least 15%, followed by a return to its previous high. The report utilized three benchmarks centered on dividends to highlight the significance of investing not only in dividend-yielding companies but also in those that consistently increase their dividends over time. Upon analyzing the data closely, it was evident that indexes comprising dividend-paying companies typically outperform the broader market, such as the S&P 500, specifically during extended downturns. This illustrates the resilience and potential for better performance of dividend-oriented investments during challenging market phases."", ""Dividends hold a significant role in the global stock market landscape, constituting a substantial portion of the MSCI World Index's yearly returns, amounting to about 34% since February 1, 1970. Engaging in extended ownership of companies focused on dividend growth has offered various notable benefits historically. These advantages encompass robust returns both in absolute terms and concerning risk-adjusted performance across entire market cycles. Such investments have showcased lower volatility compared to the broader MSCI World Index, demonstrating an ability to preserve capital even amidst challenging market conditions. Additionally, they present a diversified income source that has the potential for both income growth and appreciation of capital."", ""Nuveen's report stressed how increasing dividends over time is important for shareholders. It found that companies worldwide that regularly raised their dividends did better than those that didn't pay dividends when markets got uncertain, especially when measured by the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX).

Including the contribution from Seagen and excluding revenues from Comirnaty(2) and Paxlovid, Pfizer expects to achieve full-year 2024 operational(3) revenue growth of 8% to 10%. Excluding revenues from Comirnaty(2) and Paxlovid and the expected contribution from Seagen, Pfizer expects to achieve full-year 2024 operational(3) revenue growth of 3% to 5%. Both expected operational(3) growth rate ranges are compared with the mid-point of Pfizer’s full-year 2023 revenue guidance range provided on October 31, 2023, and account for the reclassification of royalty income. While the company will begin reporting royalty income in the revenue line in 2024, for growth rate purposes, the company has included royalty income in both 2023 and 2024. Consequently, there is no operational revenue growth attributable to the reclassification of royalty income.', 'Including the impact of Seagen, Pfizer anticipates full-year 2024 Adjusted(5) SI&A expenses to be in the range of $13.8 billion to $14.8 billion and full-year 2024 Adjusted(5) R&D expenses to be in the range of $11.0 to $12.0 billion. Consequently, total 2024 Adjusted(5) SI&A and R&D expenses are expected to be in the range of $24.8 to $26.8 billion. This range reflects an anticipated decline of approximately $4 billion by the end of 2024 and represents an incremental $500 million expense reduction versus the midpoint of Pfizer’s SI&A and R&D expense guidance provided on August 1, 2023, solely driven by Pfizer’s cost realignment program. 2024 Adjusted(5) diluted EPS is anticipated to be in a range of $2.05 to $2.25, which primarily reflects expected operational(3) growth of 8%-10% in revenues, excluding Comirnaty(2) and Paxlovid, and including the impact of Seagen, as well as anticipated operating margin improvement from the company’s cost realignment activities, partially offset by an expected $0.40 dilutive impact related to the Seagen acquisition, which is predominantly driven by costs to finance the transaction.', 'A reconciliation of Pfizer’s 2023 Financial Guidance to its 2024 Financial Guidance(1)(6), including certain significant factors impacting 2024 Financial Guidance, is presented below.', '2023 PfizerGuidance (asof October 31,2023)', '2024LegacyPfizerGuidance', 'AnticipatedImpact ofRoyaltyReclassincluded in2024Guidance', 'Anticipated2024SeagenImpactincluded in2024Guidance', '2024 FinancialGuidance', 'Revenues ($ in billions)', '$58.0 – $61.0', '$54.5 – $57.5', '$1.0', '$3.1', '$58.5 – $61.5', 'Adjusted(5) SI&A Expenses ($ in billions)', '$13.3 – $14.3', '$13.8 – $14.8', 'Adjusted(5) R&D Expenses ($ in billions)', '$11.9 – $12.9', '$11.0 – $12.0', 'Effective Tax Rate on Adjusted(5) Income', '~12%', '~15%', 'Adjusted(5) Diluted EPS', '$1.45 – $1.65', '$2.45 – $2.65', '-', '($0.40)', '$2.05 – $2.25', 'Financial guidance for Adjusted(5) diluted EPS is calculated using approximately 5.75 billion weighted average shares outstanding, and assumes no share repurchases in 2023 or 2024.', 'Seagen AcquisitionAs announced on December 12, 2023, Pfizer and Seagen have received all required regulatory approvals for the closing of the acquisition.

If you initiated a position in the summer of 2017, you saw the stock nearly gain 500%, only to crash back down to the same levels at which you bought it. However, back then, PayPal's quarterly total payment volume was only $106 billion versus the $388 billion it processes in each quarter now."", ""So, how can a stock trade at the same levels despite incredible business growth? It all concerns sentiment and expectations, and PayPal's are incredibly low. However, I think this could all turn around in 2024, making it a great year to own PayPal stock."", 'In 2017, PayPal was still a strong pick for a company that could capture the growing mobile payments market. Now, it has clearly lost ground to apps the phone creators champion.', ""This part of the pessimistic view has weighed on the stock. Another has been PayPal's falling transaction margin. For the second quarter of 2017, PayPal's transaction margin was 56.3%. In Q3 2023, this figure had fallen to 45.4%, a notable decline. This has significantly narrowed PayPal's gross margins."", ""A large part of this is the rise of Venmo, one of the most popular peer-to-peer payment services. PayPal has struggled to monetize Venmo, as it doesn't charge fees for the service (unless the user instantly transfers money to a bank). The gains would be incredible if PayPal could figure out how to monetize it. PayPal has also had other blunders along the way, like losing its place as the sole payments processor for online market operator eBay and attempting to purchase the billboard site Pinterest."", 'This adds up to a company many have lost faith in despite PayPal consistently increasing revenue and profit. As a result, PayPal has transitioned from a growth stock to a value stock, but there is still an investible business here.', ""In Q3, PayPal's revenue rose 8% year over year. While this isn't market-beating growth, revenue isn't everything. With focussed buybacks and improved efficiencies, a skillful management team can turn high-single-digit percentage growth into market-beating double-digit percentage earnings growth."", ""Fortunately, PayPal has been doing that. While PayPal's earnings per share (EPS) figure declined year over year (due to a one-time boost PayPal had in Q3 2022), its operating margin has widening after dipping in 2022 (which accelerated PayPal's sell-off)."", 'This is also a focus for new Chief Executive Officer Alex Chriss, who stated on PayPal\'s recent conference call: ""We will become leaner, more efficient, and more effective, driving greater velocity, innovation, and impact for customers."" If PayPal can expand its margins with steady revenue growth, it might be able to increase earnings growth at a double-digit percentage pace.', 'PayPal is also reducing its share count because it believes the stock is trading at a deep discount to its intrinsic value. Over the past 12 months, PayPal has repurchased 75 million shares for about $5.4 billion, reducing the shares outstanding by about 5%. By cutting the share count, PayPal guarantees EPS growth of 5.3% if the net income is unchanged.', ""While that exact interaction didn't happen in Q3, that's what will happen over the long term if PayPal continues on this trajectory. So, PayPal could produce market-beating earnings growth, which should keep its valuation in line with the broader market. However, that's hasn't happened."", 'Data source: YCharts.\xa0', ""Compared to the S&P 500, which trades at about 25 times trailing and 21 times forward earnings, PayPal's shares are trading at a substantial discount. That makes it a real bargain."", 'Will PayPal ever return to its former growth stock glory? Probably not.

We get questions about this basket all the time. People are very interested in these companies. It's something we talked about for many years. As a reminder for listeners who may not be as familiar, we're talking about in specific Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, and Block. Those are the four companies that make up the official war on cash basket. Though hey, listen, we encourage all listeners, hey, get creative, make the war on cash basket that's right for you. It doesn't have to be those four. We've even talked about a war on cash basket Part 2 on these shows before. But Matt, we're gonna kick it off with these four specifically. I want to start with the two big toll boosts. Visa and Mastercard, because these are the ones that are always just in your face so obvious and yet some folks will say, these are companies that are headed the way the Dodo bird. Crypto and Web 3.0 they're going to obsolete these networks. But I tell you to this point met, it really doesn't feel that way at all."", ""Matt Frankel: We haven't revisited the war on cash basket in quite some time. We looked like mad geniuses for the war on cash basket in around 2021 for a while there. Now it's doing OK, but it's come back to Earth a little bit. But you mentioned Visa and Mastercard, and I don't want to get into what I think Crypto is going to do or not do because it's not that long of a show. But my short answer is both of these businesses are not going anywhere. We can cover them in one swoop because I'd say they're like 95% the same company."", ""Jason Moser: It does feel like this is a lows Home Depot situation. When you cover one, you cover the other. They're a little bit different but they're the two that really ruled the roost."", 'Matt Frankel: One is 30% bigger than the other, a lows Home Depot situation. The numbers look pretty similar. If I look at the most recent quarter, both of them grew revenue by the exact same amount, up 11%. Earnings were up 22% at Visa and 24% at Mastercard. Payment volume is enormous at these companies. Between the two of them they have, just doing the quick math in my head here, they have $22 trillion of annualized payment volume between the two of them.', 'Jason Moser: Wow.', ""Matt Frankel: It's roughly split 50, 50 between the US and international. There are 4.26 billion Visa cards in the world, between credit and debit cards, 3.26 billion Mastercards. These are massive payment networks. They are not going anywhere. What a lot of people don't realize is that the other companies we're going to talk about like PayPal and Block, as well as a lot of these Fintech start-ups and a lot of the Crypto companies, it's not an either or. Visa wants companies Block to do well because guess what? Those little cash cards have a Visa logo on them. They want these companies to do well, these Fintech start-ups, it's a win win situation. I call Visa and Mastercard the ultimate war on cash stocks because whatever Fintechs win the battle, Visa and Mastercard win too."", ""Jason Moser: Well, they've done a very good job I think through the years of finding new avenues or ways into that payments value chain. I think you make a very good point there in that you've got a lot of these new fangled Fintech companies, they're doing neat things. We'll talk about embedded finance to an extent here in a little bit as well. But they all rely on those rails at one point or another. You're seeing attempts at disruption there, you see things like Fed now and whatnot, trying to basically invent new sets of rails to give more choices, more options, quicker transmission of money finances. But it seems to boil down to the fact that these are two businesses, these rails in Visa and Mastercard are just inexorable parts of the value chain here when it comes to payments, no matter what the company."", ""Matt Frankel: It's also worth mentioning that Visa and Mastercard don't have their hands in some areas of finance yet especially person to person transfers, which PayPal and Block are both known for. That's a massive opportunity there. But you're right, they are the rails. It's not a complete duopoly, you have American Express and Discover in the US and in a lot of foreign markets, Visa and Mastercard are not the dominant players like they are here. If you go to some parts of the world, credit card acceptance isn't even that widespread yet."", ""Jason Moser: I've lived in a few of those places. [laughs]"", ""Matt Frankel: You don't want to go backpacking through certain parts of Latin America and not have cash, it doesn't really work out that well in a lot of cases. But they're very mature and profitable businesses, very profitable. They have net margins that would make pretty much any other company jealous, but they're not mature to the point where they don't have any room to grow. There's a lot of international opportunity, I mentioned person to person payments. There's business to business transfers that are very prevalent that no one's really figured out how to make money off of yet. But they are definitely the rails and they're not going anywhere."", ""Jason Moser: I'm glad you mentioned earlier that, we look maybe a little bit more like geniuses with this war on cash basket, maybe a couple of years back. Obviously the performance was significantly higher than. It is worth noting this war on cash basket of Mastercard, Visa, PayPal, Block in equal weightings. The inception date of July 24th, 2017 is worth noting. This basket is still up 130% versus the market's 105%. Even with this pullback specifically, I mean, I'd look at companies like Block and PayPal, even with the pullback in companies like those, the basket is still outperforming. Let's go to PayPal because I think this is an interesting story from a number of angles. PayPal, you talk about a business with so much potential, but one that's clearly going through some growing pains. There's new leadership, hopefully there's new renewed focus there. But Matt why is the market so glass half empty on PayPal these days?"", ""Matt Frankel: You mentioned the new leadership and that kind of is one of the things that I'm excited to see if their growth strategy is a little bit more like you said, focused. Their growth was very disjointed for a while. I don't know if you remember when they were trying to acquire Pinterest."", ""Jason Moser: I do. Well, it seems like it goes back to that phrase, everything app. They wanted to be this super app in doing everything for everyone. You know what, culturally, at least on this side of the world, it just doesn't seem like that's what consumers want."", ""Matt Frankel: I'm a big Pinterest shareholder, so I'll take it. But I was sitting there scratching my head like, what are they going to do with it? They were going to buy them out for $70 a share, it's also worth noting. It was a very disjointed growth strategy. I would call it all over the place. Some of their acquisition certainly made sense, like Honey definitely made sense as an acquisition whether or not they overpaid for is another conversation."", ""Matt Frankel: A lot of companies overpaid in 2021, 2022 for acquisitions just based on the valuation environment at the time. It's not that management made bad decisions. The other thing is PayPal had these very ambitious growth targets that it looked during the pandemic years like they were going to meet without any issue. For one, they have about 430 million active users right now. Their CEO, this was only a couple of years ago, said we're going to hit 750 million users in just a few years. Clearly that's been walked back a little bit since then. The strategy has definitely shifted from we're going to hit 750 million in a few years, then we're going to go on to one billion and we're just going to go from there. Now it's gone to we have 430 million good users let's figure out how to maximize them. The question is, can PayPal extract any more value out of its current user base. Venmo in particular, has been very slow to monetize, I would say. But the numbers look better than the stock price might lead you to believe. PayPal is growing. Not maybe as the market wants it to, the user base is actually declining a bit but the users that they have, they're doubling down on, they're more engaged. Total payment volume is up 15% year of a year. That's outpacing inflation. This isn't just inflation driven. Revenue is up 8% year every year. Non-transaction expenses, which has been a big focus area, there's down 12% year every year despite higher payment volume. That combination 20% earnings growth year over year, they're really engaging their members better. The average active PayPal account makes 56.6 transactions per quarter. That's 13% higher than a year ago. They're doing a great job of engagement. This is an absolute cash machine, this is a profitable business. A lot of people think of PayPal as a tech company, which in a lot of minds translates to unprofitable. They have roughly $15 million of cash on their balance sheet. They generate over $5 million of free cash flow annually, which right now they're putting it all into buybacks."", ""Jason Moser: I'm just going to say, we talk about how companies reinvest this capital, this cash flow. I mean, PayPal is really making a big effort here to buy back a lot of these shares right now. I mean, clearly they see at least some value in where the share is right now."", 'Matt Frankel: Yeah, I mean, they\'ve retired 5% of their shares in the past year. They\'ve spent $5.4 billion in buybacks during that period. Essentially, all their free cash flow is going into buybacks right now. Now my hope is that they find some bolt on acquisitions that could drive value. That\'s the preference. It\'s like Warren Buffett says, ""Our first priority is figuring out how to maximize our current business then we\'ll worry about buybacks and things like that."" But that tells me that they see a real deep value here if they\'re not doing anything else with their money. I mean, and I mentioned, they have a lot of cash on their balance sheet, so that gives them a cushion to spend their money on buybacks and still be able to pursue acquisitions or whatever if they arise. But this is a very cheap business. It trades for I think, less than 15 times forward earnings like 12 times for a while there. If you had told me that was going to be PayPal\'s valuation a couple of years ago, we would have both thought that was kind of a silly statement to make.', ""Jason Moser: It definitely seems like a bit of an overreaction to the downside there. I'm not saying that the market was necessarily rational in 2022 either. But yeah, it does feel like given, I mean, this is the company in a fundamentally a very good position, good financials, playing into a market where there are clear and obvious tailwinds that are not abating. Then it's going to really just boil down to new leadership. Seems like new leadership is some focus, they're trying to pull back from that super app aspiration. Really just dig down into what they do really well, which could work out very well for the company. I mean, these companies go through growing pains all the time. It's never a straight line up. Speaking of never a straight line up, I mean let's look at block here because this is another really interesting story to follow here. The Fintech formerly known as Square, now it's block and it's got Square, it's got cash app, it's got these crypto aspirations with Bitcoin. It's got title and music streaming. I'm not exactly sure what the focus there, so we talk about PayPal and maybe that we're a little bit relieved that it looks like this company is getting some focus back. I think it's a fair question to ask, at least with block, is this a company that is losing focus?"", ""Matt Frankel: Well, as you know, I've been a block shareholder for the long haul. I bought two days. I'm right, two days after the IPO, I've written block from $9 a share all the way up to $280 a share and back to where it is now. I've been a fan of this company for a long time. The last time I saw you in person, we were interviewing Block co founder Jim Mckelvey."", ""Jason Moser: Oh yeah, that's right, that was a fun interview."", ""Matt Frankel: Their growth strategy over the past few years. I could also describe like PayPals, It's like all over the place. But they weren't just talking about making acquisitions that didn't make sense. They actually did a couple. You mentioned title, which I'm not really sure what the point of that was."", ""Jason Moser: Now that felt like either he was appeasing Jay Z, trying to kind of get tight in that club, or maybe this was just like a gamble on NFT's, which clearly that had worked out so well. But any which way you cut it, I just don't see the logic in that deal. But thankfully, they didn't pay an arm and a leg for Judge."", ""Matt Frankel: Speaking of paying an arm and a leg, I'm glad you just used it."", 'Jason Moser: I knew where this was going.', 'Matt Frankel: They also acquired After Pay which made sense. That is definitely a fit in the business. Not for $29 million.', 'Jason Moser: That was a lot.', 'Matt Frankel: It thankfully, it was an all stock deal so as their stock went down, the essential price they paid for the acquisition went down as well. I think it would be something like $6 million if you look at their current stock price, stop doing that, focus. That\'s kind of my point with with Jack Dorsey. The first line of his recent shareholder letter really made me smile. It said, ""We\'ve been quiet lately because we\'ve been focused,"" and if you think about it, you really haven\'t heard any news from Block lately. You\'ve heard a lot from PayPal, the new CEO, the management, shake up the strategy shift. You really haven\'t heard much from Block. They\'re really focusing their efforts and they\'re doing a lot of things that are very non Jack Dorsey esque, in the sense that, number 1, they\'re really focusing on controlling costs. He\'s generally a growth at all costs type of guy. They capped the number of employees they\'re going to have. They implemented a $1 million buyback program, which that\'s the first time I\'ve ever heard the words buyback in block the same sentences. Unlike PayPal, their business is still growing very rapidly. Gross profit was up 21% year over year in the last quarter. Cash app is still growing. The payments ecosystem is still growing. The Afterpay integration actually looks like it\'s adding significant value to the business, but there is a long way to go when it comes to reaching profitability. Out of the four we\'ve talked about so far, this is the least profitable by a long shot. Now, they could be very profitable today if they would stop pumping so much money into growth run in their expenses. I mentioned that\'s just now becoming a priority. They\'re a little late to the party with that.', ""Matt Frankel: I mentioned they did a $1 billion buyback authorization, that's not even going to cover their stock based compensation for the year. That's just really to offset it. Their share account is not going to go down even if they buy back $1 billion worth of stock. Things like that really need to be brought under control for this to really return to the level it was at before."", ""Jason Moser: I think that makes a lot of sense. I appreciate you bringing up the buy now, pay later stuff because I think in the very beginning stages of that market, I think we all probably looked at it at least with the healthy dose of skepticism. It seems ultimately like BNPL is more or less just credit card in a different name. But when you look at it, clearly consumers are looking at that more and more as an option, and retailers are looking at that more and more as an option. I said it before, if it's something that enables consumers to spend and it enables retailers to sell, then it's a value. If you look at the Adobe Analytics, they're talking about for Cyber Monday alone, BNPL is going to grow nearly 19% close to $785 million in sales. It's clearly an option that consumers are gravitating more and more toward. So even if block overpaid, which is obviously something that's debatable though, I think we probably would all agree they paid a lot. Maybe that is something that does pay off down the road. You look at the tail ones in that market, maybe it is something that ends up paying off. Matt, I wanted to dig into a few other companies in this space, companies that we like to follow tangentially, ones we don't get to talk as much about, but companies that probably many listeners are very familiar. We wanted to start with Marqeta, and I think it's a nice segue from Block into Marqeta because Marqeta in Block, they're joined at the hip, aren't they?"", ""Matt Frankel: Yeah. Well, Block is their biggest customer, specifically the Cash App by far. Marqeta is a credit card infrastructure or a payment card infrastructure provider is the best way I could describe them. In addition to being the company that provides the technology behind the Cash App card, they also do things like they provide cards for Uber. If you ever do an Instacard grocery order, they're the company that allows your credit card to be used in store without you physically being there with your card. Your shopper can buy groceries on your behalf things like that. They provide the technology behind these things. Cash App makes up a big part of their revenue. It was a huge sigh of relief for investors when Cash App renewed its contract this year. That was up to expire. I think it's now renewed."", 'Jason Moser: Big deal.', ""Matt Frankel: That would have been a nail in the coffin. I think that's renewed through 2028, I believe."", 'Jason Moser: Four additional years, I believe.', ""Matt Frankel: As a result, the company reset this year. The renewal rates as is rather common when you sign a new contract, the initial rate goes down but you agreed to four more years. You saw their revenue decline by 43% year over year, but that doesn't tell the story about how the business is going. That's just because the Cash App rates went down quite a bit. If you look at the numbers, the payment volume through Marqeta's platform is up 33% year over year. They say, start judging our growth again in the third quarter of 2024. That'll be one year after the Cash App renewal. So you'll see year over year comparisons of revenue, they're really apples to apples comparisons. High gross margin business 67% gross margin. They have up $1.3 billion in cash, so they don't really have to worry about being profitable just yet. It's only a $3 billion market cap company, so that's a lot of cash on hand. On an adjusted basis, they're on the verge of profitability, but their growth has been very impressive. I'd like to see them continue to diversify their revenue away from Cash App. But really impressive business and it's a technology that is very much needed and is going to be increasingly needed as those type of businesses really expand."", ""Jason Moser: I suspect you're right. I mentioned embedded finance earlier in the show and that really is what Marqeta is. It's embedded finance. It's bringing those finance capabilities into apps that aren't necessarily Fintech companies. You mentioned Uber, DoorDash, companies like that that rely on drivers or delivery drivers going in there and picking up something and needing to charge it to a card then gets charged to the individual consumer buying the product or whatever. That embedded finance market, it's an interesting one. It really is growing as we see the mobile economy, the digital economy, the gig economy, continue to grow. It does feel like there's a lot of opportunity there for Marqeta and it was very good news to see them continuing that relationship with Block because I have a feeling that that should pay off down the road. Matt, Shift4 payments. This is not a business I'm as familiar with, one that you follow. What does Shift4 do and what do you like about them today?"", ""Matt Frankel: They do payment processing and software for businesses. They're specifically concentrated in restaurants and hotels. They're the actual consumer-facing software terminals and things like that that you'll see when you go to pay for a hotel stay or things of that nature. Pretty big and successful company. A little over $5 billion market cap. So bigger than Marqeta and profitable on a gap basis. They have a 6% net profit margin in the past 12 months. It's a really successful business so far, very strong growth, payment processing volume is growing 36% year over year, 23% revenue growth. They get a percentage of transaction volume and some software revenue, things like that. Over the past five years, they've grown at a 48% annualized rate sustained over four years, and including in this slowdown, they're still growing. Their main focus is restaurants and hotels. They've expanded that quite a bit in the past couple of years. Stadiums and sporting venues are a big focus area for them. They recently acquired a company called Appetize that gets them into a lot more sports venues. I believe, if I remember correctly, that you're a golfer, I'm sure you've heard of Pebble Beach Resorts."", 'Jason Moser: You remember correctly.', 'Matt Frankel: Pebble Beach Resorts is a recent big winner that added Shift4 as their payment processing partner and non-profit organizations are another big vertical of theirs like habitat for you matter to use the Shift4 as their payment software. Interesting software play on the payments industry.', ""Jason Moser: Well finally met one that most listeners are probably pretty familiar with. May have heard of this company, Mercado Libre. It's what we talked about on occasion here. [laughs] It's not just a marketplace, this really is a Fintech play as well. How does Mercado Libre continue to gain share because it really feels like they have just got everything going in the right direction?"", ""Matt Frankel: They keep building out their ecosystem and it's really impressive. Their profitability really has gotten much better in the past couple of years too. If I'm looking at some of these growth numbers, I'm thinking, what's the slowdown? On both sides of their business, you have the e-commerce platform, merchandise volumes up almost 60% year over year. It's not just inflation because let's be fair, they operate in some countries where inflation is way, Argentina, inflation is over 100% right now."", ""Jason Moser: That's such a bad deal what we've got going on here right now. [laughs]"", ""Matt Frankel: It puts ours into perspective. But the number of items sold on the platform is up 26% year over year, so it's not just inflation. On the payment side, total payment volume on the Mercado Pago is up over 120% year over year. What's slowdown? If you look at their numbers, you would have no idea that's going on. Their credit business is doing well, Mercado Credito is doing well. Forgive my terrible Spanish accent."", ""My high school Spanish teacher would be very upset at me right now. But their credit portfolio is growing and performing to expectations. On the bottom line, they're very profitable. It's really rare you find a company growing revenue at almost 70% year over year with great bottom line profitability. They have an 18% operating margin, so it's a powerhouse business. I'm not surprised, it just recently hit a 52 week high. One of my largest investments and I'm sure a lot of people listening and people at the Fool could say the same. People always throw around this is an early stage Blank but this really is like an early stage Amazon, PayPal all rolled into one."", ""Jason Moser: Sounds familiar Matt. Well, listen, that's a lot of Fintech in a short amount of time. We're going to leave it there. But hey, thank you for making some time for us this week."", ""Matt Frankel: Thanks for having me. It's always good to get back together with you for a fun episode."", ""Mary Long: As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about, and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear.

But over the long term, stable dividend stocks usually outperform fixed-income investments as their prices rise and investors use dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs) to boost their total returns.', 'Therefore, investors should still keep an eye out for promising dividend stocks that could make them rich. I believe these three stocks fit that description: Opera (NASDAQ: OPRA), Philip Morris International (NYSE: PM), and IBM (NYSE: IBM).', ""Opera is best known for its namesake web browser, which ranks fifth in the market behind Alphabet's Google Chrome, Apple Safari, Microsoft Edge, and Mozilla Firefox. However, Opera also has a mobile gaming browser and a stand-alone news app. It served 311 million monthly active users across all those apps in its latest quarter."", 'Opera also continues to grow, despite being branded an underdog in the browser market. Analysts expect its revenue and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to grow 15% and 13%, respectively, next year, as its core advertising business stabilizes in a warmer macro environment. The rollout of new artificial intelligence (AI) services for its browsers could also lock in its users and widen its moat against its larger competitors.', ""Opera's stock already looks cheap at 12 times forward earnings, but it also caught the attention of income investors over the past year by paying out a special dividend of $0.80 per share in February and initiating a recurring semi-annual dividend of $0.40 per share in June. That new dividend translates to a whopping forward yield of 7.1%."", ""Opera's fundamentals are attractive, but its stock remains slightly below its IPO price of $12. Therefore, I believe investors who buy this stock while the bulls are looking the other way might net some big gains in the future."", ""Philip Morris International, one of the largest cigarette manufacturers in the world, was spun off from Altria in 2008 to handle its former parent's overseas divisions.

But as that strategy ran out of steam, it rolled out its iQOS heated tobacco devices -- which heat up tobacco sticks instead of burning them -- over the past nine years. That gradual growth of its smoke-free products (which accounted for 32% of its revenue last year) offset its declining shipments of cigarettes, and it grew at a more stable rate than Altria -- which repeatedly fumbled its expansion beyond traditional cigarettes.', ""As a result, analysts still expect PMI's revenue and adjusted EPS to rise 5% and 6%, respectively, in 2024. That stability has enabled PMI to raise its dividend every year since its split with Altria, and it currently pays an attractive forward yield of 5.7%.

So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. We can see that Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) does use debt in its business. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?"", ""Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Marathon Petroleum ', 'The chart below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Marathon Petroleum had US$26.8b in debt in September 2023; about the same as the year before. However, it also had US$13.1b in cash, and so its net debt is US$13.7b.', 'Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Marathon Petroleum had liabilities of US$21.7b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$35.4b due beyond that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$13.1b as well as receivables valued at US$12.5b due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$31.6b.', ""This deficit isn't so bad because Marathon Petroleum is worth a massive US$54.4b, and thus could probably raise enough capital to shore up its balance sheet, if the need arose. But we definitely want to keep our eyes open to indications that its debt is bringing too much risk."", ""In order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio)."", ""Marathon Petroleum has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.71. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 21.1 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. On the other hand, Marathon Petroleum saw its EBIT drop by 4.3% in the last twelve months. If earnings continue to decline at that rate the company may have increasing difficulty managing its debt load. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Marathon Petroleum's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting."", ""Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. During the last three years, Marathon Petroleum generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 83% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so."", ""Marathon Petroleum's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. But truth be told we feel its level of total liabilities does undermine this impression a bit. Looking at all the aforementioned factors together, it strikes us that Marathon Petroleum can handle its debt fairly comfortably. On the plus side, this leverage can boost shareholder returns, but the potential downside is more risk of loss, so it's worth monitoring the balance sheet. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Be aware that  Marathon Petroleum is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those can't be ignored..."", ""If, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a rock-solid balance sheet, then check out our list of net cash growth stocks without delay."", 'Have feedback on this article?

Citi is one of three large American banks to be designated in “bucket 3 or 4” of the “global systemically important bank” (“G-SIB”) framework by The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The other banks in this group are J.P. Morgan and Bank of America.', 'As a G-SIB, Citi is subjected to increased regulatory supervision by global bank regulators and central banks. Enhanced regulatory supervision was an important post-crisis reform to strengthen the global financial system by increasing bank capital ratios, transparency, and decreasing risk-taking. These reforms resulted in the largest G-SIBs moving away from risk-oriented banking activities such as advisory, high-yield lending, and trading, towards lower-risk activities. Indeed, Citi’s most valuable, high-growth segment, Treasury and Trade Solutions, is in lower-risk and entrenched activities such as liquidity and cash management, payments, trade solutions, and automated receivables processing. In our view, somewhat unintuitively, Citi’s increased regulatory supervision contributes to the company’s less risky banking business model, and thus its attractiveness as a downside-oriented investment opportunity.', 'Citi’s market perception suffers from the bank’s negative historical reputation. In 2008 during the Great Financial Crisis, Citi received the most TARP funding (the largest “bailout”) of the U.S. banks. TARP funding was provided by the U.S. government to forestall a liquidity problem that threatened to become a solvency problem. More recently, Citi mistakenly used its own capital to pay lenders when acting as Revlon’s loan agent, resulting in a $400M fine by the Federal Reserve and orders to resolve internal controls (which Citi fulfilled). Citi’s large global consumer bank was assembled by prior management in the early 2000s to attract and service high-end global consumers. Unfortunately, this pivot was costly and ill-timed in the context of increasingly complex multi-jurisdictional regulation to prevent money laundering and tax evasion.

Ford has now told its F-150 Lightning suppliers that it is planning to slash that output to around 1,600 Lightnings assembled per week, or half the original goal, per a memo obtained by Automotive News.', 'When Yahoo Finance reached out to Ford for comment, the automaker said it was “matching production to customer demand.” Clearly, customer demand has fallen, as consumers balk at paying higher prices for EVs compared to gas-powered cars, as well as paying higher financing costs compared to only a couple of years ago.\xa0For instance the F-150 Lightning Pro starts at $49,995 (before tax credits), whereas a base XL SuperCrew F-150 gas-powered truck starts at $40,780.', 'Read more: Are electric cars more expensive to insure?', 'That being said, Ford reported a record month for F-150 Lightning sales in November, selling nearly 4,400 trucks in the month — a 100% jump from a year ago. However, if Ford averages 5,000 Lightning trucks sold a month next year, that would mean only 60,000 trucks for the year — less than the halved production planned for 2024.', 'Competition is also heating up in the EV truck space, with Tesla’s Cybertruck beginning initial deliveries less than two weeks ago, Rivian selling more of its R1 EV adventure vehicles, and GM about to enter the fray next year with its Silverado EV pickups.', 'Ford had big plans for its EV transformation, as outlined in its Ford+ plan at its Capital Markets Day in May.

This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL)."", 'Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.', ' See our latest analysis for United Airlines Holdings ', 'Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for United Airlines Holdings is:', '32% = US$2.9b ÷ US$8.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.32."", 'One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, United Airlines Holdings has a higher ROE than the average (14%) in the Airlines industry.', ""That's what we like to see. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk."", ""Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking."", 'It appears that United Airlines Holdings makes extensive use of debt to improve its returns, because it has an alarmingly high debt to equity ratio of 3.53. So although the company has an impressive ROE, the company might not have been able to achieve this without the significant use of debt.', ""Return on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE."", 'But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.', 'But note: United Airlines Holdings may not be the best stock to buy.

The move is the latest in the mounting tensions between cabin crew and U.S. airline management that could result in the industry’s first labor action in more than a decade.', 'The agreement that Southwest’s nearly 19,000 flight attendants rejected included pay increases of 36% over five years and other quality of life improvements. The offer clearly was not enough: 64% of those who voted rejected the agreement.', '“The flight attendants of Southwest Airlines have made it clear that this proposed contract is not going to heal the hurt,” said Lyn Montgomery, president of the Transport Workers Union Local 556 that represents the crew members. “We will go back to the table to achieve the collective bargaining agreement that meets the needs of the hardest-working flight attendants in the industry.”', 'The union declined to comment further.', 'One area of disagreement concerns boarding pay. Almost all U.S. flight attendants are paid only when an aircraft door is closed, rather than during the boarding and deplaning process. Delta Air Lines is the sole U.S. carrier that pays cabin crew for boarding, a policy it added last year amid a drive to unionize (the airline’s cabin crew is currently not unionized).', 'Cabin crew unions at Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Spirit Airlines, and United Airlines are all in active contract negotiations. American flight attendants have gone as far as to authorize a potential strike.', 'Labor is having a moment in the U.S. Strikes have been successful in a number of high profile industries from the big auto manufacturers to actors and screenwriters in Hollywood. And the threat of strikes helped freight railroad employees reach long-sought deals. Organizing campaigns have succeeded at historically non-union companies like Starbucks.', '“People, they’re furious,” said Sara Nelson, president of the largest flight attendants union, the Association of Flight Attendants. “They’re furious that they haven’t been recognized, and their demands are very high.”', 'Flight attendants were on the frontlines of the pandemic. That included dealing with a surge in unruly fliers and having to enforce controversial rules like the mask mandate.', 'In addition to the ground pay issue, another issue concerns the work rules that govern when flights are delayed and canceled, said Embry-Riddle Professor Blaise Waguespack. This was top of mind for many Southwest crews following the airline’s meltdown last December when it “lost” many of its pilots and flight attendants.', 'Some airline executives have received big pay increases as their carriers have returned to profitability post-Covid. And pilots across the industry — even among historically lower-cost regional airlines — have ratified contracts with historic pay levels.', '“It’s a busy season for labor relations,” Waguespack said.', '“Flight attendants across the industry are tired of waiting,” said Julie Hedrick, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, which represents crews at American, in a September virtual town hall.', 'That is especially true of flight attendants at American. Their contract became amendable in January 2019 and cabin crew have not received a pay raise since then, Hedrick said.', 'The flat pay has come even as inflation has driven prices 18% higher than in 2019.', 'Strikes at airlines are governed by the U.S. Railway Labor Act. The law lays out strict rules: mediated talks, a strike authorization vote, followed by a release from mediation, and finally a 30-day so-called cooling off period before a strike can begin. There are typically several months between each step. And then, the president can still intervene and stop a strike.', 'The more than 23,000 flight attendants at American authorized a strike in August, and then sought a release from mediated talks in November. The request was denied by the National Mediation Board.', 'If flight attendants at American did strike — a big if — it would be the first at a U.S. airline since pilots at Spirit Airlines struck in June 2010. The scale of such an action at American, however, would be several orders of magnitude greater: Spirit flew less than 1% of all U.S. domestic flights in 2010 whereas American flies nearly 23% today, according to Cirium Diio data.', 'One needs to go back to 2005 to find the last time staff at a major airline went on strike – that’s when mechanics at Northwest Airlines walked off the job.', 'Even a “CHAOS,” or Create Havoc Around Our System, strike that only targets a few flights could be very disruptive. Neither the airline nor passengers know what flights will be affected in a CHAOS action until it happens, which could leave planes full of passengers stranded at the gate without crews.', 'The Association of Professional Flight Attendants asked American for a 35% pay increase at the date of signing and annual increases thereafter, while American offered just an 11% increase at signing, Hedrick said in September. The union declined to comment on the current status of negotiations.', '“There’s no way we’re getting the flight attendant contracts done across the industry without a credible strike threat,” Nelson said when asked if she thought a strike is needed to achieve the gains flight attendants seek. “One of the airlines is going to have to face that, [and] the rest are going to have to know that’s coming.”', 'Inflation hit every airline during the pandemic. During the first nine months of the year, unit costs excluding fuel — a measure of how much it costs an airline to fly a seat one mile — were up 15-23% at American, Delta, and United compared to 2019. And that was after they largely eased the run up in expenses after double-digit increases last year.', '“We are facing sizable [cost] headwinds with labor and [the] expectation of a new flight attendant agreement” next year, United Chief Financial Officer Michael Leskinen said in October.', 'That sentiment was shared by his counterparts at Alaska and American, who have all mentioned the potential for labor cost headwinds to Wall Street analysts in recent months.', 'Melius Research analyst Conor Cunningham estimates that a 20% pay increase for flight attendants would cost U.S. airlines roughly $1.9 billion annually, and increase industry unit costs excluding fuel by 1.3%. Add in the boarding pay sought by flight attendants, and expenses would jump another $718 million and unit costs another 0.5%. Southwest would face the largest increases among U.S. airlines.', '“Cost pressures continue to mount in the U.S. airline industry,” Cunningham wrote Monday. “Airlines have slowly been revising down January and February schedules to better match supply with demand in hopes of regaining pricing power … [But] the reduction in supply will further highlight the core cost issues.”', 'Southwest is alone among U.S. airlines as having factored a potential new flight attendant contract into its financial outlook.', 'Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.']"

A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up."", ""So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing."", ' See our latest analysis for Analog Devices ', ""If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow.

The new tax reforms directly impact multinational companies across the globe. The Pillar Two tax reform, signed by 138 countries, accounts for 90% of global economic activity. As per the Pillar Two tax reform, the primary goal is to establish a level playing field for companies across countries. This will primarily be done by discouraging companies from lowering their corporate income taxes in a bid to attract foreign investment. Under the supervision of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), companies with €750 million or more in revenue, are obliged to pay a global minimum tax of 15% on earned income in each country they operate in. OECD suggests that the reform will push corporate taxes globally by $220 billion per year, almost 9% of global corporate income tax revenues. Deloitte further highlights that the Pillar Two tax reform does not limit itself to just taxes, instead, it shapes how multinationals operate their supply chain networks, execute acquisitions, and strategic decisions.', 'Moreover, the system and compliance data are not only difficult to adhere to, but they also demand a complex infrastructure, that businesses need to establish. Under the reform, multinationals will be required to provide data for 100 separate data points for each entity in an organization. Not only do companies have to remodel their organizational structure, but they also have to revisit their financial reporting timelines. Therefore, to address the need for a complex infrastructure, companies will not be expected to report 2024 returns until after 18 months, which provides ample time for companies to adapt and restructure.

Within his portfolio are two stocks that I think investors and Berkshire Hathaway should be buying more of. They are Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Visa (NYSE: V), and I think investors should be taking advantage of the price the market is giving you right now."", ""Amazon is a lot more than an e-commerce site for buying goods. It has a thriving advertising business, a dominant cloud computing offering, and a growing third-party seller service that takes the burden of forecasting trends and obtaining inventory off Amazon's shoulders."", ""This has transformed Amazon into a much more lucrative investment, as its gross margins have substantially expanded as the company's business has moved into higher-margin offerings."", 'This gross margin expansion allowed Amazon to drastically improve its cash flows, which will allow Amazon to repay debt, repurchase shares, start a dividend, or invest in a different business area.', ""Within its current business set, none is more promising than Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing wing. AWS is set to capitalize on the massive cloud computing trend, a vital infrastructure piece for storing data, creating AI models, and doing other computational tasks. The cloud computing market opportunity is expected to increase to more than $1 trillion by 2028, and with Amazon owning the No. 1 market share, it's set to capitalize on this expansion."", 'Despite all of the success Amazon is having, its stock is valued around levels last seen in 2016.', 'Right now looks like an opportune time to load up on Amazon shares, as its transformation is just starting, and there is still a massive opportunity in cloud computing.', ""Visa's credit processing is a vital part of commerce infrastructure. Without it, a significant portion of monetary flow would be impaired because cash cannot be used online. Although there are several competitors in this space, Visa is the largest and has a fantastic business model."", ""The tollbooth business model is one that Buffett has long praised. For Visa, this involves taking a small slice of the money that flows through its channels, similar to how a toll booth collects a toll for all traffic and commerce that flow through it. With Visa setting their toll booth up on the flow of money through commerce, it could be seen as one of the best available to invest in. It's also doing quite well right now."", ""In the fourth quarter of fiscal-year 2023 (ending Oct. 31), Visa's revenue rose 11%, and earnings per share (EPS) shot up 22%. These strong cash flows led to the board of directors to increase the dividend by 16% and authorize a new $25 billion multiyear share repurchase program. This demonstrates Visa's strong position, as it can pay a decent dividend and buy back shares, and still grow at a market-average pace, almost guaranteeing investors a market-crushing investment."", ""It's rare to find companies that can consistently grow above 10% per year and pay a dividend, but that's exactly what Visa is. Furthermore, the stock is the cheapest it has been in a long time."", 'There have been few times over the past decade that Visa has traded at these levels.

This takes the annual payment to 0.9% of the current stock price, which unfortunately is below what the industry is paying."", ' See our latest analysis for Amphenol ', ""The dividend yield is a little bit low, but sustainability of the payments is also an important part of evaluating an income stock. However, Amphenol's earnings easily cover the dividend. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business."", 'The next year is set to see EPS grow by 13.5%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 27% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.', 'The company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $0.105 total annually to $0.88. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 24% per annum over that time. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.', 'Investors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. We are encouraged to see that Amphenol has grown earnings per share at 21% per year over the past five years. Rapid earnings growth and a low payout ratio suggest this company has been effectively reinvesting in its business. Should that continue, this company could have a bright future.', 'In summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.', ""It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. That's why when we briefly looked at Snap-on's (NYSE:SNA) ROCE trend, we were very happy with what we saw."", ""Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Snap-on:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.21 = US$1.3b ÷ (US$7.3b - US$982m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""Thus, Snap-on has an ROCE of 21%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 12% earned by companies in a similar industry."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Snap-on ', ""Above you can see how the current ROCE for Snap-on compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company."", ""It's hard not to be impressed by Snap-on's returns on capital. The company has employed 44% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 21%. Now considering ROCE is an attractive 21%, this combination is actually pretty appealing because it means the business can consistently put money to work and generate these high returns. If Snap-on can keep this up, we'd be very optimistic about its future."", ""In summary, we're delighted to see that Snap-on has been compounding returns by reinvesting at consistently high rates of return, as these are common traits of a multi-bagger. On top of that, the stock has rewarded shareholders with a remarkable 124% return to those who've held over the last five years. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further."", ""Before jumping to any conclusions though, we need to know what value we're getting for the current share price.

(NYSE: TPR), a house of iconic accessories and lifestyle brands consisting of Coach, Kate Spade, and Stuart Weitzman. Tapestry has committed to purchasing 15 years of Impact Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) produced by the projects, which will produce more than 50,000 megawatt hours (MWh) per year with a total estimated 750,000 MWh over the course of 15 years. This commitment helps enable new renewable energy to be developed in Illinois. Additionally, the two companies will invest $2,000 per MW built, or $66,000 total, in local community organizations.', ""What makes this project unique is the multifaceted opportunity to create measurable impact growth of solar energy. Traditional REC purchases typically come from existing wind farms, while Impact REC agreements are structured to put clean energy resources in areas primed to build new solar resources while simultaneously investing in local communities. In Pivot and Tapestry's case, the impact is three-fold –\xa0new clean energy, community investments, and energy burden relief."", ""The new community solar projects are expected to generate an average of 51,760 megawatt-hours of clean electricity per year, equivalent to powering over more than 6,000 average Illinois households annually. Moreover, the additional solar projects, made possible by Tapestry's Impact REC agreement, are being strategically developed in locations with few solar resources. By constructing new renewable energy projects in areas that use a larger percentage of fossil fuels, the impact of avoided pollution can be even greater."", 'The donations tied to each MW constructed will go to local nonprofit organizations focused on equitable workforce development within the renewable energy sector. These organizations provide training to underrepresented groups that live in the counties where the projects will be built.', '""At Tapestry, we know that sustainability is a business imperative. As part of our 2025 corporate responsibility goals, we committed to procuring 100% renewable electricity in our own stores, offices and fulfillment centers globally by 2025,"" said Logan Duran, VP, ESG and Sustainability, Tapestry. ""We also recognize the power of partnerships to drive meaningful change in key environmental and social areas which is why we are thrilled to join with Pivot Energy in implementing these projects in Illinois.""', ""The new community solar projects aim to reduce local residents' and businesses' electricity bills for 20 years and help ensure a stable market for renewable energy production. Tapestry's financial commitment is a significant catalyst for expanding solar in these communities, allowing the projects to move forward without relying on traditional programs, which often have limited capacity for expansion. These community solar projects are set to come online and begin delivering clean energy in early 2025."", '""Pivot\'s partnership with Tapestry is a perfect example of how companies can advance renewable energy solutions for their own sustainability goals, while creating additional opportunities for renewable energy production in the future,"" said Josh Levy, Director of Offsite Solutions with Pivot Energy. ""Tapestry is a model for the fashion industry and its consumers for environmentally-friendly solutions.""', ""Pivot Energy is committed to accelerating the transition to clean energy and positively impacting local communities.

Platforms such as Google Search and YouTube attract billions of users daily, presenting numerous advertising opportunities. With the help of AI, the company can offer more targeted ads and introduce new features to its services that could expand its user base."", ""In Q3, Alphabet posted a revenue rise of 11% year over year, beating analysts' forecasts by $980 million. The growth was primarily owed to increased sales in its Google Search and YouTube ad segments, which rose 11% and 12%."", ""The company's earnings show Alphabet is on a promising growth trajectory.

Let's take a look at Nvidia's biggest growth drivers and if the company can continue delivering significant gains in the coming years."", 'Long before Nvidia became a prominent figure in AI, it took on the weighty task of expanding in a market that barely existed.

Those fears never materialized, though. Instead, higher federal interest rates slowed down price increases, lifting a heavy yoke from the proverbial shoulders of growth stocks and other risk-laden investments. As a result, the stock market staged a solid rebound as the inflationary fears melted away, and the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC)\xa0index now stands just 4% below the all-time highs of January 2022.', 'By some definitions, the stock market has entered a technical bull market, following the proper bear market of 2022.

The five-year returns of the recorded bull markets worked out to an average gain of 169%, or an average of 28.7% per year.', 'With the idea of buying low and selling high (if you ever sell them at all), this could be the perfect time for putting your investable cash to good use. Even if you only have $1,000 to invest right now, you can start meaningful stock positions now. You can always add more money later, or simply sit back and watch your investment grow over the long haul.', 'For example, you should consider Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and  CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) -- two high-octane growth stocks with tremendously bright futures and very large market footprints. They are trading at high valuation ratios already, but for good reasons. Pouncing on these opportunities today should serve you well as the bull market gains momentum.', 'In the ever-evolving realm of cybersecurity, CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) stands out not just as a player but an innovative leader. The company has been analyzing and solving data security threats with artificial intelligence (AI) since 2012.', 'New technology always ups the intensity of the cybersecurity arms race. Right now, both the heroes and the villains are gaining new insights from AI tools. Hackers use machine learning to overcome existing data safeguards, while security experts run deep learning analyses to put up effective shields against the new threats.', 'And with a substantial head start under its belt, CrowdStrike offers some of the fastest and most effective security responses on the market. Moreover, the company already built generative AI functions into its Falcon security system. The interactive AI chatbot, named Charlotte, helps CrowdStrike customers find holes in their data security. Soon, they will be able to build a custom tool to plug those holes.', '""The first thing you could do is ask Charlotte, OK, what should we build?"" CrowdStrike CFO Burt Podbere said at a recent industry conference. ""Charlotte will give you an answer. And the next step would be, OK, Charlotte, build it for us. That\'s huge, right? That\'s going to save time, money, effort. That\'s not here today, asking Charlotte to build you the apps, but you can see where we\'re going.""', ""So CrowdStrike is an AI-based security leader today, with ambitions for even greater cybersecurity solutions in the years ahead. The stock is not exactly cheap today, having gained 116% over the last year and trading at 21 times trailing sales, but you're paying that premium for a top-notch innovator with the rocket engines running at full blast. CrowdStrike's revenue and free cash flows are soaring:"", 'Graphics processing unit (GPU) specialist Nvidia looms large in the tech industry, and I mean really huge. The days of a small-cap company producing gaming-oriented graphics cards like the TNT and Riva 128 are long gone. Now, Nvidia sports a trillion-dollar market cap (and change) thanks to an early lead in the hardware portion of the current AI boom.', ""This transformation is rooted in strategic innovation and market-defining product releases. The latest feather in Nvidia's cap is in the field of semiconductors used for training the latest and greatest AI engines, including the software behind OpenAI's ChatGPT. Now, the company is enjoying an influx of orders for that hardware and its future iterations. Lots of large businesses are planning to match or outshine OpenAI's best AI efforts. That takes a boatload of high-priced AI accelerator cards, and Nvidia is the largest name in the game so far."", ""Nvidia thinks of these AI-training megasystems as AI factories. At another investor conference, Ian Buck from Nvidia's accelerated computing division explained that the leading cloud computing platforms are building massive AI factories right now. They will resell access to some of these systems and reserve other AI factories for their own use."", '""We will see the enterprise become a significant portion in terms of consuming the factories,"" Buck said. ""It\'s early days now, but that is definitely a trend that\'s catching on.""', ""Smaller enterprises may build their own AI factories down the line, but this is how the AI industry is shaping up so far. And yes, Nvidia faces competition from Advanced Micro Devices and Intel, but these challengers can't match Nvidia's established AI market heft yet. Until AMD-powered or Intel-based supercomputers deliver the first market-beating AI factories with their own hardware, Nvidia has an iron grip on that crucial first-mover advantage."", ""So Nvidia's stock price has more than tripled in 2023 and its shares trade at a lofty 26 times sales -- a valuation typically reserved for hungry upstarts and not trillion-dollar giants. However, given its pivotal role in the AI revolution, its first-mover advantage, and the ever-increasing demand for its technology, Nvidia presents a compelling case for those willing to invest in a company that's shaping the future of technology."", ""The price of entry is high, but the potential rewards could be monumental for patient investors who understand the transformative power of AI and Nvidia's central role in it.

It's not Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Sure, Nvidia's shares have more than tripled in 2023. Over the last three months, though, the stock is only up by the low-single digits."", 'Meanwhile, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) has more than doubled this year. And its stock has especially been on fire recently, jumping close to 30% over the last three months.', ""Investors have an interesting choice in picking between these two stocks. Here are two reasons why AMD is a better AI stock to buy than Nvidia -- and two reasons why it isn't."", ""I'd argue that the top reason why AMD could be a better AI stock to buy than Nvidia right now is that customers are looking for an alternative to Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs). This presents a tremendous opportunity for AMD to step up to the plate."", ""We've already seen this happen in recent days. Both Meta Platforms\xa0and Microsoft\xa0plan to use AMD's new Instinct MI300X AI chip. This appears to be a clear sign that tech giants are trying not to rely exclusively on Nvidia."", ""The bottom line is that if AMD offers a viable cost-effective alternative to Nvidia, the company could have greater growth prospects than Nvidia does. And that could enable its stock to continue outperforming Nvidia like it's done over the last three months."", ""With Nvidia, you pretty much get GPUs and nothing but GPUs. At least, that's been the story so far for the company. Reuters reported in October that Nvidia has started designing central processing units (CPUs) using Arm's\xa0technology. We have yet to see the fruit of these reported efforts, though."", ""For now, Nvidia is more dependent on the AI chip market than AMD is. That's not a bad thing when the AI market is booming as it has been this year. However, there's something to be said in favor of the diversification that AMD offers. The company makes more types of chips that are used for a broader range of purposes. Should the AI market experience some bumps in the road, AMD could weather the volatility better than Nvidia."", ""Nvidia's GPUs remain the gold standard for training and powering AI applications. Unsurprisingly, the company dominates the AI chip market. Importantly, Nvidia isn't resting on its laurels. It is still investing heavily in research and development. It continues to roll out more powerful AI chips."", ""AMD probably won't dethrone Nvidia anytime soon. And unless it launches AI chips that are clearly superior to Nvidia's GPUs, any market share gains made by AMD likely won't hamper Nvidia's growth."", ""Oftentimes, the up-and-coming rival is more of a bargain than the 800-pound gorilla in the industry. That isn't the case here. Nvidia is actually more attractively valued than AMD."", ""AMD stock currently trades at a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 36. Nvidia's shares trade at a much lower 23.6 times forward earnings."", ""The picture looks even better when we factor projected growth into the equation. AMD's price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is 1.9 compared to Nvidia's seemingly dirt cheap 0.47."", ""Both AMD and Nvidia should also deliver strong growth as the demand for AI soars. The good news is that investors don't have to pick which company will be the biggest winner. Investors have an easy solution: Buy both stocks."", ""I think that AMD and Nvidia could experience more choppiness over the next few years. It's unrealistic to expect either stock to continue doubling or tripling every 12 months.

That performance can be attributed, in part, to their artificial intelligence (AI)-related efforts. Both companies stand to gain from different aspects of the rapid adoption of this technology.', 'Nvidia is clocking astronomical growth thanks to the booming demand for AI hardware, such as data center graphics cards and server processors. Palantir is expected to win big thanks to the increased adoption of AI software.', ""If you were to choose one of these high-flying AI stocks for your portfolio today, which one should you buy? Let's find out."", ""As already mentioned, AI supercharged Nvidia's growth, as evidenced by the company's recent quarterly results. Its fiscal 2024 third-quarter revenue (for the three months ended Oct. 29, 2023) was up a whopping 206% year over year to a record $18.1 billion. Much of that growth came from its data center business segment where revenue jumped 279% year over year to $14.5 billion, accounting for 80% of the top line."", 'The good news for Nvidia investors is that the company guided for even better growth in the current quarter. Its $20 billion revenue forecast points toward a 230% year-over-year increase. Also, it points toward a huge turnaround when compared to the 21% revenue drop the company witnessed in the same period last year when it was struggling to sell its gaming graphics cards owing to weak personal computer (PC) demand.', ""Demand for the company's data center graphics processing units (GPUs) is so strong that customers are reportedly having to wait for a year to get their hands on Nvidia's AI chips, according to market research firm Omdia. The firm estimates that Nvidia sold almost half a million units of its H100 and A100 data center GPUs in the previous quarter, driven by massive demand from the likes of Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Alphabet's Google, Amazon, Oracle, and others."", ""Nvidia expects to ship more than half a million units of its data center GPUs once again in the current quarter. This means Nvidia's data center GPU shipments in the final six months of the year could exceed a million units. What's more, Nvidia expects to triple its output of H100 GPUs in 2024 and has also announced a new, more powerful chip that it plans to manufacture in addition to the highly popular H100."", 'Not surprisingly, analysts forecast Nvidia will deliver yet another year of terrific growth in fiscal 2025, which will begin in February 2024, with an estimated jump of 57% in its top line to $92 billion. All this indicates that Nvidia stock could continue to head higher in 2024 thanks to its robust AI-fueled growth.', 'While investors consider Nvidia stock to capitalize on the booming demand for AI hardware, Palantir Technologies can help them benefit from the software side of things. Demand for AI software is expected to increase at an annual rate of 31% through 2027 to $251 billion at the end of the forecast period, according to IDC.', 'Artificial intelligence platforms, which allow organizations to develop AI models and applications, are expected to be the second-largest niche within the AI software market. IDC forecasts that the AI platforms market could grow at almost 36% a year. This bodes well for Palantir as the company was ranked the top vendor of AI platforms in 2021 by IDC in terms of market share and revenue.', 'The AI platforms market was worth $14 billion in 2021 and recorded 37% growth that year. Assuming it grows at an annual pace of 36% through 2027 as IDC predicts, it could generate annual revenue of $88 billion after four years. Palantir generated $2.1 billion in revenue in the trailing 12 months, which means that the growing demand for AI platform software has the potential to supercharge its growth.', ""That won't be surprising as Palantir is already witnessing healthy demand for its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP). The company claims that the number of customers using AIP tripled in the previous quarter and added that almost 300 organizations had used the product within five months of launch. And now, Palantir is looking to increase the reach of AIP by organizing boot camps wherein it will teach customers to quickly deploy AI use cases for their businesses."", ""So, Palantir could eventually turn out to be a top AI pick, but the reality is that the company is currently facing a slowdown. Tepid government spending means that Palantir's revenue in 2023 is expected to increase 16% year over year to $2.2 billion, down from the 24% growth it clocked in 2022. Investors, therefore, will have to wait for AI to start moving the needle for Palantir, and this isn't the only reason why it may lose out to Nvidia as the better AI pick."", ""The big surge in these two stocks this year made each quite expensive. Palantir trades at over 19 times sales, while Nvidia is slightly more expensive at 26 times sales. Meanwhile, Palantir's trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 253, which is way higher than Nvidia's trailing earnings multiple of 62."", ""Nvidia is the cheaper stock on a forward earnings basis as well, with a multiple of 55 as compared to Palantir's forward P/E ratio of 69. What's more, both companies are almost equally matched as far as the forward price-to-sales ratio is concerned."", 'All this strongly suggests Nvidia is the less expensive AI stock of the two companies being discussed here and the better pick. The semiconductor giant is already growing at a terrific pace, and its valuation is relatively more attractive. Palantir, on the other hand, has yet to make the most of the huge opportunity in AI software, leaving investors with an easy decision to make about which one of these two companies they should be buying right now.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

If you want to skip our overview of Mr. Gabelli and his hedge fund, then you can skip ahead to 5 Best Mario Gabelli Stocks Other Billionaires Are Also Piling Into. "", ""Mario Gabelli is a billionaire American hedge fund investor who is at the helm of affairs at GAMCO Investors. GAMCO is a multi billion dollar hedge fund headquartered in Rye, New York. According to Insider Monkey's research, the firm's latest investment portfolio is worth $8.6 billion - making it one of the largest financial firms in the world. It was set nearly five decades back in 1976, and it went on to beat the S&P 500 index by more than 2% each year in 1986. The investment firm offers its clients a variety of portfolios and vehicles to park their money in via its Gamco Funds division. These include open and closed end mutual funds, as well as exchange traded funds (ETFs) and money market investments. Additionally, GAMCO also has its own asset management division called GAMCO Asset Management. This division is quite important in the firm's history since Mr. Gabelli's fund was previously called\xa0 Gabelli Asset Management Company and then changed its name to GAMCO in 2005."", ""The GAMCO Asset Management business division identifies itself as a value investor. This approach is practiced by industry behemoths such as Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Seth Klarman of Baupost Group. Fundamentally (no pun intended) value investing determines a stock's fair value based on its ability to earn revenue in the future. This value is then compared to the current market price of a security, typically a stock. If the fair value is higher than the market value, then a buying decision is made based on the percentage difference between the two values called the margin of safety."", 'Additionally, the asset management arm of the hedge fund also focuses on growth stocks. GAMCO claims to invest ""in companies with above average growth in earnings, cash flow or asset values which we believe will provide excellent investment returns over time. These companies typically have strong balance sheets, leading market positions and visible long term growth prospects."" The stated objective of the GAMCO Asset Management growth division is to outperform the Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks by 2%.', ""On the flip side, the value division uses an equity research team of 40 analysts to pick out value stocks. However, GAMCO doesn't invest in any value stock. Instead, a fundamental condition for investment is the presence of a catalyst that will generate value in the future. A catalyst can be anything. For instance, if company A is a rocket company making engines, then its catalyst can be an advanced composite material that can increase chamber pressures in a rocket engine's combustion chamber to improve power output. If you're interested in value stocks, then check out 12 Best Value Stocks To Buy Heading Into 2024 (Picked By Seth Klarman)."", ""GAMCO is also one of the few hedge funds that are publicly traded as stocks. Its ticker name is GAMCO Investors, Inc. (OTC:GAMI) and the firm's latest market capitalization at the time of writing is $476 million. Since it's a publicly traded firm, GAMCO Investors, Inc. (OTC:GAMI) has to post its earnings reports regularly and the latest set of results are for the firm's third quarter. This quarter, which saw the stock market continuously readjust itself to the Fed's future interest rate policies, saw GAMCO post $59.4 million in revenue and $13 million in net income. While the revenue dropped by 3.9% annually, the net income jumped by 39.4% as the year ago quarter had seen the firm take a $2.4 million non operating loss. GAMCO Investors, Inc. (OTC:GAMI)'s Class A and B investors are also entitled to a dividend, with the latest dividend being 4 cents."", ""Since 2023 is ending with lingering worries of a recession and global slowdown, here's what Mr. Gabelli believes is happening in the economy:"", ""But when you step back and say okay, what is the world like for investing. Forget about short termism in the market which is dominant because of a variety of things. Basically the International Monetary Fund says there's a $110 trillion of - trillion - dollars of global GDP. The United States is 25%, China is 17%, Europe is about 17-8, a lower number. So what's going in China. What's gonna be the implications of that on the global market place. What's going on in United States. You break the U.S. down, consumer 70% plus or minus, then you've got industrial, then you've got government spending and blah blah blah."", ""The consumer's net worth, when you get the numbers given this rally in the month of November, given the elevated housing prices, that's going to be at least a $150 trillion dollars. Ten years ago, ten years ago not ten weeks ago, it was $75 trillion. The consumer debt is gone from 14 to 20. Up six, but the asset, the net worth is up 75. You have an income disparity and that's why the screen actors did, what the UAW did, and what the others are doing trying to raise wage parity and help pay the bills of electricity, housing, um, food. That has a major 'regressive impact'. So from our end, this recession, we've gone through so many cycles. So the consumer's okay, autos, UAWs on strike, that's recovering. Car sales will be up this week."", ""So, what stocks are Mario Gabelli and billionaires buying? We took a look and some notable names are Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON), Lands' End, Inc. (NASDAQ:LE), and American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)."", 'Mario Gabelli of GAMCO Investors', 'Our Methodology ', ""To make our list of the best Mario Gabelli stocks that billionaires are buying, we ranked GAMCO's 40 biggest Q3 2023 investment positions by the number of billionaires that had bought the shares.

But now, he's set to stay on until 2026. Here with a snapshot of the year in review for Bob Iger and Disney, we have Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal."", ""ALEXANDRA CANAL: Hi, Brad. That's right. It was a wild 2023 for Disney CEO Bob Iger following his surprise return to the company just a little over a year ago. And since that time, he's had his hands full. The stock is teetering on multi-year record lows, and there are certainly plenty of questions heading into next year. But despite it all, Iger has addressed several key issues that were big question marks at the end of 2022. So let's break them down, shall we?"", ""Number one, who will buy Hulu? That would be Disney. Now this is an outcome that Wall Street largely expected, but it wasn't a guarantee after Iger insinuated earlier this year that general entertainment was not part of the company's strategy. He eventually reversed course, confirming that Disney will buy the remaining 33% Hulu stake from Comcast for at least $8.61 billion. The two companies are currently in negotiations to determine its full value."", ""So safe to say the future of Hulu is set, which brings me to question number two. What is the future of ESPN? Now this was a biggie for analysts last year with some suggesting Disney should consider spinning off the Sports Network. Clearly, that's not happening as Bob Iger doubles down on the importance of sports. In fact, he plans to take ESPN fully over the top as a direct to consumer streaming service sometime over the next few years. So ESPN, not going anywhere just yet."", ""But speaking of streaming, what is Disney's streaming strategy? In the Bob Chapek era, there was a lot of confusion when it comes to what Disney should be in the streaming world. And because of that, there was an overproduction of content, especially for Marvel and Star Wars."", 'Bob Iger though, he wants to change that. He said the company will be focused on quality over quantity. He suggested that certain franchises might not need multiple sequels and that animation needs to get back to its creative roots. So just one example of this Chapek era reversal.', ""Another one though is theme parks. And Bob Iger did reintroduce certain elements of the parks business that Bob Chapek had previously undone, like bringing back more incentives for premium park members, as well as introducing new offerings and complementary services. But he's also raised prices on certain tickets and annual passes as the company commits plans to spend $60 billion on parks over the next 10 years."", ""But while we're talking theme parks, have to talk Florida Governor Ron DeSantis because it seems like Disney essentially won that battle. Bob Iger not mincing words when asked about the political firestorm several times over this past year. He's called DeSantis anti-Florida, anti-business. And then earlier this summer, the Governor urged Disney to, quote, drop the lawsuit, which Disney has not done at this point. So although the fight is still ongoing, it seems as though DeSantis has backed down, at least for now. So all in all, quite the productive year for Iger despite all of these obstacles for Disney. Still, much more the CEO will have to address in 2024. Brad, Seana.""]"

Since reclaiming the helm as CEO, Iger cut costs and restructured the business into three divisions —Entertainment; Parks, Experiences and Products; and ESPN —as he looks to make Disney's streaming business profitable."", ""Needham & Co. Senior Media & Internet Analyst Laura Martin, who covered the stock during Iger's first tenure as CEO, said she would give the media executive a 'C' for his first year back at Disney."", ""“It's hard to see him stumble in the first year… but in fairness to him, mostly what he's been doing is reversing things Bob Chapek did the prior two years,” Martin told Yahoo Finance Live. “It’s unclear he's been able to move forward at all rather than undoing the one bad decision he made in leadership, which was to hand the reins to Bob Chapek.”"", ""Watch the video above to hear Martin discuss Iger's return, Peltz's battle for the board, and what the company could do to change her 'hold' rating on the stock."", 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', '- And Laura, a near-term issues seems to be all of these activist battles. How should Bob Iger approach handling someone like Nelson Peltz, and perhaps others.', ""LAURA MARTIN: So I think what's great for public shareholders about somebody like Nelson Peltz is when Bob Iger comes out and says, we're going to spend $60 billion on the theme park over 10 years, that might be great for him. But public shareholders care about this year and next year because they're going to be retired in 10 years."", ""So I think what Nelson Peltz forces Bob Iger to do is justify the cost structure at the entertainment assets and the TV assets, compared to the revenue growth, which is single digits to negative. And it really forces him to cut costs. I think it's a primary reason they're going to cut a lot of content costs on the streaming side because they can't cut them on the sports side because their rights fees keep going up."", ""So I think what Nelson Peltz does is force Bob Iger to, basically, fire more people, which unless he can grow the revenue faster on the, let's call it the core business, the traditional business, he needs to cut the overhead here."", ""SEANA SMITH: So Laura, it sounds like, if I'm hearing you right, you think that maybe some of the changes that would be enacted by Nelson Peltz would actually better position Disney then for the future, and maybe make you a little bit more positive on the name."", ""LAURA MARTIN: I would say that Nelson Peltz is far more short-term oriented than Bob Iger who's a business builder. And I think public shareholders are more aligned with that kind of time frame."", ""BRAD SMITH: So with that considered, Laura, I mean, we've heard Disney talking about the thousands of acres of land that they could develop on, building out more of the parks, resorts experiences in other parts of the world. That still looks like money going out the door. So at what point do you think Disney is ultimately going to be able to deliver on this, and perhaps satisfy some of the investors?"", ""LAURA MARTIN: So I think this is a tale of two cities right now, meaning that the parks are really healthy. So I think Wall Street is supportive of investing money in the parks because the return on capital of money into the parks is going to be positive. But I do think the traditional, like ESPN linear business and the studios have had underwhelming results, meaning, when the market's giving them capital, they're not actually over delivering the cost of capital."", ""So in order to do that, you have to cut costs. So I just think that the economics of the streaming/linear TV business are broken right now for the whole industry, not just for the Walt Disney Company, for the whole industry. So the industry needs to consolidate. It needs to rip out costs. It needs to spend less on content. And I think getting out of India is going to help Disney. They've announced that reliance. And Disney are in, I guess, a handshake deal right now. I think that's helpful. And I think, when they launch ESPN, the app, that's going to be helpful also.""]"

The unique socio-economical, racial and music-industry conditions of the time helped drive the creation of both Hip Hop and House Music. It was the need to voice one’s pain and aspirations that could not be held back.', 'Born in New York City, Hip Hop was picking up steam in the late 80s, establishing itself as a viable business and capturing the hearts and minds of young people beyond the inner cities. As Hip Hop grew beyond the streets of New York City, it began infiltrating the imaginations of young creatives all over the country. Other regions began interpreting the genre differently, and Hip Hop went from a unique East Coast sound to rich and imaginative renditions from cities like Los Angeles, Miami, Detroit, Baltimore, New Orleans, and Chicago.', 'However, it was the Chicago music scene that would blend the infectious soulful dance beats, to create a new genre: House Music. An amazing synergy was born and dominated the radio waves with a new danceable rap subgenre that contributed to making Hip Hop pop music. It was the dawn of Hip House. When the two movements began to cross-pollinate the energy of rebellion, and empowerment began to take shape, the fusion sparked a tantalizing and vital chapter in music history. This seemingly random merge of Hip Hop and House added gas to a youth movement that would turn into a multi-billion-dollar industry and change the landscape of music and American culture forever.', '""It is said that music is a mirror of an artist’s reality, and his/her reality is written in part by society. Show me a revolution in music, art, and culture and I’ll show you a society screaming to evolve,"" said Keesha Boyd, Executive Producer for In Our DNA: Hip House and VP, Entertainment Emerging Products at Comcast. ""By providing a platform for the documentary that explores this reality, through Black Experience on Xfinity, it is our hope to bring this rich history to new audiences who may not have been aware of this revolution in music.""', 'In Our DNA: Hip House was directed by Whitney Clinkscales.

EG, Comcast Corp. CMCSA, 3M Co. MMM, Molson Coors Beverage Co. TAP and DaVita Inc. DVA.', 'Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:', 'After several twists and turns, the S&P 500 has hit a series of new 2023 highs lately, driven by the optimism that the Fed is done with interest rate hikes. The benchmark has registered the longest streak of weekly gains since November 2019, closing at the highest level since March 2022. The solid trend is likely to continue in 2024, with many analysts turning bullish on the benchmark.', 'The S&P 500 has gained more than 20% so far this year but is shy of 4% from its record high in late 2021. SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, the proxy version of the S&P 500 Index, has risen about 21% this year. Though most of the stocks in the ETF have returned handsomely, many are undervalued, as reflected in their lower P/E ratio than industry peers. The fund has good potential for the next year. The constituent stocks have a strong Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of B or better, suggesting their outperformance in the months to come.', 'These include Everest Group Ltd., Comcast Corp., 3M Co., Molson Coors Beverage Co. and DaVita Inc..', ""According to Bloomberg's latest Markets Live Pulse survey, a median of 518 respondents expects the S&P 500 to climb to 4,808 points next year, outpacing its previous closing peak of 4,797 hit in January 2022."", 'Fundstrat Tom Lee, who has been one of the most persistently bullish forecasters on Wall Street this year, expects that stocks will surge to a new all-time high in 2024 as the Fed shifts to a less restrictive monetary policy. He anticipates that the S&P 500 could soar to 5,200 by the end of 2024, marking a 13% increase from its current level. This optimism is partly based on the expectation that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next year as inflation eases. Rates, which have risen to a range of 5.25%-5.5%, could potentially drop to 3.2%-3.5% (read: What Lies Ahead of S&P 500 ETFs in 2024?).', 'Tom Lee said that narrowing credit spreads and a rally in high-yield bond prices suggest an ongoing liquidity rally. Despite significant withdrawals from stocks this year, cyclical stocks, bank stocks and small-cap stocks have shown an upward trend, indicating that the market is in a state of expansion, supporting the uptrend in equities.', 'Other Wall Street forecasters are also optimistic, with the U.S. avoiding a recession and inflation cooling. Major financial institutions like Bank of America, Deutsche Bank and Société Générale predict that the S&P 500 could hit new highs in 2024.', 'After the astounding surge of the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks, the rally has been broadening out in recent weeks. As more underperforming members of the S&P 500 catch up, the index should continue to climb, even if the rise in the Magnificent Seven stalls out. Per a strategist at Bank of America, only about 24% of the stocks in the S&P 500 are trading within 10% of their all-time highs. This is notably lower than the historical average of 28%. This suggests that many stocks in the index may be undervalued and have the potential to rise toward their peak values.', ""Let's take a closer look at the fundamentals of SPY."", 'SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust holds 503 stocks in its basket, with each accounting for no more than 7.3% of the assets.

The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?"", ""While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making."", 'Revisions to Earnings Estimates', ""Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up.

The new tax reforms directly impact multinational companies across the globe. The Pillar Two tax reform, signed by 138 countries, accounts for 90% of global economic activity. As per the Pillar Two tax reform, the primary goal is to establish a level playing field for companies across countries. This will primarily be done by discouraging companies from lowering their corporate income taxes in a bid to attract foreign investment. Under the supervision of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), companies with €750 million or more in revenue, are obliged to pay a global minimum tax of 15% on earned income in each country they operate in. OECD suggests that the reform will push corporate taxes globally by $220 billion per year, almost 9% of global corporate income tax revenues. Deloitte further highlights that the Pillar Two tax reform does not limit itself to just taxes, instead, it shapes how multinationals operate their supply chain networks, execute acquisitions, and strategic decisions.', 'Moreover, the system and compliance data are not only difficult to adhere to, but they also demand a complex infrastructure, that businesses need to establish. Under the reform, multinationals will be required to provide data for 100 separate data points for each entity in an organization. Not only do companies have to remodel their organizational structure, but they also have to revisit their financial reporting timelines. Therefore, to address the need for a complex infrastructure, companies will not be expected to report 2024 returns until after 18 months, which provides ample time for companies to adapt and restructure.

GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with ORCL.', ""Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL), a global provider of database technology and enterprise resource planning software, reported its quarterly financial results on December 12, 2023, through the SEC 10-Q filing. The company, founded in 1977, has established itself as a leader in SQL-based relational database management systems. With a customer base spanning 175 countries and a workforce of 136,000 employees, Oracle's financial performance remains a critical indicator of its market position and strategic direction. The recent 10-Q filing reveals a year-over-year increase in cloud and license revenues, from $10,033 million to $10,817 million for the three months ended November 30, 2023. Total revenues for the same period rose from $12,275 million to $12,941 million, reflecting Oracle's continued growth trajectory. However, the hardware segment experienced a slight decline in revenues, indicating a shift in the company's revenue mix. The overall margin also improved, suggesting effective cost management and a strong competitive edge. This SWOT analysis delves into the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as presented in Oracle's latest financial disclosures."", ""Market Leadership and Revenue Growth: Oracle Corp's strength lies in its market leadership, particularly in the cloud and license segment. The recent financial data shows a significant year-over-year increase in revenues, from $10,033 million to $10,817 million for the three months ended November 30, 2023. This growth is a testament to Oracle's strong brand, innovative technology, and loyal customer base. The company's ability to generate a higher margin in this segment, as evidenced by the increase from $6,352 million to $6,915 million, highlights its operational efficiency and the value of its offerings in the competitive tech landscape."", ""Strategic Acquisitions and R&D Investments: Oracle's proactive approach to acquisitions, such as the strategic purchase of Cerner Corporation, has bolstered its product portfolio and expanded its reach in the healthcare IT sector. The company's commitment to investing in research and development is crucial for maintaining its competitive position and fostering innovation. Oracle's R&D efforts are not only essential for product enhancement but also for driving the development of new technologies that can open up additional revenue streams."", ""Declining Hardware Revenues: A notable weakness in Oracle's portfolio is the declining hardware revenues, which dropped from $850 million to $756 million over the three-month period. This decline suggests a potential vulnerability in Oracle's hardware business and may reflect a broader industry shift towards cloud-based solutions. The company's hardware segment faces challenges in maintaining profitability and relevance as customer preferences evolve."", ""Dependency on Renewals: Oracle's financial stability is heavily reliant on the renewal of cloud services and license support contracts. While the company expects a high renewal rate, any significant change in customer renewal behavior could adversely affect Oracle's recurring revenue streams. This dependency underscores the need for Oracle to continuously innovate and provide value to ensure customer retention."", ""Cloud Services Expansion: The growing demand for cloud-based solutions presents a significant opportunity for Oracle. The company's cloud services and license support segment have shown resilience and growth potential, with the expectation that revenues will continue to increase. By capitalizing on this trend and expanding its cloud offerings, Oracle can further solidify its position in the market and attract new customers seeking modern IT solutions."", ""International Market Penetration: Oracle's global presence is a strategic advantage that offers opportunities for further expansion. With operations contributing a substantial portion of total revenues, Oracle can leverage its international footprint to tap into emerging markets and diversify its revenue sources. This geographical expansion can help mitigate risks associated with economic fluctuations in any single region."", ""Competitive Pressures: Oracle operates in a highly competitive industry, facing threats from both established players and new entrants. The company must continually innovate and adapt to maintain its market share. Competitive pressures can lead to pricing challenges and increased marketing expenses, which could impact Oracle's profitability and market position."", ""Economic Fluctuations: Global economic uncertainties pose a threat to Oracle's business. Economic downturns can lead to reduced IT spending by customers, affecting Oracle's sales and profitability. Additionally, currency fluctuations can impact the company's international revenues and margins, necessitating effective financial risk management strategies."", ""In conclusion, Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL) exhibits strong market leadership and revenue growth, particularly in its cloud and license segment. Strategic acquisitions and investments in R&D are key strengths that position the company for future innovation. However, weaknesses such as declining hardware revenues and dependency on contract renewals need to be addressed. Opportunities for expansion in cloud services and international markets are promising, while competitive pressures and economic fluctuations remain significant threats. Oracle's forward-looking strategies, including a focus on cloud expansion and customer retention, will be crucial in navigating these challenges and capitalizing on growth opportunities."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

While high-flying growth stocks generate all the hype these days (and deservedly so), defensive dividend stocks remain essential to provide a steady stream of income, as well as stability. That’s particularly true when markets become volatile. And let’s face it, with inflation proving stickier than hoped and various global tensions simmering, we could see increased volatility ahead.', 'But this doesn’t have to derail our portfolios if we hold the right mix of stocks. Even in turbulent times, plenty of stalwart, cash-rich companies with established track records have kept increasing their dividends year after year. I’m talking about the Dividend Aristocrats, and other S-tier stocks that represent some of the most reliable long-term holds out there. These are the types of stocks you can confidently buy and forget about, all while your dividend distributions roll in.', 'I’ll highlight seven generous dividend stocks perfectly suited for building a lifetime of passive income. Additionally, I’ll explore some lesser-known names throwing off juicy yields and a few dividend stalwarts you likely already know. This also includes some undervalued dividend stocks you can snap up for a bargain after their selloffs. Let’s start!', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com', 'At first glance, Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) may appear like a risky option in the world of real estate investment trusts (REITs). However, this self-storage stalwart operates with far less volatility than most commercial or residential real estate funds. Demand for storage has grown steadily amid a booming U.S. economy and population growth. Physical storage needs will only intensify in the coming decades as more blue-collar sectors thrive.', 'Public Storage is perfectly positioned to capitalize as a leading storage provider. Shares have declined 40% from their peak, creating substantial upside from the stock’s current $269 price tag. The company’s generous 4.5% dividend yield also leaves income potential. Payouts should continue rising, given impressive profitability and growth trends. Thus, Public Storage represents a relatively safe, growing business that is undeserving of its selloff. The predictable nature of self-storage stands out against a turbulent real estate backdrop. Steady demand and pricing power should continue driving predictable cash flows. Therefore, the bottom appears to be in for this dividend stalwart.', 'Source: gvictoria / Shutterstock.com', 'Like Public Storage, Innovative Industrial Properties’ (NYSE:IIPR) cannabis-linked real estate focus makes it appear riskier than typical REITs. However, leasing industrial space to pot growers somewhat insulates IIPR from traditional property market swings. Highly volatile cannabis stocks dominate the headlines, but IIPR’s indirect approach looks opportunistic after its 75% plunge.', 'The REIT’s jaw-dropping yield says markets expect tenants to miss rent payments. But the trust’s substantial collection rate and rising payouts signal otherwise. While challenges exist industrywide, top multi-state operators seem to be on solid enough ground to easily cover rent. Preferred access to specialized growing facilities also gives tenants a major incentive to pay IIPR before other expenses.', 'Ultimately, fears around this stock appear to be overblown, given reasonable rent coverage ratios for most tenants. Providing an 8.25% yield effectively compensates investors for the risk they’re taking. Accordingly, from my perspective, this stock’s return profile looks very attractive for long-term, income-focused investors.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'AT&T (NYSE:T) seems poised for a long-awaited breakout after years of declines. While the telecom giant has constantly frustrated shareholders with drama and distractions, improving wireless and fiber trends signal a coming wave of growth and value creation. Trading at less than 7-times earnings, I believe T stock pricing largely reflects the negatives rather than enormous untapped potential.', 'The company’s generous 6.5% dividend yield adds stability for patient investors until catalysts gain traction. AT&T continues expanding its next-generation 5G and fiber networks to meet surging data demand. As those capital-intensive investments moderate, cash generation may explode higher. The company also expects to achieve $2 billion in cost savings within three years.', 'I believe AT&T makes for an ideal recovery and turnaround candidate at current levels.

However, in my view, the stock remains a compelling buy based on its standout capital appreciation potential. Watsco has emerged as one of the strongest performers across the entire market, with WSO stock surging 55% this year. Strength is owed partly to the record summer heat, which drove demand for air conditioning products.', 'Looking ahead, climate change trends point towards sustaining tailwinds regardless of one’s views. Analysts also forecast healthy, accelerating long-term growth for Watsco’s niche AC distribution business. Thus, I believe the company’s modest starting yield could grow into a significant income stream when combined with an ongoing upside in stock prices. Of course, risks exist, but WSO seems poised to continue capitalizing on natural tailwinds from rising temperatures.', 'Watsco’s dividend growth and stock appreciation potential make it well worth holding for the long-run.', 'Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com', 'As one of the pharmaceutical sector’s largest players, AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) provides immense dividend reliability. Unlike more speculative names listed here, this stock prioritizes dividends over capital gains. After all, few industries boast cash flow consistency comparable to biopharma companies with diverse drug portfolios. Even with the U.S. Humira patent expiration in play, AbbVie has only strengthened its cash generation capabilities.', 'With its high 4.3% forward yield and Dividend King status, AbbVie seems poised to deliver years of payout growth ahead. Healthcare tends to endure recessions better than other sectors as well. Therefore, while the upside appears limited, I believe AbbVie remains a low-volatility, high-yield pick suitable for nearly any dividend-focused portfolio. AbbVie looks like an ideal pick for income and stability. The days of sky-high growth may have passed, but strong and growing dividends seem highly sustainable for long-term investors.', 'Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com', 'No energy stock provides immunity from oil and gas volatility, as recent years have repeatedly proven. Nonetheless, Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE:EPD) is slowly recovering to pre-pandemic valuation levels. Enterprise Products has delivered slow but steady share price progress since initial 2020 lows. And with revenue basically doubling from 2020 to 2022, the company’s operating business shows momentum that looks sustainable as well. Despite a projected 2023 revenue pullback, analysts’ models see top-line growth resuming in 2024 and beyond as higher oil prices persist.', 'EPD stock features a 7.5% dividend yield, which also leads its midstream peer group. With 26 consecutive annual payout hikes, the company clearly prioritizes dividend distributions through ups and downs. Ultimately, Enterprise Products’ combination of cash flow consistency, yield magnitude, and conservative operations warrant income investor consideration. In my view, Enterprise Products Partners remains a rock-solid midstream pick as energy markets stabilize.', 'Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com', 'Like many food producers, Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) has battled agricultural commodity volatility in recent years. Following a surge in meat and poultry prices, the company now contends with falling prices and resulting profit pressures. However, with shares having priced in the deceleration of earnings, Tyson seems poised to provide some nice upside as demand recovers.', 'The company’s valuation also looks highly attractive, with Tyson’s forward price-earnings ratio sitting below 12-times. Tyson also pays 4% dividend yield after 12 consecutive annual hikes, providing income as investors wait. So, while macro uncertainty lingers, I believe the stock’s risk/reward profile skews positively for long-term investors right now. Tyson boasts a diversified protein portfolio, economies of scale, and agora-food demand tailwinds that should ultimately drive a rebound over time.', 'On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

324,0dced67c-3370-3fc3-ba0c-59c522bfd26c,PSA,2023-12-13,Bargain Buys: 7 Stocks Lagging the S&P 500 With Big Potential,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bargain-buys-7-stocks-lagging-135621697.html,1701870981,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'JNJ', 'GM', 'NOC', 'NKE']","['With the S&P 500 index stunningly back to its winning ways, it may be time to get on the bandwagon but with bargain stocks with potential. In other words, these enterprises presently lag the benchmark on a year-to-date basis. However, they could offer better bang for the buck over the intermediate to long term.', 'First, while the broader equities space has responded positively to strong holiday sales, it’s not entirely clear that the underlying consumer base can keep up the spending. For example, inflation remains stubbornly high while borrowing costs are elevated against prior norms. Therefore, it may be sensible to consider bargain stocks over already-hyped entities.', 'Second, major companies that are lagging the benchmark index offer a sensible starting point for stocks with potential for upside. Unlike other businesses, the securities mentioned below are part of the S&P 500. Therefore, red ink may have a better chance of turning black rather than a darker shade of crimson.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'On that note, check out these compelling bargain stocks with potential.', 'Source: mimohe / Shutterstock.com', 'According to Wall Street analysts, athletic apparel and equipment manufacturer Nike (NYSE:NKE) carries a moderate buy view. This assessment breaks down as 18 buys, 12 holds and zero sells. Overall, the average price target lands at $118.08, which is admittedly modest. However, the high-side target hits $150, which may give cautious speculators hope for a robust upside.', 'Looking at the financials, the $150 target isn’t something pulled out of a dark cavernous place. Despite the risks associated with the consumer discretionary sector, Nike has proven resilient. Yes, its total revenue slipped for its fiscal year ended May 2020 against the prior year. However, since then, it has consistently increased the top line.', 'Just as importantly, the company’s gross profit margin remains stable. In the quarter ended August 2023, this metric hit 44.21%, basically in line with the prior year’s result. Also, the long-term average stands around 44% to 45%. That implies Nike benefits from pricing power, making NKE one of the bargain stocks with potential.', 'Source: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.com', 'An aeronautics and defense company, Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) has been disappointing relative to the benchmark index. Since the start of the year, NOC is firmly in negative territory. However, analysts remain cautiously optimistic, pegging it a moderate buy. This assessment breaks down as seven buys, four holds and one sell. Overall, the average price target comes out to $500.17.', 'To be sure, that’s not a whole lot. However, the most optimistic analyst – Bank of America Securities’ Ronald Epstein – sees NOC hitting $615. If so, acquiring shares now would make it one of the compelling bargain stocks with potential. Fundamentally, the catalyst centers on the geopolitical tensions that have erupted in Eastern Europe and more recently, the Middle East.', 'Part of the bullish tale involves the losing of naïve arguments. With the world spiraling out of control, the U.S. simply needs to restore order. That’s a plus for Northrop Grumman. Also, company sales have witnessed a conspicuous spike in 2022 and in the trailing-12-month (TTM) period, aligning with the aforementioned flashpoints.', 'Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com', 'One of the biggest names in, well, public storage facilities, the aptly named Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) offers arguably permanent relevance. After all, irrespective of outside conditions, everyone finds themselves in need of extra storage. However, while the S&P 500 is enjoying solid double-digit returns, PSA sits in negative territory. Still, that could change according to the Street’s experts.', 'Right now, analysts rate PSA a consensus strong buy. This assessment breaks down as seven buys, two holds, and no sells. Overall, the average price target lands at $292.44. That’s an okay return over the next 12 months. However, the max price target comes in at $330, which symbolizes a very solid performance. Fundamentally, it’s not out of the question.', 'First, as I stated earlier, we all need storage at some point in our lives. Second and more importantly, the blistering costs of living (here and abroad) have forced many folks to downsize. Therefore, putting away bulky stuff that doesn’t see regular use could result in greater demand for PSA. I see it as one of the bargain stocks with potential.', 'Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com', 'A pharmaceutical and medical technologies giant, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) usually offers a reliable platform for positive returns. I anticipate a return to normal programming given the recent uptick in momentum for JNJ. But in the meantime, yeah, it noticeably lags the S&P 500. For some, that’s bad news. For others, it’s one of the underappreciated bargain stocks with potential.', 'Let’s check in with the analysts first. Currently, they peg JNJ as a consensus moderate buy with a $177.45 average price target. That’s a decent potential return because you’re also getting a dividend yield of 2.97% with a reasonable payout ratio of 44.8%. Further, the high-side target clocks in at $215, which comes from Cantor Fitzgerald’s Louise Chen.', 'Fundamentally, J&J symbolizes an insulated investment idea in that pharmaceuticals and medical tech don’t necessarily correlate with broader market and economic performances. Basically, when you need such innovations, you try to get them irrespective of the costs. Also, JNJ offers great value, trading at trailing-year earnings multiple of 11.76x, below the sector median of 23.42x.', 'Source: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock', 'Controversial for its tobacco business, Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) nevertheless deserves consideration for bargain stocks with potential. First, it meets the qualifications. It’s one of the S&P 500 companies yet it underperforms the benchmark index with a negative return this year. However, analysts remain hopeful about PM, rating it a consensus moderate buy with a $107.59 price target.', 'As I mentioned with J&J above, that’s a decent upside prospect because you’ve got to take into account the dividend. At 5.43%, that’s a strong rate of passive income, though you must watch the high payout ratio of 84.54%. Adding to the bullish sentiment, the maximum price target comes in at $120. That’s courtesy of TD Cowen’s Vivien Azer.', 'Fundamentally, I believe it’s a reasonable forecast. Yes, global smoking prevalence has declined over the past several years. However, in many countries, the prevalence either did not change or it actually increased. More importantly, Philip Morris develops heat-not-burn products and other alternative devices that appeal to tobacco aficionados.', 'And it’s a consistently profitable enterprise, warranting a second look despite the controversy.', 'Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com', 'Another somewhat controversial idea for bargain stocks with potential, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) doesn’t exactly put a smile on everyone’s faces due to the underlying big oil business. Plus, forward-looking relevance concerns exist as people shift their mobility to the electric platform. So, it’s definitely an underperformer to the S&P 500.', 'Still, Exxon Mobil deserves another look in my opinion. For starters, analysts peg XOM as a consensus strong buy with an average price target of $131. That’s a solid return during any market cycle. Additionally, the company features a dividend yield of 3.57% along with a low (sustainable) payout ratio of 35.24%.', 'Fundamentally, hydrocarbons are likely here to stay for the long haul. Fundamentally, very few energy sources command the energy density of fossil fuels. Additionally, population expansion and possibly worsening geopolitical tensions should shift emphasis toward energy diversification rather than complete transitions. Aside from an understandable blip in 2020, Exxon has been consistently profitable over the past several years.', 'Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com', 'Perhaps the riskiest idea on this list of bargain stocks with potential, automaker General Motors (NYSE:GM) should not be entered into lightly. Following a relatively brief but painful labor union dispute, General Motors has the unenviable task of restoring investor confidence. However, in recent sessions, GM stock has demonstrated significant signs of life.', 'Certainly, analysts remain optimistic about the auto giant, pegging shares a consensus moderate buy. Overall, their average price target stands at $45.33. Further, the high-side target is much more aggressive at $90. That’s a recent late-November call by Citi’s Itay Michaeli. Fundamentally, the company’s concerted effort to pivot to electric vehicles should pay off handsomely. After all, GM benefits from several iconic brands that it can pivot toward electric mobility.', 'However, it’s not giving up entirely on its racing heritage, as evidenced by the company’s eighth-generation Corvette. This car pumps out a mid-engine confirmation V8, which is unheard of at the price point GM is offering it. That should bring some excitement to the table. Finally, GM trades for a lowly forward earnings multiple of 4.81x. If you want to speculate on the blue chips, GM could be it.', 'On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

And we're part of a bustling food scene unlike any other. That culinary hotspot includes heavy influence from Latin American cultures - which continue inspiring our own menu - and are often shared with the community via thousands of street vendors. From tamales and elote to tacos and pupusas, street vendors are a SoCal staple for locals and tourists alike. They embody Taco Bell's entrepreneurial mindset, enthusiastically cooking up both authentic and fusion cuisine."", ""Although these passionate small business owners are essential to the community, they often face challenges like permitting issues, equipment access, financial barriers and even street harassment. Since Taco Bell's start, we've believed that there should be no limitations when it comes to making, selling, eating or celebrating tacos - or any food for that matter. Earlier this year, we boldly set out to give Taco Tuesday back to the people, so that everyone can freely celebrate Taco Tuesday. As we continue to support taco culture and those that inspire and embolden it, we're acting to help break down barriers when it comes to serving tacos and other Hispanic and Latin cuisines on Taco Tuesdays starting next month until the end of the year.

Motley Fool Money starts now. I'm Dylan Lewis and I'm joined over the airways by Motley Fool Senior Analyst Bill Mann. Bill, thanks for joining me."", ""Bill Mann: Hey Dylan. Thanks for the invite. Hope you're doing great."", ""Dylan Lewis: I am and I have to be honest, Bill, I feel like today's show feels a bit like an instant classic. We have two stories and an interview. All of it is about food, probably one of our favorite things to talk about. So I am incredibly excited. I hope you're bringing the excitement too."", 'Bill Mann: The gluttony market is ready to be entertained.', ""Dylan Lewis: Why don't we start with McDonald's on the gluttony market [laughs]. They have their investor day this week and they just revealed some huge growth targets as part of their investor day presentations. Bill targeting 50,000 restaurant locations by 2027, which would be the fastest period of growth in the company's history, they currently have like 42,000 locations. My first question is, does Earth have enough room for 50,000 McDonald's locations?"", ""Bill Mann: I just want to put this in context a little bit. In the United States, there are about 13,400 McDonald's. Obviously, not all of that growth is going to happen in the US, in fact, I would suspect that very little of it will be here. So when they're talking about an additional 8,000 McDonald's, think about all of the McDonald's all around the United States and they are building 60% of those in the next couple of years targeted by 2027. They're going to do so worldwide. It's been a tough year for some of the McDonald's markets, obviously they are now out of Russia, for example, which was a big market for them. They've deemphasized China to some degree. But I suspect the later in particular you're going to see a renewed emphasis. I don't know if this has been mentioned to you before, Dylan, but there are more than a billion people in China."", ""Dylan Lewis: There are quite a few. I would imagine that there are probably some McDonald's locations that could go there to serve some of those people."", ""Dylan Lewis: Yeah. They've got several hundred McDonald's throughout China now. But there is actually plenty of room for McDonald's to grow. One of the more interesting things about this investor day was the fact that they dropped this little nugget in. Seventeen of the McDonald's menu items are billion dollar brands in their own rights."", ""Dylan Lewis: It's incredible. I like that you drop nugget there I don't know if that was on purpose, but the nuggets are part of the one of those 17 brands. It's an interesting way to restate just how powerful the collective brand value of McDonald's is."", ""Bill Mann: I'm a little bit angry that hot mustard sauce isn't a billion dollar brand. Because I feel like that is the sole reason that I go into McDonald's just to get anything with the hot mustard sauce. But going across the board, they're talking about basically breaking down and building back up not only how people interact with McDonald's through mobile ordering, through delivery even, but also in how these items are made."", ""Bill Mann: Yeah, they have a couple of different initiatives that tie into some of this stuff. One of them is a Best Burger initiative. This is, I think in some ways kind of a Domino's style initiative where McDonald's is revisiting one of its most iconic brands, it's Burger Line, and saying, I think we need to improve this a little bit. From what I've read from The Wall Street Journal, New Brio spun, coming to this thing, they're going to be changing how they handle ingredients, also how patties are prepared. I look at this Bill and I say, with the way that the food market has moved and just what it costs to buy something at a McDonald's or Burger King, these are no longer budget options, and it makes sense to me that they need to revisit their offering because they are no longer competing and clearly cheaper than the other burgers out there. They're reaching parity with some of those more fast casual style burgers."", ""Bill Mann: We've reached burger parity now. It has been the case for a long time that McDonald's was not considered a discount or a low cost place in a bunch of the markets they are in. This again is where a lot of their growth is coming from. Now the Domino's thing that you're talking about is legendary marketing where they came out and they said, hey, guess what? Our pizza isn't very good, and you know what? We're going to make it better. This is not what McDonald's is doing. I think that they are perfectly happy, satisfied with the quality of their products. But as you mentioned, as they get into higher price points, which is somewhat inevitable, they do recognize the fact that they do need to compete on quality in certain areas while keeping the McDonald's experience as similar and as familiar as it has been in the past."", ""Dylan Lewis: One other spot for growth that I do want to check in on with this investor day and some of the things that they've talked about is we see location growth as a major headline here. But you zoom in and the digital element and the loyalty element of their business is increasingly coming into focus. One of the other big headlines was them really wanting to expand the use of their loyalty programs and the impact and the spend that they see with their loyalty programs, Bill that to me it seems exactly like where the food industry is going and we're just going to see more and more of this from the chains."", ""Bill Mann: I think there's no accident at all that the only external quote that they put in their big press release came from Sundar Pichai, who's the CEO of [Alphabet's] Google. AI is going to be a very big thing for McDonald's as it is for Domino's now. You can giggle a little bit at the thought of a burger in the metaverse or your artificially intelligent, this is how the micro chip is going to get delivered into your system. They also want to expand their loyalty program by as many as 250 million active users. In the way that they're doing it, being much smarter in how they reward and attract the people they consider to be their best and most valuable customers."", ""Dylan Lewis: That's proven to be an incredibly valuable relationship for people to have. I think one of the things I'm interested to see as we see this grow is the system connection they have, where we see more kiosks in locations, how does that sync up with the app and how people know, and really what businesses are generally able to do in terms of pushing members to new products or higher margin products, as the relationship becomes more digital and they have a little bit more control over what people are paying attention to on the menu."", ""Bill Mann: Yeah, I'm just excited to walk into a McDonald's someday and have hot mustard sauce just handed to me the moment I come in regardless of whatever else I order."", ""Dylan Lewis: You know, Bill, if you keep mentioning it on the podcast, it's basically free advertising. It may become the billion dollar brand that you want it to be. It's going to take a while, but I think if you're consistently plugging it on the show, you might help it get its way there."", ""Bill Mann: Honestly speaking, my smartphone is right here next to me and I'm sure it's going, oh yeah, hot mustard sauce. You've mentioned that quite a lot. I guess this is what we're going to be delivering your direction. So yes, our AI overlords are moving into the McDonald's space as well."", ""Dylan Lewis: We have McDonald's projecting some incredible growth, a slightly different story. When we take a look over at the whiskey market. Jack Daniels's owner, Brown Foreman, disclosed that whiskey sales were down 2% for the first half of its fiscal year, which sent shares down 10% today, Bill, we're also seeing shares of Diagio down. It seems like generally there's a little bit of softness in the spirit markets."", ""Bill Mann: Yeah, so both of those companies, and those are two of the largest publicly traded spirits makers in the world. Brown Foreman is the baker of among other things, Jack Daniels is probably its most important brand. Especially in the higher end of the whiskey market, we've seen a fair amount of what people have considered to be a bubble mentality in the really high end among the collectors. The prices for whiskies have gone through the roof. It is interesting to me the fact that it is down about 1% year over year, and the stock is down about 20, which should tell you 20% over the year. It's down nine-ish percent today at Brown Foreman. It should tell you a little bit the amount of enthusiasm that was being built into the market specifically as it comes to the whiskey market, but it really goes across the board for spirits."", ""Dylan Lewis: Yeah, I think all told Brown Foreman revised its guidance down from 5%-7% year over year, organic sales to like 3-5% so it's still projecting growth for the year but expecting some softness. This was for me, Bill an interesting opportunity to take a step back and look at the alcohol market in the United States. You look at where spirits were in 20 years ago, early 2000, about 28% market share. It has now reached parity with beer. They both own about 40 plus percent of the overall alcohol market and Brown Foreman has been a huge beneficiary of that. Diagio has also been a huge beneficiary of that. Do you feel like we're just having to reach a point where we're moderating our growth expectations a little bit?"", ""Bill Mann: When you put it that way, it's wild to think about because it's not like you would look at the US beer market and say that they've been resting on their laurels. There has been a huge growth in craft brewing. Maybe even just the top-line major brewers have, they're getting attacked on all end. Included in the spirits market is an area of the market called ''Ready To Drink'' and you go to grocery shelves now and you see the Moscow Mules and things that are already in cans. This was really never done before. It was a big market for them and I think it came on the tail end of the Hard Seltzer movement. If alcoholic water isn't enough for you, have we got an opportunity for you? Yes. They are looking for ways for spirits to be put out in a lower alcohol format and consumers have responded in a big, big way."", ""Dylan Lewis: It is interesting you bring that up because it's a category, to me, that has seen innovation in an incredible way over the last 5-10 years. It has probably never been better to be a drinker in the United States, especially if you're not someone who traditionally has liked beer or liked wine. You go to a supermarket now and you have a lot of those ready-to-drink type options that you would have had to have made at home five or 10 years ago. It seems like we are almost waiting for that next catalyst or waiting for that next trend in the space."", ""Bill Mann: Yeah, maybe I love how you put it that this is like a golden age for drinkers. [laughs] If you love drinking, it's never been better. Yeah. As far as I'm concerned, I prefer my alcohol to be weapons-grade so none of this is particularly of great interest to me. But you take Jack Daniels as a platform and Jack Daniels as a brand is worth billions of dollars, so the fact that Brown Foreman has moved it into different formats, lower alcohol, fruitier drinks, carbonated drinks, I don't think that we've seen the end of it. I think we are just at the beginning of those levels of innovation. Again, as far as I'm concerned though, I'm an old fuddy-duddy, give me whiskey in a glass with an ice cube maybe."", 'Dylan Lewis: Bill Mann is a man of weapons-grade spirits and hot condiments. Bill, I appreciate you being on the show today.', 'Bill Mann: Thanks, Dylan.', ""Dylan Lewis: Listeners we're not quite done talking burgers and fries. Up next, Deidre Woollard talks with Pinky Cole, founder of Slutty Vegan, to discuss what it takes to build a marketing company masquerading as a restaurant chain."", ""Deidre Woollard: I want to talk a little bit to start off with about your brand in general because a lot of people think they have the idea for the next food trend and we've seen so many food trends come and go, highly competitive space. How did it start for you and how did you find the angle that worked for you?"", ""Pinky Cole: I was a television producer and a casting director at the time where I came up with Slutty Vegan and mind you, I had a restaurant before that cooled on fire and I lost everything. This was my redemption period. I'm thinking that, OK, I got my dream job working on TV. I'm doing well. I don't need to do anything else, but the universe has something else aligned for me and that was this crazy concept called Slutty Vegan that I came up with in my two-bedroom apartment. Not knowing that this concept would turn into a multi-million dollar brand, I was really just trying to, one, have a side hustle and two, show my friends that you could eat vegan and it could be cool. The next thing I know, I have this concept that is now becoming a household name that everybody wants to be a part of. It's been five years since I created the brand and I have done so much. We opened up 13 and counting locations, we want to bed in the airport. We've had tons of brand partnerships and the brand continues to grow. When I look back five years over my life and I'm like, I cannot believe that all of this has happened over burgers, pies, and fries. I'm excited about the growth in my business and it just really just opened up so many verticals for the other things that I'm doing."", ""Deidre Woollard: You've got this bold brand and then you're putting your brand in Target so how did that happen and how has the response been so far?"", ""Pinky Cole: Target is a very interesting story. I was at a festival called Afro Punk and it was an Executive Target. And somebody was like, that's an executive target, you need to go talk to them. Me being who I'm, one thing about me is I'm always going to shoot my shot. I walked up to him and I introduced myself to him. I'm like, do you know who I am? I own Slutty Vegan. I want to talk to you and he was looking at me like, this girl is crazy. That conversation was just one so very organic and fluid and authentic. There was so much essence that was born out of that conversation. As a result of that, he was just like, I like you, I like your spirit. Beyond the business and all the things that you do, you have a really good spirit, and it just meshes with who I am and what I represent. I want to help you. From that conversation, we've been able to put our bacon in stores, our seasoning in stores, our slutty vegan dips in stores, and that was about almost two years ago and the relationship has been so beautiful. One, because Target obviously is for the community, and they've shown that time and time again, which I can appreciate. Two, to go from being a mom-and-pop shop turn corporation to be able to have products in stores and my friends and family can walk past and say, damn, that's pinky stuff in stores is the best feeling in the world because I never in my life imagined to have products on shelves of stores that I shopped at as a little girl. Now to be one of those people who has products in stores, it's a dream come true. I'm just happy, and I'm thankful for Target, and it only gets better from here."", ""Deidre Woollard: I'm curious about the bacon. We were talking before the show, and I've had the dips, but the bacon isn't available yet where I live. But I wanted to get your take too on the foam meat trend in general because I know you've used Beyond Meat and Impossible in some of your products. Beyond Meat publicly traded company has been one of those things where people are asking if the market is big enough for what they were planning. What do you think about the foam meat market in general?"", ""Pinky Cole: I'm going to be totally honest because that's the only way that I could be. I believe that the market is very saturated right now. Once upon a time, when people wanted vegan food, you couldn't just go to every single restaurant and get a vegan option. Then I believe that I contributed to the craze. The trinities alongside Beyond Meat and Impossible Meat of making it super popular that all big businesses wanted to tap into the market. Everybody wants to be a part of a hot market. What happens when everybody gets a part of a hot market? It becomes saturated. When it's saturated, you don't have to look far and wide to go get it. You don't have to pay $17 for a vegan burger anymore. You can pay $3 and go to the grocery store and get that. What I think is happening now is because the market is so saturated, a lot of businesses are unable to sustain themselves who strictly focus on vegan food. The competitive advantage that I have is I've already built a true solid concept that's proven and people love it. If I don't sell another burger right now, Lady Vegan is still a brand. I could still sell other products, but a lot of other businesses can't say that. Is it difficult? Very well, it's very difficult. I still use Impossible and I still use Beyond, and I really respect and love them and love their partnership. But I also think that collectively as a market, we have to figure out how to continue to get innovative so that this wave doesn't die, so it can continue to sustain itself so that we can all be successful. But I think we'll get through it."", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, some of the push back, too, has been that some of the vegan options aren't healthy. There's the two camps of vegan is the healthiest option and while vegan, there's a whole spectrum within vegan. Where do you sit in that?"", ""Pinky Cole: I think there's a lot of propaganda around veganism in the meat industry. Obviously, veganism has taken over per say when it comes to people eating meat and not eating meat. Now there's a level of competition, so obviously there's going to be some propaganda associated with it. I believe that everything is in moderation. My concept is to meet people where they are. Am I saying that you got to eat a salad every day? Absolutely not. But what I'm saying is you come in slutty vegan, and you can get a familiar option, something that you're already used to, and then it might change your mindset on eating vegan when you go to another restaurant. That's really my take on it. I believe, like I said, everything has to be in moderation. Whether you are eating chicken, beef, pork, or vegan burger, everything is in moderation. There are healthier options that is in the vegan community obviously. A lot of people push burgers and fries. But if you look a little bit deeper, you'll realize that there are a lot of healthy vegan options, and you just got to be mindful of what you eat."", ""Deidre Woollard: You've also taken your brand, and you've ventured into all these diverse collaborations with Steve Madden for a Pea-certified sneaker. You've got bad collection lip bar with a vegan lipstick. What have you learned from these successful collaborations, and what are you looking for in your next collaboration?"", ""Pinky Cole: What I learned in collaboration is that is the surest way to grow your business by way of brand partnerships. You want to get exposure, you attach yourself to a brand that's bigger than yours. For anybody that's watching and listening to this, that is part of the surest way to get a different level of exposure if you're trying to get a new audience. If you want more people to hear about your brand, you got to connect with the right people. It's just like relationships, personal relationships, professional relationships. You got to align yourself with the people who are already doing it, who are already successful so that you can continue to grow your brand and grow your business. That's probably one of the biggest things that I've learned. We got a lot of really dope brand partnerships that are coming up in 2024. I'm really excited about them because a lot of the people that I like to partner with wouldn't typically brand themselves with a vegan restaurant. But I like to say that slightly vegan is more than just a restaurant. We are a marketing company that happens to sell burgers, fries, and pies. This is a lifestyle movement. When you think about Pepsi, when you think about Coca-Cola, this is a movement that's not just going to stop with food. It is a movement that makes people feel good, it makes people feel like they can conquer the world. That is how I leave with it when we do brand partnerships. I feel good about what we have going on, coming up in Q1 and Q2, even in Q3 with the brand partnerships that we've already been planning with."", ""Deidre Woollard: As a person who's investing in your future, investing in your family's future, how has the way that you've invested, both in your business and in your personal life changed?"", ""Pinky Cole: That you're a great interviewer, by the way. Nobody ever asked me these kind of questions. My personal life, I'll start there. I put my kids in Montessori School. That might not seem like a big fit. But I did that because I wanted to make sure that I'm fully preparing my children for the world in a way that I didn't get that level of preparation. I'm utilizing my resources to give them the push that they need so that they could be the very best. My daughter is about to have vocal lessons, she's two years old. I get to do all the things that I didn't get to have done by way of lack of resources when I was growing up. I make sure that my environment is happy and healthy. I'm fortunate enough to live in a country club. I'm fortunate enough to have trust funds and plans for my children so that when they turn 18, whether they decide to go to college or not, they are set up for the future. Personally, it's important to make sure that my kids have what they need."", ""Because at the end of the day, they are now my number one priority. Making sure that my kids are good. Professionally, same thing. Like real estate. Making sure that the business that I create yields a return that I can reinvest in the business and I also can reinvest in the community. That's really important to me, and I believe that every entrepreneur should have a philanthropic arm in that business. Because it's not always about just reinvesting money in the business and that's it. You got to reinvest into the people that are investing into you, and that's how you continue to grow successful and sustainable businesses. It feels good to be able to do that on both sides, and it only continues to get better as I evolve. I've been a legitimate entrepreneur for the last five years, and it is hard, absolutely, but is it worth it? Totally. I wouldn't change a thing and the more that I can be around and surround myself with the people who are already successful, I know that my thought process will evolve and even get better more than it is right now."", ""Dylan Lewis: As always, people on the program may own stocks mentioned and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against.

Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $1.52 total annually to $2.80. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 6.3% over that duration. Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period, and without any major cuts in the payment over time, we think this is an attractive combination as it provides a nice boost to shareholder returns.', ""The company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Unfortunately things aren't as good as they seem. Seagate Technology Holdings' EPS has fallen by approximately 21% per year during the past five years.

However, the next year is actually looking up, with earnings set to rise.

"", ""Mario Gabelli is a billionaire American hedge fund investor who is at the helm of affairs at GAMCO Investors. GAMCO is a multi billion dollar hedge fund headquartered in Rye, New York. According to Insider Monkey's research, the firm's latest investment portfolio is worth $8.6 billion - making it one of the largest financial firms in the world. It was set nearly five decades back in 1976, and it went on to beat the S&P 500 index by more than 2% each year in 1986. The investment firm offers its clients a variety of portfolios and vehicles to park their money in via its Gamco Funds division. These include open and closed end mutual funds, as well as exchange traded funds (ETFs) and money market investments. Additionally, GAMCO also has its own asset management division called GAMCO Asset Management. This division is quite important in the firm's history since Mr. Gabelli's fund was previously called\xa0 Gabelli Asset Management Company and then changed its name to GAMCO in 2005."", ""The GAMCO Asset Management business division identifies itself as a value investor. This approach is practiced by industry behemoths such as Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Seth Klarman of Baupost Group. Fundamentally (no pun intended) value investing determines a stock's fair value based on its ability to earn revenue in the future. This value is then compared to the current market price of a security, typically a stock. If the fair value is higher than the market value, then a buying decision is made based on the percentage difference between the two values called the margin of safety."", 'Additionally, the asset management arm of the hedge fund also focuses on growth stocks. GAMCO claims to invest ""in companies with above average growth in earnings, cash flow or asset values which we believe will provide excellent investment returns over time. These companies typically have strong balance sheets, leading market positions and visible long term growth prospects."" The stated objective of the GAMCO Asset Management growth division is to outperform the Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks by 2%.', ""On the flip side, the value division uses an equity research team of 40 analysts to pick out value stocks. However, GAMCO doesn't invest in any value stock. Instead, a fundamental condition for investment is the presence of a catalyst that will generate value in the future. A catalyst can be anything. For instance, if company A is a rocket company making engines, then its catalyst can be an advanced composite material that can increase chamber pressures in a rocket engine's combustion chamber to improve power output.

Its ticker name is GAMCO Investors, Inc. (OTC:GAMI) and the firm's latest market capitalization at the time of writing is $476 million. Since it's a publicly traded firm, GAMCO Investors, Inc. (OTC:GAMI) has to post its earnings reports regularly and the latest set of results are for the firm's third quarter. This quarter, which saw the stock market continuously readjust itself to the Fed's future interest rate policies, saw GAMCO post $59.4 million in revenue and $13 million in net income. While the revenue dropped by 3.9% annually, the net income jumped by 39.4% as the year ago quarter had seen the firm take a $2.4 million non operating loss. GAMCO Investors, Inc. (OTC:GAMI)'s Class A and B investors are also entitled to a dividend, with the latest dividend being 4 cents."", ""Since 2023 is ending with lingering worries of a recession and global slowdown, here's what Mr. Gabelli believes is happening in the economy:"", ""But when you step back and say okay, what is the world like for investing. Forget about short termism in the market which is dominant because of a variety of things. Basically the International Monetary Fund says there's a $110 trillion of - trillion - dollars of global GDP. The United States is 25%, China is 17%, Europe is about 17-8, a lower number. So what's going in China. What's gonna be the implications of that on the global market place. What's going on in United States. You break the U.S. down, consumer 70% plus or minus, then you've got industrial, then you've got government spending and blah blah blah."", ""The consumer's net worth, when you get the numbers given this rally in the month of November, given the elevated housing prices, that's going to be at least a $150 trillion dollars. Ten years ago, ten years ago not ten weeks ago, it was $75 trillion. The consumer debt is gone from 14 to 20. Up six, but the asset, the net worth is up 75. You have an income disparity and that's why the screen actors did, what the UAW did, and what the others are doing trying to raise wage parity and help pay the bills of electricity, housing, um, food. That has a major 'regressive impact'. So from our end, this recession, we've gone through so many cycles. So the consumer's okay, autos, UAWs on strike, that's recovering.

Citi is one of three large American banks to be designated in “bucket 3 or 4” of the “global systemically important bank” (“G-SIB”) framework by The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The other banks in this group are J.P. Morgan and Bank of America.', 'As a G-SIB, Citi is subjected to increased regulatory supervision by global bank regulators and central banks. Enhanced regulatory supervision was an important post-crisis reform to strengthen the global financial system by increasing bank capital ratios, transparency, and decreasing risk-taking. These reforms resulted in the largest G-SIBs moving away from risk-oriented banking activities such as advisory, high-yield lending, and trading, towards lower-risk activities. Indeed, Citi’s most valuable, high-growth segment, Treasury and Trade Solutions, is in lower-risk and entrenched activities such as liquidity and cash management, payments, trade solutions, and automated receivables processing. In our view, somewhat unintuitively, Citi’s increased regulatory supervision contributes to the company’s less risky banking business model, and thus its attractiveness as a downside-oriented investment opportunity.', 'Citi’s market perception suffers from the bank’s negative historical reputation. In 2008 during the Great Financial Crisis, Citi received the most TARP funding (the largest “bailout”) of the U.S. banks. TARP funding was provided by the U.S. government to forestall a liquidity problem that threatened to become a solvency problem. More recently, Citi mistakenly used its own capital to pay lenders when acting as Revlon’s loan agent, resulting in a $400M fine by the Federal Reserve and orders to resolve internal controls (which Citi fulfilled). Citi’s large global consumer bank was assembled by prior management in the early 2000s to attract and service high-end global consumers. Unfortunately, this pivot was costly and ill-timed in the context of increasingly complex multi-jurisdictional regulation to prevent money laundering and tax evasion.

Decline in the global economic environment may reduce demand for the company’s products, resulting in lower sales, lower product prices and reduced reimbursement rates by third-party payers while increasing the cost of operating the business.', 'Furthermore, with the sustained inflationary pressures in the future, the company may struggle to keep in check its operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues.

In his 58 years at the helm, he's overseen a greater than 4,300,000% aggregate gain in Berkshire's Class A shares (BRK.A), as well as doubled up the annualized total return, including dividends, of the widely followed S&P 500."", 'Lengthy books have been written on the core philosophies the Oracle of Omaha lives by, which includes thinking long-term and buying into great businesses with sustained catalysts at a fair price.', ""But what doesn't receive nearly enough credit for Buffett's nearly six decades of investment success is his penchant for buying dividend stocks. Companies that pay a regular dividend to their shareholders are usually profitable and time-tested. What's more, income stocks have a history of running circles around public companies that don't offer a payout in the return department."", ""A majority of the stocks currently held by Berkshire Hathaway pay a dividend, with Buffett's company set to collect close to $6 billion in income over the coming 12 months."", ""But what's truly surprising is how much of this income will derive from a small number of holdings. Warren Buffett and his team are set to rake in nearly $3.5 billion in annual dividend income from just four stocks over the next year."", ""Berkshire Hathaway's No. 2 holding by market value, Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), will be doing the heaviest lifting of all when it comes to providing dividend income. The more than 1.03 billion shares Buffett's company owns of BofA will translate into almost $992 million in dividend income over the next 12 months."", 'The lure of bank stocks for Buffett has always been their cyclical ties and the recurring need for financial services. Though banks are cyclical, and will therefore contend with higher delinquency rates and loan losses during recessions, periods of economic expansion last considerably longer than downturns. Rather than foolishly trying to time when these downturns will occur, Buffett has wisely positioned Berkshire Hathaway in high-quality financial stocks, like BofA, to take advantage of long-winded expansions.', ""But there's more to Berkshire's No. 2 holding than just macroeconomic factors. Bank of America is also the most interest rate-sensitive of America's largest banks by assets. When interest rates change, no bank is more impacted than BofA."", ""Since March 2022, the nation's central bank has increased the federal funds rate by 525 basis points, which is the fastest pace of rate hikes in more than four decades. Every rate hike is leading to billions of dollars in added net interest income each quarter."", ""As I've previously pointed out, BofA has done an admirable job of digitizing its platform. Online and mobile-based transactions are considerably cheaper than in-person interactions. As more of its customers utilize digital transactions, Bank of America will be able to consolidate some of its physical branches and lower its expenses."", ""Perhaps it comes as no surprise that tech stock Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) plays a key role in Berkshire Hathaway's dividend income collection. Apple accounted for 49% of the company's nearly $366 billion of invested assets as of the closing bell on Dec. 8, 2023, making it the biggest holding by a considerable amount in Buffett's portfolio."", 'The $15 billion Apple is doling out in dividends annually is a reflection of its top-notch branding, as well as its cutting-edge innovation.', 'According to Kantar\'s 2023 BrandZ Rankings, Apple is the world\'s most valuable brand. It has an exceptionally loyal customer base, along with phenomenal pricing power. Meanwhile, Interbrand has listed Apple as the world\'s ""best brand"" for 11 consecutive years.', ""Beyond brand value, Apple is riding high thanks to its innovation. It's been a leading provider of smartphones for more than a decade, and it's led the way with tablets via the iPad. Moreover, CEO Tim Cook is overseeing the steady transition of Apple into a platforms-focused company. A subscription-driven model will further enhance customer loyalty and meaningfully improve the company's operating margin over the long term."", ""I'd be remiss if I didn't also mention Apple's unsurpassed capital-return program. In addition to its massive nominal-dollar dividend, Apple has repurchased in excess of $600 billion worth of its common stock since the start of 2013. Buffett has always appreciated a rock-solid share-buyback program."", 'Buffett and his team will be raking in a boatload of dividend income from energy stock Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) over the next 12 months, with this income coming from two separate channels.', 'Berkshire Hathaway is expected to receive $164.2 million in dividend income from the nearly 228.1 million shares of Occidental common stock it owns. Every single share of common stock has been purchased since the start of 2022.', ""Buffett's company also holds $8.49 billion of preferred stock in Occidental yielding 8% that'll generate around $679.2 million in annual income. Berkshire originally held $10 billion in preferred stock tied to a 2019 deal that helped Occidental acquire Anadarko. However, Occidental has redeemed $1.51 billion of this preferred position, through Nov. 7."", ""What makes Occidental such an attractive investment to Buffett and his team is the expectation that the spot price of crude oil will remain above its historic average. Supporting this thesis is Russia's war with Ukraine, along with three years of capital underinvestment by energy companies caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. As long as crude oil supply remains tight, there's a good likelihood that the spot price of crude oil will stay elevated."", ""A higher spot price for crude oil is especially important for Occidental Petroleum. Although it's an integrated energy company, it generates the lion's share of its revenue from its drilling operations. This is to say that if the spot price of crude oil increases, Occidental's operating cash flow will benefit more than most other integrated oil and gas operators. Just keep in mind that the reciprocal would also be true -- a declining spot price for crude oil will disproportionately hurt Occidental's operating cash flow."", ""The fourth stock that, collectively with Bank of America, Apple, and Occidental Petroleum, allows Buffett to rake in nearly $3.5 billion in annual dividend income is beverage stock Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO). Coca-Cola has raised its base annual payout for 61 consecutive years, and it's Berkshire's longest continuous holding (since 1988)."", ""One reason Coke is such a phenomenal income producer is that it's a consumer staples stock. Regardless of how well or poorly the U.S. and global economy perform, consumers are going to need food and beverages. This creates a predictable demand floor for Coca-Cola each year."", 'Branding is another catalyst for Coca-Cola and its rock-solid payout. Coca-Cola has topped the annually released ""Brand Footprint"" report from Kantar as the most chosen brand for 10 years running, as of 2022. Coke has a well-recognized logo and its top-notch marketing efforts have helped it connect with young and mature audiences alike for decades.', ""Equally important, Coca-Cola brings virtually unmatched geographic diversity to the table. With the exception of North Korea, Cuba, and Russia (the latter of which is due to its aforementioned ongoing war with Ukraine), Coke is operating in every other country around the globe. It has 26 brands generating at least $1 billion in annual sales, and it's able to rely on emerging markets for a proverbial shot in the arm of organic growth."", ""Berkshire Hathaway's cost basis for its Coca-Cola shares is just $3.2475. Based on its $1.84-per-share annual payout, Buffett's company is netting almost a 57% yield on cost. Put another way, Coca-Cola's dividend income alone is more than doubling Berkshire's initial investment in the company every two years."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Bank of America right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Bank of America, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Bank of America wasn't one of them.

Citi is one of three large American banks to be designated in “bucket 3 or 4” of the “global systemically important bank” (“G-SIB”) framework by The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The other banks in this group are J.P. Morgan and Bank of America.', 'As a G-SIB, Citi is subjected to increased regulatory supervision by global bank regulators and central banks. Enhanced regulatory supervision was an important post-crisis reform to strengthen the global financial system by increasing bank capital ratios, transparency, and decreasing risk-taking. These reforms resulted in the largest G-SIBs moving away from risk-oriented banking activities such as advisory, high-yield lending, and trading, towards lower-risk activities. Indeed, Citi’s most valuable, high-growth segment, Treasury and Trade Solutions, is in lower-risk and entrenched activities such as liquidity and cash management, payments, trade solutions, and automated receivables processing. In our view, somewhat unintuitively, Citi’s increased regulatory supervision contributes to the company’s less risky banking business model, and thus its attractiveness as a downside-oriented investment opportunity.', 'Citi’s market perception suffers from the bank’s negative historical reputation. In 2008 during the Great Financial Crisis, Citi received the most TARP funding (the largest “bailout”) of the U.S. banks. TARP funding was provided by the U.S. government to forestall a liquidity problem that threatened to become a solvency problem. More recently, Citi mistakenly used its own capital to pay lenders when acting as Revlon’s loan agent, resulting in a $400M fine by the Federal Reserve and orders to resolve internal controls (which Citi fulfilled). Citi’s large global consumer bank was assembled by prior management in the early 2000s to attract and service high-end global consumers. Unfortunately, this pivot was costly and ill-timed in the context of increasingly complex multi-jurisdictional regulation to prevent money laundering and tax evasion.

The company has delivered decent gains despite some fluctuations over the past decade. The share price has surged by over 376%, equating to a compounded annual growth rate of 16.9%. In this discussion, I will analyze Ulta Beauty to see whether it is a good stock for investors at the current price."", 'List of 52-Week Lows', 'List of 3-Year Lows', 'List of 5-Year Lows', 'Ulta Beauty is as a major player in the specialty beauty retail sector with over 1,350 stores across the United States. These stores offer a wide range of products, including fragrances, cosmetics and skincare items, along with a suite of services such as full-service hair salons, brow bars, makeup and skin treatments. The company holds approximately 9% of the $104 billion beauty product market, but only a 1% stake in the $68 billion market for hair, skin and nail services. This disparity highlights significant opportunities for Ulta Beauty to expand its services segment and increase its market presence.', ""In the third quarter, Ulta Beauty's net sales experienced decent growth, rising by 6.4% from the prior-year quarter to nearly $2.5 billion. This growth was accompanied by a 4.5% increase in comparable sales, attributed to a 5.9% rise in transactions. However, this was slightly offset by a 1.4% decrease in the average ticket value. The company saw significant growth in the skincare, fragrance and bath product categories, while makeup sales remained steady and haircare experienced a slight decline. Despite the surge in revenue, operating income decreased, falling to $329.7 million from $362.7 million last year. This decline was primarily due to higher selling, general and administrative expenses."", ""Ulta Beauty has demonstrated a remarkable growth trajectory since 2004, achieving high double-digit revenue increases in 17 of the past 18 years. The sole exception was in fiscal year 2020, when sales fell by 23.4% due to the adverse effects of Covid-19, including store closures, reduced operating hours and limited in-store services. From 2014 to 2023, Ulta Beauty expanded its revenue from $491 million to over $10.2 billion, achieving a compound annual growth rate of 18.4%. Equally notable is the company's consistent profitability and increasing operating income. Throughout these 18 years, Ulta Beauty maintained profitability each year. Its operating income soared from $18.5 million to $1.64 billion, marking an impressive annual growth rate of 28.3%."", ""The company's return on capital has been notably strong. Between 2004 and 2022, it consistently achieved double-digit returns on capital, with the exception of 2020, when it recorded a return of 8.9% due to the impact of Covid-19. However, the company made a robust recovery in the subsequent years, with the return on capital soaring to 37.8% in 2021 and further increasing to 41.8% in 2022."", ""Ulta has adopted a conservative capital structure despite the growing revenue and profitability. By the third quarter of 2023, it had $2 billion in shareholders' equity and $5.6 billion in assets. A significant portion of these assets comprises $2.32 billion in merchandise inventory, $1.12 billion in property and equipment and $1.58 billion in operating lease assets. The company maintains a low short-term debt level at $195.4 million. Its operating lease liabilities are relatively modest at $1.9 billion."", ""Upon examining the company's operating lease commitments, they are well-distributed over the coming years and are comfortably supported by its operating cash flow. In 2022, the operating cash flow reached $1.48 billion, while the average annual operating lease obligations stood at just about $325 million."", ""Source: Ulta Beauty's 10-K"", ""So far this year, the company has bought back 1.8 million shares for $840 million and anticipates the total expenditure on share repurchases for the year to reach $950 million. Given the current share price of $470, this would equate to an additional purchase of approximately 234,000 shares.

Painful DPN and LSR are two of the largest segments within the estimated 10 million patients who are prescribed a medicine for peripheral neuropathic pain every year in the U.S.', 'About VX-548', 'VX-548 is an investigational oral, selective NaV1.8 inhibitor that is highly selective for NaV1.8 relative to other NaV channels. NaV1.8 is a voltage-gated sodium channel that plays a critical role in pain signaling in the peripheral nervous system. NaV1.8 is a genetically validated target for the treatment of pain, and Vertex has previously demonstrated positive proof-of-concept results and a well-tolerated profile with VX-548 in two Phase 2 studies of acute pain following abdominoplasty and bunionectomy surgeries. Vertex’s approach is to selectively inhibit NaV1.8 using small molecules with the objective of creating a new class of medicines that have the potential to provide superior relief of pain without the limitations of opioids, including their addictive potential. VX-548 is one of the most recent molecules to enter clinical development from Vertex’s portfolio of NaV1.8 inhibitors.', 'About Vertex', 'Vertex is a global biotechnology company that invests in scientific innovation to create transformative medicines for people with serious diseases.

In his 58 years at the helm, he's overseen a greater than 4,300,000% aggregate gain in Berkshire's Class A shares (BRK.A), as well as doubled up the annualized total return, including dividends, of the widely followed S&P 500."", 'Lengthy books have been written on the core philosophies the Oracle of Omaha lives by, which includes thinking long-term and buying into great businesses with sustained catalysts at a fair price.', ""But what doesn't receive nearly enough credit for Buffett's nearly six decades of investment success is his penchant for buying dividend stocks. Companies that pay a regular dividend to their shareholders are usually profitable and time-tested. What's more, income stocks have a history of running circles around public companies that don't offer a payout in the return department."", ""A majority of the stocks currently held by Berkshire Hathaway pay a dividend, with Buffett's company set to collect close to $6 billion in income over the coming 12 months."", ""But what's truly surprising is how much of this income will derive from a small number of holdings. Warren Buffett and his team are set to rake in nearly $3.5 billion in annual dividend income from just four stocks over the next year."", ""Berkshire Hathaway's No. 2 holding by market value, Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), will be doing the heaviest lifting of all when it comes to providing dividend income. The more than 1.03 billion shares Buffett's company owns of BofA will translate into almost $992 million in dividend income over the next 12 months."", 'The lure of bank stocks for Buffett has always been their cyclical ties and the recurring need for financial services. Though banks are cyclical, and will therefore contend with higher delinquency rates and loan losses during recessions, periods of economic expansion last considerably longer than downturns. Rather than foolishly trying to time when these downturns will occur, Buffett has wisely positioned Berkshire Hathaway in high-quality financial stocks, like BofA, to take advantage of long-winded expansions.', ""But there's more to Berkshire's No. 2 holding than just macroeconomic factors. Bank of America is also the most interest rate-sensitive of America's largest banks by assets. When interest rates change, no bank is more impacted than BofA."", ""Since March 2022, the nation's central bank has increased the federal funds rate by 525 basis points, which is the fastest pace of rate hikes in more than four decades. Every rate hike is leading to billions of dollars in added net interest income each quarter."", ""As I've previously pointed out, BofA has done an admirable job of digitizing its platform. Online and mobile-based transactions are considerably cheaper than in-person interactions. As more of its customers utilize digital transactions, Bank of America will be able to consolidate some of its physical branches and lower its expenses."", ""Perhaps it comes as no surprise that tech stock Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) plays a key role in Berkshire Hathaway's dividend income collection. Apple accounted for 49% of the company's nearly $366 billion of invested assets as of the closing bell on Dec. 8, 2023, making it the biggest holding by a considerable amount in Buffett's portfolio."", 'The $15 billion Apple is doling out in dividends annually is a reflection of its top-notch branding, as well as its cutting-edge innovation.', 'According to Kantar\'s 2023 BrandZ Rankings, Apple is the world\'s most valuable brand. It has an exceptionally loyal customer base, along with phenomenal pricing power. Meanwhile, Interbrand has listed Apple as the world\'s ""best brand"" for 11 consecutive years.', ""Beyond brand value, Apple is riding high thanks to its innovation. It's been a leading provider of smartphones for more than a decade, and it's led the way with tablets via the iPad. Moreover, CEO Tim Cook is overseeing the steady transition of Apple into a platforms-focused company. A subscription-driven model will further enhance customer loyalty and meaningfully improve the company's operating margin over the long term."", ""I'd be remiss if I didn't also mention Apple's unsurpassed capital-return program. In addition to its massive nominal-dollar dividend, Apple has repurchased in excess of $600 billion worth of its common stock since the start of 2013. Buffett has always appreciated a rock-solid share-buyback program."", 'Buffett and his team will be raking in a boatload of dividend income from energy stock Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) over the next 12 months, with this income coming from two separate channels.', 'Berkshire Hathaway is expected to receive $164.2 million in dividend income from the nearly 228.1 million shares of Occidental common stock it owns. Every single share of common stock has been purchased since the start of 2022.', ""Buffett's company also holds $8.49 billion of preferred stock in Occidental yielding 8% that'll generate around $679.2 million in annual income. Berkshire originally held $10 billion in preferred stock tied to a 2019 deal that helped Occidental acquire Anadarko. However, Occidental has redeemed $1.51 billion of this preferred position, through Nov. 7."", ""What makes Occidental such an attractive investment to Buffett and his team is the expectation that the spot price of crude oil will remain above its historic average. Supporting this thesis is Russia's war with Ukraine, along with three years of capital underinvestment by energy companies caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. As long as crude oil supply remains tight, there's a good likelihood that the spot price of crude oil will stay elevated."", ""A higher spot price for crude oil is especially important for Occidental Petroleum. Although it's an integrated energy company, it generates the lion's share of its revenue from its drilling operations. This is to say that if the spot price of crude oil increases, Occidental's operating cash flow will benefit more than most other integrated oil and gas operators. Just keep in mind that the reciprocal would also be true -- a declining spot price for crude oil will disproportionately hurt Occidental's operating cash flow."", ""The fourth stock that, collectively with Bank of America, Apple, and Occidental Petroleum, allows Buffett to rake in nearly $3.5 billion in annual dividend income is beverage stock Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO). Coca-Cola has raised its base annual payout for 61 consecutive years, and it's Berkshire's longest continuous holding (since 1988)."", ""One reason Coke is such a phenomenal income producer is that it's a consumer staples stock. Regardless of how well or poorly the U.S. and global economy perform, consumers are going to need food and beverages. This creates a predictable demand floor for Coca-Cola each year."", 'Branding is another catalyst for Coca-Cola and its rock-solid payout. Coca-Cola has topped the annually released ""Brand Footprint"" report from Kantar as the most chosen brand for 10 years running, as of 2022. Coke has a well-recognized logo and its top-notch marketing efforts have helped it connect with young and mature audiences alike for decades.', ""Equally important, Coca-Cola brings virtually unmatched geographic diversity to the table. With the exception of North Korea, Cuba, and Russia (the latter of which is due to its aforementioned ongoing war with Ukraine), Coke is operating in every other country around the globe. It has 26 brands generating at least $1 billion in annual sales, and it's able to rely on emerging markets for a proverbial shot in the arm of organic growth."", ""Berkshire Hathaway's cost basis for its Coca-Cola shares is just $3.2475. Based on its $1.84-per-share annual payout, Buffett's company is netting almost a 57% yield on cost. Put another way, Coca-Cola's dividend income alone is more than doubling Berkshire's initial investment in the company every two years."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Bank of America right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Bank of America, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Bank of America wasn't one of them.

Whether it's everyday stimulants such as coffee or illegal substances such as anabolic steroids, there are several substances that enable people to concentrate more and improve their productivity or athletic performance."", 'One such product category is the functional beverages segment. Functional beverages are a broad category, and some individual products that they include are energy drinks, tea, coffee, vitamin supplements, and even mineralized water. The premise behind these beverages is to supplement human nutrition and provide micronutrients, minerals, and vitamins that might be absent from a regular diet.', 'In terms of monetary value, the functional beverages market is quite sizeable. Research from Future Markets Insights shows that this market was worth a whopping $156 billion as of 2022 end and it is slated to grow to $164 billion by the end of this year. From 2023 end to 2033, the research firm expects the market to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.4% to be worth $277 billion by the end of the forecast period. This makes the functional beverage market one of the biggest in the world, and some drivers behind this rapid growth include a rising health trend in younger generations such as millennials and Gen Z. Additionally, an aging global population is also expected to stimulate demand, but constraints such as the need to ensure end to end supply chain visibility are some risks that can hamper market performance.', 'One of the more popular segments of the functional beverage market is the energy drink market. These products are quite popular among athletes and graduate students alike, as both are eager to maximize their performance to beat out the competition or deadlines set by their professors and universities. According to our research part of 10 Biggest Energy Drink Companies in the World, the energy drink market was worth $54.8 billion in 2020, and it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.1% between 2022 and 2030. Combining this with our analysis of the functional beverage market above, the energy drink segment accounts for more than a third of the broader revenue pie and its growth rate is also significantly faster than the broader market. Additionally, and as is the case with other industries such as construction and travel, Asia Pacific is expected to lead the energy drink market growth in the future. In particular, China is expected to post a 10% CAGR between 2020 and 2027, with a final market value of $33.7 billion by 2027.', ""But what about stocks?

(NASDAQ:GOOG). This is unsurprising as larger firms have considerable resources at their disposal, and they can often match the operational scale of smaller companies by setting up smaller business divisions."", ""Functional drinks are discretionary products, which means that their business operations are sensitive to high inflation. People are likely to focus on core purchases such as medicine and chicken if inflation is high, as they choose to skip their Red Bull for the next shopping run. Therefore, as inflation in the U.S. is still high (despite notably falling in the wake of the Federal Reserve's rapid interest rate hikes, it's important to look at what the companies themselves are experiencing."", ""On this front, here's what the management of Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) had to say during its third quarter of 2023 earnings call:"", 'The company continues to have market share leadership in the energy drink category for all outlets combined in the United States in both the 13-week and four-week periods ended October 21, 2023.

The other banks in this group are J.P. Morgan and Bank of America.', 'As a G-SIB, Citi is subjected to increased regulatory supervision by global bank regulators and central banks. Enhanced regulatory supervision was an important post-crisis reform to strengthen the global financial system by increasing bank capital ratios, transparency, and decreasing risk-taking. These reforms resulted in the largest G-SIBs moving away from risk-oriented banking activities such as advisory, high-yield lending, and trading, towards lower-risk activities. Indeed, Citi’s most valuable, high-growth segment, Treasury and Trade Solutions, is in lower-risk and entrenched activities such as liquidity and cash management, payments, trade solutions, and automated receivables processing. In our view, somewhat unintuitively, Citi’s increased regulatory supervision contributes to the company’s less risky banking business model, and thus its attractiveness as a downside-oriented investment opportunity.', 'Citi’s market perception suffers from the bank’s negative historical reputation. In 2008 during the Great Financial Crisis, Citi received the most TARP funding (the largest “bailout”) of the U.S. banks. TARP funding was provided by the U.S. government to forestall a liquidity problem that threatened to become a solvency problem. More recently, Citi mistakenly used its own capital to pay lenders when acting as Revlon’s loan agent, resulting in a $400M fine by the Federal Reserve and orders to resolve internal controls (which Citi fulfilled). Citi’s large global consumer bank was assembled by prior management in the early 2000s to attract and service high-end global consumers. Unfortunately, this pivot was costly and ill-timed in the context of increasingly complex multi-jurisdictional regulation to prevent money laundering and tax evasion.

The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.06 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $3.00.

The ORi feature is indicated for the monitoring of hemoglobin oxygen saturation levels in patients 18 years and above on supplemental oxygen during no-motion conditions perioperatively in hospital environments.', 'The latest study demonstrating a significant correlation between the two parameters during OLV is a major stepping stone for Masimo’s real-time patient monitoring business and is likely to solidify its position in the niche space on a global scale.', 'The researchers noted the importance of striving to prevent hyperoxemia and hypoxemia, especially during surgery requiring OLV, due to the risk of pulmonary complications. Hence, they sought to evaluate a non-invasive, continuous method of predicting imminent over- or under-oxygenation to overcome the drawbacks of invasive blood gas analysis alone, using Masimo ORi.', 'The researchers found that ORi values were significantly correlated with PaO2 measured simultaneously. They also concluded that ORi could provide useful information on arterial oxygenation even during OLV.', 'ORi is expected to provide clinicians with additional visibility, as a complement to SpO2 monitoring with Masimo SET pulse oximetry, into when oxygenation is increased into, or decreased out of, moderate hyperoxia in real time.

Though most of the stocks in the ETF have returned handsomely, many are undervalued, as reflected in their lower P/E ratio than industry peers. The fund has good potential for the next year.

He anticipates that the S&P 500 could soar to 5,200 by the end of 2024, marking a 13% increase from its current level. This optimism is partly based on the expectation that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next year as inflation eases.

Major financial institutions like Bank of America, Deutsche Bank and Société Générale predict that the S&P 500 could hit new highs in 2024.', 'After the astounding surge of the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks, the rally has been broadening out in recent weeks. As more underperforming members of the S&P 500 catch up, the index should continue to climb, even if the rise in the Magnificent Seven stalls out. Per a strategist at Bank of America, only about 24% of the stocks in the S&P 500 are trading within 10% of their all-time highs. This is notably lower than the historical average of 28%.

Given that stock prices are usually aligned with a company's financial performance in the long-term, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely to see if they had a hand to play in the recent price move. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Sempra's  ROE today."", 'ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.', ' View our latest analysis for Sempra ', 'The formula for ROE is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Sempra is:', '9.5% = US$3.2b ÷ US$33b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.10 in profit."", 'So far, we\'ve learned that ROE is a measure of a company\'s profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company\'s future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.', ""When you first look at it, Sempra's ROE doesn't look that attractive. However, given that the company's ROE is similar to the average industry ROE of 9.3%, we may spare it some thought. Having said that, Sempra has shown a modest net income growth of 16% over the past five years. Taking into consideration that the ROE is not particularly high, we reckon that there could also be other factors at play which could be influencing the company's growth. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently."", ""As a next step, we compared Sempra's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 5.0%."", ""The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is SRE worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether SRE is currently mispriced by the market."", ""The high three-year median payout ratio of 64% (or a retention ratio of 36%) for Sempra suggests that the company's growth wasn't really hampered despite it returning most of its income to its shareholders."", ""Besides, Sempra has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 55% of its profits over the next three years. However, Sempra's ROE is predicted to rise to 12% despite there being no anticipated change in its payout ratio."", ""In total, it does look like Sempra has some positive aspects to its business. Namely, its high earnings growth. We do however feel that the earnings growth number could have been even higher, had the company been reinvesting more of its earnings and paid out less dividends. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Accordingly, Cincinnati Financial investors that purchase the stock on or after the 18th of December will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 16th of January."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.75 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$3.00 to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that Cincinnati Financial has a trailing yield of 2.9% on the current share price of $104.63. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing."", ' See our latest analysis for Cincinnati Financial ', ""Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. That's why it's good to see Cincinnati Financial paying out a modest 28% of its earnings."", ""Generally speaking, the lower a company's payout ratios, the more resilient its dividend usually is."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. For this reason, we're glad to see Cincinnati Financial's earnings per share have risen 11% per annum over the last five years."", ""Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, Cincinnati Financial has lifted its dividend by approximately 6.3% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders."", 'Should investors buy Cincinnati Financial for the upcoming dividend? Companies like Cincinnati Financial that are growing rapidly and paying out a low fraction of earnings, are usually reinvesting heavily in their business. This is one of the most attractive investment combinations under this analysis, as it can create substantial value for investors over the long run. Overall, Cincinnati Financial looks like a promising dividend stock in this analysis, and we think it would be worth investigating further.', 'With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces.

We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", 'A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:', '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$6.16b', 'US$7.60b', 'US$8.93b', 'US$9.61b', 'US$10.1b', 'US$10.6b', 'US$11.0b', 'US$11.3b', 'US$11.7b', 'US$12.0b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x7', 'Analyst x5', 'Analyst x4', 'Analyst x3', 'Est @ 5.39%', 'Est @ 4.44%', 'Est @ 3.77%', 'Est @ 3.31%', 'Est @ 2.98%', 'Est @ 2.75%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.5% ', 'US$5.7k', 'US$6.6k', 'US$7.2k', 'US$7.2k', 'US$7.1k', 'US$6.9k', 'US$6.6k', 'US$6.4k', 'US$6.1k', 'US$5.8k', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$66b', ""After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage.

Given that we are looking at General Electric as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.055. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

The new tax reforms directly impact multinational companies across the globe. The Pillar Two tax reform, signed by 138 countries, accounts for 90% of global economic activity. As per the Pillar Two tax reform, the primary goal is to establish a level playing field for companies across countries. This will primarily be done by discouraging companies from lowering their corporate income taxes in a bid to attract foreign investment. Under the supervision of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), companies with €750 million or more in revenue, are obliged to pay a global minimum tax of 15% on earned income in each country they operate in. OECD suggests that the reform will push corporate taxes globally by $220 billion per year, almost 9% of global corporate income tax revenues. Deloitte further highlights that the Pillar Two tax reform does not limit itself to just taxes, instead, it shapes how multinationals operate their supply chain networks, execute acquisitions, and strategic decisions.', 'Moreover, the system and compliance data are not only difficult to adhere to, but they also demand a complex infrastructure, that businesses need to establish. Under the reform, multinationals will be required to provide data for 100 separate data points for each entity in an organization. Not only do companies have to remodel their organizational structure, but they also have to revisit their financial reporting timelines. Therefore, to address the need for a complex infrastructure, companies will not be expected to report 2024 returns until after 18 months, which provides ample time for companies to adapt and restructure.

This follows a rough year for the stock markets in 2022 which marked one of the worst years for the stock market since 2008. Of the three major U.S. stock indices, NASDAQ 100 fared the worst, declining more than 30% in 2022 as shareholders withdrew from growth firms due to escalating fears of a recession. S&P 500 fared better than the NASDAQ-100 but still went down more than 19% in 2022.', 'The stock markets behaved erratically during 2023 as well with major indices going up and down (mostly up) with the macroeconomic and geopolitical developments. The last Fed meeting, going to be held this week, is expected to maintain interest rates at the current level. Investors and analysts are watching closely to ascertain Fed’s tone to ascertain the probable timing of rate cuts. With a strong Labor Department’s monthly jobs report that exceeded estimates for new job additions in November, and this year’s lowest core PCE increase, major stock indices in the United States had another week of positive close, which has led to six consecutive weeks of growth.

In addition to broader macroeconomic factors, industry-specific and company-specific factors also play a significant role in the performance of different stocks. For instance, a significant portion of the gains in 2023 can be attributed to the rise of the “Magnificent Seven”, i.e., Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla. These stocks, combined, have soared an average of 70% year-to-date, compared to a measly average 6% for the rest of the S&P 500 constituents, as of November end.

The new tax reforms directly impact multinational companies across the globe. The Pillar Two tax reform, signed by 138 countries, accounts for 90% of global economic activity. As per the Pillar Two tax reform, the primary goal is to establish a level playing field for companies across countries. This will primarily be done by discouraging companies from lowering their corporate income taxes in a bid to attract foreign investment. Under the supervision of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), companies with €750 million or more in revenue, are obliged to pay a global minimum tax of 15% on earned income in each country they operate in. OECD suggests that the reform will push corporate taxes globally by $220 billion per year, almost 9% of global corporate income tax revenues. Deloitte further highlights that the Pillar Two tax reform does not limit itself to just taxes, instead, it shapes how multinationals operate their supply chain networks, execute acquisitions, and strategic decisions.', 'Moreover, the system and compliance data are not only difficult to adhere to, but they also demand a complex infrastructure, that businesses need to establish. Under the reform, multinationals will be required to provide data for 100 separate data points for each entity in an organization. Not only do companies have to remodel their organizational structure, but they also have to revisit their financial reporting timelines. Therefore, to address the need for a complex infrastructure, companies will not be expected to report 2024 returns until after 18 months, which provides ample time for companies to adapt and restructure.

In practice, that\'s a hard goal to reach, but a good way to start is by focusing on companies that have proven track records of success behind them. One quick and dirty way to figure that out is by looking at a stock\'s dividend history.', 'Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG), ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM), and Federal Realty (NYSE: FRT) are all standouts when it comes to their dividends. Here\'s why you might want to own these three ""forever"" stocks.', 'If there\'s a secret to Procter & Gamble\'s success, it is most likely research and development. That\'s because the company\'s products are, largely, things that have existed for a very long time. What keeps them fresh is the innovation that allows P&G to say they are ""new"" and ""improved."" Those two words are incredibly valuable in the consumer staples sector.', ""The company's success is most clearly seen in the 67 consecutive annual dividend increases it has provided investors. That makes the company a highly elite Dividend King. But there's more to the story here, because not only has P&G used innovation to its advantage, but it also has industry-leading distribution and marketing chops. It's the type of company you buy and hold on to for the rest of your life. The problem is that it doesn't go on sale very often. Today's 2.6% dividend yield is about average for this stock, and the price-to-sales and price-to-earnings ratios are a touch lower than their five-year averages. It looks like P&G might be trading at a fair price, which is actually attractive when you know you are buying a great company."", ""International energy giant ExxonMobil has managed to increase its dividend annually for 41 consecutive years. That's actually pretty shocking, given that it operates in the energy sector, where oil and natural gas prices often rise and fall in dramatic, and swift, fashion. But the company is built from the ground up to withstand the swings so it can continue to reward investors for sticking around."", ""For starters, the company's business is integrated, which means it has exposure to the entire energy value chain. That helps to smooth out the ups and downs since some areas of the energy business tend to do well even as others are doing poorly. On top of that, ExxonMobil focuses on maintaining a strong balance sheet. Low leverage allows ExxonMobil to take on debt when times are tough so it can continue to support its business and dividend."", ""In all, it's a reliable way to add exposure to the volatile energy sector, which can provide valuable diversification for your portfolio. Although the stock is probably fully valued today, given its middle-of-the-road (historically speaking) 3.8% dividend yield, it would be a good stock to own even if you try to wait for a deeper pullback before buying it. In other words, keep an eye on it if even if you aren't willing to buy it today."", ""The big claim to fame for real estate investment trust (REIT) Federal Realty is that it has the longest dividend streak of any REIT. It's also a Dividend King, with 56 years of annual increases under its belt. The company's focus is well-located strip malls and mixed-use developments. Unlike many of its closest peers, however, it has long focused on quality over quantity, owning only around 100 properties. They're very good properties, with higher average incomes and population counts within three miles of the property than its peers have."", ""What's really interesting here, however, is that Federal Realty doesn't really care what stores are in its properties, so long as they're doing well. The list shifts over time, as you might expect. So you can have exposure to the retail sector by owning Federal Realty without having to try to pick a retail winner, effectively placing all of your bets on one company. And you can collect a 4.4% dividend yield along the way. In fairness, the dividend yield has been much higher in the past, notably during recessions when investors tend to throw the baby out with the bathwater. So you might want to wait until there's a deep pullback before buying. But put it on your wishlist now so you actually pull the trigger when the opportunity to own it on the cheap arises again."", ""Procter & Gamble, ExxonMobil, and Federal Realty are all the types of stocks you cling to for life once you've added them to your portfolio. Right now, P&G and ExxonMobil seem at least reasonably priced if you don't mind paying full rate for a great company. Federal Realty is probably a little pricey. But even if you have a heavy value bias, you'll want to keep all three on your watch list.

And while some management teams aren't adept at navigating their businesses through volatility stemming from falling energy prices, let alone maintaining or raising the dividend, Chevron's C-suite has demonstrated sufficient prowess. For 36 consecutive years, Chevron has logged dividend raises, making it one of the elite dividend-paying stocks available to investors."", 'One of the alluring aspects of Chevron as a dividend stock is that the company often generates sufficient free cash flow from its extensive operations up and down the energy value chain to cover its dividend.', ""And Chevron's free cash flow, presumably, will remain strong in the years to come, especially in light of the recent acquisition of PDC Energy, an acquisition expected to contribute $1 billion in annual free cash flow."", 'Shares of Chevron are currently valued at 7.6 times operating cash flow, representing a discount to its five-year average cash flow multiple of 9.4.

But it is below the stocks' three-, five, seven, and 10-year median."", 'I believe P&G deserves to trade above its historic valuation, not below it. The company has done a uniquely impressive job during this inflationary period by exhibiting unparalleled pricing power when so many of its peers have seen their margins compress or are just now building their margins back up.', ""2022 and 2023 proved how P&G is the undisputed industry leader across its businesses segments, and it's also demonstrated the advantage it has from a supply chain management perspective."", 'With 67 consecutive years of dividend raises, P&G is a reliable passive-income stock that also has what it takes to take market share and grow its operations for years to come.', 'Lee Samaha (MSC Industrial): Maintenance, repair, and operations (MRO) product distributor MSC Industrial is a play on industrial production growth in the United States. In an era where global trade tensions are growing and the economy continues to suffer from supply chain constraints, many industrial companies have reshoring on their mind.', 'However, to shift manufacturing back from low-labor-cost countries will require investment in productivity-enhancing technology like automation and smart manufacturing, and it will also need a good-quality, reliable MRO supply to improve productivity.', ""That's where MSC Industrial's inventory management solutions, same-day shipping of products, e-commerce capability, and growing installed base of vending machines at customer sites come in. Through these initiatives and its focus on metalworking, MSC has generated organic sales growth in excess of industrial production growth in the U.S. over the past few years."", 'Its earnings have grown in concert, and its quarterly dividend of $0.83 puts the stock on a dividend yield of 3.4% at the current price.

(NYSE:C) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:', '“Citigroup\xa0(“Citi”) is a large-capitalization global diversified financial services holding company that primarily serves multinational institutional and high net worth consumer clients. Citi is one of three large American banks to be designated in “bucket 3 or 4” of the “global systemically important bank” (“G-SIB”) framework by The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The other banks in this group are J.P. Morgan and Bank of America.', 'As a G-SIB, Citi is subjected to increased regulatory supervision by global bank regulators and central banks. Enhanced regulatory supervision was an important post-crisis reform to strengthen the global financial system by increasing bank capital ratios, transparency, and decreasing risk-taking. These reforms resulted in the largest G-SIBs moving away from risk-oriented banking activities such as advisory, high-yield lending, and trading, towards lower-risk activities. Indeed, Citi’s most valuable, high-growth segment, Treasury and Trade Solutions, is in lower-risk and entrenched activities such as liquidity and cash management, payments, trade solutions, and automated receivables processing. In our view, somewhat unintuitively, Citi’s increased regulatory supervision contributes to the company’s less risky banking business model, and thus its attractiveness as a downside-oriented investment opportunity.', 'Citi’s market perception suffers from the bank’s negative historical reputation. In 2008 during the Great Financial Crisis, Citi received the most TARP funding (the largest “bailout”) of the U.S. banks. TARP funding was provided by the U.S. government to forestall a liquidity problem that threatened to become a solvency problem. More recently, Citi mistakenly used its own capital to pay lenders when acting as Revlon’s loan agent, resulting in a $400M fine by the Federal Reserve and orders to resolve internal controls (which Citi fulfilled). Citi’s large global consumer bank was assembled by prior management in the early 2000s to attract and service high-end global consumers. Unfortunately, this pivot was costly and ill-timed in the context of increasingly complex multi-jurisdictional regulation to prevent money laundering and tax evasion.

Citi is one of three large American banks to be designated in “bucket 3 or 4” of the “global systemically important bank” (“G-SIB”) framework by The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The other banks in this group are J.P. Morgan and Bank of America.', 'As a G-SIB, Citi is subjected to increased regulatory supervision by global bank regulators and central banks. Enhanced regulatory supervision was an important post-crisis reform to strengthen the global financial system by increasing bank capital ratios, transparency, and decreasing risk-taking. These reforms resulted in the largest G-SIBs moving away from risk-oriented banking activities such as advisory, high-yield lending, and trading, towards lower-risk activities. Indeed, Citi’s most valuable, high-growth segment, Treasury and Trade Solutions, is in lower-risk and entrenched activities such as liquidity and cash management, payments, trade solutions, and automated receivables processing. In our view, somewhat unintuitively, Citi’s increased regulatory supervision contributes to the company’s less risky banking business model, and thus its attractiveness as a downside-oriented investment opportunity.', 'Citi’s market perception suffers from the bank’s negative historical reputation. In 2008 during the Great Financial Crisis, Citi received the most TARP funding (the largest “bailout”) of the U.S. banks. TARP funding was provided by the U.S. government to forestall a liquidity problem that threatened to become a solvency problem. More recently, Citi mistakenly used its own capital to pay lenders when acting as Revlon’s loan agent, resulting in a $400M fine by the Federal Reserve and orders to resolve internal controls (which Citi fulfilled). Citi’s large global consumer bank was assembled by prior management in the early 2000s to attract and service high-end global consumers. Unfortunately, this pivot was costly and ill-timed in the context of increasingly complex multi-jurisdictional regulation to prevent money laundering and tax evasion.

The move is the latest in the mounting tensions between cabin crew and U.S. airline management that could result in the industry’s first labor action in more than a decade.', 'The agreement that Southwest’s nearly 19,000 flight attendants rejected included pay increases of 36% over five years and other quality of life improvements. The offer clearly was not enough: 64% of those who voted rejected the agreement.', '“The flight attendants of Southwest Airlines have made it clear that this proposed contract is not going to heal the hurt,” said Lyn Montgomery, president of the Transport Workers Union Local 556 that represents the crew members. “We will go back to the table to achieve the collective bargaining agreement that meets the needs of the hardest-working flight attendants in the industry.”', 'The union declined to comment further.', 'One area of disagreement concerns boarding pay. Almost all U.S. flight attendants are paid only when an aircraft door is closed, rather than during the boarding and deplaning process. Delta Air Lines is the sole U.S. carrier that pays cabin crew for boarding, a policy it added last year amid a drive to unionize (the airline’s cabin crew is currently not unionized).', 'Cabin crew unions at Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Spirit Airlines, and United Airlines are all in active contract negotiations. American flight attendants have gone as far as to authorize a potential strike.', 'Labor is having a moment in the U.S. Strikes have been successful in a number of high profile industries from the big auto manufacturers to actors and screenwriters in Hollywood. And the threat of strikes helped freight railroad employees reach long-sought deals. Organizing campaigns have succeeded at historically non-union companies like Starbucks.', '“People, they’re furious,” said Sara Nelson, president of the largest flight attendants union, the Association of Flight Attendants. “They’re furious that they haven’t been recognized, and their demands are very high.”', 'Flight attendants were on the frontlines of the pandemic. That included dealing with a surge in unruly fliers and having to enforce controversial rules like the mask mandate.', 'In addition to the ground pay issue, another issue concerns the work rules that govern when flights are delayed and canceled, said Embry-Riddle Professor Blaise Waguespack. This was top of mind for many Southwest crews following the airline’s meltdown last December when it “lost” many of its pilots and flight attendants.', 'Some airline executives have received big pay increases as their carriers have returned to profitability post-Covid. And pilots across the industry — even among historically lower-cost regional airlines — have ratified contracts with historic pay levels.', '“It’s a busy season for labor relations,” Waguespack said.', '“Flight attendants across the industry are tired of waiting,” said Julie Hedrick, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, which represents crews at American, in a September virtual town hall.', 'That is especially true of flight attendants at American. Their contract became amendable in January 2019 and cabin crew have not received a pay raise since then, Hedrick said.', 'The flat pay has come even as inflation has driven prices 18% higher than in 2019.', 'Strikes at airlines are governed by the U.S. Railway Labor Act. The law lays out strict rules: mediated talks, a strike authorization vote, followed by a release from mediation, and finally a 30-day so-called cooling off period before a strike can begin. There are typically several months between each step. And then, the president can still intervene and stop a strike.', 'The more than 23,000 flight attendants at American authorized a strike in August, and then sought a release from mediated talks in November. The request was denied by the National Mediation Board.', 'If flight attendants at American did strike — a big if — it would be the first at a U.S. airline since pilots at Spirit Airlines struck in June 2010. The scale of such an action at American, however, would be several orders of magnitude greater: Spirit flew less than 1% of all U.S. domestic flights in 2010 whereas American flies nearly 23% today, according to Cirium Diio data.', 'One needs to go back to 2005 to find the last time staff at a major airline went on strike – that’s when mechanics at Northwest Airlines walked off the job.', 'Even a “CHAOS,” or Create Havoc Around Our System, strike that only targets a few flights could be very disruptive. Neither the airline nor passengers know what flights will be affected in a CHAOS action until it happens, which could leave planes full of passengers stranded at the gate without crews.', 'The Association of Professional Flight Attendants asked American for a 35% pay increase at the date of signing and annual increases thereafter, while American offered just an 11% increase at signing, Hedrick said in September. The union declined to comment on the current status of negotiations.', '“There’s no way we’re getting the flight attendant contracts done across the industry without a credible strike threat,” Nelson said when asked if she thought a strike is needed to achieve the gains flight attendants seek. “One of the airlines is going to have to face that, [and] the rest are going to have to know that’s coming.”', 'Inflation hit every airline during the pandemic. During the first nine months of the year, unit costs excluding fuel — a measure of how much it costs an airline to fly a seat one mile — were up 15-23% at American, Delta, and United compared to 2019. And that was after they largely eased the run up in expenses after double-digit increases last year.', '“We are facing sizable [cost] headwinds with labor and [the] expectation of a new flight attendant agreement” next year, United Chief Financial Officer Michael Leskinen said in October.', 'That sentiment was shared by his counterparts at Alaska and American, who have all mentioned the potential for labor cost headwinds to Wall Street analysts in recent months.', 'Melius Research analyst Conor Cunningham estimates that a 20% pay increase for flight attendants would cost U.S. airlines roughly $1.9 billion annually, and increase industry unit costs excluding fuel by 1.3%. Add in the boarding pay sought by flight attendants, and expenses would jump another $718 million and unit costs another 0.5%. Southwest would face the largest increases among U.S. airlines.', '“Cost pressures continue to mount in the U.S. airline industry,” Cunningham wrote Monday. “Airlines have slowly been revising down January and February schedules to better match supply with demand in hopes of regaining pricing power … [But] the reduction in supply will further highlight the core cost issues.”', 'Southwest is alone among U.S. airlines as having factored a potential new flight attendant contract into its financial outlook.', 'Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.']"

Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. In this article, we decided to focus on Aflac's  ROE."", 'Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.', ' See our latest analysis for Aflac ', 'Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Aflac is:', '19% = US$4.4b ÷ US$23b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.19 in profit."", 'So far, we\'ve learned that ROE is a measure of a company\'s profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don\'t necessarily bear these characteristics.', ""At first glance, Aflac seems to have a decent ROE. On comparing with the average industry ROE of 14% the company's ROE looks pretty remarkable. Probably as a result of this, Aflac was able to see a decent growth of 6.8% over the last five years."", ""As a next step, we compared Aflac's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 9.0% in the same period."", ""The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is AFL fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know."", 'Aflac has a low three-year median payout ratio of 21%, meaning that the company retains the remaining 79% of its profits. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business.', ""Additionally, Aflac has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 32% over the next three years. Therefore, the expected rise in the payout ratio explains why the company's ROE is expected to decline to 13% over the same period."", ""Overall, we are quite pleased with Aflac's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. As a result, the decent growth in its earnings is not surprising. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

In practice, that\'s a hard goal to reach, but a good way to start is by focusing on companies that have proven track records of success behind them. One quick and dirty way to figure that out is by looking at a stock\'s dividend history.', 'Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG), ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM), and Federal Realty (NYSE: FRT) are all standouts when it comes to their dividends. Here\'s why you might want to own these three ""forever"" stocks.', 'If there\'s a secret to Procter & Gamble\'s success, it is most likely research and development. That\'s because the company\'s products are, largely, things that have existed for a very long time. What keeps them fresh is the innovation that allows P&G to say they are ""new"" and ""improved."" Those two words are incredibly valuable in the consumer staples sector.', ""The company's success is most clearly seen in the 67 consecutive annual dividend increases it has provided investors. That makes the company a highly elite Dividend King. But there's more to the story here, because not only has P&G used innovation to its advantage, but it also has industry-leading distribution and marketing chops. It's the type of company you buy and hold on to for the rest of your life. The problem is that it doesn't go on sale very often. Today's 2.6% dividend yield is about average for this stock, and the price-to-sales and price-to-earnings ratios are a touch lower than their five-year averages. It looks like P&G might be trading at a fair price, which is actually attractive when you know you are buying a great company."", ""International energy giant ExxonMobil has managed to increase its dividend annually for 41 consecutive years. That's actually pretty shocking, given that it operates in the energy sector, where oil and natural gas prices often rise and fall in dramatic, and swift, fashion. But the company is built from the ground up to withstand the swings so it can continue to reward investors for sticking around."", ""For starters, the company's business is integrated, which means it has exposure to the entire energy value chain. That helps to smooth out the ups and downs since some areas of the energy business tend to do well even as others are doing poorly. On top of that, ExxonMobil focuses on maintaining a strong balance sheet. Low leverage allows ExxonMobil to take on debt when times are tough so it can continue to support its business and dividend."", ""In all, it's a reliable way to add exposure to the volatile energy sector, which can provide valuable diversification for your portfolio. Although the stock is probably fully valued today, given its middle-of-the-road (historically speaking) 3.8% dividend yield, it would be a good stock to own even if you try to wait for a deeper pullback before buying it. In other words, keep an eye on it if even if you aren't willing to buy it today."", ""The big claim to fame for real estate investment trust (REIT) Federal Realty is that it has the longest dividend streak of any REIT. It's also a Dividend King, with 56 years of annual increases under its belt. The company's focus is well-located strip malls and mixed-use developments. Unlike many of its closest peers, however, it has long focused on quality over quantity, owning only around 100 properties. They're very good properties, with higher average incomes and population counts within three miles of the property than its peers have."", ""What's really interesting here, however, is that Federal Realty doesn't really care what stores are in its properties, so long as they're doing well. The list shifts over time, as you might expect. So you can have exposure to the retail sector by owning Federal Realty without having to try to pick a retail winner, effectively placing all of your bets on one company. And you can collect a 4.4% dividend yield along the way. In fairness, the dividend yield has been much higher in the past, notably during recessions when investors tend to throw the baby out with the bathwater. So you might want to wait until there's a deep pullback before buying. But put it on your wishlist now so you actually pull the trigger when the opportunity to own it on the cheap arises again."", ""Procter & Gamble, ExxonMobil, and Federal Realty are all the types of stocks you cling to for life once you've added them to your portfolio. Right now, P&G and ExxonMobil seem at least reasonably priced if you don't mind paying full rate for a great company. Federal Realty is probably a little pricey. But even if you have a heavy value bias, you'll want to keep all three on your watch list. Every so often they do find themselves on the sale rack."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in ExxonMobil right now?', 'Before you buy stock in ExxonMobil, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and ExxonMobil wasn't one of them.

Because often, the purchase of stock is a sign that the buyer views it as undervalued. However, insiders are sometimes wrong, and we don't know the exact thinking behind their acquisitions."", 'While some insiders did sell some of their holdings in Sherwin-Williams, one lone insider trumped that with significant stock purchases. Namely, Chairman & CEO John Morikis out-laid US$1.0m for shares, at about US$232 per share. That can definitely be seen as a sign of conviction.', 'Along with the insider buying, another encouraging sign for Sherwin-Williams is that insiders, as a group, have a considerable shareholding. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$209m. This comes in at 0.3% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.', ""One positive for Sherwin-Williams is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. Better yet, insiders are significant shareholders, and have been buying more shares. That makes the company a prime candidate for your watchlist - and arguably a research priority. You still need to take note of risks, for example - Sherwin-Williams has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of."", ""Keen growth investors love to see insider buying.

The booze can also be sipped neat or over ice.', '“While the flavor may seem wacky, the collaboration has novelty value, and it is likely a lot of people will be interested enough to try it out,” said Neil Saunders, retail analyst and managing director at GlobalData Retail.

Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?"", ""Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about PepsiCo (PEP)."", 'PepsiCo currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 2.00, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 16 brokerage firms. An ABR of 2.00 indicates Buy.', 'Of the 16 recommendations that derive the current ABR, eight are Strong Buy, representing 50% of all recommendations.', 'Brokerage Recommendation Trends for PEP', 'Check price target & stock forecast for PepsiCo here>>>While the ABR calls for buying PepsiCo, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.', 'Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.', ""In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement."", ""Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision."", 'Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR', 'In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.', 'The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', ""It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them."", 'In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.', 'Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.', ""Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements."", 'Is PEP Worth Investing In?', 'In terms of earnings estimate revisions for PepsiCo, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0% over the past month to $7.55.', ""Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term."", ""The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for PepsiCo.

Based on this payment, the dividend yield on the company's stock will be 2.8%, which is an attractive boost to shareholder returns."", ""While the dividend yield is important for income investors, it is also important to consider any large share price moves, as this will generally outweigh any gains from distributions. Investors will be pleased to see that Gap's stock price has increased by 94% in the last 3 months, which is good for shareholders and can also explain a decrease in the dividend yield."", ' View our latest analysis for Gap ', ""A big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. Based on the last payment, Gap's profits didn't cover the dividend, but the company was generating enough cash instead. Healthy cash flows are always a positive sign, especially when they quite easily cover the dividend."", 'According to analysts, EPS should be several times higher next year. If recent patterns in the dividend continue, we could see the payout ratio reaching 34% which is fairly sustainable.', ""The company's dividend history has been marked by instability, with at least one cut in the last 10 years. The most recent annual payment of $0.60 is about the same as the annual payment 10 years ago. The dividend has seen some fluctuations in the past, so even though the dividend was raised this year, we should remember that it has been cut in the past."", ""With a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share is growing, which could point to a growing dividend in the future. Gap's EPS has fallen by approximately 45% per year during the past five years. Such rapid declines definitely have the potential to constrain dividend payments if the trend continues into the future. However, the next year is actually looking up, with earnings set to rise. We would just wait until it becomes a pattern before getting too excited."", ""In summary, while it's good to see that the dividend hasn't been cut, we are a bit cautious about Gap's payments, as there could be some issues with sustaining them into the future.

If you want to skip our overview of the stock market and the latest news, then you can take a look at 5 A-Rated Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On. ', 'The stock market is made of thousands of companies whose shares trade hands daily. These trades are based on information or other signals that make investors buy or sell the stocks. The volume of data that is available to the retail investor, coupled with complex financial terms makes investing appear daunting.', ""This is particularly true in today's market environment which is markedly different from what investors were used to before the 2019 coronavirus pandemic. Back then, interest rates were low and investors had easy access to capital for their investments. Similarly, firms found it easier to grow as low rates meant that not only could they easily raise capital for expansion but their products also found willing buyers."", 'However, just four years later, the market is quite different. Now, even as indexes such as the NASDAQ Composite and the S&P 500 have managed to post gains, the broader economic climate makes investing trickier. Multi decade high interest rates have ensured that only the best companies can keep their balance sheets healthy. They have also provided potential stock market investors with alternatives to park their money, and also shaken the valuations of stocks. Stock valuations factor in interest rates as a loss of interest through stable investments such as ten year U.S. government bonds are often the opportunity cost of investing capital in a company.', ""Now, with 2024 coming to an end, investors are finding more reasons to be optimistic than not. This is because it appears that the Federal Reserve might not have a choice when it comes to reducing interest rates in 2024. So far, the central bank has pumped up rates to 5.25% to curtail inflation, and economic data released in November and December 2023 has provided hints that inflation is on a downward trend. At the same time, the key worry that high rates might tip America into a recession might not bear fruit either. The Fed, throughout its interest rate hiking cycle, has hoped that instead of falling into a recession, the economy will undergo what is called a 'Soft Landing.' A soft landing is when economic growth slows down but does not enter into negative territory. Given the pace and scale of the interest rate hikes, a soft landing is the best case scenario for stock market bulls and recent data shows that it might actually materialize."", ""For instance, the Labor Department's data for the non farm jobs market released in December 2023 shows that the economy added 199,000 jobs in November while the unemployment rate stood at 3.7%. Both these figures are important, since the number of jobs added in November outpaced the 150,000 jobs added in October. Similarly, the unemployment rate dropped from 3.9% showing that the labor market continues to improve. This data set supports the soft landing narrative because it shows that despite painfully high interest rates, companies continued to expand their hiring. More hiring leads to more output and is good for economic growth. On the flip side, had the job market contracted, i.e. the unemployment rate grew and the number of jobs added fell, then investors would have worried that the first signs of an economic slowdown were approaching. This could have made them panic, leading to the stock market trading lower and safe haven assets such as the U.S. dollar rising."", 'However, in reality, since the jobs report was robust, investors responded by betting in the opposite direction. After the report was released, the S&P 500 index and the NASDAQ closed at 4,604 and 14,403, respectively to mark their highest readings since March 2022 and April 2022. This bit is important, as while markets have had somewhat of a good year in 2023 mostly due to the boom in technology and artificial intelligence, they are yet to retake their 2021 close levels. The indexes effectively reversed all losses since the first quarter of 2023 provides early hints about investor hopes for the future, and if the data continues to walk a fine rope, then this strong performance can extend into the future as well.', ""At the same time, a strong labor market report also allows the Fed to keep rates higher for longer. It shows that the labor market continues to be robust, and if not closely monitored, then it can end up feeding into inflation to undo all the work done to bring down inflation. These worries are also on economists and analysts minds. For instance, here's what Stuart Cole, the head macro economist at Equiti Capital had to say to Reuters:"", '""Today’s employment report has come in hotter than expected, with the payrolls number and monthly average earnings figure printing above expectations and the unemployment rate unexpectedly falling. The picture being painted as far as the Fed is concerned will likely be one of a labour market that remains strong and showing no real signs yet of buckling under the weight of the interest rates rises that it has so far delivered.""', '""The drop in the unemployment rate in particular will assuage any concerns of a recession, and with payrolls and earnings both rising it keeps the ‘soft landing’ narrative very much in the ascendancy.""', '""The report will likely see some of those forecasting an early Fed cut next year re-evaluating their positions, and unless we get a surprisingly large fall in the CPI numbers next week, those Q1 rate cut expectations will probably now be priced out.""', ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at some A-rated stocks that billionaires are buying.
