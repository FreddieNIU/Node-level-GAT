While this fund is not tracked by the Zacks Mutual Fund Rank, we were able to examine other factors like performance, volatility, and cost.History of Fund/ManagerSchwab Funds is based in San Francisco, CA, and is the manager of SNXFX. The Schwab 1000 Index made its debut in April of 1991 and SNXFX has managed to accumulate roughly $11.89 billion in assets, as of the most recently available information. The fund is currently managed by a team of investment professionals.PerformanceObviously, what investors are looking for in these funds is strong performance relative to their peers. This fund has delivered a 5-year annualized total return of 10.83%, and it sits in the middle third among its category peers. But if you are looking for a shorter time frame, it is also worth looking at its 3-year annualized total return of 13.9%, which places it in the middle third during this time-frame.When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. Over the past three years, SNXFX's standard deviation comes in at 18.37%, compared to the category average of 20.91%. The standard deviation of the fund over the past 5 years is 19.06% compared to the category average of 18.86%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.Risk FactorsThe fund has a 5-year beta of 1.02, so investors should note that it is hypothetically as volatile as the market at large. Because alpha represents a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark, which is the S&amp;P 500 in this case, one should pay attention to this metric as well. SNXFX's 5-year performance has produced a negative alpha of -0.68, which means managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns.Story continuesHoldingsExamining the equity holdings of a mutual fund is also a valuable exercise. This can show us how the manager is applying their stated methodology, as well as if there are any inherent biases in their approach. For this particular fund, the focus is largely on equities that are traded in the United States.Currently, this mutual fund is holding 98.85% stock in stocks, which have an average market capitalization of $231.90 billion. The fund has the heaviest exposure to the following market sectors:TechnologyFinanceTurnover is about 2%, so those in charge of the fund make fewer trades than comparable funds.ExpensesFor investors, taking a closer look at cost-related metrics is key, since costs are increasingly important for mutual fund investing. Competition is heating up in this space, and a lower cost product will likely outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, all things being equal. In terms of fees, SNXFX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.05% compared to the category average of 0.79%. So, SNXFX is actually cheaper than its peers from a cost perspective.This fund requires a minimum initial investment of $0, while there is no minimum for each subsequent investment.Bottom LineDon't stop here for your research on Mutual Fund Equity Report funds. We also have plenty more on our site in order to help you find the best possible fund for your portfolio.

It has amassed assets over $4.85 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs in the Broad Developed Market ETFs. FNDE, before fees and expenses, seeks to match the performance of the Russell RAFI Emerging Markets Large Co. Index (Net).The Russell RAFI Emerging Markets Large Company Index (Net) ranks companies in the Russell Emerging Markets Index by measures of fundamental size and tracks the performance of those companies whose fundamental scores are in the top 87.5% of the Russell Emerging Markets Index.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesCost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins if all other fundamentals are the same.With on par with most peer products in the space, this ETF has annual operating expenses of 0.39%.Story continuesThe fund has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 5.21%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.When you look at individual holdings, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing accounts for about 4.16% of the fund's total assets, followed by China Construction Bank Corp H and Hon Hai Precision Industry Ltd.The top 10 holdings account for about 25.39% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskThe ETF return is roughly 7.22% so far this year and it's up approximately 0.63% in the last one year (as of 06/06/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $23.19 and $27.76.The ETF has a beta of 0.76 and standard deviation of 17.59% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 396 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab Fundamental Emerging Markets Large Company Index ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Broad Developed Market ETFs segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.IShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (IEMG) tracks MSCI Emerging Markets Investable Market Index and the Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (VWO) tracks FTSE Emerging Markets All Cap China A Inclusion Index. IShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF has $70.36 billion in assets, Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF has $71.66 billion. IEMG has an expense ratio of 0.09% and VWO charges 0.08%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Broad Developed Market ETFs.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In 2022, dividends, value, and low-volatility strategies provided protection during the bear market in global equities. However, the situation has reversed in 2023.Quality-focused factor investing and ETFs targeting quality dividends have performed relatively better than strategies focused on dividend growth and high yield. Investments excluding AI, tech, growth, high beta, or mega-caps have struggled to keep pace.Lets’ consider dividend ETFs as a reliable investment option in an unpredictable year. These include Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF VIG, Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF SCHD, iShares Select Dividend ETF DVY, SPDR S&amp;P Dividend ETF SDY and ProShares S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF NOBL.Why Have Investors Turned Away From Dividend Stocks?As reported by TheStreet, technology stocks continued to thrive all throughout May, overshadowing other sectors. Due to its association with the tech sector, communications services got a boost. Consumer discretionary benefited from investor enthusiasm toward growth stocks. However, all other sectors significantly lagged the S&amp;P 500 Index.Investors are captivated by the potential of AI to lower expenses and elevate product offerings, fueling visions of a remarkable technology supercycle. Microsoft, a ChatGPT investor, has witnessed a 38% surge in its shares in 2023, while Nvidia has soared approximately 166%, as optimism grows around increased demand for its chips driven by AI, propelling the company to the trillion-dollar market capitalization club.Currently, investor focus is solely on AI and stocks poised to capitalize on this expanding trend. Market sentiment appears to be driven by a sense of mania, suggesting that these stocks may continue their upward trajectory before potentially experiencing a significant correction later in the year.Is This a Good Time to Bet on Dividend Funds?The current year poses challenges for investors. The stock market has the potential to rebound strongly and experience a remarkable rally. However, the persistence of high interest rates and lingering inflation may collaborate to exert downward pressure on stock prices.Story continuesIn a gradually unfolding recessionary climate and an uncertain economic environment, dividend ETFs often serve as a reliable choice. However, it is important to note that the turnaround may take some time to materialize.The current uncertainty surrounding AI laws and regulations, coupled with the potential for AI hype-induced market fluctuations, makes it wise to consider the benefits of investing in dividend-paying stocks and funds. By focusing on this theme, investors can safeguard their capital and enjoy stability through consistent pay-outs.Mature companies, less susceptible to market swings, offer an added layer of protection. Embracing dividend-paying funds as a strategy can acts as a hedge against economic uncertainty and provides downside protectionETFs in FocusNow, let's dive deeper into the specifics of the above mentioned ETFs:Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG)Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF closely tracks the performance of the S&amp;P U.S. Dividend Growers Index, which consists of common stocks of companies that have a record of increasing dividends over time.With a basket of 314 securities the fund has a major allocation to the information technology, financials and health-care sectors with each having a share of 20.49%, 17.99% and 16.3%, respectively.With a dividend yield of 1.98%, the fund charges an annual fee of 0.06%.

4,e2f074dd-bedf-3a93-9a00-fb1419c1bafb,TXN,2023-06-06,3 Semiconductor Stocks to Buy (and Never Sell),InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-semiconductor-stocks-buy-never-133433380.html,1685453673,STORY,"['NVDA', 'TSM', 'TXN', 'MPWR']","[Recently, semiconductor stocks surged dramatically. Outstanding earnings and promising forecasts from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) sparked this rally, leading to a stellar week for the sector. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NYSEARCA:SMH), a key industry indicator, jumped over 11% in a single week.Looking closer, three standout semiconductor stocks emerge for future investment. These stocks have shown incredible growth historically, and they’re poised for more. Strong business models equip them to capitalize on the booming chip stock market throughout the 2020s and beyond.Now, let’s shine a light on these promising stocks. They have proven their worth in the past, and their sturdy business strategies suggest a readiness to leverage the escalating chip industry demand. It’s time to examine these powerhouses closely. Each one is a strong contender for the top semiconductor stock of the future.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM)Taiwan Semiconductor, TSMC (TSM) on phone screen stock image.Source: sdx15 / Shutterstock.comTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) is the dominant semiconductor foundry company worldwide. And its leadership continues to grow. TSM’s market share has risen from just under 50% a few years ago to 58% at the end of 2022. The next closest competitor, Samsung Electronics, has just 16% market share.So, what does this imply in real-world terms? Essentially, TSM stands as the giant in chip manufacturing. Given that not all semiconductor companies own their manufacturing facilities, they resort to outsourcing their production requirements to a foundry. Here’s where TSM steps in. Commanding the majority of this business, TSM captures the lion’s share of revenues and profits from the physical production of semiconductor chips.Fundamentally, TSM operates with platform neutrality. Essentially, the dominant semiconductor brand in the chip market doesn’t notably affect TSM’s operations. Regardless of the victor, TSM remains consistently involved, assembling chips for all players.Story continuesActing as the quintessential ‘picks and shovels’ player in the semiconductor industry, TSM is strategically positioned. With the industry booming, TSM is set to reap the benefits. Thus, irrespective of which way the market sways, TSM stands on solid ground, ready to capitalize on industry growth.Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR)Close-up Presentation of a New Generation Microchip. Gloved Hand Holding Piece of Technological Wonder. Semiconductor stocks are in the news.Source: ShutterstockMonolithic Power Systems (NASDAQ:MPWR) is one of the most fascinating companies in the semiconductor industry. It began by making low-end chips for a variety of consumer electronics applications. Over the years, it has shrewdly reinvested its profits to broaden its product lines and move into higher end categories of the chip industry.Primarily, the company’s unwavering emphasis on R&amp;D and organic product development has reaped considerable benefits. In effect, this approach has yielded unique products that have found utility across a broad spectrum of markets. Consequently, the firm enjoys a diversified market presence, thanks to its product differentiation strategy. MPWR stock has delivered shareholders jaw-dropping returns, rising from $10 in 2004 to more than $500 today.A key element of Monolithic’s success is its fab-less manufacturing model. This allows the company to be capital-light and deliver larger returns to shareholders. Monolithic’s recent innovations in the power management space, in particular, have allowed it to develop chips that are both smaller and more energy efficient than competitors.Also, of note, Monolithic has significant exposure to the data center market. Nvidia’s recent earnings report was spectacular in large part due to a great acceleration of demand in the data center space. Monolithic should enjoy a similar tailwind. Indeed, MPWR stock jumped last week following the Nvidia news, but shares should have farther to run in coming weeks and months. And, over the longer-term, Monolithic’s track record speaks for itself.Texas Instruments (TXN)Texas Instruments logo on its world headquarters located in Dallas, Texas.Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comTexas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) is the largest player in the analog category of semiconductors. Analog chips are important because they convert real-world observations such as meteorological information into data that machines can interpret.Certainly, analog chips are critical in various sectors. Specifically, they strengthen security and facilitate remote monitoring. Not to mention, they play a crucial role in smart cars and industrial automation. What’s more, these chips yield impressive profits. Plus, they have a longer lifespan than many other chips, ensuring more bang for the buck from research and development investments.Furthermore, Texas Instruments combines a great business with excellent capital allocation. Management has focused its whole strategy around increasing free cash flow per share. This, in turn, is used to buy back stock and increase the company’s dividend each and every year.Reflecting on the past two decades, TXN stock has exhibited remarkable growth. When you factor in dividends, it’s delivered a whopping total return of over 700%. Looking ahead, given the escalating demand for analog semiconductors, the future certainly appears bright for TXN’s shareholders.

UNM's PEG has been as high as 1.03 and as low as 0.42, with a median of 0.54, all within the past year.Another valuation metric that we should highlight is UNM's P/B ratio of 0.93. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks attractive against its industry's average P/B of 1.65. UNM's P/B has been as high as 1.06 and as low as 0.62, with a median of 0.88, over the past year.Value investors also use the P/S ratio. The P/S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. UNM has a P/S ratio of 0.73. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.17.Story continuesFinally, investors should note that UNM has a P/CF ratio of 5.32. This figure highlights a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find firms that are undervalued when considering their impressive cash outlook. UNM's current P/CF looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 6.70. UNM's P/CF has been as high as 6.70 and as low as 4.71, with a median of 5.62, all within the past year.These are just a handful of the figures considered in Unum Group's great Value grade. Still, they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment. Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook, and we can clearly see that UNM is an impressive value stock right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

AIG, Unum Group UNM, EnerSys ENS, Koppers Holdings Inc. KOP and UFP Industries, Inc. UFPI.5 Value Stocks With Impressive EV-to-EBITDA Ratios to Snap UpThe price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple enjoys wide-scale popularity among investors seeking stocks trading at a bargain. In addition to being a widely used tool for screening stocks, P/E is a popular metric to work out the fair market value of a firm. But even this ubiquitously used valuation multiple has a few limitations.Although P/E enjoys great popularity among value investors, a less-used and more-complicated metric called EV-to-EBITDA is sometimes viewed as a better alternative. EV-to-EBITDA gives the true picture of a company’s valuation and earnings potential. It has a more comprehensive approach to valuation. American International Group, Inc., Unum Group, EnerSys, Koppers Holdings Inc. and UFP Industries, Inc. are some stocks with attractive EV-to-EBITDA ratios.Is EV-to-EBITDA a Better Substitute to P/E?EV-to-EBITDA is essentially the enterprise value (EV) of a stock divided by its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). EV is the sum of a company’s market capitalization, its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents.EBITDA, the other component of the multiple, gives a better idea of a company’s profitability as it removes the impact of non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that reduce net earnings. It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows.Just like P/E, the lower the EV-to-EBITDA ratio, the more attractive it is. A low EV-to-EBITDA ratio could signal that a stock is potentially undervalued. EV-to-EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company’s balance sheet that the P/E ratio does not. Due to this reason, EV-to-EBITDA is generally used to value the potential acquisition targets as it shows the amount of debt the acquirer has to assume. Stocks boasting a low EV-to-EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates.Story continuesAnother shortcoming of P/E is that it can’t be used to value a loss-making firm. A company’s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. On the other hand, EV-to-EBITDA is difficult to manipulate and can also be used to value companies making losses but are EBITDA-positive.EV-to-EBITDA is also a useful tool in measuring the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation. Moreover, it can be used to compare companies with different levels of debt.However, EV-to-EBITDA is not devoid of shortcomings and alone cannot conclusively determine a stock’s inherent potential and future performance. The multiple varies across industries and is usually not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries, given their diverse capital expenditure requirements.Therefore, instead of just relying on EV-to-EBITDA, you can club it with the other major ratios such as price-to-book (P/B), P/E and price-to-sales (P/S), to achieve the desired results.Here are our five picks out of the seven stocks that passed the screen:American International Group is a leading global insurance organization, providing a wide range of property casualty insurance, life insurance, retirement solutions, and other financial services.

8,316a279e-5569-3527-ae50-87ded3d39932,TMO,2023-06-06,Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.'s (NYSE:TMO) Fundamentals Look Pretty Strong: Could The Market Be Wrong About The Stock?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thermo-fisher-scientific-inc-nyse-120032760.html,1686052832,STORY,['TMO'],"[It is hard to get excited after looking at Thermo Fisher Scientific's (NYSE:TMO) recent performance, when its stock has declined 5.5% over the past three months. But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. Specifically, we decided to study Thermo Fisher Scientific's  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. Check out our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Thermo Fisher Scientific is:14% = US$6.0b ÷ US$42b (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.14 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Thermo Fisher Scientific's Earnings Growth And 14% ROETo start with, Thermo Fisher Scientific's ROE looks acceptable. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 14%. This certainly adds some context to Thermo Fisher Scientific's exceptional 24% net income growth seen over the past five years. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.Story continuesWe then performed a comparison between Thermo Fisher Scientific's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 24% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. If you're wondering about Thermo Fisher Scientific's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is Thermo Fisher Scientific Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Thermo Fisher Scientific's ' three-year median payout ratio is on the lower side at 5.8% implying that it is retaining a higher percentage (94%) of its profits. So it looks like Thermo Fisher Scientific is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business, which shows in its earnings growth.Moreover, Thermo Fisher Scientific is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 4.9% of its profits over the next three years. Still, forecasts suggest that Thermo Fisher Scientific's future ROE will rise to 23% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with Thermo Fisher Scientific's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

12,783dd170-a66b-32b0-96fd-043ff14175e9,EW,2023-06-06,Here's Why You Should Invest in Edward Lifesciences (EW) Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-invest-edward-lifesciences-112600789.html,1685964360,STORY,"['EW', 'HOLX', 'ZBH']","[Edwards Lifesciences Corporation EW is gaining investors’ confidence, backed by the performance of the Surgical Structural Heart business. In the first quarter, the Critical Care segment witnessed balanced contributions from all product lines.The company continued to successfully deliver on its strategy and achieve milestones in pursuit of the significant opportunity to transform care for a large number of patients with mitral and tricuspid disease. However, mounting expenses and an unfavorable foreign currency impact are worrisome.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has decreased 11.5% against the 2.6% rise of the industry and a 4.2% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned global medical device company has a market capitalization of $51.73 billion. Edward Lifesciences has an earnings yield of 2.99% compared to the industry’s -6.92%. EW’s earnings surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in one, delivering an average surprise of 1.24%.Let’s delve deeper.UpsidesSurgical Structural Heart Looks Promising: In the first quarter, Edward Lifesciences’ Surgical Structural Heart business improved on a constant-currency basis, driven by the penetration of its premium products across all regions. The valve surgery growth was higher than the company’s expectations as hospital staffing levels improved, leading to some catch-up in procedures.The RESILIA portfolio continues to hold strong momentum globally. In addition, the company began the enrolment of its MOMENTIS clinical trial to demonstrate the durability of RESILIA in the mitral position. The increased adoption of the MITRIS Valve in the United States is encouraging.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCritical Care Business Holds Potential: In the first quarter, Critical Care sales growth was led by the Smart Recovery portfolio and the strong adoption of the Acumen IQ sensor and finger cuff featuring a unique Hypotension Prediction Index algorithm. The demand for Swan-Ganz pulmonary artery catheters and the HemoSphere monitoring platform also remained strong in the first quarter.Story continuesThe company remains excited about its pipeline of Critical Care innovations as it continues to shift its focus to Smart Recovery technologies designed to help clinicians make better decisions and get patients home to their families faster.TMTT (Transcatheter Mitral and Tricuspid Therapies) Stands Strong: In the first quarter, the segment’s performance was driven by overall transcatheter edge-to-edge repair procedure growth. The ongoing launch and the growing adoption of PASCAL Precision in Europe and the initial launch in the United States also contributed to the segment’s sales. Clinician feedback on PASCAL Precision has been consistently positive, particularly highlighting the differentiated premium features of the system.In mitral, Edwards Lifesciences looks forward to presenting one-year data from the full cohort of the CLASP IID pivotal trial later in 2023. In mitral replacement, the enrollment of the ENCIRCLE pivotal trial with SAPIEN M3 is anticipated to complete the enrollment of the main cohort around the end of 2023.Within tricuspid, FDA recently approved continued access allowing domestic hospitals involved in the clinical trial to continue to offer EVOQUE as a therapy option. In addition, the CLASP II TR pivotal trial with PASCAL continues to enroll well.DownsidesForeign Exchange Headwinds: We remain worried about the significant challenges Edward Lifesciences had to face due to an unfavorable foreign currency impact that has been adversely affecting the company’s gross margin over the past few quarters. Per management, significant currency fluctuations could have a material effect on revenues, the cost of sales and operational results.Escalated Expenses: The contraction of both the margins in the first quarter is discouraging. A year-over-year increase in SG&amp;A expenses reflected increased investments over the prior year in transcatheter field-based personnel to support the growth strategy. For the full-year 2023, EW expects R&amp;D expenses to be 17%-18% of sales, with investments in developing new technologies and generating evidence to support TAVR and TMTT.Estimate TrendEdward Lifesciences has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings per share (EPS) has moved up from $2.54 to $2.55 in the past 30 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $5.96 billion. This suggests a 10.7% rise from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Zimmer Biomet ZBH, Penumbra PEN and Hologic, Inc.

For more stocks, head on over to 5 High Quality S&amp;P 500 Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On.As the first half of 2023 comes to an end, the primary concern on anyone's mind is whether there will be a recession this year. Courtesy of modern day data collection and analysis capabilities, policymakers are able to have some insight into how the economy is performing to tailor their decisions accordingly. And this data is crucial in enabling the Federal Reserve to decide whether it will further increase interest rates or consider pausing and gradually bringing them down.On this front, June started with a crucial data reading from the Labor Department. This revealed that the labor market remained strong and added 339,000 jobs in May. This indicates that despite the record interest rate hikes by the Fed, the economy remains resilient - lending credence to speculation that perhaps more interest rate increases might be on the cards. However, for the interest rate bears, the unemployment rate also increased by 0.3% to sit at 3.7% - the largest jump since the start of the coronavirus pandemic's economic disruption in April 2020.So what does this mean for the stock market? In more normal times, a potential economic slowdown would lead to the stock market dropping as well - but the contrarian nature of the two primary metrics within this report made studying the immediate impact on the market even more interesting. Overall, markets reacted positively, as the NASDAQ index rose by 1%, the S&amp;P 500 by 1.45%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) by 2.12%. This indicated that investors had taken the rise in unemployment and a reduction in wage growth as the primary takeaway from the labor report, using these to form opinions that believe that the Fed will not deliver an interest rate hike late this month.Story continuesHowever, the jobs report is only one part of the Fed's decision making process. An equally important metric is the inflation report that will come out on the same day the Fed officials will meet to set the policy rate. And while there are few estimates available as to what might happen later this month, there are other metrics that point at the consumer and broader economic sentiment. One such metric is the Consumer Confidence Index which aims to look at household expectations of their financial situations for the near future. This index dropped to 102.3 in May from 103.7 in April as the broader gloom about the debt ceiling standoff between Congress and the President weighed on consumers' minds. At the same time, long term inflation expectations also dropped and stood at 6.1% for the next twelve months as they marked a new low since January 2021.Speaking of which, it's not only the households that believe inflation will come down. The two-year breakeven inflation (BEI) rate for inflation protection bonds dropped below 2% in May for the first time in years, indicating that bond investors believe that inflation will fall below this rate in the coming years as well. This is in strong contrast to a reading of 3% for the start of 2023. Finally, Fed Funds Futures pricing data gathered through the CME FedWatch Tool shows that there is a 75% probability that interest rates will remain unchanged this month. However, this might make for some early optimism since the picture changes when we consider the outlook for July. For July, there is a 53.5% probability that the Fed will deliver a 25 basis point hike.So how is this choppy environment making an impact on investment managers? Well, on this front, the management of Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) shared some insights at the bank's earnings call for the first quarter of 2023 where they outlined:Overall margin in the Wealth Management business was 26%, impacted by modest increases in credit reserves, slightly lower growth of NII versus forecast and ongoing integration expenses. We continue to focus on the levers within our control with an eye towards expense management. In ISG, underwriting and M&amp;A remain very subdued. As I have said previously, these are revenues delayed, not dead. Already, we are seeing a growing M&amp;A pipeline and some spring-like signs of new issuance emerging. That said, it largely remains a back half 2023 and full year 2024 story.On the positive side, our fixed income and equity trading teams performed very well in managing through some historic rate moves.Total trading revenues were solid. I expect the markets to remain choppy through this earnings season and for the next several months. However, absent any geopolitical surprise or limited progress on bringing down inflation, I think 2023 is likely to end on a constructive note in most areas. Morgan Stanley is very well positioned not just for 2023, but for several years ahead as we see significant growth opportunities across all three of our client platforms.I will now pass it over to Sharon for more details on the first quarter. Sharon Yeshaya Thank you, and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $14.5 billion in the first quarter, our EPS was $1.70, and our ROTCE was 16.9%. The firm’s results demonstrated the durability of our business model, evidenced by the resilient ROTCE, robust asset consolidation and wealth and our stable capital and liquidity levels.In institutional securities, fixed income and equity supported our clients while navigating volatile markets. Wealth Management showcased $110 billion of net new assets and investment management continued to benefit from the investments we have made to diversify our offerings.With these details in mind, let's take a look at the top S&amp;P 500 stocks that have found favor among billionaires, as the index and the individuals represent the best of both worlds, particularly in this uncertain economic environment.

Click to skip ahead and see Billionaire Bridgewater Founder Ray Dalio’s Top 5 Holdings in 2023.McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) are three of the top holdings in billionaire money manager Ray Dalio’s consumer-focused 13F portfolio.Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates has been the most successful fund in history in terms of net dollar gains since inception, delivering $52.2 billion in gains through the end of 2021 according to research conducted by LCH Investments. The fund continued to roll last year even in the midst of Dalio stepping down in October, as the Pure Alpha strategy returned 9.5%.Bridgewater has undertaken several initiatives under new chief executive Nir Bar Dea, including slashing 8% of its workforce and capping investments in its flagship fund as it looks to reallocate resources and restructure. Among other things, Bar Dea plans to invest heavily in Bridgewater’s AI and machine learning capabilities.Meanwhile, Dalio continues to expand his family office, which manages the billionaire’s greater than $16 billion in personal wealth, as well as his philanthropic donations. The Dalio Family Office’s newest branch is planned for Abu Dhabi, where it will work alongside the firm’s existing branches in Singapore and the United States.Dalio gave the recently agreed-upon debt-ceiling deal a D grade in a tweet on Twitter, adding that it was about the best that could be expected but simply wasn’t good enough. In a LinkedIn post published in May, Dalio warned that the U.S. faces a disastrous financial collapse if it continues to raise the debt ceiling without any meaningful limit being put in place.Dalio also engaged in a recent conversation of sorts with the AI chat platform ChatGPT as he relayed in a YouTube video posted in the middle of April. ChatGPT wondered what the most important investing-related lesson is that Dalio learned throughout his storied career, to which the Bridgewater founder responded that diversification was the “Holy Grail” of investing. Dalio added that by investing in 10 to 15 good, uncorrelated assets, an investor can reduce their risk by about 80% without impacting their potential returns.Story continuesIn the first quarter, Bridgewater Associates made significant adjustments to its 13F portfolio, selling off 228 of its former holdings while adding just 118 new positions in their place. The firm also trimmed the size of far more holdings than it was adding to. Of particular note was Bridgewater’s exposure to the finance sector, which was lowered by 330 basis points to 23%. In response, Bridgewater’s exposure to healthcare and communications stocks was raised by a combined 371 basis points. Bridgewater’s 13F portfolio dropped to $16.4 billion in assets as of the end of March, down from $18.3 billion at the end of 2022.Amid a turbulent quarter, the first full one in which Nir Bar Dea was at the helm of Dalio’s iconic firm, let’s take a look at the top ten holdings of the fund in 2023.Billionaire Bridgewater Founder Ray Dalio’s Top 10 Holdings in 2023Ray Dalio of Bridgewater AssociatesOur MethodologyThe following data is gathered from Bridgewater Associates’ latest 13F filing with the SEC. We follow hedge funds like Bridgewater Associates because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q1 2023 reporting period.Billionaire Bridgewater Founder Ray Dalio’s Top 10 Holdings in 202310. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $223 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 174 The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are a few of the longtime favorite top holdings of Bridgewater founder and CIO Ray Dalio. A newer addition to a top 10 spot among his holdings is Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), after Dalio grew his stake in the company by nearly 150% during Q3 of 2022. In the first quarter of this year he boosted the size of his V stake by another 19%, ending Q1 with 990,819 shares.Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) has broadly outperformed the S&amp;P 500 over the last decade and could very well do so in the decade to come. The credit card payments processor is still growing revenue at a low-double digit rate and has several tailwinds at its back that could allow it to continue doing for the foreseeable future. Chief among those tailwinds are the continued rise in the global penetration of credit cards and ecommerce’s growing share of global sales. And both of those tailwinds have plenty of room to run yet. As such, Visa shares are currently trading at somewhat of a premium at 29.5x earnings.Polen Global Growth Strategy shared some of the fundamental strengths that Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) enjoys in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“We trimmed Mastercard and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) to equal weights of the Portfolio. Mastercard and Visa operate as a duopoly in a large and growing market. Over the last 50 years, global personal consumer expenditures (PCE) has grown 7-9% annualized. We expect 4-5% long-term PCE growth going forward. Additionally, the shift from cash to credit continues unabated, with a total credit penetration of only approximately 50% globally.3 This shift provides Visa and Mastercard with another ~4-6% of growth. When combined with PCE, this gives both companies high-single-digit to low-double[1]digit revenue growth opportunities. This growth estimate is before accounting for growth amplifiers like the acceleration of e[1]commerce, the shift from offline to online, and additional services. Both companies enjoy extremely strong network effects that provide strong competitive advantages.We have trimmed Visa and Mastercard because their combined weight grew to over 12% of the Global Growth Portfolio because of their recent performance and to fund our increase in Amazon’s position size. We added to both positions when their prices were depressed due to cross-border transactions deteriorating materially from the pandemic. Cross-border volumes came roaring back when travel corridors reopened, and although we are several quarters removed from the cross-border nadir, Visa still grew volumes &gt;30% in 1Q23. Total cross-border volumes are now 132% of 2019 levels. At 4.5% each, both companies remain high conviction positions for Global Growth.”9. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $239 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 204 (GOOG), 155 (GOOGL) Bridgewater CIO Ray Dalio was bullish on Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) during Q1 after shares hit a two-year low at the end of 2022. Dalio more than tripled the size of his stake in Alphabet’s class A (GOOGL) shares during the quarter, holding just under 2.31 million of them at the end of March. GOOGL shares are having a much better 2023 so far, gaining 37%.As Baron Opportunity Fund discusses below, one of the biggest worries investors have about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) right now is how its search engine traffic will hold up against the rise of ChatGPT, which has already had 1.6 billion visitors. When users want general information on certain topics, they may be increasingly likely to seek out quick answers from the AI platform rather than wade through pages of search results (and ads), which frequently contain links to outdated or even irrelevant content. While Google plans to eventually release its own competing AI platform, if anything that will just further cannibalize its own search engine and eat into its ad revenue.Baron Opportunity Fund continues to lower its exposure to Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) given some of those worries, as it revealed in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“As we did last quarter, we continued to decrease our weighting in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) because, as stated earlier, we believe ChatGPT and/or similar AI-based services present a hard-to-measure risk to Google’s virtual search monopoly.”8. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $259 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 69 There’s been a 23% rise in hedge fund ownership of Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) over the past two quarters, with the stock sitting near its all-time high in smart money shareholders. Bridgewater Associates pared back its SBUX holding by 5% during the first quarter to 2.49 million shares.Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) continues to expand its global footprint, with plans to grow its store count to 45,000 within the next two years, which would double its store count since 2015. Starbucks plans to open about one-third of those new stores in China, where it’s understandably been facing headwinds of late, but the long-term opportunity there is tremendous. SBUX shares have dipped by 13% since the company’s latest earnings report in early May, driving their price down to 32.2x earnings, which looks reasonable.The Polen Global Growth Strategy isn’t as bullish on Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) as Bridgewater’s Ray Dalio, as it sold off its stake in the company in Q4 according to its Q4 2022 investor letter:“We also liquidated our remaining position in Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX). While the company remains a unique and resilient franchise, China is a very important growth market for the company, and zero-COVID policies have made it challenging for the company to operate in this important market. While we expect China to return to more “normal” operation at some point, any COVID flare-ups, in China or other markets, present a very real headwind to Starbucks’ profitability. L’Oreal, Estée Lauder, and other holdings continue to have meaningful exposure to China, but in each of these cases, our research indicates they’re able to better adapt to these operating challenges and realize the growth opportunity in China through their online businesses. In short, we think there are better risk-reward opportunities.”7. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $394 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 92 There was a massive spike in hedge fund ownership of Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) during Q1, as 37% more funds were long WMT at the end of Q1 than at the start of it. Louis Bacon’s Moore Global Investments and George Soros’ Soros Fund Management were among the funds adding Walmart to their 13F portfolios. On the other hand, Bridgewater’s Ray Dalio offloaded 22% of his Walmart shares during the quarter, ending March with 2.67 million of them.Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) grew e-commerce sales by 26% during the first quarter of its fiscal year 2024, while overall sales rose by 7.7% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Operating cash flow also rebounded to $4.6 billion in the quarter from a loss of $3.8 billion a year earlier.After buying back about $10 billion worth of its shares in FY 2023, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) scaled back to just $700 million in repurchases in the latest quarter. The company still has $18.6 billion remaining on its share repurchase authorization, which would buy back close to 5% of its outstanding shares.6. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $428 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 63 Closing out the first half of Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio’s top holdings in 2023 is Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), ranking sixth. The billionaire money manager trimmed his stake in the wholesale retailer by 9% during Q1, ending the quarter with 861,306 shares. He owned the largest COST position among the select group of hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey’s database.Hedge funds and analysts love Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) for its staunchly loyal customer base and its strong value proposition. Truist has a $568 price target on the stock and believes the tougher economic conditions will allow Costco to further grow its membership and gain market share. Deutsche Bank has a $574 target on COST shares.Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) has been experiencing some weakness in its discretionary categories, which led to soft March sales and negative comps for the first time in nearly seven years, excluding the pandemic. It’s likely that weakness was felt broadly across retail however and wasn’t Costco specific. Overall March sales grew by 0.5% to $21.7 billion.PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) are three of Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio’s top 2023 holdings.

Such high occupancy rates imply stable revenue streams and suggest a robust tenant base.An important aspect to consider in evaluating CPT's growth is its new lease and renewal rates. From the first quarter to May 2023, the new lease rates have improved from 1.8% to 3.6%, including 2.7% in April. This increase indicates Camden's ability to attract new tenants, highlighting the competitive nature of its property portfolio. While renewal rates slightly dropped from 6.7% to 6% during the same period, they still represent a strong performance in tenant retention.Consequently, blended rates also saw an increase, moving up from 4% in the first quarter to 4.8% in May 2023. This increment signifies Camden's capacity to negotiate higher rents without significantly compromising its occupancy rates.In terms of effective rates — the change in rates when they become effective — the new lease rates improved from 1.7% to 3.4%, while renewal rates remained relatively stable, around 6-7%. Blended rates also showed an uptick, moving from 4.5% to 4.9%.ConclusionCamden Property Trust demonstrates a balanced approach to property management and growth. The consistently high occupancy rates, coupled with improved lease and renewal rates, point toward a solid operational model.Across the United States, Camden presently owns and manages 172 properties comprising 58,702 apartment homes. With six properties currently under development, once completed, Camden's portfolio will expand to a total of 60,652 apartment homes in 178 properties.Currently, Camden carries a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).

By the end of 2023, NCLH anticipates more than 20% of its fleet will have tested and operated on biodiesel blends.Investing in shore power: NCLH currently has 12 ships equipped with shore power capabilities which allows these ships to connect to onshore electrical power grids to supply much of the power needed while docked when available. The Company continues to invest in expanding this technology and expects to have approximately 60% of its fleet shore-power enabled by year-end 2023 and approximately 70% by year-end 2025.Sailing SafelyRobust public health program to protect guests, crew and communities we visit: NCLH operates a comprehensive 24/7/365 public health and safety program, working closely with health authorities around the world to implement and continuously improve policies and procedures that meet and, in many cases, exceed regulations. Crew members are also highly trained in the Company’s Outbreak Prevention and Response Plan, designed to mitigate, and help prevent the spread of communicable diseases.Continuous public health training and education: In partnership with representatives from various government agencies and suppliers, NCLH continues to host public health training through monthly online collaborations as well as annual in-person summits.Prioritized safety and security efforts: Utmost importance placed on safety and security at sea with third-party audits conducted regularly to verify compliance. Each ship also has a resident Safety Officer, with experience ranging between 10 and 15 years in various roles at sea, and ship crews participate in regular safety training, exercises and drills on board and shoreside.Empowering PeopleEnhanced employee benefits demonstrate commitment to team members: NCLH expanded its suite of employee benefits by adding new Family Care Benefits which provides fully paid maternity, paternity and adoption leave as well as family planning assistance for full-time U.S shoreside team members.Fostering inclusive workforce where diverse backgrounds are represented and empowered: Across NCLH’s global shoreside workforce, 61% of team members are female, including 47% of managers and above. In addition, across the U.S. shoreside workforce, 67% of team members were under-represented minorities, including 54% of managers and above. In 2023, the Company also appointed three new Presidents to lead its brands, all three of whom were internal and ethnically or gender diverse candidates, including the appointment of NCLH’s first female brand President, Andrea DeMarco, to lead Regent Seven Seas Cruises.Provided training and development opportunities across workforce: NCLH team members logged more than 800,000 hours of training and development across various roles and responsibilities, cementing the corporate philosophy to empower top talent and foster robust career development.Strengthening Our CommunitiesOngoing corporate efforts to philanthropic contributions: NCLH contributed more than $2 million in monetary and in-kind donations to nonprofit organizations around the world. This included over $300,000 donated to aid in disaster and crisis relief, including Hurricane Ian recovery efforts in Southwest Florida.Honoring the connection between travel and education: Each year, Norwegian Cruise Line’s Giving Joy program recognizes top educators for their unwavering commitment to inspiring students every day. In 2022, the Giving Joy program awarded 100 teachers across North America a free week-long cruise for two, valued at over $750,000 collectively, along with thousands of dollars in contributions from NCL and its partners to the schools of the top three grand prize winners.Offsetting Emissions and Supporting Communities through Carbon Offsets: NCLH has purchased 1.6 million carbon offsets to date contributing to 14 projects globally including in South Korea, Brazil and Turkey. The offsets purchased not only support the Company’s decarbonization journey but also invest in cleaner energy sources and local job creation in these communities.Operating with Integrity and AccountabilityTied ESG metric to compensation: The Board of Directors’ Compensation Committee approved the inclusion of an ESG metric for the first time as part of the 2022 short-term incentive (“STI”) and once again approved the inclusion of an ESG metric in 2023. This metric is tied to the progress made on NCLH’s GHG reduction goals and builds greater accountability across the Company to accelerate the progress on ESG goals.Fostering a culture of ethical conduct: NCLH continuously emphasizes the importance of ethical business practices and upholds all team members to a Code of Ethical Business Conduct which team members are required to review and certify on an annual basis.Committed to maintaining a strong board with diverse experiences and backgrounds: NCLH welcomed a new board member in 2022, Zillah Byng-Thorne. Zillah brings her extensive technology sector, digital media and e-commerce experience to the board. Currently, the board is approximately 50% diverse, including 37.5% female and 12.5% under-represented minorities, with an average tenure of 6.6 years.About Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.

That compares with a record 20.8 million bpd in 2005, according to EIA data going back to 1973.The market is also waiting for U.S. oil inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute (API), an industry group, at 4:30 p.m. EDT on Tuesday and the EIA at 10:30 a.m. EDT on Wednesday.Analysts forecast U.S. energy firms added about 1.0 million barrels of crude into storage during the week ended June 2, according to a Reuters poll. [EIA/S] [API/S]That would be the second weekly increase in crude stocks in a row and compares with a rise of 2.0 million barrels in the same week last year and a five-year (2018-2022) average increase of 2.3 million barrels.(Reporting by Scott DiSavino in New YorkAdditional reporting by Rowena Edwards in London, Arathy Somasekhar in Houston and Trixie Yap in SingaporeEditing by David Goodman, Matthew Lewis, Chizu Nomiyama and Richard Chang)]"

But Morgan Stanley analysts are predicting a 16% earnings drop for S&amp;P 500 companies. Ben Laidler, Global Markets Strategist at eToro, and Tom Essaye, Sevens Report Research Founder and President, give their takes on what lies ahead for the market.Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: First, we've got to think about the S&amp;P 500's Friday rally, and that inching the index closer to exiting its longest bear market in decades. A robust jobs report and debt ceiling resolution fueled investor optimism, and excitement over AI also helping drive some gains. But Morgan Stanley analysts say the rally will reverse course in the months ahead.In a note Sunday, analysts led by Andrew Sheets predicting earnings per share will drop 16% this year, a bearish outlook at odds with Wall Street estimates. So let's get back to Ben Laidler, who is eToro global market strategist and Tom Essaye, Sevens Report Research founder and president.Ben, to you first on this. As you think about the number of calls that have now essentially kicked off our week, whether for the S&amp;P 500 or just looking back at what we've seen so far in the S&amp;P 500 rally attempt to get out of a bear market, where does that sit with you? Do you believe that the forecasts that we're seeing right now have some weight or have some support or substantiated evidence to them as well?BEN LAIDLER: We remain pretty positive, right? I mean, this has been a massive pain trade for most people this year. The fundamentals have definitively turned less bearish. And when everyone is hugely bearish by some measures, almost the most we've ever seen, that's all you need to drive this double-digit S&amp;P 500 rally we've seen this year and 25% for the NASDAQ.People wanted to call this recession for the last 18 months. And it just hasn't arrived. And therefore, not only are you not seeing earnings fall, you're actually seeing earnings rise. And that's happening alongside rising valuations, which is being allowed by lower inflation, lower bond yields. So this is really the Goldilocks scenario.Story continuesAnd it's a massive pain trade for the bears. And frankly, I think it continues. I think the fundamentals are decent. I'm very happy to say that I do too agree that growth is probably going to slow from here. But I think markets are just going to look through it, frankly. Because inflation's coming down, the Fed's getting flexibility to cut interest rates back.I think any sort of slowdown in the economy, slow down in earnings, markets are going to look to the other side. And remember, markets are very long duration, right? The market is not the economy these days, right? It's tech, it's health care, it's defensives, it's things that are much more sensitive to inflation, bond yields, and interest rates than it is to growth in the underlying economy, I would argue.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. Although you could say, to your point, the growth in the underlying economy isn't that bad, right? Or not as bad as expected. Guys, I've seen the term melt-up applied to the rally that we have been seeing. Tom, you first on this. What does that mean when people talk about a melt-up? And does it matter that-- what are the implications of that that it's being called that?TOM ESSAYE: So it's sort of a very official term, of course. Now, it's just a wall to Wall Street slang, essentially, for a market that won't go down even if there are headlines that mean it should. And it basically kind of pulls in skeptical investors. So imagine something sort of melting and it spreads as it keeps going.And that's what we're seeing, right? For the past six weeks prior to Thursday and Friday, five stocks drove the entire market. It's those five AI mega-cap tech names. On Thursday and Friday, it broadened out. Tech actually relatively underperformed. And that's where you're getting people with this melt-up.Now it's spreading, now it's going across all the sectors of the market. And to Ben's point, if you're underweight, you got to be waking up today really nervous because this thing has momentum in the near-term, and you're missing it. And so now do we create more chasing? And the answer is probably yes.JULIE HYMAN: So Ben, do melt-ups last?BEN LAIDLER: Yeah, absolutely. I know it depends on the fundamentals. And I think the fundamentals are very, very solid. We're not in recession. We're going to have a slowdown. It's probably going to be a modest slowdown. Companies, corporates are getting their profit margins back, top line has been resilient.I think valuations are well supported in investors hopelessly out of position here. So I think as long as-- it always comes back to the fundamentals. If the fundamentals remain less bad, maybe even sort of firm up stronger from here, I think investors can pretend to be as bearish as they like. But investment managers get paid to manage money not to sit on cash.BRAD SMITH: Well, as well, Ben, you've written around this too. And I imagine both of you have monitored the AI FOMO in some cases as investors are looking across any type of mention and a record number of mentions from S&amp;P 500 companies in this most recent earnings season. But is the AI move that we've seen attached to fundamentals right now from your perspective, Ben?BEN LAIDLER: I would say absolutely. So I would say two things. So one, I've been doing this a while, I have never seen a company as large as Nvidia be so flat-footed on a revenue outlook for the current quarter as they just were on AI. That was the moment that AI flipped from being hope to being dollars and cents reality. And I think that's massively significant.Two, this is a lot more than just AI. Know this is tech cost-cutting. This is investors looking for defensive growth. I like big tech. This is lower bond yields and what that does to potential valuations. God help the market or the tech bears if we see Apple really make a go of their AI VR headset today. That would just be another driver to the tech space. Point being, I think there's a lot of drivers to tech here. I don't think there's only one leg to the stool.JULIE HYMAN: And we're going to talk about Apple more in just a second. But there's something else I'm watching this morning, guys. And that's a new forecast out for Morgan Stanley. For once, it's not Michael Wilson, the US Strategist, who's making this forecast. It's actually Andrew Sheets over there. And the team there is predicting that S&amp;P 500 earnings per share are going to fall 16% this year. Tom, is that nuts?TOM ESSAYE: No. It's certainly against the consensus. And we have to take it with a grain of salt. And Morgan Stanley has probably been the most bearish shop on the street for the past multiple years, honestly. It certainly got it right last year, not so much this year. But I haven't read that report, but I'm going to guess here's their thesis.And it goes to what Ben was saying earlier is that basically, if we see broad-based disinflation-- right now we're seeing it on the cost side of things for companies. What if we see it on the finished goods prices, right? So what if there are price wars? Remember those? They can come back. And actually AutoNation last week kind of hinted at one.So if you see prices start to drop in the marketplace, good for the consumer, not good for corporate earnings because margins are where they're going to make their money. So I think there is a risk of that. Is it imminent? I don't think so. But could it happen between now and year-end? I mean, yeah, it definitely could.BRAD SMITH: Yeah. And so in which companies does that does that impact the most in your perspective?TOM ESSAYE: Well, I think that really, you're sort of cyclical companies would get hit the hardest. because your staple demand is going to be there. But if people can't extract greater margins and we have what I call a falling economic tide, whether it's a modest slowdown or a significant slowdown, we don't know, I think those are the names that'll get hurt the worst.So really, you've got kind of a fork in the road. On one hand, Thursday and Friday should make you very bullish on cyclicals at least from a technical standpoint. But there's earnings risk here. And if they get hit, then the back half of the year is going to be ugly for them.JULIE HYMAN: I have a feeling, Ben, you have stuff to say about all of this as well.BEN LAIDLER: Listen, I've got my head in the sand here. The economy is going to slow. That's going to take a chunk out of earnings. All I'm saying is, we've been calling this for a year and a half, where if we're not expecting a certain amount of this at this point, then what have we been doing?And I do think there are plenty of ways to defend yourself from that. I think it's health care, it's big tech. It's the defensive bets of the market. I would absolutely be steering clear of the cyclicals, of commodities, of small cap, the ones that are going to suffer if growth rolls over here.But the fact that it's happening this sort of relatively late in the cycle, if it does happen, I think means the Fed's in a position to respond to that. Again, which is why I think markets are-- some sectors will get hurt more than others. But I think the market overall will just look through to the other side of the Fed cutting interest rates and growth flattening out an earnings recovery.]"

This will help ensure a dependable and resilient grid that can grow in the future.On Jun 1, 2023, the operating division filed a Certificate of Need and Route Permit with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. It submitted a request to replace the aging critical infrastructure and modernize the terminal stations of its 465-mile HVDC transmission line that runs from Center, ND to Hermantown, MN.The new system is expected to cost between $800 million and $900 million. Construction related to this project is expected to start in Minnesota and North Dakota as early as 2024, subject to regulatory permissions. The system is projected to go into operation between 2028 and 2030.Benefits of the Upgrade ProjectAs Minnesota Power gets ready to fulfill the state of Minnesota's target of supplying carbon-free electricity by 2040, maintaining and enhancing the reliable delivery of essential energy becomes a crucial part of its EnergyForward plan.This operating division of ALE ensures a robust grid with cost-effective utilization of its existing assets. The current project will help improve reliability and reduce transmission congestion on its electric grid. It will also enable a safe and reliable supply of power, and help meet the state's carbon reduction goals.The project also includes the construction of three transmission lines (of less than a mile each) to connect the new converter station to the existing electric system. The converter facilities at the Square Butte East Substation in Center, ND, are slated for similar upgrades.Utilities' Focus on Infrastructure UpgradesRenewable energy requires more complex storage and management infrastructure. In order to make the Upper Midwest's grid more reliable and resilient, transmission investments and the replacement of outdated infrastructure with contemporary systems are essential. This is especially true as the region experiences extreme weather events and the energy source continues to change.Along with ALLETE, some other electric power companies like FirstEnergy Corporation FE, Duke Energy DUK and AVANGRID AGR are adopting measures to strengthen their existing infrastructure.In 2022, FirstEnergy invested $1.4 billion to modernize and improve the reliability and resiliency of its transmission system. The company filed the new four-year Grid Modernization II program with the Ohio commission, proposing a $626-million capital investment to expand the deployment of Grid Modernization technologies and help reduce the frequency of power outages. The first phase of the Grid Modernization program is nearly complete.FE’s long-term (three- to five-year) earnings growth rate is 6.45%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings per share (EPS) indicates a year-over-year increase of 4.15%.Duke Energy remains focused on expanding its scale of operations and implementing modern technologies at its facilities. It invests heavily in infrastructure and expansion projects. Almost 85% of the planned investment will fund the company's generation fleet transition and grid modernization. This includes approximately $75 billion to modernize and strengthen its transmission and distribution infrastructure.DUK’s long-term earnings growth rate is 6.18%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 EPS implies a year-over-year improvement of 6.64%.AVANGRID aims to invest $21.5 billion through 2025 to maintain and upgrade its infrastructure and facilities.AGR’s long-term earnings growth rate is 4.43%. It delivered an average earnings surprise of 5.12% in the last four quarters.Story continuesPrice PerformanceIn the past month, shares of ALLETE have lost 2.2% compared with the industry’s 5.8% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankALLETE currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The company’s ongoing investment is also projected to increase grid reliability and enable efficient customer service. The Energizing the Future initiative will likely add to its overall operational strength.However, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has to face risks related to ongoing increases in interest rates and any delay in completing a capital project.TailwindsThe utility’s efforts to expand its regulated generation mix increased earnings predictability. In the last few years, FirstEnergy witnessed a successful broadening of regulated operations and a complete transition to a fully-regulated utility company.FirstEnergy plans to invest nearly $11.4 billion in the 2023-2025 period to further strengthen its existing operations. The company expects to invest $5.9 billion in regulated distribution and $5.4 billion in regulated transmission during the same time frame. Strengthening of the transmission and renewable generation assets will allow FE to provide emission-free electricity to customers and transmit electricity even under adverse weather conditions.HeadwindsThe increase in interest rates will raise the entire project cost (compared with the previous projection), resulting in a decline in profitability.  Any delay in the timely completion of the capital projects is a headwind.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same industry are Southern Company SO, Consolidated Edison ED and NiSource Inc.

For more stocks, head on over to 5 High Quality S&amp;P 500 Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On.As the first half of 2023 comes to an end, the primary concern on anyone's mind is whether there will be a recession this year. Courtesy of modern day data collection and analysis capabilities, policymakers are able to have some insight into how the economy is performing to tailor their decisions accordingly. And this data is crucial in enabling the Federal Reserve to decide whether it will further increase interest rates or consider pausing and gradually bringing them down.On this front, June started with a crucial data reading from the Labor Department. This revealed that the labor market remained strong and added 339,000 jobs in May. This indicates that despite the record interest rate hikes by the Fed, the economy remains resilient - lending credence to speculation that perhaps more interest rate increases might be on the cards. However, for the interest rate bears, the unemployment rate also increased by 0.3% to sit at 3.7% - the largest jump since the start of the coronavirus pandemic's economic disruption in April 2020.So what does this mean for the stock market? In more normal times, a potential economic slowdown would lead to the stock market dropping as well - but the contrarian nature of the two primary metrics within this report made studying the immediate impact on the market even more interesting. Overall, markets reacted positively, as the NASDAQ index rose by 1%, the S&amp;P 500 by 1.45%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) by 2.12%. This indicated that investors had taken the rise in unemployment and a reduction in wage growth as the primary takeaway from the labor report, using these to form opinions that believe that the Fed will not deliver an interest rate hike late this month.Story continuesHowever, the jobs report is only one part of the Fed's decision making process. An equally important metric is the inflation report that will come out on the same day the Fed officials will meet to set the policy rate. And while there are few estimates available as to what might happen later this month, there are other metrics that point at the consumer and broader economic sentiment. One such metric is the Consumer Confidence Index which aims to look at household expectations of their financial situations for the near future. This index dropped to 102.3 in May from 103.7 in April as the broader gloom about the debt ceiling standoff between Congress and the President weighed on consumers' minds. At the same time, long term inflation expectations also dropped and stood at 6.1% for the next twelve months as they marked a new low since January 2021.Speaking of which, it's not only the households that believe inflation will come down. The two-year breakeven inflation (BEI) rate for inflation protection bonds dropped below 2% in May for the first time in years, indicating that bond investors believe that inflation will fall below this rate in the coming years as well. This is in strong contrast to a reading of 3% for the start of 2023. Finally, Fed Funds Futures pricing data gathered through the CME FedWatch Tool shows that there is a 75% probability that interest rates will remain unchanged this month. However, this might make for some early optimism since the picture changes when we consider the outlook for July. For July, there is a 53.5% probability that the Fed will deliver a 25 basis point hike.So how is this choppy environment making an impact on investment managers? Well, on this front, the management of Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) shared some insights at the bank's earnings call for the first quarter of 2023 where they outlined:Overall margin in the Wealth Management business was 26%, impacted by modest increases in credit reserves, slightly lower growth of NII versus forecast and ongoing integration expenses. We continue to focus on the levers within our control with an eye towards expense management. In ISG, underwriting and M&amp;A remain very subdued. As I have said previously, these are revenues delayed, not dead. Already, we are seeing a growing M&amp;A pipeline and some spring-like signs of new issuance emerging. That said, it largely remains a back half 2023 and full year 2024 story.On the positive side, our fixed income and equity trading teams performed very well in managing through some historic rate moves.Total trading revenues were solid. I expect the markets to remain choppy through this earnings season and for the next several months. However, absent any geopolitical surprise or limited progress on bringing down inflation, I think 2023 is likely to end on a constructive note in most areas. Morgan Stanley is very well positioned not just for 2023, but for several years ahead as we see significant growth opportunities across all three of our client platforms.I will now pass it over to Sharon for more details on the first quarter. Sharon Yeshaya Thank you, and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $14.5 billion in the first quarter, our EPS was $1.70, and our ROTCE was 16.9%. The firm’s results demonstrated the durability of our business model, evidenced by the resilient ROTCE, robust asset consolidation and wealth and our stable capital and liquidity levels.In institutional securities, fixed income and equity supported our clients while navigating volatile markets. Wealth Management showcased $110 billion of net new assets and investment management continued to benefit from the investments we have made to diversify our offerings.With these details in mind, let's take a look at the top S&amp;P 500 stocks that have found favor among billionaires, as the index and the individuals represent the best of both worlds, particularly in this uncertain economic environment.

(NYSE:CRM). The company's stock led the NYSE gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Salesforce’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Salesforce What Is Salesforce Worth?Great news for investors – Salesforce is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $293.67, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. However, given that Salesforce’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What does the future of Salesforce look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Salesforce. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since CRM is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on CRM for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy CRM. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed buy.So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing Salesforce at this point in time.

The enterprise cloud computing solution provider’s first-quarter fiscal 2024 non-GAAP earnings increased 71.4% to $1.69 per share from 98 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.61.The quarterly non-GAAP earnings were adversely impacted by a loss of 11 cents per share from mark-to-mark accounting of CRM’s strategic investments at a non-GAAP tax rate of 23.5%. However, the company’s ongoing restructuring initiative, which includes trimming the workforce, benefited first-quarter non-GAAP earnings by 72 cents per share.Revenue Growth Outperforms Estimates, Though at Slowest Pace Since 2010Salesforce’s quarterly revenues of $8.25 billion climbed 11% year over year, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.17 billion. The top line also improved 13% in constant currency. Despite this, the company's revenue growth for the quarter came in at its slowest pace since 2010, per Reuters. This slowdown was partly due to a shortfall in under-contract sales expected in the next 12 months (that is, cRPO, or current revenue performance obligation).The company has been benefiting from the robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. Thus, the rapid adoption of its cloud-based solutions resulted in the better-than-anticipated performance in the fiscal first quarter.What Went Wrong?Despite the positive earnings, analysts noted that Salesforce's revenue outperformance was below historical trends, resulting in a stock sell-off. Salesforce also missed on under-contract sales expected in the next 12 months (that is, cRPO, or current revenue performance obligation). However, for the upcoming quarter Salesforce expects sales of $8.51B to $8.53B, higher than the $8.49B estimates.Wall Street's Response to Salesforce's Q1 ResultsGoldman Sachs reiterated its Buy rating on CRM shares, citing the results as ""strong in light of the challenging macro backdrop."" Similarly, Bank of America reaffirmed a Top Pick status on CRM, noting it was ""impressed"" by the 1% guidance beat for cRPO growth ""given the tough macro and disruption from restructuring actions,” per investing.com, quoted on Yahoo.Story continuesSalesforce-Heavy ETFs to Tap?The stock currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

48,dc574148-0837-39f2-8146-aa8e5a7bc2c0,CRM,2023-06-06,Salesforce Inc. (CRM) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-inc-crm-trending-stock-130011541.html,1685970011,STORY,['CRM'],"[Salesforce.com (CRM) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this customer-management software developer have returned +7.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.1% change. The Zacks Computer - Software industry, to which Salesforce.com belongs, has gained 9.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Salesforce.com is expected to post earnings of $1.73 per share, indicating a change of +45.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +2.4% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.18 points to a change of +37% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +1.2%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.79 indicates a change of +22.4% from what Salesforce.com is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Salesforce.com.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Salesforce.com, the consensus sales estimate of $8.52 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +10.4%. The $34.63 billion and $38.46 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +10.5% and +11.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySalesforce.com reported revenues of $8.25 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.3%. EPS of $1.69 for the same period compares with $0.98 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.17 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.95%. The EPS surprise was +4.97%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Salesforce.com is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Salesforce.com. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

49,32e1400c-cf14-4821-98dd-a57c993217b7,CRM,2023-06-06,5 stock market trends to watch this summer: Morning Brief,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-stock-market-trends-to-watch-this-summer-morning-brief-120050345.html,1685966450,STORY,"['AAPL', 'AI', 'CRM', 'HPE', 'TGT', 'NVDA', 'AMD']","[This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every Monday to Friday by 6:30 a.m. ET along with:The chart of the dayWhat we're watchingWhat we're readingEconomic data releases and earningsThe official start of summer is only a few weeks away. And for most market goers, that means watching the action on the Yahoo Finance app (which I strongly encourage you to download) from a beach, a park, or a pool.While the natural inclination is to ""sell in May and go away,"" I humbly say: please don't do that. Not just because we have bills to pay here, but because there is a litany of interesting stories to track in the markets. I would argue there are many more compelling stories for investors compared to Summer 2022.Here is a tiny sampling of things I am watching during a summer that probably won't involve me going to a beach, pool, or house party because well — investing ""stuff"" is all I got going for me. The order is totally random and not in order of importance.1. Target's stockShares have been hammered by close to 14% in the past two weeks since the company removed LGBTQ+ merchandise from its stores. The fear is consumer backlash means weakening sales and a missed second quarter. The company also caught a JP Morgan downgrade on concerns the restart of student loan payments in Sept. 1 will hurt sales.Unclear if there is a near-term catalyst to jumpstart Target's stock considering all of this, which comes after another tough quarter of sales.2. The economic impact of student loan repaymentsThe downgrade to Target's stock could be a canary-in-the-coal-mine indicator of what analysts and market strategists do this summer before the repayments begin. Are more retailer ratings cut? Do strategists trim their S&amp;P 500 earnings estimates and year-end price targets? How will markets react? The market reaction to the Target downgrade was modest, but can it continue?Story continuesMake no mistake, the payment restart will be a headwind for an economy that doesn't need one.Goldman Sachs estimates student loan repayments will subtract 0.2 percentage points from personal consumption expenditures growth this year if the loan forgiveness plan is struck down, or 0.1 percentage point if the plan stands.Jefferies economist Thomas Simons thinks at least $400 a month in spending capacity will be removed from the pockets of those with student loans.""So as we're now adding this back in to balance sheets that are already pretty strained by two years of very high inflation that's run significantly higher than wage growth, the capacity to absorb this in a lot of budgets I think is much worse now,"" Simons said on Yahoo Finance Live.3. AI StocksIt's time for investors to draw a differentiation in AI stocks. Not doing so could prove very painful to one's portfolio.On the one hand, you have credible companies infusing generative AI into their businesses to unlock efficiencies and win new business. I was very impressed by what HP CEO Enrique Lores told me about how AI will transform the personal computer starting in 2024. With that, the company and rival Dell could be winners of a PC refresh cycle in 2024.I was also surprised to learn from Hewlett Packard Enterprise CFO Tarek Robbiati that the company has secured $800 million in new AI-related business.I fancy we may hear something positive very soon from AMD on the generative AI front. Maybe not as Earth-shattering as Nvidia, but strong enough to excite investors.Salesforce has an AI investor day slated a week from today. And Cisco Live is underway in Las Vegas — AI discussions will probably be front and center here.Again, these are credible companies working on cool AI stuff for the benefit of investors.On the other end of the spectrum, you have companies such as c3.AI.The money-losing company is being attacked by short sellers —such as the super-thorough Ben Axler at Spruce Point— for suspect accounting standards. I think many on the Street are beginning to drill down into the fundamentals of these more fringe AI plays to avoid getting burned —much like when the SPAC bubble burst.I expect a summer of AI scrutiny, leading to a possible rotation into more credible AI stocks.4. Apple's stockApple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) kicks off today (our tech editor Dan Howley will have full live coverage from Apple HQ), and it's time to see these AR/VR glasses the company has been working on for umpteen years.Shares of the tech giant are up almost 40% year to date, in part due to hype building for another new product category for Apple. And, Apple is generally viewed as a safe-haven play.But listen to the team at Morgan Stanley, and you get the sense these glasses have been the bigger tailwind for Apple's stock.""We estimate the AR/VR headset market can grow to $100 billion by 2030, and expand 5x by 2037, to over $500 billion,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring said in a research note ahead of the event.I am not sold on Apple's AR/VR glasses given the expected super high price point. And, I know I am not the only one who's skeptical about Apple having amazing success with a category that has always proven challenging. And how are they doing with that HomePod?Could we see a post-WWDC summer swoon in Apple's stock as glasses hype fades and recession talk resurfaces?Don't rule it out.5. The FedThe Fed could singlehandedly cut summer vacations short if it raises interest rates at its June 14 meeting. Why? The market has bet on the Fed pausing on rate hikes at the meeting, with maybe one more hike for the cycle coming at the July 26 gathering.Hopes for a Fed pause have fed (no pun intended) the markets' naturally bullish inclination — the Nasdaq Composite is up more than 25% on the year. The FANG+ Index is up about 65%.If the Fed doesn't deliver a pause, it may be a Summer Reset for markets.And that is one trend you won't want to be watching from a no-cell-service zone like the beach.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

50,d6f45aaf-0e3e-326b-acfc-c7d4863f3e9e,CRM,2023-06-06,Rambus and Hibbett Sports have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rambus-hibbett-sports-highlighted-zacks-112600525.html,1685964360,STORY,"['RMBS', 'DASTY', 'VRSN', 'CRM']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – June 5, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares Rambus RMBS as the Bull of the Day and Hibbett Sports HIBB as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Salesforce CRM, VeriSign VRSN and Dassault Systemes DASTY.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:The latest craze to hit the market this year is Artificial Intelligence, AI. The ground-breaking technology is causing not just ripples, but seismic waves across the market. It has helped kickoff a rally that sent NVIDIA through the roof. It is also bleeding over to many other names in the semiconductor industry. Among them, is today’s Bull of the Day.Today’s Bull of the Day is Rambus. Rambus is an American technology company that designs, develops, and licenses chip interface technologies and architectures used in digital electronic products. The company's primary business model is based on developing and licensing intellectual property related to memory technologies for semiconductors, which are then used in consumer, enterprise, and industrial applications.Currently, Rambus is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The reason for the favorable Zacks Rank is that recent earnings estimate revisions have been coming into the upside. Over the last thirty days, analysts have pushed up their estimates for the current year and next year. The bullish moves have increased our Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current year from $1.74 to $1.78 while next year’s numbers are up from $2.04 to $2.21.That represents earnings growth of 1.71% this year, swelling to 24.16% for next year. That comes on revenue growth of 4.87% for the current year and 18.7% for next year.Taking a look at the Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chart, you can see the consistent year-over-year moves higher in both the price and the earnings. Earnings growth has been not only solid since 2020, but there has been a pretty consistent move higher in those estimates throughout the course of the year. FY2024 estimates now seem to be taking off, helping pull the price along with it.Story continuesBear of the Day:Retailers, specifically those having to do with athletics, have been coming under pressure. Earnings estimates have been squeezed to the downside, input prices have been rising, and the overall outlook has taken a turn for the worse. It should come as no surprise then, that’s today’s Bear of the Day is in this industry.The Bear of the Day is Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) Hibbett Sports. Hibbett, Inc. together with its subsidiaries, engages in the retail of athletic-inspired fashion products in the United States. Its stores offer a range of merchandise, including athletic footwear, athletic and fashion apparel, team sports equipment, and related accessories. The company operates Hibbett stores, City Gear stores, and Sports Additions athletic shoe stores. It also sells its products through online channels.Over the course of the last 30 days, four analysts have cut their earnings estimates for the current year while four have also done so for next year. The bearish moves have dropped our Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current year from $10.18 to $7.88 while next year’s number is down from $11.01 to $9.04.That means that the current year Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for an 18% contraction in earnings this year. That number is expected to grow by 14.78% for next year. That’s on 2.14% revenue growth this year and 5.48% revenue growth for next year.The Retail – Apparel and Shoes industry ranks in the Bottom 15% of our Zacks Industry Rank.Additional content:Salesforce Offers Limited Near-Term Upside: 2 Stocks to Buy Instead Salesforce, the customer relationship management software giant, reported earnings on Thursday after the market close. Although CRM beat earnings handily, raised guidance, and returned cash to shareholders the stock sold off, nonetheless.After rallying close to 60% YTD, completing a major restructuring, and dramatically boosting profits, it seems Salesforce may have been priced to perfection. With so much good news discounted in the stock price, it may be time for CRM to take a break.·         Earnings: $1.69 per share, adjusted, vs. $1.61 per share as expected by analysts·         Revenue: $8.25 billion, vs. $8.18 billion as expected by analysts·         Returned $2.1 Billion in First Quarter to Stockholders through Share BuybacksSalesforce is a member of the Software industry, which currently ranks in the top 46% of the Zacks Industry Rank. It has been extremely strong YTD, so we know there are other stocks investors can rotate into if they are ready to take profits in CRM.Two stocks that boast strong long-term performance, that also currently have superior earnings revision trends are VeriSign and Dassault Systemes. VeriSign has averaged an annualized return of 15.7% over the last 20 years, and Dassault Systemes 14.4% over that same period.VeriSignVeriSign is a leading provider of domain name registry services and internet infrastructure solutions. With a focus on managing the stability and security of the DNS infrastructure, VeriSign ensures the reliable functioning of .com and .net domain names. By leveraging advanced technologies and offering additional services like DDoS protection, VeriSign plays a crucial role in maintaining a secure online environment and enabling seamless internet accessibility.VeriSign has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Current quarter earnings have been revised higher by nearly 2% and are expected to grow 10.4% YoY and FY23 earnings have been upgraded by 2.7%, with estimates of 10.9% YoY growth.VRSN has done almost nothing over the last five years, trading in a large range. The stock made a huge run up from 2011 to 2019, more than 10’xing over that time.Now that VRSN has had some time to cool off, and grow into its valuation, it should be ready for another bull run soon. Moreover, the presence of catalysts driving positive earnings revisions and an attractive valuation further contribute to the breakout potential.VRSN is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 32x, which is above the industry average of 30x, and below its five-year median of 37x. This below average valuation could draw in buyers looking for undervalued tech stocks.Dassault SystemesDassault Systemes is a renowned global leader in 3D design, engineering, and collaborative software solutions. The company, founded in 1981 and headquartered in France, offers a comprehensive portfolio of innovative products and services that cater to various industries, including aerospace, automotive, manufacturing, and life sciences.Dassault Systemes' flagship software, CATIA, is widely recognized as a leading design and modeling tool, while its other offerings, such as SOLIDWORKS and SIMULIA, provide advanced simulation and virtual testing capabilities. With a strong focus on digital transformation and sustainable innovation, Dassault Systemes empowers businesses to enhance their product development processes, improve efficiency, and drive meaningful customer experiences.Through its cutting-edge technologies and industry expertise, DASTY continues to shape the future of design and engineering, enabling companies to stay at the forefront of their respective sectors.Dassault Systemes has seen near unanimous upgrades in its earnings estimates, earning it a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Current quarter earnings have been upgraded by 11% and are expected to grow 7% YoY. FY23 earnings have been revised 9% higher and are expected to climb 9% YoY.Additionally, current quarter sales are expected to grow 8.8% YoY and FY23 sales are projected to grow 10% YoY. These are extremely steady numbers for a $60 billion company.DASTY is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 37.5x, which is above the industry average, and in line with its 10-year median. Dassault Systemes clearly trades at a premium valuation; however, it is for good reason.Dassault Systemes’ applications are the leader in PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) and Engineering software. It is estimated that it owns the largest share in the market at 17% and increased that share by 8.3% over the last year. DASTY has over 300,000 customers in more than 140 countries.Bottom LineThere is no doubt that Salesforce is a powerhouse in the stock market, but with the incredible run it has gone on, it may be time to look for value elsewhere. With its mixed earnings revisions, and limited bullish catalysts, investors may want to proceed with caution in holding the software giant.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

51,e7c49ad3-e07a-3a88-9f4e-816e5619195d,FLS,2023-06-06,3 Top Industrial Manufacturing Stocks to Buy on Improved Supply Chain,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-top-industrial-manufacturing-stocks-141900323.html,1685974740,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'FLS', 'GGG', 'TT']","[A low-demand environment due to a slowdown in the manufacturing sector is weighing on the Zacks Manufacturing – General Industrial industry. However, improving supply chains and reduced delivery lead times bode well for the industry’s growth. Focus on inorganic activities to expand network and product offerings, and investments in product development and innovation should drive the industry’s growth.Companies like Ingersoll Rand Inc. IR, Graco Inc. GGG and Flowserve Corporation FLS are well-placed to capitalize on the buoyancy in the industry.About the IndustryThe Zacks Manufacturing – General Industrial industry comprises companies engaged in the production of a wide range of industrial equipment. Some industry players offer power transmission products, bearings, engineered fluid power components and systems, industrial rubber products, vapor-abrasive blasting equipment, vehicle-powered truck refrigeration systems, adhesive, gel coat equipment, flow-control components and linear motion components. In addition, industrial manufacturing companies reconstruct and assemble pumps, valves, speed reducers and hydraulic motors. The companies provide services to original equipment manufacturing, and maintenance, repair and overhaul customers. These end users belong to the mining, oil and gas, forest products, agriculture and food processing, fabricated metals, chemicals and petrochemicals, transportation and utilities industries.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Manufacturing General Industrial IndustryPersistent Weakness in the Manufacturing Sector: Continued weakness in the manufacturing sector signals a low demand environment for the industry players. Per the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) report, in May, the Manufacturing PMI (Purchasing Manager’s Index) touched 46.9%, contracting for the seventh consecutive month. A figure less than 50% indicates a contraction in manufacturing activity. The New Orders Index remained in contraction territory at 42.6%, declining 3.1 percentage points from the figure recorded in April. As recession fears loom large amid a slowdown in the U.S. economy, businesses expect continued softness in demand at least in the near term.Easing Supply Chain Disruptions: While supply chain disruptions persist, especially related to the availability of electronic components, the situation has improved as evident from the ISM report’s Supplier Deliveries Index, which reflected faster deliveries for the eighth straight month in May. Easing supply chain issues should support industrial manufacturing companies’ growth in 2023.Acquisition-Based Growth Strategy: The industry participants focus on an acquisition-based growth strategy to expand their network and product offerings. This helps them foray into new markets and solidify their competitive position. Exposure to various end-markets helps industrial manufacturing companies offset risks associated with a single market. Continuous investments in product development and innovation, automation and technological advancements augur well for the industry’s growth.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Manufacturing – General Industrial industry, housed within the broader Zacks Industrial Products sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #40. This rank places it in the top 16% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the group’s 2023 earnings per share has increased 9.8% since the end of January.Given the industry’s bright near-term prospects, we will present a few stocks, worth considering for your portfolio. But before that, it’s worth taking a look at the industry’s stock market performance and current valuation.Industry Outperforms Both Sector &amp; S&amp;PThe Zacks Manufacturing – General Industrial industry has outperformed both the broader sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite index over the past year.Over this period, the industry has appreciated 10.2% compared with the sector and the S&amp;P 500 Index’s increase of 2.3% and 4.1%, respectively.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of forward 12-month Price-to-Earnings (P/E), which is a commonly used multiple for valuing manufacturing stocks, the industry is currently trading at 17.74X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 19.01X. It is also above the sector’s P/E ratio of 15.53X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 26.96X, as low as 14.92X and at the median of 18.83X as the chart below shows.Price-to-Earnings RatioPrice-to-Earnings Ratio 3 Manufacturing-General Industrial Stocks Leading the PackEach of the stocks below sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Ingersoll Rand: Headquartered in Davidson, NC, Ingersoll Rand, a global industrial company, has expertise in industrial and mission-critical flow creation technologies. Solid underlying demand and higher orders should drive the company’s growth. IR’s focus on expanding its market presence, solidifying its customer base and enhancing product offerings through acquisitions is a key catalyst to its growth. In January 2023, the company completed the acquisition of SPX FLOW’s Air Treatment business, boosting its core compressor product offering.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ingersoll Rand’s 2023 earnings has been revised upward by 7.5% in the past 60 days. Shares of the company have rallied 24.4% in a year.Price and Consensus: IRGraco: Based in Minneapolis, MN, Graco is a manufacturing company engaged in designing, manufacturing and marketing equipment and systems. Strength in the Process segment due to higher sales in vehicle service, industrial lubrication, process transfer pumps, environmental, and semiconductor augur well for GGG. Investments in product innovation and capacity expansion should fuel the company’s growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Graco’s 2023 earnings has been revised upward by 10.9% in the past 60 days. Shares of the company have gained 25.3% in a year.Price and Consensus: GGGFlowserve: Headquartered in Irving, TX, Flowserve is a leading manufacturer and aftermarket service provider of comprehensive flow control systems, globally. The company is thriving on the back of record booking levels due to strong manufacturing, repair and operations (“MRO”) and aftermarket activity.

ALGN has been gaining from the expanding work-flow options of its leading iTero scanners. The initial adoption of the Invisalign comprehensive was well received in the market. However, economic uncertainty and stiff competition raise apprehension over the company.Year-to-date, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 43.2% compared with an 7.4% rise of the industry and a 13.5% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned global medical device company has a market capitalization of $23.11 billion. The company’s expected long-term earnings growth of 17.2%, ahead of the industry’s 11.6% rise.Let’s delve deeper.Key Growth DriversiTero in Focus: Align Technology has been focusing on expanding work-flow options of its leading iTero scanners. In the first quarter, services revenues increased year over year, primarily due to higher subscription revenues resulting from the large number of iTero scanners in the field. The company also had higher non-systems revenues reflecting increased scanner rentals, upgrades and certified pre-owned or CPO leasing programs.In 2022, the company announced a strategic collaboration with Desktop Metal to supply iTero Element Flex scanners to Desktop Labs. The iTero Element Flex is the preferred restorative scanner for Desktop Labs and will connect dentists directly with a suite of offerings from Desktop Labs.Strategic Alliances: Align Technology's slew of strategic alliances looks impressive. The company has well-established relationships with many DSOs, especially in the United States and is continuously exploring collaboration with others that drive the adoption of digital dentistry. Align Technology announced a $75-million equity investment in Heartland Dental.During the first quarter, the company delivered 7.8 billion impressions and had 22.1 million visits to its websites. Align Technologies continues to invest in top media platforms such as TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram and YouTube across markets.Story continuesInvisalign Portfolio Expansion: Align Technology’s Invisalign portfolio offers orthodontic treatment to straighten teeth without metal braces.During the first quarter, the company launched Invisalign Comprehensive three and three product in most markets. Instead of unlimited additional aligners within five years of the treatment end date, the latest configuration offers Invisalign comprehensive treatment with three additional aligners included within three years of treatment end date.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe initial adoption of the product garnered a positive response. The company expects that its impact will be more meaningful and provide doctors with the desired flexibility. This will allow the company to recognize deferred revenues over a shorter period of time compared with the traditional Invisalign comprehensive product.DownsidesCompetitive Landscape: Align Technology faces significant competition from traditional orthodontic appliance (or wires and brackets) players such as 3M’s Unitek, Danaher Corporation’s Sybron Dental Specialties and Dentsply International. The company also competes with products similar to Invisalign Technology, such as the products from Ormco Orthodontics, a division of Sybron Dental Specialties.Economic Uncertainty: The general slowdown in the United States and certain international economies is having a negative impact on consumer spending and affecting Align Technology’s business fundamentals. Align Technology attributed the waning earnings to the macroeconomic crisis that affected the overall dental market and led to persistent soft dental sales for Align Technology. Dental procedures are primarily elective in nature and are deferred when unemployment levels rise.Estimate TrendIn the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Align Technology’s 2023 earnings has moved 4.1% north to $8.31.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $3.89 billion, suggesting a 4.2% surge from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Addus Homecare Corporation ADUS, Merit Medical Systems, Inc.

For more stocks, head on over to 5 High Quality S&amp;P 500 Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On.As the first half of 2023 comes to an end, the primary concern on anyone's mind is whether there will be a recession this year. Courtesy of modern day data collection and analysis capabilities, policymakers are able to have some insight into how the economy is performing to tailor their decisions accordingly. And this data is crucial in enabling the Federal Reserve to decide whether it will further increase interest rates or consider pausing and gradually bringing them down.On this front, June started with a crucial data reading from the Labor Department. This revealed that the labor market remained strong and added 339,000 jobs in May. This indicates that despite the record interest rate hikes by the Fed, the economy remains resilient - lending credence to speculation that perhaps more interest rate increases might be on the cards. However, for the interest rate bears, the unemployment rate also increased by 0.3% to sit at 3.7% - the largest jump since the start of the coronavirus pandemic's economic disruption in April 2020.So what does this mean for the stock market? In more normal times, a potential economic slowdown would lead to the stock market dropping as well - but the contrarian nature of the two primary metrics within this report made studying the immediate impact on the market even more interesting. Overall, markets reacted positively, as the NASDAQ index rose by 1%, the S&amp;P 500 by 1.45%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) by 2.12%. This indicated that investors had taken the rise in unemployment and a reduction in wage growth as the primary takeaway from the labor report, using these to form opinions that believe that the Fed will not deliver an interest rate hike late this month.Story continuesHowever, the jobs report is only one part of the Fed's decision making process. An equally important metric is the inflation report that will come out on the same day the Fed officials will meet to set the policy rate. And while there are few estimates available as to what might happen later this month, there are other metrics that point at the consumer and broader economic sentiment. One such metric is the Consumer Confidence Index which aims to look at household expectations of their financial situations for the near future. This index dropped to 102.3 in May from 103.7 in April as the broader gloom about the debt ceiling standoff between Congress and the President weighed on consumers' minds. At the same time, long term inflation expectations also dropped and stood at 6.1% for the next twelve months as they marked a new low since January 2021.Speaking of which, it's not only the households that believe inflation will come down. The two-year breakeven inflation (BEI) rate for inflation protection bonds dropped below 2% in May for the first time in years, indicating that bond investors believe that inflation will fall below this rate in the coming years as well. This is in strong contrast to a reading of 3% for the start of 2023. Finally, Fed Funds Futures pricing data gathered through the CME FedWatch Tool shows that there is a 75% probability that interest rates will remain unchanged this month. However, this might make for some early optimism since the picture changes when we consider the outlook for July. For July, there is a 53.5% probability that the Fed will deliver a 25 basis point hike.So how is this choppy environment making an impact on investment managers? Well, on this front, the management of Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) shared some insights at the bank's earnings call for the first quarter of 2023 where they outlined:Overall margin in the Wealth Management business was 26%, impacted by modest increases in credit reserves, slightly lower growth of NII versus forecast and ongoing integration expenses. We continue to focus on the levers within our control with an eye towards expense management. In ISG, underwriting and M&amp;A remain very subdued. As I have said previously, these are revenues delayed, not dead. Already, we are seeing a growing M&amp;A pipeline and some spring-like signs of new issuance emerging. That said, it largely remains a back half 2023 and full year 2024 story.On the positive side, our fixed income and equity trading teams performed very well in managing through some historic rate moves.Total trading revenues were solid. I expect the markets to remain choppy through this earnings season and for the next several months. However, absent any geopolitical surprise or limited progress on bringing down inflation, I think 2023 is likely to end on a constructive note in most areas. Morgan Stanley is very well positioned not just for 2023, but for several years ahead as we see significant growth opportunities across all three of our client platforms.I will now pass it over to Sharon for more details on the first quarter. Sharon Yeshaya Thank you, and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $14.5 billion in the first quarter, our EPS was $1.70, and our ROTCE was 16.9%. The firm’s results demonstrated the durability of our business model, evidenced by the resilient ROTCE, robust asset consolidation and wealth and our stable capital and liquidity levels.In institutional securities, fixed income and equity supported our clients while navigating volatile markets. Wealth Management showcased $110 billion of net new assets and investment management continued to benefit from the investments we have made to diversify our offerings.With these details in mind, let's take a look at the top S&amp;P 500 stocks that have found favor among billionaires, as the index and the individuals represent the best of both worlds, particularly in this uncertain economic environment.

If there are problems, we want to solve them. If the UK wants to impose regulatory requirements that go beyond those in the EU, we want to find ways to fulfil them.""Smith was also scheduled to meet officials from the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) during his visit to London this week, according to reports.He said he had always been ""bullish on the United Kingdom as a great place to live, to learn, to build"".Smith criticised Britain after the CMA veto, saying it would shake confidence in the UK as a destination for tech.The EU approved the Activision deal in May after it accepted remedies put forward by Microsoft that were broadly comparable to those it proposed in the UK.Microsoft has also appealed the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's action seeking to block the deal after the agency said it would suppress competition.The British appeal is due to be heard next month, with a verdict likely in August or September.Story continuesSmith focused his remarks on Tuesday on how AI should be governed, saying it should not be the sole responsibility of tech companies. ""It needs to be subject to the rule of law,"" he said, adding: ""And we will need regulations to govern it.""Microsoft and its partner OpenAI were already using a safety board to review the features and standards of their AI models before they were deployed, he said, and such an approach could be replicated more widely.""Just like an aeroplane, just like a bus, just like an automobile, a powerful model will probably need to pass such a review,"" he said. ""And it ... probably should get a licence.""And of course, that means there needs to be a licensor in a position to make that decision.""

If there are problems, we want to solve them. If the UK wants to impose regulatory requirements that go beyond those in the EU, we want to find ways to fulfil them.""Smith was also scheduled to meet officials from the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) during his visit to London this week, according to reports.He said he had always been ""bullish on the United Kingdom as a great place to live, to learn, to build"".Smith criticised Britain after the CMA veto, saying it would shake confidence in the UK as a destination for tech.The EU approved the Activision deal in May after it accepted remedies put forward by Microsoft that were broadly comparable to those it proposed in the UK.Microsoft has also appealed the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's action seeking to block the deal after the agency said it would suppress competition.The British appeal is due to be heard next month, with a verdict likely in August or September.Smith focused his remarks on Tuesday on how AI should be governed, saying it should not be the sole responsibility of tech companies. ""It needs to be subject to the rule of law,"" he said, adding: ""And we will need regulations to govern it.""Story continuesMicrosoft and its partner OpenAI were already using a safety board to review the features and standards of their AI models before they were deployed, he said, and such an approach could be replicated more widely.""Just like an aeroplane, just like a bus, just like an automobile, a powerful model will probably need to pass such a review,"" he said. ""And it ... probably should get a licence.""And of course, that means there needs to be a licensor in a position to make that decision.""(Reporting by Paul Sandle and Elizabeth Piper; Writing by Sarah Young; Editing by Kate Holton and Alexander Smith)]"

It will also explore the emerging trends in professions worldwide and the key players making a difference at the global level for various professions. If you want to skip our detailed analysis on the topic, you can head straight to the 5 Most Respected Professions in the World.Certain professions have earned a universal reputation for respect and admiration in a world filled with countless paths and possibilities.

One prevailing trend is the growing emphasis on social impact and sustainability. Professions that contribute to the greater good, like healthcare providers, environmental scientists, and educators, are gaining remarkable recognition for their dedication to improving lives and the planet.According to Global Greens Skill Report, the growth of sustainability jobs is experiencing rapid acceleration. In the United States, employment in renewable energy and environmental fields has surged by an impressive 237% over the past five years, per the research from Linked-In.

Until 2019 a pre-checked box in the signup process allowed Microsoft to share that data with advertisers.A Microsoft spokesman said the company would comply with a court-approved settlement order, Reuters reported, adding that a data retention glitch in the company’s systems would be fixed.Britain’s Online Safety Bill aims to crack down on how big tech companies treat their users’ data, with campaigners saying the proposed law is urgently needed to protect children from online exploitation and surveillance by advertisers.Story continuesCritics say the bill reaches too far, however, with WhatsApp and Signal Messenger threatening to leave the UK over anti-encryption proposals in the new law.Wikipedia has also threatened to shut down in Britain over plans to introduce mandatory age verification for anyone using an online service.Lucy Crompton-Reid, head of Wikipedia’s UK charitable arm, told the BBC in April it was “definitely possible that one of the most visited websites in the world – and a vital source of freely accessible knowledge and information for millions of people – won’t be accessible to UK readers”.WhatsApp boss Will Cathcart told The Telegraph in December that the messaging app would also withdraw from the UK rather than comply with the new bill.Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

Those actions violated the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, the FTC stated.In a blog post, Microsoft corporate vice president for Xbox Dave McCarthy outlined additional steps the company is now taking to improve its age verification systems and to ensure that parents are involved in the creation of child accounts for the service. These mostly concern efforts to improve age verification technology and to educate children and parents about privacy issues.McCarthy also said the company had identified and fixed a technical glitch that failed to delete child accounts in cases where the account creation process never finished. Microsoft policy was to hold that data no longer than 14 days in order to allow players to pick up account creation where they left off if they were interrupted.The settlement must be approved by a federal court before it can go into effect, the FTC said.]"

Click to skip ahead and see Billionaire Bridgewater Founder Ray Dalio’s Top 5 Holdings in 2023.McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) are three of the top holdings in billionaire money manager Ray Dalio’s consumer-focused 13F portfolio.Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates has been the most successful fund in history in terms of net dollar gains since inception, delivering $52.2 billion in gains through the end of 2021 according to research conducted by LCH Investments. The fund continued to roll last year even in the midst of Dalio stepping down in October, as the Pure Alpha strategy returned 9.5%.Bridgewater has undertaken several initiatives under new chief executive Nir Bar Dea, including slashing 8% of its workforce and capping investments in its flagship fund as it looks to reallocate resources and restructure. Among other things, Bar Dea plans to invest heavily in Bridgewater’s AI and machine learning capabilities.Meanwhile, Dalio continues to expand his family office, which manages the billionaire’s greater than $16 billion in personal wealth, as well as his philanthropic donations. The Dalio Family Office’s newest branch is planned for Abu Dhabi, where it will work alongside the firm’s existing branches in Singapore and the United States.Dalio gave the recently agreed-upon debt-ceiling deal a D grade in a tweet on Twitter, adding that it was about the best that could be expected but simply wasn’t good enough. In a LinkedIn post published in May, Dalio warned that the U.S. faces a disastrous financial collapse if it continues to raise the debt ceiling without any meaningful limit being put in place.Dalio also engaged in a recent conversation of sorts with the AI chat platform ChatGPT as he relayed in a YouTube video posted in the middle of April. ChatGPT wondered what the most important investing-related lesson is that Dalio learned throughout his storied career, to which the Bridgewater founder responded that diversification was the “Holy Grail” of investing. Dalio added that by investing in 10 to 15 good, uncorrelated assets, an investor can reduce their risk by about 80% without impacting their potential returns.Story continuesIn the first quarter, Bridgewater Associates made significant adjustments to its 13F portfolio, selling off 228 of its former holdings while adding just 118 new positions in their place. The firm also trimmed the size of far more holdings than it was adding to. Of particular note was Bridgewater’s exposure to the finance sector, which was lowered by 330 basis points to 23%. In response, Bridgewater’s exposure to healthcare and communications stocks was raised by a combined 371 basis points. Bridgewater’s 13F portfolio dropped to $16.4 billion in assets as of the end of March, down from $18.3 billion at the end of 2022.Amid a turbulent quarter, the first full one in which Nir Bar Dea was at the helm of Dalio’s iconic firm, let’s take a look at the top ten holdings of the fund in 2023.Billionaire Bridgewater Founder Ray Dalio’s Top 10 Holdings in 2023Ray Dalio of Bridgewater AssociatesOur MethodologyThe following data is gathered from Bridgewater Associates’ latest 13F filing with the SEC. We follow hedge funds like Bridgewater Associates because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q1 2023 reporting period.Billionaire Bridgewater Founder Ray Dalio’s Top 10 Holdings in 202310. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $223 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 174 The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are a few of the longtime favorite top holdings of Bridgewater founder and CIO Ray Dalio. A newer addition to a top 10 spot among his holdings is Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), after Dalio grew his stake in the company by nearly 150% during Q3 of 2022. In the first quarter of this year he boosted the size of his V stake by another 19%, ending Q1 with 990,819 shares.Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) has broadly outperformed the S&amp;P 500 over the last decade and could very well do so in the decade to come. The credit card payments processor is still growing revenue at a low-double digit rate and has several tailwinds at its back that could allow it to continue doing for the foreseeable future. Chief among those tailwinds are the continued rise in the global penetration of credit cards and ecommerce’s growing share of global sales. And both of those tailwinds have plenty of room to run yet. As such, Visa shares are currently trading at somewhat of a premium at 29.5x earnings.Polen Global Growth Strategy shared some of the fundamental strengths that Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) enjoys in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“We trimmed Mastercard and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) to equal weights of the Portfolio. Mastercard and Visa operate as a duopoly in a large and growing market. Over the last 50 years, global personal consumer expenditures (PCE) has grown 7-9% annualized. We expect 4-5% long-term PCE growth going forward. Additionally, the shift from cash to credit continues unabated, with a total credit penetration of only approximately 50% globally.3 This shift provides Visa and Mastercard with another ~4-6% of growth. When combined with PCE, this gives both companies high-single-digit to low-double[1]digit revenue growth opportunities. This growth estimate is before accounting for growth amplifiers like the acceleration of e[1]commerce, the shift from offline to online, and additional services. Both companies enjoy extremely strong network effects that provide strong competitive advantages.We have trimmed Visa and Mastercard because their combined weight grew to over 12% of the Global Growth Portfolio because of their recent performance and to fund our increase in Amazon’s position size. We added to both positions when their prices were depressed due to cross-border transactions deteriorating materially from the pandemic. Cross-border volumes came roaring back when travel corridors reopened, and although we are several quarters removed from the cross-border nadir, Visa still grew volumes &gt;30% in 1Q23. Total cross-border volumes are now 132% of 2019 levels. At 4.5% each, both companies remain high conviction positions for Global Growth.”9. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $239 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 204 (GOOG), 155 (GOOGL) Bridgewater CIO Ray Dalio was bullish on Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) during Q1 after shares hit a two-year low at the end of 2022. Dalio more than tripled the size of his stake in Alphabet’s class A (GOOGL) shares during the quarter, holding just under 2.31 million of them at the end of March. GOOGL shares are having a much better 2023 so far, gaining 37%.As Baron Opportunity Fund discusses below, one of the biggest worries investors have about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) right now is how its search engine traffic will hold up against the rise of ChatGPT, which has already had 1.6 billion visitors. When users want general information on certain topics, they may be increasingly likely to seek out quick answers from the AI platform rather than wade through pages of search results (and ads), which frequently contain links to outdated or even irrelevant content. While Google plans to eventually release its own competing AI platform, if anything that will just further cannibalize its own search engine and eat into its ad revenue.Baron Opportunity Fund continues to lower its exposure to Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) given some of those worries, as it revealed in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“As we did last quarter, we continued to decrease our weighting in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) because, as stated earlier, we believe ChatGPT and/or similar AI-based services present a hard-to-measure risk to Google’s virtual search monopoly.”8. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $259 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 69 There’s been a 23% rise in hedge fund ownership of Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) over the past two quarters, with the stock sitting near its all-time high in smart money shareholders. Bridgewater Associates pared back its SBUX holding by 5% during the first quarter to 2.49 million shares.Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) continues to expand its global footprint, with plans to grow its store count to 45,000 within the next two years, which would double its store count since 2015. Starbucks plans to open about one-third of those new stores in China, where it’s understandably been facing headwinds of late, but the long-term opportunity there is tremendous. SBUX shares have dipped by 13% since the company’s latest earnings report in early May, driving their price down to 32.2x earnings, which looks reasonable.The Polen Global Growth Strategy isn’t as bullish on Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) as Bridgewater’s Ray Dalio, as it sold off its stake in the company in Q4 according to its Q4 2022 investor letter:“We also liquidated our remaining position in Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX). While the company remains a unique and resilient franchise, China is a very important growth market for the company, and zero-COVID policies have made it challenging for the company to operate in this important market. While we expect China to return to more “normal” operation at some point, any COVID flare-ups, in China or other markets, present a very real headwind to Starbucks’ profitability. L’Oreal, Estée Lauder, and other holdings continue to have meaningful exposure to China, but in each of these cases, our research indicates they’re able to better adapt to these operating challenges and realize the growth opportunity in China through their online businesses. In short, we think there are better risk-reward opportunities.”7. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $394 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 92 There was a massive spike in hedge fund ownership of Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) during Q1, as 37% more funds were long WMT at the end of Q1 than at the start of it. Louis Bacon’s Moore Global Investments and George Soros’ Soros Fund Management were among the funds adding Walmart to their 13F portfolios. On the other hand, Bridgewater’s Ray Dalio offloaded 22% of his Walmart shares during the quarter, ending March with 2.67 million of them.Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) grew e-commerce sales by 26% during the first quarter of its fiscal year 2024, while overall sales rose by 7.7% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Operating cash flow also rebounded to $4.6 billion in the quarter from a loss of $3.8 billion a year earlier.After buying back about $10 billion worth of its shares in FY 2023, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) scaled back to just $700 million in repurchases in the latest quarter. The company still has $18.6 billion remaining on its share repurchase authorization, which would buy back close to 5% of its outstanding shares.6. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $428 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 63 Closing out the first half of Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio’s top holdings in 2023 is Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), ranking sixth. The billionaire money manager trimmed his stake in the wholesale retailer by 9% during Q1, ending the quarter with 861,306 shares. He owned the largest COST position among the select group of hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey’s database.Hedge funds and analysts love Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) for its staunchly loyal customer base and its strong value proposition. Truist has a $568 price target on the stock and believes the tougher economic conditions will allow Costco to further grow its membership and gain market share. Deutsche Bank has a $574 target on COST shares.Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) has been experiencing some weakness in its discretionary categories, which led to soft March sales and negative comps for the first time in nearly seven years, excluding the pandemic. It’s likely that weakness was felt broadly across retail however and wasn’t Costco specific. Overall March sales grew by 0.5% to $21.7 billion.PepsiCo, Inc.

I call it “everyday investing.” When selecting the best stocks to buy, it’s fair to say familiarity with the companies you own is a wise strategy. But you can’t just pick companies that make products and services you use and expect to do well. Rather, you want to consider whether the companies behind them actually make money. For instance, who among us hasn’t taken an Uber (NYSE:UBER)? Yet, the company has never turned a profit and is trading 10% below where it went public in 2019.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHowever, if you shop at Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) (and can look past how it treats its workers), buying shares makes tremendous sense. The e-commerce powerhouse generated nearly $12.2 billion in operating income last year and its share price is up 815% over the past decade. Each of the names on today’s list of the best stocks to buy are companies whose products and services I use on a daily basis. SBUXStarbucks$97.75AAPLApple$177.30GOOGLAlphabet$123.67Starbucks (SBUX)Starbucks (SBUX) coffee cup on a counterSource: Natee Meepian / Shutterstock.comMost mornings, I walk three to four miles before starting my workday around 8 a.m. I always stop at my local Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) for a Venti Americano and a quick check of my emails. In one way or another, Starbucks has been a part of my daily life since the early 1990s. Because I mostly own ETFs to avoid potential conflicts of interest — not to mention it’s much easier to manage ETF portfolios than 20 or 30 stock positions — I’ve never actually held SBUX. That’s my loss, for sure. I’ve been working for 37 years. That’s so long that Starbucks hadn’t even gone public when I first started in the business world. The company’s initial public offering happened in June 1992, selling shares for $17. It raised a whopping $29 million in its IPO and the rest, as they say, is history. Story continuesIn its 31-year history as a public company, its stock has split 2-for-1 six times, the first in 1993 and the last in April 2015. So, if you bought 100 shares in its IPO for $1,700, you’d have 6,400 shares worth $625,600 today, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21%. A CAGR of half that amount would be good. No wonder why Howard Schultz is a billionaire. What I’ve learned about Starbucks over the years is that it always rebounds from adversity. In recent years, this has included labor disputes and Covid-19-related lockdowns in the United States and China, its two major markets. In the latest quarter, U.S. same-store sales grew 12%, while they rose 3% in China, the first positive quarter since fiscal Q3 2021.  Apple (AAPL)Apple Stock Looks Too Cheap Here for Investors to Pass UpSource: mama_mia / Shutterstock.comFull disclosure: I own an iPhone, two iPads, an Airbook, a Mac desktop and a pair of AirPods. You could say I like Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) products. However, the company’s services have contributed to its above-average growth in recent years. In early May, Apple reported its fiscal Q2 2023 results. Investors expected a dud of a quarter. Instead, it delivered revenue and earnings that beat analyst estimates. On the top line, it generated $94.8 billion, $1.9 billion higher than the consensus, while earnings per share of $1.52 were 9 cents higher than expectations. Apple’s Services business generated a record $20.9 billion in revenue, up 5.5% year over year. It includes Apple TV+, Apple Music and Apple Arcade and is the company’s highest-margin business segment.“We are pleased to report an all-time record in Services and a March quarter record for iPhone despite the challenging macroeconomic environment, and to have our installed base of active devices reach an all-time high,” Apple Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Tim Cook said in the company’s press release.   Of the 40 analysts covering AAPL stock, 30 rate it “overweight” or “buy,” with a median target price of $183.43, which is 3.5% above its current share price. On May 23, the company announced a multiyear agreement with Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) to develop 5G components that will allow it to develop more advanced products with American-made components, part of Apple’s commitment to invest $430 billion in the U.S. economy over five years.    Apple is Warren Buffett’s largest equity position by a country mile for a reason. Alphabet (GOOGL)Closeup logo of Google.com website on an iPhone on wooden table. GOOG stock and Google layoffsSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.comAs a freelance writer, Google Drive is my savior. I use it eight to nine hours each workday for article writing, billing, etc. I’m sure many of my InvestorPlace colleagues feel the same. As the parent company of Google, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has spent the last few years working on building revenue streams other than Google Search. It’s had middling success doing so. In 2022, Alphabet had revenue of $283 billion. Of that, Google advertising accounted for 79%. That’s broken down into three revenue streams: Google Search (72% of Google advertising), YouTube ads (13%) and Google Network (15%). The remaining revenue is split between Google Cloud (nearly 10% overall) and other (a little more than 10%), which includes Google Play, Fitbit, Google Nest, Pixel devices, YouTube Premium and YouTube TV.I can see from the paragraph above, and knowing how I benefit from Alphabet, the dilemma faced by the company. It generates revenue from me from Google Cloud and Google Workspace, and indirectly through Google Search. But, on the other hand, I don’t spend much time on YouTube, don’t use Google Play, or own any Fitbit or Nest products. So, how does it grow when other companies such as Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Amazon and Apple are nibbling on its ad business? That’s the million-dollar question.However, with the company generating more than $60 billion in free cash flow a year, it has the luxury to think further out. That’s probably one reason Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Holdings took a $1 billion position in May. On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read 10 S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats To Avoid. Over the years, there has been an observable shift in focus from growth stocks to dividend stocks in certain market environments. High inflationary periods have fared well for dividend stocks historically. Dividend investing also often aligns with a long-term investment strategy as investors may find comfort in the consistent dividend income and the potential for capital appreciation that quality dividend stocks can offer over time. In 2022, dividend aristocrat stocks outperformed the broader market, falling by just 6.21%, compared with a much harsher decline of 18.1% in the S&amp;P 500.Not only the performance of dividend stocks remained strong compared to other asset classes, but companies in the S&amp;P 500 also paid a record amount in dividend payments last year. According to a report by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, the S&amp;P 500 corporations distributed $561 billion in dividends in 2022, up from $511.2 billion in 2021. Though the market suffered some setbacks in the face of Silicon Bank Valley's failure earlier in March, global dividend payouts sustained their position. In the first quarter of 2023, global dividends grew by 12% on a headline basis to a record $327 billion, as reported by Janus Henderson Investors. The increase was mainly driven by special dividends paid by companies during the quarter.Analysts and economists are giving a positive outlook for dividend stocks as these equities held their ground during uncertain market conditions. Goldman Sachs Chief US Equity Strategist David Kostin spoke with Business Insider in April and mentioned that dividend payments are expected to grow this year as well. Here are some remarks from the analyst:""We expect that S&amp;P 500 DPS [dividend-per-share] will reach $70 in 2023 and $73 (+4%) in 2024. Recent company actions also point to a healthy dividend growth environment. The difference in outlooks for dividend and buyback growth suggests firms focusing on dividends will continue to outperform buyback stocks.""Story continuesDividend growth track records play an important role when investing in dividend stocks. These companies often exhibit solid financial health, strong cash flows, and a history of successful operations. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) are some of the most popular dividend aristocrat stocks, however, in this article, we will cover the least popular dividend aristocrats among hedge funds.25 S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats To AvoidDaily newspaper economy stock market chartOur Methodology:For this list, we scoured Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds as of Q1 2023 and picked the 25 least popular dividend aristocrats in terms of hedge fund positions.

It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. We can see that Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY) does use debt in its business. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?What Risk Does Debt Bring?Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. See our latest analysis for Sysco How Much Debt Does Sysco Carry?The chart below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Sysco had US$11.0b in debt in April 2023; about the same as the year before. However, it does have US$757.9m in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$10.2b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Strong Is Sysco's Balance Sheet?According to the last reported balance sheet, Sysco had liabilities of US$8.98b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$12.1b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$757.9m as well as receivables valued at US$5.23b due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$15.1b.While this might seem like a lot, it is not so bad since Sysco has a huge market capitalization of US$36.8b, and so it could probably strengthen its balance sheet by raising capital if it needed to. But it's clear that we should definitely closely examine whether it can manage its debt without dilution.Story continuesWe measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).Sysco has a debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.9 and its EBIT covered its interest expense 5.2 times. Taken together this implies that, while we wouldn't want to see debt levels rise, we think it can handle its current leverage. We saw Sysco grow its EBIT by 2.7% in the last twelve months. That's far from incredible but it is a good thing, when it comes to paying off debt. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Sysco's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. During the last three years, Sysco produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 64% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.Our ViewWhen it comes to the balance sheet, the standout positive for Sysco was the fact that it seems able to convert EBIT to free cash flow confidently. But the other factors we noted above weren't so encouraging. For example, its net debt to EBITDA makes us a little nervous about its debt. Looking at all this data makes us feel a little cautious about Sysco's debt levels. While debt does have its upside in higher potential returns, we think shareholders should definitely consider how debt levels might make the stock more risky. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. For example - Sysco has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.When all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

The company’s current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products. Since 2008, PMI has invested more than USD 10.5 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as post-market studies. In November 2022, PMI acquired Swedish Match – a leader in oral nicotine delivery – creating a global smoke-free champion led by the companies’ IQOS and ZYN brands. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized versions of PMI’s IQOS Platform 1 devices and consumables and Swedish Match’s General snus as Modified Risk Tobacco Products (MRTPs). As of March 31, 2023, PMI's smoke-free products were available for sale in 78 markets, and PMI estimates that approximately 18.5 million adults around the world had already switched to IQOS and stopped smoking.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read 10 S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats To Avoid. Over the years, there has been an observable shift in focus from growth stocks to dividend stocks in certain market environments. High inflationary periods have fared well for dividend stocks historically. Dividend investing also often aligns with a long-term investment strategy as investors may find comfort in the consistent dividend income and the potential for capital appreciation that quality dividend stocks can offer over time. In 2022, dividend aristocrat stocks outperformed the broader market, falling by just 6.21%, compared with a much harsher decline of 18.1% in the S&amp;P 500.Not only the performance of dividend stocks remained strong compared to other asset classes, but companies in the S&amp;P 500 also paid a record amount in dividend payments last year. According to a report by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, the S&amp;P 500 corporations distributed $561 billion in dividends in 2022, up from $511.2 billion in 2021. Though the market suffered some setbacks in the face of Silicon Bank Valley's failure earlier in March, global dividend payouts sustained their position. In the first quarter of 2023, global dividends grew by 12% on a headline basis to a record $327 billion, as reported by Janus Henderson Investors. The increase was mainly driven by special dividends paid by companies during the quarter.Analysts and economists are giving a positive outlook for dividend stocks as these equities held their ground during uncertain market conditions. Goldman Sachs Chief US Equity Strategist David Kostin spoke with Business Insider in April and mentioned that dividend payments are expected to grow this year as well. Here are some remarks from the analyst:""We expect that S&amp;P 500 DPS [dividend-per-share] will reach $70 in 2023 and $73 (+4%) in 2024. Recent company actions also point to a healthy dividend growth environment. The difference in outlooks for dividend and buyback growth suggests firms focusing on dividends will continue to outperform buyback stocks.""Story continuesDividend growth track records play an important role when investing in dividend stocks. These companies often exhibit solid financial health, strong cash flows, and a history of successful operations. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) are some of the most popular dividend aristocrat stocks, however, in this article, we will cover the least popular dividend aristocrats among hedge funds.25 S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats To AvoidDaily newspaper economy stock market chartOur Methodology:For this list, we scoured Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds as of Q1 2023 and picked the 25 least popular dividend aristocrats in terms of hedge fund positions.

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 70% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Leggett &amp; Platt, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Leggett &amp; Platt ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Leggett &amp; Platt?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Leggett &amp; Platt does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Leggett &amp; Platt's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Leggett &amp; Platt. The company's largest shareholder is State Street Global Advisors, Inc., with ownership of 13%. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 12% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 9.7% by the third-largest shareholder.After doing some more digging, we found that the top 16 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Leggett &amp; PlattThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in Leggett &amp; Platt, Incorporated. It is a pretty big company, so it is generally a positive to see some potentially meaningful alignment. In this case, they own around US$65m worth of shares (at current prices). If you would like to explore the question of insider alignment, you can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 29% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

80,f995d0b1-fbfb-3765-b962-960dc0409518,PKG,2023-06-06,Packaging Corp (PKG) Declines 20% in a Year: Will It Recover?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/packaging-corp-pkg-declines-20-143100878.html,1685975460,STORY,"['PKG', 'PNR', 'WOR']","[Shares of Packaging Corporation of America PKG have lost 20.4% in a year compared with the industry’s fall of 12.6%, reflecting the ongoing weakness in volume in the Paper segment. Elevated costs are also denting the company’s margins.Weak Packaging Demand &amp; Low Paper Volumes Ail PKGGlobal and domestic economic conditions continue to be challenging, with ongoing inflationary pressures, high interest rates and persisting supply-chain disruptions creating headwinds. Customers are working to lower their high inventory levels, impacting the order flow and demand for Packaging Corporation’s products. Containerboard production is anticipated to be lower in the upcoming quarters, and the company plans to match production with demand.The company anticipates lower prices in the Packaging segment in the second quarter of 2023 as a result of the recent decreases in the published domestic containerboard prices and lower export prices. In the Paper segment, the company will continue implementing the price increase that took effect in September 2022, with a fairly flat sales volume. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Cost Headwinds Hurt ResultsLabor costs and certain indirect costs are expected to be elevated in the upcoming quarters. Inflated prices for many chemicals, particularly starch and caustic soda, remain headwinds. This will be somewhat offset by lower wood and recycled fiber prices, energy prices, and reduced scheduled maintenance outage expenses. High interest and non-operating pension expenses and a higher tax rate are expected to hurt margins.Packaging Corp has a market capitalization of around $11 billion. It currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Let’s discuss the factors that indicate that the stock may stage a comeback despite the near-term headwinds.Solid E-commerce Growth to Buoy Packaging DemandDespite the current weakness, Packaging Corp stands to gain from strong growth in e-commerce activities that will continue to support demand for its packaging solutions.The Packaging segment accounts for around 91% of the company’s revenues. Also, packaging products are essential for distributing food, beverage and pharmaceutical products. The Packaging segment will continue to be supported by stable packaging demand for meat, fruit and vegetables, processed food, beverages, medicine, and other consumer products.Although demand in the Packaging segment fell short of the company's initial expectations in the first quarter of 2023, Packaging Corp was able to offset the negative impacts through outstanding cost-management and process-optimization efforts at its mills and corrugated product plants. Despite the weak demand, PKG continues to perform above pre-COVID levels. In spite of one fewer shipping day in the second quarter of 2023, the company anticipates increased volume for the Packaging segment.Story continuesLow Debt Levels &amp; Acquisitions to Aid GrowthThe company completed debt refinancing in October 2021, which extended its overall debt maturity from 8.5 years to 16.3 years, and lowered its overall interest rate from 3.9% to 3.5%. As of Mar 31, 2023, the company’s total debt to total capital ratio stood at 0.40, much lower than the industry’s 0.63.In December 2021, the company acquired all assets of the United States-based packaging solutions company, Advanced Packaging Corporation, in a cash-free transaction. The company acquired a full-line 500,000-square-foot corrugated products facility in Grand Rapids, MI. The deal supports Packaging Corp’s focus on enhancing its containerboard portfolio through organic box volume growth and strategic box plant acquisitions.Following the buyout, the company’s containerboard integration increased almost 80,000 tons. This will also boost its mill capacity and box plant operations. The deal is expected to be accretive to earnings.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the Industrial Products sector are Worthington Industries, Inc. WOR, The Manitowoc Company, Inc.

Also, decent liquidity will likely support capital deployment activities in the near term. However, rising costs, volatile equity markets and the deterioration of credit quality are concerning.Northern Trust’s key strength lies in its organic growth, reflected by rises in revenues and loan balances. Its revenues have been increasing over the years on rising non-interest income and NII.  In fact, management expects modest growth in core advisory fees, elimination of fee waiver and ongoing creation of new businesses to propel fee income in the upcoming period.The company’s NII and net interest margin have been rising on loan balances and rise in interest rates. Though its loan and lease balance increased over the years, the trend declined in first-quarter 2023. Nonetheless, margins are likely to get support in the quarters ahead from high interest rates and betterment of the lending scenario.Northern Trust has been focusing on reinstating its operating leverage. Management expects growth in core expenses to be less than or equal to 7% in 2023. Through such efforts, it will likely to improve productivity and meet its financial targets. Also, the ultimate measure of success of the company’s past efforts was its ability to consistently achieve its financial target of a return on equity between 10% and 15%.As of Mar 31, 2023, Northern Trust’s long-term debt of $2.07 billion was lower than its cash and due from banks, and Federal Reserve and other Central Bank deposits totaling $40.65 billion. Given the higher level of liquid assets compared with long-term obligations, debt levels seem manageable and capital deployment activities seem sustainable. Consistent dividend payments and share repurchases are likely to enhance shareholders’ value.However, Northern Trust’s non-interest expenses have been rising over the years. In fact, its costs are expected to remain high on rising compensation, and equipment and software expenses. Hence, we believe that an increasing expense trend is likely to hinder bottom-line growth in the upcoming quarters.In the first quarter, NTRS recorded a sequential rise in total non-accrual loans and $15 million of provision expense. The worsening economic outlook amid recessionary fears is expected to keep provisions and non-accrual assets high in the near term, increasing the risk of credit losses.Northern Trust’s business is affected by the changing conditions of global financial markets and general economic conditions. Weak economic conditions affected demand for trust and investment products and services. Hence, amid volatile equity markets, reduction in transaction volumes might affect earnings in the coming quarters.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 15.2% compared with a decline of 6.6% recorded by its industry over the past six months.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Finance Stocks Worth ConsideringA couple of better-ranked stocks from the finance sector are OFG Bancorp OFG and Pathward Financial Inc.

AIG is well-poised to grow due to strong Global Commercial business, improving underwriting performance and new business growth.AIG continues to benefit from strong performance in its General Insurance business and the strengthening of insurance rates. Moreover, divestitures are helping the company to streamline its business and enhance capital allocation.AIG is a leading global insurance organization providing a wide range of property casualty insurance, life insurance, retirement solutions and other financial services.Zacks Rank &amp; Price PerformanceAmerican International currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). In the quarter-to-date period, the stock has gained 9.6% compared with the industry’s growth of 2.2%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOptimistic Growth ProjectionsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for AIG’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $6.58 per share, indicating a 44.6% increase from the year-ago reported figure of $4.55. The same for AIG’s 2023 sales is pegged at $49.3 billion, indicating an 8.5% increase from the year-ago reported figure of $45.4 billion.Decent Surprise HistoryThe company beat earnings estimates in three of the last four quarters, while it missed on the other occasion, the average surprise being 9.2%.Key DriversIn the first quarter, a significant portion of AIG’s total revenues came from premiums, which improved 19.1% year over year. The figures are expected to grow further in the future due to strong performance in commercial lines and rate increases contributing to higher pricing.The General Insurance segment accounted for 56.3% of total revenues in the first quarter. This segment delivered strong results in the first quarter due to the improving performance of Lexington and Global Commercial businesses. North America Commercial is expected to aid the results of this business segments due to strong growth in net premiums thanks to Validus Re. Strong retention, rate increases and new businesses have been the key drivers for the Lexington business.Story continuesTotal net investment income increased 9.1% year over year to $3,533 million. The current rising interest rate environment should provide an impetus to growth in net investment income. In order to take advantage of higher interest rates, AIG has repositioned its General Insurance portfolio to gain higher yields but remains careful about maintaining credit quality and duration. This is likely to result in higher net investment income in 2023.AIG’s underwriting income increased 13% in the first quarter owing to its underwriting excellence. The General Insurance accident year combined ratio improved 100 basis points, highlighting improved underwriting profitability.American International is delivering well on its AIG 200 savings objective. This has helped the company streamline and modernize its technology infrastructure and operations. Moreover, with Corebridge’s deconsolidation, AIG plans to reduce its expenses by $300 million.The company rewarded its shareholders with $603 million in repurchases and dividends worth $241 million, reflecting its balanced capital management strategy. This implies that the company’s shares are a good buy for investors looking for returns in the form of dividends.AIG has a high leverage ratio which is a concern. Its net debt-to-capital of 48% at the first-quarter end was significantly higher than the industry’s average of 3.1%. Also, American International’s return on equity of 8.6% is lower than the industry’s average of 9.8%. Nevertheless, we believe that a systematic and strategic plan of action will drive growth in the long term.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks from the Multi-line Insurance space are Assurant, Inc.

AIG, Unum Group UNM, EnerSys ENS, Koppers Holdings Inc. KOP and UFP Industries, Inc. UFPI.5 Value Stocks With Impressive EV-to-EBITDA Ratios to Snap UpThe price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple enjoys wide-scale popularity among investors seeking stocks trading at a bargain. In addition to being a widely used tool for screening stocks, P/E is a popular metric to work out the fair market value of a firm. But even this ubiquitously used valuation multiple has a few limitations.Although P/E enjoys great popularity among value investors, a less-used and more-complicated metric called EV-to-EBITDA is sometimes viewed as a better alternative. EV-to-EBITDA gives the true picture of a company’s valuation and earnings potential. It has a more comprehensive approach to valuation. American International Group, Inc., Unum Group, EnerSys, Koppers Holdings Inc. and UFP Industries, Inc. are some stocks with attractive EV-to-EBITDA ratios.Is EV-to-EBITDA a Better Substitute to P/E?EV-to-EBITDA is essentially the enterprise value (EV) of a stock divided by its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). EV is the sum of a company’s market capitalization, its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents.EBITDA, the other component of the multiple, gives a better idea of a company’s profitability as it removes the impact of non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that reduce net earnings. It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows.Just like P/E, the lower the EV-to-EBITDA ratio, the more attractive it is. A low EV-to-EBITDA ratio could signal that a stock is potentially undervalued. EV-to-EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company’s balance sheet that the P/E ratio does not. Due to this reason, EV-to-EBITDA is generally used to value the potential acquisition targets as it shows the amount of debt the acquirer has to assume. Stocks boasting a low EV-to-EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates.Story continuesAnother shortcoming of P/E is that it can’t be used to value a loss-making firm. A company’s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. On the other hand, EV-to-EBITDA is difficult to manipulate and can also be used to value companies making losses but are EBITDA-positive.EV-to-EBITDA is also a useful tool in measuring the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation. Moreover, it can be used to compare companies with different levels of debt.However, EV-to-EBITDA is not devoid of shortcomings and alone cannot conclusively determine a stock’s inherent potential and future performance. The multiple varies across industries and is usually not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries, given their diverse capital expenditure requirements.Therefore, instead of just relying on EV-to-EBITDA, you can club it with the other major ratios such as price-to-book (P/B), P/E and price-to-sales (P/S), to achieve the desired results.Here are our five picks out of the seven stocks that passed the screen:American International Group is a leading global insurance organization, providing a wide range of property casualty insurance, life insurance, retirement solutions, and other financial services.

HOLX shares have gained 5.6% year to date compared with the industry’s increase of 3.1%. The Medical sector has declined 2.7% in the said time frame. With a market capitalization of $19.48 billion, the average volume of shares traded in the last three months was about 1.4 million.The higher capital equipment revenues, procedural volumes return and an acceleration from the new business lines continue to drive this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s performance. Its earnings increased 23.4% in the last five years, better than the industry’s average of 4.4%.Hologic’s ROE for the trailing 12 months was 19.4%, better than the industry average of (34.6%). It has a VGM Score of B. The VGM Score rates stocks on their combined weighted styles, helping to identify those with the most attractive value, best growth and most promising momentum.Will the Upside Continue?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Hologic’s 2024 earnings is pegged at $4.09, indicating a 5.1% increase from the year-ago reported figure. The consensus estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $4.15, indicating a year-over-year improvement of 3.7%. It has a Growth Score of B. The Growth Style Score analyzes growth prospects of the company.The company’s expanded global installed base of Panthers, over 3,250 strong represents the catalyst for the division's sustained growth. The superior workflow of the Panther combined with the broad menu of nearly 20 FDA-approved assays across the Panther and Panther Fusion systems, creates tremendous value for customers and differentiates them from competitors.To streamline its operations and reduce cost of revenues, Hologic has been adopting a few significant strategies in the past few years. The company invested deliberately and opportunistically in commercial areas where management recognized a good return. These include Hologic’s Genius marketing campaign in Breast Health, cervical cancer co-testing initiatives in Diagnostics and efforts to gain competitive market share with NovaSure. Per management, these strategic initiatives are already paying off through increased brand awareness, market share gains and price stability, all of which will contribute to the company’s higher sales.Story continuesIn this regard, the company’s international sales have been a major catalyst in the past three years, with the major driver being the molecular diagnostics business. Hologic is focused entirely on commercial infrastructure. The company has been progressing with respect to the placement of Panther instruments across the globe.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHologic is witnessing encouraging uptake of its newer assays like vaginitis panel and virals and tremendous international expansion opportunities. Hologic is also expanding internationally in breast health with a focus to continue gaining market share with the existing 3D and upgradable 2D mammography products, the same products that have established leadership positions in the United States.Hologic ended second-quarter fiscal 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $2.58 billion compared with $2.34 billion at the end of first-quarter fiscal 2023. Total long-term debt (including the current portion) was $2.79 billion at the end of the fiscal second quarter compared with $2.80 at the end of the fiscal first quarter. Although the quarter’s total debt was higher than the cash and cash equivalent level, the company has a short-term payable debt of $26 million on its balance sheet. This can be treated as a positive for the company amid the ongoing economic downturn, as it is holding sufficient cash for debt repayment.Estimate TrendsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for HOLX’s 2023 and 2024 has moved 4% and 2.3% north, respectively, in the past 90 days, reflecting analysts’ optimism.Other Key PicksHologic carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Addus Homecare Corporation ADUS, Merit Medical Systems, Inc.

AMN is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its broad array of services. The optimism led by a solid first-quarter 2023 performance and its healthcare Managed Services Program (“MSP”) are expected to contribute further. However, healthcare industry regulations and the consolidation of healthcare delivery units are major downsides.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 0.2% against a 23.1% decline of the industry and 4.2% rise of the S&amp;P 500.This renowned player in the healthcare total talent services space has a market capitalization of $3.95 billion. The company projects 3.3% growth for the next five years and expects to witness continued improvements in its business. AMN Healthcare surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, delivering an earnings surprise of 10.5%, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Broad Array of Services: We are upbeat about AMN Healthcare’s business’ gradual evolution beyond traditional healthcare staffing. The company has become a strategic total talent solutions partner for its clients. The company’s suite of healthcare workforce solutions includes MSPs, vendor management systems and medical language interpretation services.On the first-quarter 2023 earnings call in May, management confirmed that the company is continuing to elevate AMN Passport to be a digital staffing solution for all healthcare jobseekers at any stage of their careers across all businesses of AMN Healthcare.Healthcare MSP: AMN Healthcare’s unique MSP is helping the company gain market traction. Notably, the program helps streamline the entire workforce planning process, which facilitates the delivery of improved patient care. This has resulted in a large network of improved patient care and efficiency.In 2022, AMN Healthcare had approximately $5.3 billion in spend under management through its MSPs, and approximately 64% of its consolidated revenues flowed through MSP relationships.Story continuesStrong Q1 Results: Per management, the Technology and Workforce Solutions and Physician and Leadership Solutions segments exceeded expectations in the first quarter of 2023. The continued strength in AMN Healthcare’s Language Services also looks promising. The expansion of the gross margin bodes well. AMN Healthcare’s management confirmed that the company will be rolling out major enhancements to key parts of its technology. This looks promising for the stock.DownsidesHealthcare Industry Regulations: The healthcare industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state laws and regulations. AMN Healthcare provides talent solutions and technologies on a contractual basis to its clients who pay the company directly. Accordingly, Medicare, Medicaid and insurance reimbursement policy changes generally do not directly impact the company. Nevertheless, reimbursement changes in government programs, particularly Medicare and Medicaid, can and do indirectly affect the demand and the prices paid for the company’s services.Consolidation of Healthcare Delivery Units: Healthcare delivery organizations are consolidating, giving them greater leverage in negotiating service pricing. Consolidations may also result in AMN Healthcare losing its ability to work with certain clients because the party acquiring or consolidating with its client may have a previously established service provider they opt to maintain.Estimate TrendAMN Healthcare has been witnessing a negative estimate revision trend for 2023. Over the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings per share has moved 0.6% south to $8.26.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $987.9 million, suggesting a 30.8% decline from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

In the first quarter, the Critical Care segment witnessed balanced contributions from all product lines.The company continued to successfully deliver on its strategy and achieve milestones in pursuit of the significant opportunity to transform care for a large number of patients with mitral and tricuspid disease. However, mounting expenses and an unfavorable foreign currency impact are worrisome.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has decreased 11.5% against the 2.6% rise of the industry and a 4.2% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned global medical device company has a market capitalization of $51.73 billion. Edward Lifesciences has an earnings yield of 2.99% compared to the industry’s -6.92%. EW’s earnings surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in one, delivering an average surprise of 1.24%.Let’s delve deeper.UpsidesSurgical Structural Heart Looks Promising: In the first quarter, Edward Lifesciences’ Surgical Structural Heart business improved on a constant-currency basis, driven by the penetration of its premium products across all regions. The valve surgery growth was higher than the company’s expectations as hospital staffing levels improved, leading to some catch-up in procedures.The RESILIA portfolio continues to hold strong momentum globally. In addition, the company began the enrolment of its MOMENTIS clinical trial to demonstrate the durability of RESILIA in the mitral position. The increased adoption of the MITRIS Valve in the United States is encouraging.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCritical Care Business Holds Potential: In the first quarter, Critical Care sales growth was led by the Smart Recovery portfolio and the strong adoption of the Acumen IQ sensor and finger cuff featuring a unique Hypotension Prediction Index algorithm. The demand for Swan-Ganz pulmonary artery catheters and the HemoSphere monitoring platform also remained strong in the first quarter.Story continuesThe company remains excited about its pipeline of Critical Care innovations as it continues to shift its focus to Smart Recovery technologies designed to help clinicians make better decisions and get patients home to their families faster.TMTT (Transcatheter Mitral and Tricuspid Therapies) Stands Strong: In the first quarter, the segment’s performance was driven by overall transcatheter edge-to-edge repair procedure growth. The ongoing launch and the growing adoption of PASCAL Precision in Europe and the initial launch in the United States also contributed to the segment’s sales. Clinician feedback on PASCAL Precision has been consistently positive, particularly highlighting the differentiated premium features of the system.In mitral, Edwards Lifesciences looks forward to presenting one-year data from the full cohort of the CLASP IID pivotal trial later in 2023. In mitral replacement, the enrollment of the ENCIRCLE pivotal trial with SAPIEN M3 is anticipated to complete the enrollment of the main cohort around the end of 2023.Within tricuspid, FDA recently approved continued access allowing domestic hospitals involved in the clinical trial to continue to offer EVOQUE as a therapy option. In addition, the CLASP II TR pivotal trial with PASCAL continues to enroll well.DownsidesForeign Exchange Headwinds: We remain worried about the significant challenges Edward Lifesciences had to face due to an unfavorable foreign currency impact that has been adversely affecting the company’s gross margin over the past few quarters. Per management, significant currency fluctuations could have a material effect on revenues, the cost of sales and operational results.Escalated Expenses: The contraction of both the margins in the first quarter is discouraging. A year-over-year increase in SG&amp;A expenses reflected increased investments over the prior year in transcatheter field-based personnel to support the growth strategy. For the full-year 2023, EW expects R&amp;D expenses to be 17%-18% of sales, with investments in developing new technologies and generating evidence to support TAVR and TMTT.Estimate TrendEdward Lifesciences has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings per share (EPS) has moved up from $2.54 to $2.55 in the past 30 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $5.96 billion.

Nearly 65,000 members, or about 48% of those eligible, voted on the measure.""Bravo SAG-AFTRA. We are in it to win it,"" Fran Drescher, the union's president, said in a statement.Talks between the 160,000-member union, Hollywood's largest, and the major studios are scheduled to start on Wednesday.No new negotiations are scheduled with the striking Writers Guild of America (WGA), which represents 11,500 film and TV writers. Their walkout has disrupted production of late-night shows and shut down high-profile projects including a new season of Netflix's ""Stranger Things"" and a ""Game of Thrones"" spinoff for Warner Bros Discovery's HBO.Over the weekend, the studios likely averted a second work stoppage by reaching a tentative deal with the Directors Guild of America (DGA). That pact will take effect if DGA members vote to ratify it in the coming weeks.With the actors, ""we are approaching these negotiations with the goal of achieving a new agreement that is beneficial to SAG-AFTRA members and the industry overall,"" said the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which represents Walt Disney Co, Netflix Inc and other studios.A strike by actors would lead to a broader shutdown across Hollywood and increase pressure on studios that need programming to feed their streaming services and the fall TV broadcast schedule.In the negotiations, actors are seeking higher pay and safeguards against unauthorized use of their images through artificial intelligence. Their current deal expires June 30.Story continuesSAG-AFTRA leaders said the industry had changed dramatically with the rise of streaming television and the emergence of new technology such as generative AI.The coming talks ""may be one of the most consequential negotiations in the union's history,"" said chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland.""Inflation, dwindling residuals due to streaming, and generative AI all threaten actors’ ability to earn a livelihood if our contracts are not adapted to reflect the new realities,"" he said.

Discovery, NBCUniversal, Paramount, and Sony.The agreement, reached over the weekend, includes gains in wages and benefits, a 76% increase in foreign streaming residuals (a type of royalty payment), a ""groundbreaking agreement"" confirming that AI is not a person and therefore cannot perform the duties of DGA members, and the banning of live ammunition on sets after the October 2021 shooting death on the set of ""Rust.""The tentative deal will be submitted for board approval on Tuesday where further details will be revealed.The Director's Guild of America reached a tentative agreement with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers as the writers' strike enters its sixth week (ASSOCIATED PRESS)""In these negotiations we made advances on wages, streaming residuals, safety, creative rights and diversity, as well as securing essential protections for our members on new key issues like artificial intelligence – ensuring DGA members will not be replaced by technological advances,"" Jon Avnet, chair of the DGA’s Negotiations Committee, said in a statement.The news comes as Hollywood writers, represented by the Writers Guild of America (WGA), enter their sixth week of strikes. The WGA began its strike in early May in protest of higher wages and other demands amid the streaming boom. That set off a production shutdown across the entire industry.Moody's has said that some media companies could see credit ratings suffer as a result of the strike, with studio executives like Paramount Global (PARA) CEO Bob Bakish warning it could impact the company's bottom line the longer it continues.In a statement provided to Yahoo Finance, the WGA said while it congratulates the DGA on reaching an agreement, ""the AMPTP will not be able to negotiate a deal for writers with anyone but us,"" adding the studios' ""divide and conquer strategy won’t work this time.""Story continues""As always, we will see you out on the picket lines this week,” the union said.Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich wrote in a note to clients on Monday the DGA agreement does not necessitate a WGA deal due to the differences in their demands.""Studios will benefit from a temporary (i.e. a few months) but not prolonged strike as they are prepared for such a pause due to a robust backlog of content while the strike also enables a pare back in content spending,"" she added. ""If more prolonged, we anticipate studios to lean into unscripted shows and internationally produced content.""Photo by: NDZ/STAR MAX/IPx 2023 6/1/23 Members of the Writers Guild of America (WGA) and its supporters picket outside of Warner Bros Discovery, Inc. on June 1, 2023 in New York City.

Doesn’t work anymore.”In a statement to Yahoo Finance, the AMPTP said: “Member companies remain united in their desire to reach a deal that is mutually beneficial to writers and the health and longevity of the industry, and to avoid hardship to the thousands of employees who depend upon the industry for their livelihoods.”SAG-AFTRA — the union which represents approximately 160,000 actors, announcers, recording artists, and other media professionals around the world — is set to enter its negotiations with the AMPTP on Wednesday. It is currently conducting a strike authorization vote and will announce the results on Monday.In a statement, SAG-AFTRA said the DGA deal does not influence any of its own negotiating tactics.""Our bargaining strategy has never relied upon nor been dependent on the outcome or status of any other union’s negotiations, nor do we subscribe to the philosophy that the terms of deals made with other unions bind us,"" said Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, executive director at SAG-AFTRA.""We continue to stand in strong solidarity with the members of the WGA and with their strike, and we congratulate the DGA on their bargaining and look forward to reviewing the detailed terms of their agreement as soon as possible.""Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.However, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.TJX (TJX) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this parent of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and other stores a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for TJX is 7.9%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 14.6% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 10.8%.Cash Flow GrowthCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for TJX is 8.2%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 3.3%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 7.3% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 5.4%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for TJX have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1.4% over the past month.Bottom LineTJX has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that TJX is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The steady bid for gold by central banks has proven to be a compelling catalyst, pushing prices to new highs as well.Although there have been complaints from Wall St about gold’s lackluster hedging abilities, the yellow metal has performed quite well over the last five years, compounding 8.1% annually. Additionally, there are still several bullish factors that can push gold higher. With a convincing long-term technical setup, a central bank buying spree, and upgrades in the miners, gold stocks may be ready to run.One way for investors to get exposure to gold without directly buying the commodity is to invest in gold mining stocks. The Gold - Mining industry currently sits in the top 30% of the Zacks Industry Rank and boasts several top-ranked stocks. Newmont NEM, Sandstorm Gold SAND, and AngloGold Ashanti AU are all Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks, indicating upward trending earnings revisions.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTechnical SetupGold has been building out a prototypical cup and handle pattern for over a decade. If the price of gold can hold above the $2,000 level, it should signal the next big bull run is underway.Admittedly, price has experienced some trouble holding above $2,000, so there may be some more sideways consolidation before it begins to steadily trend higher again. If gold can’t hold above the $1,800 level this trade setup would be challenged, and if it is below $1,700 it is invalid.TradingViewImage Source: TradingViewCentral BanksIn 2022, central bank gold demand was the highest on record. In total, central banks purchased 1,136 tons of gold, worth ~$70 billion. Demand in 2023 is expected to slow with projections estimating ~$50 billion in gold purchases central banks. However, it is clear that central banks are very much focused on diversifying their holdings, especially away from the USD.Story continuesWorld Gold CouncilImage Source: World Gold CouncilNewmontNewmont is one of the world's largest producers of gold with several active mines in Nevada, Peru, Australia, and Ghana. As of Dec 31, 2022, Newmont had gold mineral reserves of more than 96.1 million ounces and its attributable gold production for 2022 was 6 million ounces.NEM currently earns a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), reflecting its upward trending earnings revisions. After trending lower over the last year, earnings estimates have turned sharply higher. FY23 earnings have been upgraded by 16.4% and are expected to grow 31% YoY to $2.42 per share.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNewmont is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 17.4x, which is above the industry average of 9.7x, but well below its 10-year median of 24x. As one of the leading gold mining companies in the world it is no surprise that NEM has regularly traded at a significant premium to the industry. Additionally, NEM has a generous dividend yield of 3.8%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAngloGold AshantiHeadquartered in Johannesburg, South Africa, AngloGold Ashanti is a global gold mining company with mines and exploration projects across Continental Africa, South Africa, Americas, and Australasia. It is the third-biggest gold mining company globally in terms of production. Earnings for AU have been revised significantly higher over the last two months. FY23 earnings have been boosted by 14%, and FY24 have been revised higher by 7.7%. Additionally, FY23 earnings are expected to grow 50.4% YoY, and FY24 earnings are projected to climb by 30% YoY. Furthermore, FY23 sales are expected to 20% YoY.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAU recently made some exciting strategic moves regarding its primary listing. While the company has recently shifted its focus to a set of more lucrative mines, they also require significantly more capital. In an effort to access the world largest pool of capital AngloGold Ashanti is moving its stock listing from Johannesburg to New York.  Sandstorm Gold Sandstorm Gold is a leading royalty and streaming company in the precious metals sector. With a focus on gold, Sandstorm provides upfront financing to mining companies in exchange for future streams or royalty interests.This unique business model allows Sandstorm to benefit from the long-term success of its partner mines without assuming the operational risks associated with mining operations. SAND’s diversified portfolio includes assets in various mining jurisdictions worldwide, providing exposure to a range of exploration and production opportunities.After bottoming earlier this year, FY23 earnings are now clearly trending higher. FY23 earnings estimates have been upgraded by 57% over the last two months and are expected to be flat YoY. Additionally, FY23 sales are expected to 21% YoY.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBecause of its unique business model, SAND enjoys very wide margins. Over the last five years margins have expanded by over 500%, and the company now has 54% net margins. It also means the company is much less capital intensive and has a comfortable balance sheet. With $1.9 billion in assets, and just $510 million in liabilities, the company has $1.45 billion in shareholder equity.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineWith a 5,000-year history of storing value, gold has proven its staying power. While it may not offer the same advantages of equities, gold makes for a compelling portfolio diversifier, that performs exactly when you need it most. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

100,f936c754-fe41-3c2f-9c25-74b9fcd862fd,NEM,2023-06-06,3 Stocks to Buy for 2023’s Coming Gold Rush,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-buy-2023-coming-125441440.html,1685451281,STORY,"['HG=F', 'GC=F', 'NEM', 'GOLD']","[With a potential debt ceiling resolution, gold has lost some of its shine. But don’t write off these gold mining stocks with high upside potential just yet. If we’re not already knee-deep in recession, we’re headed for one. Even the New York Federal Reserve says there’s a 68.2% chance of a recession in the next 12 months. “The probability that the country will enter a recession within the next year has risen to 68.2 percent, according to the New York Fed, which is the highest level since 1982,” they noted.Rising U.S. recession risks can easily prompt further safe-haven gold buying. And we also have to consider that high inflation is still persistent. Plus, even global central banks are racing to buy gold. In fact, in the first quarter, they bought 228t of gold – 34% higher than the previous record set in 2013. That also follows annual demand of 1,078t in 2022. That being said, analysts at UBS believe gold prices could hit $2,100 by year-end; $2,200 by March 2024.If gold can push back above $2,000, consider these three hot gold mining stocks with high upside potential.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBarrick Gold (GOLD)A pile of shining gold bars. Gold stocksSource: ShutterstockBarrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) is one of the biggest companies in the gold industry. It’s also severely oversold, just under $17 a share. GOLD is also technically oversold on RSI, MACD, and Williams’ %R. The last time these indicators became this over-extended, the stock ran from about $15.50 to $20.Operating mines and projects in 18 countries in North and South America, Africa, Papua New Guinea, and Saudi Arabia, the company’s portfolio spans the world’s most prolific gold districts. The company, which expects to produce about 4.5 million ounces of gold through 2030, carries a 2.35% dividend yield.Better, according to CEO Mark Bristow, the company is on the hunt for takeovers. He also forecasts a rally in gold and copper. “There’s significant upside risk for the gold price and the copper price” because of tightening supply for both and the shift by central banks to diversify their reserves by holding gold in place of the dollar, he told the Financial Times.Story continuesVanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX)An image of a rising bar graph on top of gold bars, representing gold stocksSource: Alexander Limbach / ShutterstockNext up, the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSEARCA:GDX) is attractive. One of the best ways to diversify at less cost is with an ETF, such as the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF.  Not only can you gain access to some of the biggest gold stocks in the world, but you can also do so at less cost.  With an expense ratio of 0.51%, the ETF holds positions in Newmont Corp. (NYSE:NEM), Barrick Gold, Franco-Nevada (NYSE:FNV), Agnico Eagle Mines (NYSE:AEM), Gold Fields (NYSE:GFI), and Wheaton Precious Metals (NYSE:WPM) to name a few. Even better, shares of mining stocks can often outperform the price of gold.That’s because higher gold prices can result in increased profit margins and free cash flow for gold miners.  In addition, top gold miners often have limited exposure to riskier mining projects.Also, according to Capital.com, “Gold miners have traditionally outperformed bullion in bullish markets, due to the way these companies use their operating leverage in order to increase profits, which leads to a boost in share prices. Thus, this is largely due to profit expansion, as miners are able to sell appreciating gold fairly quickly, thus avoiding a decline in prices, whereas their own operational costs rise much more slowly.”Newmont Corporation (NEM)Newmont logo on a mobile phone screenSource: Piotr Swat/ShutterstockOperating mines and projects in nine countries in North and South America, Africa, and Australia, Newmont Corporation’s portfolio spans the world’s top gold districts. Even better, with a dividend yield of 3.93%, Newmont Corporation is another industry’s largest gold company with 96 million ounces of gold reserves.It’s also too cheap to ignore. At strong support from late last year, NEM is also over-extended on RSI, MACD, and Williams’ %R. The last time those indicators became this over-extended at the same time, NEM jumped from about $42.50 to $52.50 in weeks. Even better, Newmont just agreed to buy Newcrest for $17.5 billion. Not only would this be one of the largest-ever gold mining deals, it could cement Newmont’s position as the world’s biggest producer of gold and increase its exposure to copper (about 50 billion pounds).On the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Ian Cooper, a contributor to InvestorPlace.com, has been analyzing stocks and options for web-based advisories since 1999.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayWall Street Titan: Here’s My #1 Stock for 2023It doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

(NYSE:M) will pay a dividend of $0.1654 on the 3rd of July. The dividend yield will be 4.3% based on this payment which is still above the industry average. View our latest analysis for Macy's Macy's' Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageIf the payments aren't sustainable, a high yield for a few years won't matter that much. Based on the last payment, Macy's was paying only paying out a fraction of earnings, but the payment was a massive 127% of cash flows. A cash payout ratio this high could put the dividend under pressure and force the company to reduce it in the future if it were to run into tough times.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 7.3%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 15% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityAlthough the company has a long dividend history, it has been cut at least once in the last 10 years. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.80 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $0.662. The dividend has shrunk at around 1.9% a year during that period. Generally, we don't like to see a dividend that has been declining over time as this can degrade shareholders' returns and indicate that the company may be running into problems.Dividend Growth Is DoubtfulWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share is growing. It's not great to see that Macy's' earnings per share has fallen at approximately 6.3% per year over the past five years. Declining earnings will inevitably lead to the company paying a lower dividend in line with lower profits. Earnings are predicted to grow over the next year, but we would remain cautious until a track record of earnings growth is established.Macy's' Dividend Doesn't Look SustainableOverall, we don't think this company makes a great dividend stock, even though the dividend wasn't cut this year. While Macy's is earning enough to cover the payments, the cash flows are lacking. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

However, the company's fundamentals look pretty decent, and long-term financials are usually aligned with future market price movements. Particularly, we will be paying attention to General Dynamics'  ROE today.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. See our latest analysis for General Dynamics How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for General Dynamics is:18% = US$3.4b ÷ US$19b (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.18 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.A Side By Side comparison of General Dynamics' Earnings Growth And 18% ROETo begin with, General Dynamics seems to have a respectable ROE. Especially when compared to the industry average of 12% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. Given the circumstances, we can't help but wonder why General Dynamics saw little to no growth in the past five years. Based on this, we feel that there might be other reasons which haven't been discussed so far in this article that could be hampering the company's growth. For example, it could be that the company has a high payout ratio or the business has allocated capital poorly, for instance.Story continuesWe then compared General Dynamics' net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 5.7% in the same period, which is a bit concerning.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is GD fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is General Dynamics Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Despite having a normal three-year median payout ratio of 41% (implying that the company keeps 59% of its income) over the last three years, General Dynamics has seen a negligible amount of growth in earnings as we saw above. Therefore, there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline.Moreover, General Dynamics has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 38%. As a result, General Dynamics' ROE is not expected to change by much either, which we inferred from the analyst estimate of 20% for future ROE.SummaryOn the whole, we do feel that General Dynamics has some positive attributes. However, given the high ROE and high profit retention, we would expect the company to be delivering strong earnings growth, but that isn't the case here. This suggests that there might be some external threat to the business, that's hampering its growth. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum.

The industry is gaining from positive momentum in Macau’s gaming revenues. Moreover, robust demand for sports betting is aiding the industry. The expansion of online betting offerings bodes well. Stocks like DraftKings Inc. DKNG, Wynn Resorts, Limited WYNN and Corsair Gaming, Inc. CRSR are likely to gain traction from this upbeat demand.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Gaming industry includes companies, which primarily own and operate integrated casinos, hotels and entertainment resorts. Some industry players also deliver technology products and services across lotteries, electronic gaming machines, sports betting and interactive gaming. Some industry participants develop and operate gaming establishments and associated lodging, restaurant, horse racing and entertainment amenities. Some companies are also involved in developing and selling gaming applications. Additionally, e-sport or sporting event or tournament services, content management system, video software, mobile applications and e-sports data platform solutions are provided.Key Themes Shaping the Gaming IndustryVisitation Improving: The industry is benefiting from improving visitation. In May, Macau’s gross gaming revenues (GGR) surged 365.9% year over year to MOP$15.57 billion (US$1.93 billion). For the first five months of February GGR is up 172.9% year over year. Notably, companies continue to focus on the level of services and staffing with selective amenities, and enhanced safety and social-distancing protocols in the gaming floor to welcome gamers. However, easing of restrictions and investment will boost gaming revenues in Macau. In the next 10 years, six casinos companies will invest nearly $15 billion.U.S. Commercial Gaming Revenues Make Record: The gaming industry in the United States continues to perform better-than-expected. Per the American Gaming Association data, revenues from gambling hit a record high of $60.42 billion in 2022. In 2022, sports betting increased 72.7% year over year. In first-quarter of 2023, U.S. commercial gaming revenues reached $16.6 billion. This marks the industry’s eighth straight record-breaking quarter. The U.S. gaming industry will continue to improve.  Sports Betting a Major Driver: The legalization of sports betting in Delaware, Mississippi, New Jersey, New Mexico, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Montana, Indiana, Tennessee, Illinois and New Hampshire has been driving growth. Moreover, bettors can place wagers via the digital platforms in Connecticut, Kentucky, Michigan, Massachusetts, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, Kansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina, California, Oregon, Arizona, Montana, Colorado and other states. Some popular gaming applications include DraftKings, Barstool, FanDuel, BetMGM, BetRivers, Fox Bet and BetMonarch.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Gaming industry is grouped within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector.  It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #63, which places it in the top 25% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates gloomy near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually gaining confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. Since Feb 28, 2023, the industry’s northbound estimate for the current year has increased 181.8%.We will present a few gaming stocks that one can add to the investment portfolio, given their strong fundamentals.

The industry currently has a forward 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 13.41.

A company with a favorable efficiency level is expected to provide stellar returns as it is believed to be positively correlated with price performance.However, at times it becomes difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company. This is why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks. These efficiency ratios are:These efficiency ratios are:Receivables Turnover: This is the ratio of 12-month sales to four-quarter average receivables. It shows a company’s potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit. A high receivables turnover ratio or the “accounts receivable turnover ratio” or “debtor’s turnover ratio” is desirable as it shows that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers.Asset Utilization: This ratio indicates a company’s capability to convert assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level. It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last four-quarter average of total assets. Like the above ratios, high asset utilization may indicate that a company is efficient.Inventory Turnover: The ratio of the 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a four-quarter average inventory is considered one of the most popular efficiency ratios. It indicates a company’s ability to maintain a suitable inventory position. While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS, a low value indicates that the company is facing declining sales, which has resulted in excess inventory.Story continuesOperating Margin: This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period. It measures a company’s ability to control operating expenses. Hence, a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers.Here are the top four stocks that made it through the screen:Wynn Resorts is a leading developer, owner and operator of casino resorts. The Wynn Resorts has an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 67.2%.Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri is the leading provider of mobile communications services in Turkey.

However, when several insiders are buying, like in the case of NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NRG), it sends a favourable message to the company's shareholders.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for NRG Energy NRG Energy Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by President Mauricio Gutierrez for US$480k worth of shares, at about US$32.03 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, at around the current price, which is US$33.30. That means they have been optimistic about the company in the past, though they may have changed their mind. We do always like to see insider buying, but it is worth noting if those purchases were made at well below today's share price, as the discount to value may have narrowed with the rising price. In this case we're pleased to report that the insider purchases were made at close to current prices.While NRG Energy insiders bought shares during the last year, they didn't sell. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeNRG Energy is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this free list of growing companies with insider buying.Insider OwnershipLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Insiders own 1.0% of NRG Energy shares, worth about US$80m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.Story continuesSo What Do The NRG Energy Insider Transactions Indicate?The fact that there have been no NRG Energy insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. But insiders have shown more of an appetite for the stock, over the last year. Overall we don't see anything to make us think NRG Energy insiders are doubting the company, and they do own shares. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 2 warning signs with NRG Energy and understanding these should be part of your investment process.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

This move lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.2%. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.59%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 1.54%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the parent company of Florida Power &amp; Light Co. Had lost 2.2% over the past month. This has was narrower than the Utilities sector's loss of 3.68% and lagged the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.14% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from NextEra Energy as it approaches its next earnings report date. The company is expected to report EPS of $0.78, down 3.7% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $6.59 billion, up 27.21% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $3.11 per share and revenue of $26.48 billion. These totals would mark changes of +7.24% and +26.37%, respectively, from last year.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for NextEra Energy. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988.

The world’s 20 largest hedge funds collectively hold $45 trillion of assets under management. The largest hedge fund in the U.S., Bridgewater Associates, manages $126 billion. These massive funds often buy and sell billions of dollars worth of stock at a time, moving markets in the process.When a hedge fund takes a big position in a stock, it is viewed as a vote of confidence in the company and the future direction of the share price. Conversely, when hedge funds liquidate a position, it is taken as a sign by other investors that it’s time to sell. The latest moves by U.S. hedge funds were recently disclosed as part of regulatory disclosure requirements. This allows us to see what stocks hedge funds bought and sold during the first quarter of 2023.Here is a look at three stocks that hedge funds have ghosted big-time.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTSLATesla$201.16BKBank of New York Mellon$40.69DISDisney$87.82Tesla (TSLA)A person walks past the storefront of a Tesla (TSLA) store with several vehicles visible behind a glass doorSource: Ivan Marc / Shutterstock.comSoros Fund Management, the family office of billionaire investor George Soros, is a fund many investors look to for guidance. Accordingly, when this hedge fund sold its entire stake in electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) during this year’s first quarter, investors perked up.Soros dumped TSLA stock in relatively short order. His hedge fund loaded up on TSLA stock throughout the fourth quarter of 2022, when its share price fell 60% between the start of October and the end of December. The stock literally bottomed on January 3 of this year before rising 92% during the first quarter, peaking on March 31.So far in the second quarter, TSLA stock has pulled back 7%. Soros and other hedge fund managers seem to have timed the dip and rise in Tesla’s share price perfectly. Now that the stock is again slumping, Soros and others have exited their position in Tesla and moved onto new investments. In Soros’ case, he opened a new stake in Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).Story continuesThe exit from Tesla seems to have been well-timed, to say the least. Tesla is likely to continue to struggle with weak consumer demand and declining sales. The company’s CEO Elon Musk said during a Q1 earnings call that he sees an “uncertain” macroeconomic environment ahead. I think Soros is right to be selling here, and this is a stock I’d be cautious of right now.Bank of New York Mellon (BK)Sign of BNY Mellon Wealth Management. The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) is an American banking and financial services holding company.In general, hedge funds were net sellers of bank stocks during Q1, following the failure of multiple regional lenders across the U.S. Notably, one of the biggest sales occurred with Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK).Famed investor Warren Buffett, who has historically been bullish on banks, sold his entire position in Bank of New York Mellon during Q1. This came as the Oracle of Omaha loaded up on more shares of Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). Many hedge fund managers also offloaded their holdings in Bank of New York Mellon, as the situation with mid-sized lenders in the U.S. deteriorated in the first few months of the year.Why did hedge funds and other notable investors sell their stakes in BK stock? Likely because Bank of New York Mellon has a large number of uninsured deposits. According to Visual Capitalist, 92% of the deposits held at Bank of New York Mellon are uninsured. The federal government in Washington, D.C. insures deposit amounts up to $250,000. Any more is not insured, which can lead bank customers to withdraw funds if they feel a bank is on shaky ground. Should enough customers pull their deposits at once, it can lead to a run on the bank. That’s what brought down regional lenders such as Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.Hedge fund managers, and Warren Buffett, clearly didn’t feel comfortable with the level of uninsured deposits at Bank of New York Mellon and dumped BK stock as a result. Year to date, BK stock is down 12%.Disney (DIS)dis stock the Disney logo in red font on a storefrontSource: David Tran Photo / Shutterstock.comThe Magic Kingdom might be the happiest place on earth, but Disney (NYSE:DIS) was not the best place to invest capital judging by the way hedge fund managers and other prominent investors dumped the stock during Q1. Many hedge funds dramatically trimmed their holdings of DIS stock during the first quarter, with some exiting their entire position. For example, Soros Fund cut its stake in Disney stock by 75%. The selloff among hedge funds has helped push Disney’s share price down 20% over the past 12 months and near a 52-week low.Perhaps hedge fund managers are concerned about the ongoing restructuring at Disney that’s being orchestrated by interim CEO Bog Iger? Or maybe they’re concerned about softening user numbers at the Disney+ streaming service? Or they might be irritated that the company has yet to reinstate the dividend it suspended during the pandemic? They could also be miffed about the ongoing feud with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis?Whatever the reasons, hedge funds seem to have had enough of the Mouse House, offloading DIS stock mightily during the first three months of the year.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in BAC and DIS.

For more stocks, head on over to 5 High Quality S&amp;P 500 Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On.As the first half of 2023 comes to an end, the primary concern on anyone's mind is whether there will be a recession this year. Courtesy of modern day data collection and analysis capabilities, policymakers are able to have some insight into how the economy is performing to tailor their decisions accordingly. And this data is crucial in enabling the Federal Reserve to decide whether it will further increase interest rates or consider pausing and gradually bringing them down.On this front, June started with a crucial data reading from the Labor Department. This revealed that the labor market remained strong and added 339,000 jobs in May. This indicates that despite the record interest rate hikes by the Fed, the economy remains resilient - lending credence to speculation that perhaps more interest rate increases might be on the cards. However, for the interest rate bears, the unemployment rate also increased by 0.3% to sit at 3.7% - the largest jump since the start of the coronavirus pandemic's economic disruption in April 2020.So what does this mean for the stock market? In more normal times, a potential economic slowdown would lead to the stock market dropping as well - but the contrarian nature of the two primary metrics within this report made studying the immediate impact on the market even more interesting. Overall, markets reacted positively, as the NASDAQ index rose by 1%, the S&amp;P 500 by 1.45%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) by 2.12%. This indicated that investors had taken the rise in unemployment and a reduction in wage growth as the primary takeaway from the labor report, using these to form opinions that believe that the Fed will not deliver an interest rate hike late this month.Story continuesHowever, the jobs report is only one part of the Fed's decision making process. An equally important metric is the inflation report that will come out on the same day the Fed officials will meet to set the policy rate. And while there are few estimates available as to what might happen later this month, there are other metrics that point at the consumer and broader economic sentiment. One such metric is the Consumer Confidence Index which aims to look at household expectations of their financial situations for the near future. This index dropped to 102.3 in May from 103.7 in April as the broader gloom about the debt ceiling standoff between Congress and the President weighed on consumers' minds. At the same time, long term inflation expectations also dropped and stood at 6.1% for the next twelve months as they marked a new low since January 2021.Speaking of which, it's not only the households that believe inflation will come down. The two-year breakeven inflation (BEI) rate for inflation protection bonds dropped below 2% in May for the first time in years, indicating that bond investors believe that inflation will fall below this rate in the coming years as well. This is in strong contrast to a reading of 3% for the start of 2023. Finally, Fed Funds Futures pricing data gathered through the CME FedWatch Tool shows that there is a 75% probability that interest rates will remain unchanged this month. However, this might make for some early optimism since the picture changes when we consider the outlook for July. For July, there is a 53.5% probability that the Fed will deliver a 25 basis point hike.So how is this choppy environment making an impact on investment managers? Well, on this front, the management of Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) shared some insights at the bank's earnings call for the first quarter of 2023 where they outlined:Overall margin in the Wealth Management business was 26%, impacted by modest increases in credit reserves, slightly lower growth of NII versus forecast and ongoing integration expenses. We continue to focus on the levers within our control with an eye towards expense management. In ISG, underwriting and M&amp;A remain very subdued. As I have said previously, these are revenues delayed, not dead. Already, we are seeing a growing M&amp;A pipeline and some spring-like signs of new issuance emerging. That said, it largely remains a back half 2023 and full year 2024 story.On the positive side, our fixed income and equity trading teams performed very well in managing through some historic rate moves.Total trading revenues were solid. I expect the markets to remain choppy through this earnings season and for the next several months. However, absent any geopolitical surprise or limited progress on bringing down inflation, I think 2023 is likely to end on a constructive note in most areas. Morgan Stanley is very well positioned not just for 2023, but for several years ahead as we see significant growth opportunities across all three of our client platforms.I will now pass it over to Sharon for more details on the first quarter. Sharon Yeshaya Thank you, and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $14.5 billion in the first quarter, our EPS was $1.70, and our ROTCE was 16.9%. The firm’s results demonstrated the durability of our business model, evidenced by the resilient ROTCE, robust asset consolidation and wealth and our stable capital and liquidity levels.In institutional securities, fixed income and equity supported our clients while navigating volatile markets.

Shoppers often could afford to buy only very small amounts of some essentials - sometimes as little as a cup of washing powder at a time.But that meant they were actually paying more per cup. As anyone who has ever shopped at warehouse clubs knows, buying in bulk gets you discounts, thanks in large part to less packaging. Buying goods in small, prepackaged containers means paying more.Mitha, 33, and Biraghi, 34, who for the previous four years had been building internet-enabled dispensing and supply chain tech to distribute condoms and HIV testing kits, thought they knew a way to use technology to eliminate this so-called poverty tax - by helping customers purchase only as much of a good as they needed.Their company, Novek, is now piloting an Internet of Things-enabled machine that allows Kibera shopkeepers to accurately dispense as little as a few cents' worth of washing powder into reusable containers and sell it at the same price as if it were being sold in bulk - increasing sales and profit margins for store owners while reducing single-use plastic, a major contributor to water pollution.""We believe that if we improve both the product small business owners deliver to customers and their incomes, we will ultimately drive economic prosperity for everyone,"" Mitha says.Dubbed the ""Silicon Savannah,"" Kenya has become a hotbed of innovation as entrepreneurs like Mitha take advantage of its extensive high-speed internet, deep mobile phone penetration, and widely used digital payments infrastructure to develop products and services to strengthen the economy, improve everyday life and create opportunities for more people.Story continuesCalculating that Kenyans spend over $300 million a year on washing powder, Mitha says Novek is already drawing interest from multinational consumer-goods companies looking for more reliable and greener ways to reach customers.By using IoT - which allows machines equipped with sensors and software to use the internet to connect with other devices - manufacturers can track their product from the time it leaves the factory to when it is sold in Kibera's tin-roofed kiosks, giving them real-time insights into a retailer's inventory and triggering restocking, which makes the supply chain more resilient. It could help them reduce the plastic used to package tiny quantities of washing powder - which can make up some 20% of the cost - and pass those savings back to low-income consumers through cheaper prices.Novek has been able to speed up the research and development needed for its detergent dispenser machines so they're ready for shopkeepers to test thanks to a grant from the Strive Community Innovation Fund, which last year awarded a total of $1 million to eight enterprises focused on creating ways to strengthen small businesses' digital capabilities. Strive Community is part of a portfolio of programs launched by the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth with Caribou Digital.Designed to save space in cramped shops while being simple to use, the IoT machines can dispense amounts as small as a few ounces and pull in penny-conscious shoppers. The hope is that by bringing in more customers, the shops will do better and help the whole economy thrive.For Kibera shopkeeper Brian, the bright yellow dispenser Novek recently installed in his shop is already proving a hit with customers and tripling the amount of detergent he sells each week.It's also a way he can help cut down on plastic packaging, which invariably ends up being burnt in Kibera's massive garbage dumps or clogging its already polluted streams.""Customers here are attracted by new things in the market, and technology is something that really piques their interest. The more curious they are, the more word spreads,"" he says. ""They prefer the machine-dispensed soap because it gives them more for their money than the prepackaged sachets.""Mitha says Novek's dispensers can eventually be used with many products, such as sugar or honey, in low-income areas around the world.""The vision here,"" he says, ""is that this is viable everywhere in the world where people buy small quantities of goods. The scope is global.""Originally published by The Mastercard Center for Inclusive GrowthCheck out more content from The Mastercard Center for Inclusive GrowthView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from The Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: The Mastercard Center for Inclusive GrowthWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/mastercard-center-inclusive-growthEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: The Mastercard Center for Inclusive GrowthView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/759350/Mastercard-How-an-IoT-Startup-Is-Tackling-Single-Use-Plastic-One-Load-of-Laundry-at-a-Time]"

Ford Donohue, a financial advisor at Homrich Berg, spoke with Fortune in May to emphasize the importance of dividend-growing companies. Here are some comments from the analyst:Story continues“A diversified portfolio of dividend-growing stocks provides income in the form of dividends that should grow over time to offset the impact of inflation. We also believe that consistent dividend growth is a sign of a sound business model, balance sheet strength, and strong corporate governance, all of which should lead to the growth of the underlying business over time and increase the chances of capital appreciation of the stock.”Some of the best tech stocks like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon.com, Inc.

Highlights in 2022 include:We continued to work with the National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology (NCWIT) as an investment-level collaborator to promote opportunities for gender diversity in technology and computing. As part of this, we continued to participate in Technolochicas, a national initiative of NCWIT, and we announced our very own Technolochica. Technolochicas uses the powerful stories of Latinas from diverse backgrounds in technology fields to raise awareness among young Latinas and their families about opportunities and careers in technology. Our Technolochica will contribute to the initiative by helping to promote our Company's commitment to hiring diverse candidates and will also serve as a role model for future generations of Latina technologists.We celebrated our fourth year of membership with Reboot Representation Tech Coalition, including our continued support for Reboot's mission to close the gender gap for underrepresented women of color in tech. Reboot and its coalition company members seek to design solutions to include the most underrepresented communities to increase Black, LatinX and Native American women's participation in technology and STEM. These solutions involve developing a pipeline from K-12 schools to colleges and graduate institutions, and to develop skills to prepare these young women for professions in tech. We also participated in Reboot's inaugural mentorship program, which aimed to introduce Black, Latina and Native American women undergraduates in computing to role models who look like them.We continued to be an Inclusion Works Partner with Disability:IN, the leading nonprofit resource for business disability inclusion worldwide. Our collaboration includes participating in speaking engagements for global audiences and implementing recommended best practices across our workplace. In 2022, our CEO signed Disability:IN's CEO Letter on Disability Inclusion, to continue advancing equality and inclusion and to serve as a positive example for disability inclusion for CEOs and organizations globally. We were also recognized as a Disability Equality Index® Top Scorer and Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion for the eighth consecutive year.We held the Racial Justice Giving Initiative (RJGI) as part of our ongoing effort to collaborate with our employees to support racial justice in the United States. Through the RJGI, employees nominate nonprofit organizations that are working to drive systemic change in racial justice and equity. The RJGI Committee then evaluates the nominations based on pre-determined criteria and selects organizations to participate. Beyond awarding funding from the Qualcomm Foundation and the DEI team, the initiative culminates in a TED Talk-style event for all employees during which the selected organizations share presentations about their work. In 2022, the recipients of the RJGI were ACLU Foundation of San Diego &amp; Imperial Counties; Center for Effective Public Policy; Creating Coding Careers; Friends in Need Children's Center, Inc.; Front Porch Arts Collective of Boston; Girls Inc. of San Diego County; Greater Than Tech; La Maestra Family Clinic, Inc.; Motus Theatre; and RISE San Diego.Story continuesLearn more in Qualcomm's 2022 Corporate Responsibility ReportQualcomm, Monday, June 5, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Qualcomm on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: QualcommWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/qualcommEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: QualcommView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/759281/Qualcomms-Collaborations-with-External-Organizations]"

Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Qualcomm (QCOM).Qualcomm currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.69, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 21 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.69 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 21 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 14 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 66.7% and 4.8% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for QCOMBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for QCOMCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Qualcomm here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Qualcomm, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Should You Invest in QCOM?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Qualcomm, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 14.4% over the past month to $8.32.Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for Qualcomm. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for Qualcomm with a grain of salt.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The good news? Plenty of discount sites for booking travel are out there to help you save big. Plus, you might even score some rewards and perks in the process.I’m a Financial Planning Expert: Here Are 5 Things You Should Never Spend Money on If You Want To Be RichLearn: How To Build Your Savings From ScratchHere are seven top sites to consider using when you’re ready to book your next trip.Expedia“I prefer the Expedia website because it offers all services like hotels, flights, rental cars and vacation bundles,” said Elice Max, co-owner and marketing director of EMUCoupon. “Expedia offers a rewards program to its customers that makes it unique. You’ll get a few rewards as soon as you sign up, like discounts and extra amenities at select hotels.”Max added, ” And as you travel more and reach higher membership levels, you’ll gain access to more perks, such as point upgrades and free late checkouts. For instance, once you collect 10 Trip Elements in a year — such as flight tickets, car rentals and per-night hotel stays — you’ll gain access to the Silver rewards tier and earn 2 points for every $1 you spend. When you collect 25 Trip Elements in a year, you’ll earn 3 points per $1. You can use those points toward future bookings on the Expedia site.”Booking.com“Booking.com is also the most popular online travel site. It has grown in popularity because it allows you to book all types of lodging like apartments, resorts, villas, hostels, bed and breakfasts, guesthouses and even farms and boats,” said Max. “In general, you’ll find information here that you won’t find on many other travel websites.”Booking.com also has its own loyalty program called Genius, which features three rewards levels related to overnight stays you book:Genius Level 1: Automatic and offers a 10% discount on the price of your stay before taxes and fees.Genius Level 2: Unlock lifetime access once you book and complete five stays within two years. You’ll receive a 10-15% discount on the price of your stay before taxes and fees, free breakfast and a free room upgrade.Genius Level 3: Unlock lifetime access once you complete 15 stays in two years. You’ll get up to a 20% discount on the price of your stay before taxes and fees, free breakfast and room upgrades and direct access to a live agent to discuss your bookings.Story continuesTake Our Poll: Are You Concerned About the Safety of Your Money in Your Bank Accounts?Hopper“This is more of an app rather than a site, but I really love the hands-off approach to booking,” said Consumer Analyst Julie Ramhold with DealNews. “I don’t have to constantly check to find the best deals — I just set up my travel time and route, and Hopper will let me know when to book. It also highlights how much prices are expected to drop and when they’re expected to start rising again, and how much they’ll go up closer to your departure date.”Ramhold continued, “You can also earn Carrot Cash now on your bookings which results in even further savings down the road. Plus Hopper has more than just flights now — you can find hotels, cars, and even homes if you want to rent something larger than just a standard hotel room. And if you’re eco-conscious, Hopper plants trees with every booking to offset the carbon emissions, so that’s another huge perk.”Skyscanner“This is a site that is similar to Hopper and can handle booking flights, hotels, and car rentals as well. I really like that you can do price alerts with them, and also check nearby airports as well as opt for non-stop flights only,” Ramhold said. “You can also sign up for updates so that you can be notified when things open up again. The site makes it easy to find last-minute flights, too — those that are leaving within 90 days — so if you need to get away, this is a great section to browse. Booking is transparent too, with no hidden fees so you’ll know exactly what every cent is going towards when you pay.”Orbitz“My favorite discount travel booking site is Orbitz, a long-time OTA with its rewards program called the Orbitz Rewards,” said Georgia McBroom, co-founder of CamperFAQs. “The 1-3% purchase price back, called Orbucks, from hotel accommodations, flight deals and vacation packages can be used as payment for future hotel bookings. Joining the program is free, giving you access to perks and low-price guarantees on flights. On top of that, it refunds the difference when you find a cheaper flight deal from a different site.”You can get even more rewards if you book your hotels, flights, vacation packages and activities through the Orbitz app.Hotels.com“While there are seemingly countless travel booking sites all boasting deals and discounts, they’re actually almost all owned by the same handful of companies,” said Lauren Keys of Trip of a Lifestyle. “That means, the deals will be pretty consistent across these brands, so you’ll really only save more if the booking site has a rewards program.”Keys continued, “Hotels.com has the best rewards program, offering you a free night after you stay 10. It’s the best deal out there at about 10% back on what you spend booking through their site (most other rewards programs are in the 1-5% back range).”You’ll also get instant access to better pricing on accommodations when you book at Hotels.com — about 10% off.KAYAK“KAYAK has always been my favorite discount travel booking site. It is incredibly easy to use and reliable for offering the cheapest rates around,” said Larry Snider, VP of Operations of Casago Vacation Rentals. “My favorite feature about KAYAK is the ability to track flights and accommodation costs. You can get notified when the best time to buy is, and when it is better to wait it out.”KAYAK also has a loyalty program called KAYAK Explorer. By signing up and booking through KAYAK’s mobile app, you’ll earn Explorer Points good for perks and rewards, such as gift cards, prepaid debit cards and discounts on dining and travel. Plus, once you sign up for the KAYAK app, you’ll receive 2,000 Explorer points as a thank you.More From GOBankingRatesWhy Stealth Wealth Is the Best Way To Handle Your MoneyVote for Your Favorite: GOBankingRates' Top 100 Most Influential Money Experts3 Ways to Recession Proof Your Retirement7 Things You Must Do To Create a Plan for Your MoneyThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 7 Top Discount Sites for Booking Travel and Saving Big]"

The stock outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.2%. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.59%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 1.54%.Heading into today, shares of the aerospace and defense company had lost 0.23% over the past month, outpacing the Aerospace sector's loss of 0.34% and lagging the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.14% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Lockheed Martin as it approaches its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $6.41, up 222.11% from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $15.78 billion, up 2.15% from the year-ago period.LMT's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $27.09 per share and revenue of $65.76 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -0.51% and -0.34%, respectively.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Lockheed Martin.

PHM has gained 52.4% so far this year compared with the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry’s 32% growth, the Zacks Construction sector’s 16.9% rise and the S&amp;P 500 Index’s 12.7% rally.PHM has been riding on land acquisition strategies and focusing on entry-level buyers. Also, business expansion via community openings in various locations bodes well. The company regularly raises shareholders’ value via repurchases and dividend distributions, boosting investors’ sentiment.Although a challenging sales environment, higher cancellation rates, supply-chain issues and significant inflation are major concerns, the improving interest rate environment is raising hope. Also, the lack of existing homes for sale, a focus on cost control, more stabilized mortgage rates, increased operating leverage and important buyouts have been boosting  its confidence. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Let’s delve deeper into the factors influencing this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company.Land Acquisition &amp; Development to Improve ProfitabilityPulteGroup’s land acquisition strategies aim to improve volumes, revenues and profitability on an annual basis. In first-quarter 2023, it spent $906 million on land acquisition and development. PHM expects the land acquisition and development spend in 2023 to be within $3.5-$4 billion, up from the previously considered value of $3.3 billion. Of these, it estimates 65% will go toward developing owned land positions.Apart from this, PulteGroup’s land strategy emphasizes investing in shorter-lived, smaller land assets while expanding the use of land option agreements when possible, thereby mitigating market risk.The company’s first-quarter 2023 results posted a 28% increase in earnings per share (EPS) and a 12-month return on equity of 32%. The solid EPS was driven by a 13.5% increase in revenues, improved gross margins and overhead leverage. The company also witnessed solid gross orders, closings and margins in the quarter.Story continuesCost Control &amp; Focus on First-Time/Entry-Level BuyersTo mitigate the accelerated raw material prices, PHM and its peers have undertaken various cost control measures and focused on making the homebuilding platform more efficient, which in turn is resulting in higher operating leverage. Homebuilders have been controlling construction costs by designing homes efficiently and obtaining construction materials and labor at competitive prices.PulteGroup remains focused on the growing demand for entry-level homes, which aim at lower-priced homes, given affordability concerns prevailing in the U.S. housing market. First-time buyers increased by 18% to 3,177 homes for first-quarter 2023. It comprised 39% of first-timers, 35% of move-ups and 26% of active adults. The shift from mix to first-time is in line with its strategy of having more than one-third of business in the first-time buyer space.Community Expansion Strategy to Offset Inflationary WoesChanging demography has lifted demand for new homes in lower-density markets, including small metro areas, rural markets and large metro exurbs, as people seek larger homes to work from home amid the pandemic. The desire for more space and amenities to accommodate working and learning from home should continue to boost the U.S. housing market in the near term.PHM has been expanding its reach in various markets via community openings and recently announced community openings in various locations. On Mar 16, it unveiled a new community in Louisville, The Trails at Belmond. On Mar 8, it introduced expansion in the Greenville market with three new construction communities within its Pulte Homes brand.Driving Shareholder ValuePHM has been paying quarterly dividends for nearly four decades. It has consistently focused on sharing its cash flows with shareholders and maintaining a solid financial position. In December 2022, it announced a quarterly dividend hike of 7% to 16 cents per share. PHM repurchased 2.8 million shares in first-quarter 2023 for $150 million. At the end of first-quarter 2023, PHM declared cash dividends of $36.1 million. As of Mar 31, 2023, the company had $232.9 million remaining in authorization. On Apr 24, 2023, its board of directors increased the share repurchase authorization by $1 billion.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther top-ranked stocks in the same industry are Taylor Morrison Home Corporation TMHC, Beazer Homes USA BZH and M/I Homes MHO.Scottsdale, AZ-based Taylor Morrison’s ongoing operational enhancements, acquisition synergies and robust pricing power have more than offset the inflationary pressure and delays in some closings. The company’s well-balanced, diverse mix of portfolio and operating strategy is encouraging. The success of its efforts has been driving growth for the company and enhancing its liquidity level, enabling it to take advantage of investment opportunities as the market evolves.TMHC currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

(TPH) Hits Fresh High: Is There Still Room to Run?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tri-pointe-homes-inc-tph-131504554.html,1685970904,STORY,"['TPH', 'PHM']","[Have you been paying attention to shares of Tri Pointe Homes (TPH)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 6.4% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $31.25 in the previous session. Tri Pointe Homes has gained 67.7% since the start of the year compared to the 17.7% move for the Zacks Construction sector and the 32.6% return for the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on April 27, 2023, Tri Pointe reported EPS of $0.73 versus consensus estimate of $0.42.For the current fiscal year, Tri Pointe is expected to post earnings of $3.07 per share on $3.4 billion in revenues. This represents a -44.58% change in EPS on a -20.89% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $3.57 per share on $3.81 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 16.39% and 12.13%, respectively.Valuation MetricsTri Pointe may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Tri Pointe has a Value Score of A. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and C, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.Story continuesIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 10.2X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 8.7X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 5.1X versus its peer group's average of 5.2X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 0.78. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Zacks RankWe also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Tri Pointe currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Tri Pointe passes the test. Thus, it seems as though Tri Pointe shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.How Does TPH Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of TPH have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is PulteGroup, Inc. (PHM). PHM has a Zacks Rank of # 1 (Strong Buy) and a Value Score of B, a Growth Score of B, and a Momentum Score of B.Earnings were strong last quarter. PulteGroup, Inc. beat our consensus estimate by 32.02%, and for the current fiscal year, PHM is expected to post earnings of $9.13 per share on revenue of $15.08 billion.Shares of PulteGroup, Inc. have gained 3.5% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 7.6X and a P/CF of 5.93X.The Building Products - Home Builders industry is in the top 3% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for TPH and PHM, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(PHM): Here is What You Need to Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-pultegroup-inc-130013977.html,1685970013,STORY,['PHM'],"[PulteGroup (PHM) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this homebuilder have returned +3.5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry, which PulteGroup falls in, has gained 2.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, PulteGroup is expected to post earnings of $2.43 per share, indicating a change of -11% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +5.2% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $9.13 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -15.5%. This estimate has changed +4% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.21 indicates a change of +0.9% from what PulteGroup is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +4.5%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for PulteGroup.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of PulteGroup, the consensus sales estimate of $3.93 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of 0%. The $15.08 billion and $15.47 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -7.1% and +2.6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPulteGroup reported revenues of $3.58 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.2%. EPS of $2.35 for the same period compares with $1.83 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.27 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +9.42%. The EPS surprise was +32.02%.Over the last four quarters, PulteGroup surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.PulteGroup is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about PulteGroup. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read 10 S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats To Avoid. Over the years, there has been an observable shift in focus from growth stocks to dividend stocks in certain market environments. High inflationary periods have fared well for dividend stocks historically. Dividend investing also often aligns with a long-term investment strategy as investors may find comfort in the consistent dividend income and the potential for capital appreciation that quality dividend stocks can offer over time. In 2022, dividend aristocrat stocks outperformed the broader market, falling by just 6.21%, compared with a much harsher decline of 18.1% in the S&amp;P 500.Not only the performance of dividend stocks remained strong compared to other asset classes, but companies in the S&amp;P 500 also paid a record amount in dividend payments last year. According to a report by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, the S&amp;P 500 corporations distributed $561 billion in dividends in 2022, up from $511.2 billion in 2021. Though the market suffered some setbacks in the face of Silicon Bank Valley's failure earlier in March, global dividend payouts sustained their position. In the first quarter of 2023, global dividends grew by 12% on a headline basis to a record $327 billion, as reported by Janus Henderson Investors. The increase was mainly driven by special dividends paid by companies during the quarter.Analysts and economists are giving a positive outlook for dividend stocks as these equities held their ground during uncertain market conditions. Goldman Sachs Chief US Equity Strategist David Kostin spoke with Business Insider in April and mentioned that dividend payments are expected to grow this year as well. Here are some remarks from the analyst:""We expect that S&amp;P 500 DPS [dividend-per-share] will reach $70 in 2023 and $73 (+4%) in 2024. Recent company actions also point to a healthy dividend growth environment. The difference in outlooks for dividend and buyback growth suggests firms focusing on dividends will continue to outperform buyback stocks.""Story continuesDividend growth track records play an important role when investing in dividend stocks. These companies often exhibit solid financial health, strong cash flows, and a history of successful operations. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) are some of the most popular dividend aristocrat stocks, however, in this article, we will cover the least popular dividend aristocrats among hedge funds.25 S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats To AvoidDaily newspaper economy stock market chartOur Methodology:For this list, we scoured Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds as of Q1 2023 and picked the 25 least popular dividend aristocrats in terms of hedge fund positions.

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. In light of that, when we looked at Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Medtronic is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.079 = US$6.5b ÷ (US$91b - US$9.1b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023).Thus, Medtronic has an ROCE of 7.9%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return but it's around the Medical Equipment industry average of 9.1%. See our latest analysis for Medtronic roceIn the above chart we have measured Medtronic's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Medtronic.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsThings have been pretty stable at Medtronic, with its capital employed and returns on that capital staying somewhat the same for the last five years. This tells us the company isn't reinvesting in itself, so it's plausible that it's past the growth phase. So unless we see a substantial change at Medtronic in terms of ROCE and additional investments being made, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger. This probably explains why Medtronic is paying out 51% of its income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Unless businesses have highly compelling growth opportunities, they'll typically return some money to shareholders.Story continuesThe Bottom LineIn summary, Medtronic isn't compounding its earnings but is generating stable returns on the same amount of capital employed. And investors may be recognizing these trends since the stock has only returned a total of 9.1% to shareholders over the last five years. As a result, if you're hunting for a multi-bagger, we think you'd have more luck elsewhere.On a final note, we've found   1 warning sign for Medtronic  that we think you should be aware of.While Medtronic may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

PREVYMIS is administered once-daily as an oral tablet or as an injection for intravenous infusion.PREVYMIS is contraindicated in patients receiving pimozide or ergot alkaloids. Increased pimozide concentrations due to concomitant administration of PREVYMIS may lead to QT prolongation and torsades de pointes. Increased ergot alkaloids concentrations due to concomitant administration of PREVYMIS may lead to ergotism. PREVYMIS is contraindicated with pitavastatin and simvastatin when co-administered with cyclosporine. Significantly increased pitavastatin or simvastatin concentrations may lead to myopathy or rhabdomyolysis.The concomitant use of PREVYMIS and certain drugs may result in potentially significant drug interactions, some of which may lead to adverse reactions (PREVYMIS or concomitant drugs) or reduced therapeutic effect of PREVYMIS or the concomitant drug. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during PREVYMIS therapy; review concomitant medications during PREVYMIS therapy; and monitor for adverse reactions associated with PREVYMIS and concomitant medications. See additional Selected Safety Information below.""PREVYMIS has been an important addition to the care of high-risk adult CMV-seropositive patients who have received allogeneic stem cell transplants to help prevent CMV infection and disease. We are delighted that PREVYMIS is now approved to help prevent CMV disease in adult kidney transplant patients at high risk,"" said Dr. Elizabeth Rhee, vice president, global clinical development, Merck Research Laboratories. ""At Merck, we are proud to continue to bring innovative medicines to people to address serious infectious diseases.""Story continuesPhase 3 study for PREVYMIS in high-risk adult kidney transplant recipients [CMV D+/R-]The FDA approval of PREVYMIS for CMV disease prophylaxis in adult kidney transplant recipients was supported by a Phase 3, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, active comparator-controlled non-inferiority trial (P002, NCT03443869) in 589 adult kidney transplant recipients at high risk (CMV D+/R-). Participants were randomized (1:1) to receive either PREVYMIS concomitantly with acyclovir (n=292), or valganciclovir concomitantly with a placebo to acyclovir (n=297). Study drug was initiated between Day 0 and Day 7 post-kidney transplant and continued through Week 28 (~200 days) post-transplant. Study drug was administered either orally or IV; the dose of PREVYMIS was the same regardless of the route of administration. Three participants received IV PREVYMIS for a mean duration of 1.7 days. Participants were monitored through Week 52 post-transplant. The median age was 51 years (range: 18 to 82 years); 72% were male; 84% were White; 9% were Black; 3% were multiple; 2% were Asian; 1% Alaskan native or American Indian; 17% were Hispanic or Latino; and 60% received a kidney from a deceased donor. The most common primary reasons for transplant were congenital cystic kidney disease (17%), hypertension (16%), and diabetes/diabetic nephropathy (14%).The study demonstrated that PREVYMIS was non-inferior to valganciclovir, the current standard of care, for the primary endpoint of incidence of CMV disease (CMV end-organ disease or CMV syndrome, confirmed by an independent adjudication committee) through Week 52 post-kidney transplant. The proportion of study participants with CMV disease through Week 52 post-kidney transplant was 10% with PREVYMIS and 12% with valganciclovir (stratum-adjusted treatment difference = -1.4, [95% confidence interval, -6.5, 3.8], meeting the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of 10%). The incidence of CMV syndrome (defined as evidence of CMV in blood by viral isolation, rapid culture, antigenemia, or nucleic acid testing, and two or more of the following: 1) fever ≥38°C for at least 2 days, 2) new or increased malaise/fatigue, 3) leukopenia or neutropenia on two separate measurements at least 24 hours apart, 4) ≥5% atypical lymphocytes, 5) thrombocytopenia, 6) elevation of ALT or AST to 2x the upper limit of normal) was 8% vs 11%, respectively. The incidence of CMV end organ disease was 2% vs less than 1%, respectively. For purposes of these analyses, participants who discontinued prematurely from the study for any reason or were missing data at the timepoint were not counted as failures. The number of participants who discontinued from the study before Week 52 was 32 (11%) in the PREVYMIS arm and 28 (9%) in the valganciclovir arm. The number of participants with a missing outcome in the Week 52 visit window was 24 (8%) in the PREVYMIS arm and 25 (8%) in the valganciclovir arm.Efficacy was comparable across all subgroups. This included the subgroups that used or did not use highly cytolytic, anti-lymphocyte immunotherapy during induction, which was a stratification factor at randomization.In an exploratory analysis of the incidence of CMV disease through Week 28 post-transplant, the difference (PREVYMIS – valganciclovir) was -1.7% with a 95% CI of (-3.4, 0.1). No subjects in the PREVYMIS group experienced CMV disease through Week 28 post-transplant (end of treatment period) compared with five subjects in the valganciclovir group.The safety of PREVYMIS was also evaluated in the Phase 3 (P002) study. Adverse events (AEs) were those reported while participants were on study medication or within two weeks of study medication completion/discontinuation. Diarrhea was reported in at least 10% of participants in the PREVYMIS group and at a frequency greater than valganciclovir (PREVYMIS, 32%; valganciclovir, 29%). Study drug was discontinued due to an AE in 4% of PREVYMIS participants and 14% of valganciclovir participants. The most frequently reported AEs that led to study drug discontinuation were neutropenia (PREVYMIS, 1%; valganciclovir, 2%) and leukopenia (PREVYMIS, 1%; valganciclovir, 5%).The Phase 3 study also collected information on laboratory abnormalities reported through week 28 post-transplant. Selected laboratory abnormalities were as follows:PREVYMISN=292ValganciclovirN=297Absolute neutrophil count (cells/μL)&lt; 5002%7%500 – &lt; 7501%4%750 – &lt; 10001%8%Total &lt; 10005%18%Hemoglobin (g/dL)&lt; 6.52%0%6.5 – &lt; 8.04%5%8.0 – &lt; 9.529%32%Total &lt; 9.534%37%Platelets (cells/μL)&lt; 500000%0%50000 – &lt; 1000001%3%Total &lt; 1000001%3%Leukocytes (cells/μL)&lt; 10001%2%1000 – &lt; 20005%19%2000 – &lt; 25004%14%Total &lt; 250010%35%Serum creatinine (mg/dL)&gt; 2.524%22%&gt; 1.5 – 2.549%52%Total &gt; 1.573%73%Dosing of PREVYMIS in high-risk adult kidney transplant recipientsThe recommended dosage of PREVYMIS is 480 mg administered once daily orally or as an intravenous infusion, initiated as early as Day 0 and up to Day 7 post-kidney transplant and continued through Day 200 post-transplant. If PREVYMIS is co-administered with cyclosporine, the dosage of oral or intravenous PREVYMIS should be decreased to 240 mg once daily. PREVYMIS 240 mg and 480 mg tablets may be administered with or without food. Following the completion of PREVYMIS prophylaxis, monitoring for CMV reactivation is recommended.For patients with creatinine clearance (CLcr) greater than 10 mL/min (by Cockcroft-Gault equation), no dosage adjustment of PREVYMIS is required based on renal impairment. The safety of PREVYMIS in patients with end-stage renal disease (CLcr less than 10 mL/min), including patients on dialysis, is unknown. In patients with CLcr less than 50 mL/min receiving PREVYMIS injection, accumulation of the intravenous vehicle, hydroxypropyl betadex, could occur. Serum creatinine levels should be closely monitored in these patients.PREVYMIS injection, which contains hydroxypropyl betadex, should be used only in patients unable to take oral therapy. Patients should be switched to oral PREVYMIS as soon as they are able to take oral medications. PREVYMIS tablet and injection may be used interchangeably at the discretion of the physician, and no dosage adjustment is necessary when switching formulations.No dosage adjustment of PREVYMIS is required for patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment. PREVYMIS is not recommended for patients with severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment.About PREVYMIS (letermovir)PREVYMIS inhibits viral replication by targeting the CMV DNA terminase complex. PREVYMIS is now approved for prophylaxis of CMV disease in adult kidney transplant recipients at high risk (Donor CMV-seropositive/Recipient CMV-seronegative [D+/R-]). Since 2017, PREVYMIS has been the only drug approved in the United States for prophylaxis of CMV infection and disease in adults who are CMV-seropositive [R+] and have received an allogeneic HSCT, and has also been approved for this indication in more than 60 countries including EU member states, Canada, Japan and China. Under an agreement signed in 2012, Merck (through a subsidiary) purchased worldwide rights to develop and commercialize letermovir from AiCuris GmbH &amp; Co KG (www.aicuris.com).Selected Safety Information about PREVYMISPREVYMIS is contraindicated in patients receiving pimozide or ergot alkaloids. Increased pimozide concentrations may lead to QT prolongation and torsades de pointes. Increased ergot alkaloids concentrations may lead to ergotism.PREVYMIS is contraindicated with pitavastatin and simvastatin when co-administered with cyclosporine. Significantly increased pitavastatin or simvastatin concentrations may lead to myopathy or rhabdomyolysis.The concomitant use of PREVYMIS and certain drugs may result in potentially significant drug interactions, some of which may lead to adverse reactions (PREVYMIS or concomitant drugs) or reduced therapeutic effect of PREVYMIS or the concomitant drug.The rates of adverse events in the first 100 days following HSCT occurring in at least 10% of transplant recipients treated with PREVYMIS and at a frequency at least 2% greater than placebo were nausea (27% vs 23%), diarrhea (26% vs 24%), vomiting (19% vs 14%), peripheral edema (14% vs 9%), cough (14% vs 10%), headache (14% vs 9%), fatigue (13% vs 11%), and abdominal pain (12% vs 9%).Hypersensitivity reaction, with associated moderate dyspnea, occurred in one HSCT subject following the first infusion of IV PREVYMIS after switching from oral PREVYMIS, leading to treatment discontinuation.The most common adverse event occurring in at least 10% of kidney transplant recipients treated with PREVYMIS and at a frequency greater than valganciclovir was diarrhea (32% vs 29%).If PREVYMIS is co-administered with cyclosporine, the dosage of PREVYMIS should be decreased to 240 mg once daily.Co-administration of PREVYMIS may alter the plasma concentrations of other drugs and other drugs may alter the plasma concentrations of PREVYMIS. Consult the full Prescribing Information prior to and during treatment for potential drug interactions.Closely monitor serum creatinine levels in patients with CLcr less than 50 mL/min using PREVYMIS injection.PREVYMIS is not recommended for patients with severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment.The safety and efficacy of PREVYMIS in patients below 18 years of age have not been established.For patients with CLcr greater than 10 mL/min (by Cockcroft-Gault equation), no dosage adjustment of PREVYMIS is required based on renal impairment. The safety of PREVYMIS in patients with end-stage renal disease (CLcr less than 10 mL/min), including patients on dialysis, is unknown.About CMVMany adults in the United States are CMV-seropositive, meaning they have CMV antibodies in their blood, indicating a previous exposure to or primary infection with CMV. People with healthy immune systems rarely develop CMV symptoms after initial infection, with the virus typically remaining inactive or latent in the body for life. CMV‐seronegative recipients who receive an organ from a CMV‐seropositive donor [D+/R-] are at high risk of CMV disease after transplantation.About MerckAt Merck, known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, we are unified around our purpose: We use the power of leading-edge science to save and improve lives around the world.

Experts say mRNA vaccines, which can be produced in as little as eight weeks, paired with drugs that rev up the immune system may lead to a new generation of cancer therapies.The hope is for ""a completely new treatment paradigm in cancer that will be better tolerated and unique to individual patients' tumors,"" said Dr. Jane Healy, an executive overseeing in early cancer treatment development at Merck.Moderna said during its investor call that it was starting a Phase 3 confirmatory study, which it hoped to open in the third quarter of this year.Story continuesThe Merck/Moderna collaboration is one of several combining powerful drugs that unleash the immune system to target cancers with mRNA vaccine technology. Pfizer's COVID vaccine partner BioNTech SE and Gritstone Bio Inc are taking similar approaches using mRNA technology.The vaccines all target neoantigens, new mutations that are only present on tumors. Aiming at these unique proteins allows the immune system to kill cancer cells while leaving healthy tissue unscathed.The trick is determining which of many mutations is driving the cancer.To accomplish this, tumors are removed and their genetic makeup is mapped using next-generation DNA sequencing. Companies use artificial intelligence to predict which mutations will be the most effective targets. These are used to build an individualized vaccine targeting only mutations in the patient's tumor.During this process, patients typically receive an immunotherapy such as Keytruda or Roche's Tecentriq, which block a mechanism cancer uses to hide from the immune system.'A STARTING POINT'Long before COVID, companies had been eyeing messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which carries instructions for cells to make specific proteins, as a vehicle for delivering a cancer vaccine.Merck and Moderna have been collaborating since 2016. Researchers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) in New York began working with Germany's BioNTech in 2017.At that time, there was already proof that immunotherapy could work in so-called ""hot"" tumors, or highly mutated cancers, such as melanoma. There was little hope it would work in ""cold"" cancers with few mutations, such as pancreatic cancer, said MSK's Dr. Vinod Balachandran.With standard treatment, 90% of pancreatic cancer patients die within five years of diagnosis.Balachandran's team studied the rare long-term survivors and found an immune system component called T cells in these individuals were able to recognize mutations derived from the cancer, raising the possibility of a targeted vaccine.In a small ongoing trial testing a made-to-order BioNTech vaccine plus Roche's Tecentriq, half of the 16 pancreatic cancer patients mounted an immune response, and none showed signs of relapse after 18 months, according to data published last month in Nature.Gritstone Bio is taking a different tack, combining two types of customized vaccines in hopes of treating patients with metastatic colon cancer, another cancer that has been largely unresponsive to immunotherapy.The approach first primes the immune system with an older technology called a chimpanzee adenovirus vaccine that targets patients' tumors. That is followed by a personalized self-amplifying mRNA vaccine, which includes an enzyme that makes extra copies of the antigens, reducing the required dose.Gritstone is expecting data from a later-stage trial testing its dual vaccine therapy in the first quarter of 2024.""Based on everything we've shown and we've published, we're really excited,"" said Gritstone CEO Andrew Allen.Merck and Moderna are planning a larger Phase 3 trial in melanoma and are also testing its combination in lung cancer.""We see this as a starting point,"" Healy said.

We are here to serve the kingdom and its population, to give them connectivity to the world (and) support the second-fastest- growing economy,"" he said.He said all major European and Asian capitals as well as main North American cities would be on the network. Narrowbody jets would focus on the Indian subcontinent and Gulf region.Story continuesBoeing's clean sweep of the lucrative Saudi widebody order - involving planes for both Riyadh Air and Jeddah-based Saudia - was a blow for Airbus which as recently as late last year had widely been seen as likely to win at least part of the deal.European industry officials alleged political pressure from the United States, noting head of state involvement in previous large-scale plane negotiations, while some analysts said it pointed to a greater U.S. presence in the region.Douglas denied that politics had played any part, however.""Absolutely not, there was no way I was going to split the fleet,"" he said.Douglas was speaking on the sidelines of the annual meeting of the International Air Transport Association, a gathering of 300 airlines that he described as ""speed-dating"" among carriers expiring business ties or talking to suppliers.Asked what partnerships or alliances Riyadh Air would envisage, Douglas said he was having discussions about codeshares.""Most successful airlines have an extended network through really great partnerships ... One of the many reasons why we're engaging with our colleagues here at IATA is to start that particular dialogue.""Qatar Airways Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker said last month he was excited for the launch of Riyadh Air and that a codeshare or technical co-operation was possible.""There is a lot of business around for everybody,"" he said.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 5G Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On. The global market for 5G technologies is projected to experience substantial growth, with an expected increase from $30.62 billion in 2022 to $44.71 billion in 2023, indicating a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 46.0%. Furthermore, the market is predicted to reach $125.27 billion in 2027, growing at a CAGR of 29.4%. Industries such as automotive, industrial, consumer electronics, healthcare, energy, and utilities are involved as end-users in this market. According to Jeff Fieldhack, the research director at Counterpoint Research, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is predicted to be among the select few original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) that will experience growth this year, along with Honor and possibly OnePlus. Fieldhack emphasized that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is at the forefront of the 5G competition. He further explained that companies are currently prioritizing profit margins over market share due to the economic downturn. Fieldhack also noted that Chinese OEMs are adopting a more cautious approach due to reduced growth projections in the smartphone industry. They are striving for sustainable margins rather than focusing solely on sales volume.Don't Miss: Billionaires Are Crazy About These 10 StocksAs per a Reuters report, the UK has set a target to provide 5G mobile coverage in populated areas by 2030 and stated that there is no specific requirement for the number of network operators needed to ensure a competitive market. All four major mobile networks in the UK, namely BT's EE, O2, Vodafone, and Three, are currently deploying 5G technology. The UK government expressed its desire for the next iteration of 5G, known as standalone 5G or 5G Plus, to be widely accessible by the end of the decade. This widespread availability aims to unlock the potential of new technologies such as autonomous vehicles, robots, and drones. Similarly, market research firm Counterpoint reported at the end of December 2022 that the shipment of 5G smartphones in India is expected to surpass that of 4G smartphones by the end of 2023. This surge in 5G smartphone shipments is attributed to the widespread adoption of high-speed 5G networks and the increasing sales of handsets in the lower price segments.Story continuesBillionaires, always keen on seizing profitable opportunities, are actively investing in companies like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Marvell Technology, Inc.

U.S. defense contractors tend to be safe and reliable investments. Most major defense contractors benefit from lucrative government contracts, innovative technologies, strong intellectual property rights, robust sales and growing profits. In addition, there are a number of attractive defensive stocks with reliable dividends.Defense stocks tend to pay generous dividends to their shareholders, with most exceeding the average dividend yield of 1.66% found among companies listed on the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index. Further, while many publicly traded companies scaled back or suspended their dividend payments during the Covid-19 pandemic, a number of defense firms raised their payouts.This makes defense stocks attractive to any type of investor, but especially to retirees or others who rely on dividends as part of their income stream.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHere are three of the best dividend stocks in the defense sector.LMTLockheed Martin$447.97NOCNorthrop Grumman$438.16RTXRaytheon Technologies$92.82Lockheed Martin (LMT)Close top view of a Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35C Lightning II with afterburner onSource: ranchorunner / Shutterstock.comWe’ll start the list of top defense stocks for income investors with Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), the world’s biggest defense contractor with annual revenue of nearly $66 billion.The company is a leading supplier to the U.S. Defense Department and makes cutting-edge technology. It continues to win multibillion-dollar contracts from the U.S. government, with the most recent being a $7.8 billion agreement related to next-generation F-35 fighter jets.Lockheed Martin is also pushing into new areas, notably space. It recently announced plans to reorganize its space work into three separate business units: commercial civil space, national security space, and strategic and missile defense systems.LMT stock is essentially flat over the past 12 months but has gained more than 40% in the past five years. Furthermore, the company pays a generous quarterly dividend of $3 per share for an above-average yield of 2.68%. And Lockheed has a history of steadily raising its dividend, increasing its payout in each of the past 20 years.Story continuesNorthrop Grumman (NOC)United States Air Force Northrop Grumman (NOC) RQ-4B Global Hawk unmanned surveillance aircraft.Source: viper-zero / Shutterstock.comNorthrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) is another defense contractor that pays a steady and reliable dividend to stockholders. The company paid out over 70% of its free cash flow in dividends last year. Most recently, it increased its quarterly dividend by 8% to $1.87 per share. This gives it a yield of 1.71%.As for NOC stock, it has slumped 7% over the past year. While it has gained 33% in the past five years, the S&amp;P 500 is up 54% during that time. Despite shares’ recent lackluster performance, many analysts claim to like the stock and its valuation right now. Their average price target of $505.53 is 15% above where shares currently trade.The company beat the consensus expectation for its first-quarter results, reporting earnings per share of $5.50 on revenue of $9.3 billion versus the $5.09 on $9.2 billion analysts were expecting. Dragging on the stock have been declines in profits at some of Northrop Grumman’s key business units, notably mission systems and aeronautics systems. Offsetting this, however, is its space unit, which saw Q1 sales increase 17% from a year ago. Revenue from the space segment now outpaces aeronautics by 33%.Overall, the company and its dividend remain strong.Raytheon Technologies (RTX)A German army mobile Raytheon (RTX) MIM-104 Patriot surface-to-air missile (SAM) system on display during the Laage airbase open house.Source: VanderWolf Images / Shutterstock.comRaytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) is another defense contractor that recently raised its quarterly dividend, boosting its payout by 7% to 59 cents per share. Shares now yield 2.53%, which is about 50% greater than the average dividend offered by companies listed on the S&amp;P 500.The dividend increase was announced alongside strong first-quarter results that included a 10% year-over-year increase in sales to $17.21 billion, surpassing the consensus analyst estimate for $16.96 billion. And Raytheon announced earnings per share (EPS) of $1.22, well ahead of the $1.13 analysts expected.In addition to being a defense company, Raytheon is also a leading aerospace firm that manufactures aircraft parts for sale around the world. The aerospace segment helps to round out the company’s business. For example, Q1 sales were lifted by growing demand for commercial aircraft parts and services in China.As for the performance of RTX stock, it is down 4% over the past 12 months and has gained 17% over the past five years. However, those looking for the top defense stocks for income investors should be comforted by the fact that the company has raised its dividend by 24% since 2020.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Joel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

""More parents are recognizing their children simply are not interested in joining the family business and are not pressuring them to do so. Knowing what your children are interested in and where their strengths lie is key to effective succession planning.""Among parents, nearly all (94%) want their children to forge their own path, rather than follow in their footsteps.""My father originally planned to sell our 110-year-old family business, Pioneer Linens; yet a year before he passed away, he named me as successor—and it’s been my honor to continue the legacy of both my father and grandfather,"" said Penny Murphy, third-generation business owner. ""My brother, on the other hand, was the recipient of my father’s real estate. We are grateful that our father thoughtfully created an equitable estate plan that aligned with our respective interests.""Where the wealth comes fromNine out of ten (90%) wealth creators attribute their financial success specifically to hard work and determination. In addition, two-thirds (63%) of wealth creators cite the advantages of a good education, and almost half (43%) acknowledge the importance of living in the land of opportunity, while a quarter (24%) acknowledge the role of luck.Story continuesInvestment and Insurance Products are:• Not Insured by the FDIC or Any Federal Government Agency• Not a Deposit or Other Obligation of, or Guaranteed by, the Bank or Any Bank Affiliate• Subject to Investment Risks, Including Possible Loss of the Principal Amount InvestedHelping to move this success down through family lines tends to get trickier for some, though. Three out of four wealth creator parents (73%) believe they have succeeded in passing down their financial values, and (75%) feel they have done a good job raising their children to be financially successful on their own—yet almost half (44%) worry about their children not knowing how to build wealth of their own.In line with wealth creators expressing concern about their children’s ability to build their own wealth, they also said they provide a good deal of financial support to their adult children, with four out of five (81%) saying they will bail them out of financial trouble. Although 88% of Gen X parents said they believe that wealth can ruin children (compared to 81% of respondents overall), nearly half (48%) acknowledge they tend to overdo it when it comes to giving things to their children (compared to 40% of respondents overall).Most wealth creators help their adult children financially in multiple areas:Education80%Cars51%Travel or vacations46%Ongoing expenses35%Healthcare29%Houses27%Grandchildren’s education25%Childcare6%Notably, parents who said they help their adult children with houses rises to 47% among those with $5 million or more in investable assets (compared to 27% of respondents overall).And while a large majority (70%) want their children to live up to their family’s standards of wealth and success, nearly a third (30%) report it has been hard to transmit their work ethic to their children—and this is higher (40%) among Gen X parents.""Family business owners may be tempted to transfer ownership as an incentive for family members to join the business,"" said Bob Marshall, business growth strategy executive at Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. ""While well intentioned, these transfers may lead to unintended consequences, especially if the family member does not have the required skills, engagement, or desire to take over the business.""Two out of five (39%) say their business has been an important source of meaning and purpose in their lives, and one in six (17%) say it is part of the legacy they want to leave.""Whether the family discussion is about estate planning or business succession planning, what’s important is that everyone is aligned and there are no surprises,"" added Liersch. ""Without a thoughtful conversation and formal plan, assumptions can be made and disruption to the family dynamics are highly likely.""About the SurveyOn behalf of Wells Fargo, Versta Research conducted a national survey of 1,008 Wealth Creators, defined as U.S. adults, age 50 or over who have at least $1 million in investable assets, excluding those who inherited most of their assets. The sample included 136 respondents from Generation X (ages 50 to 57), 771 Baby Boomers (ages 58 to 76), and 101 from the Silent Generation (ages 77 or older). Data were weighted by age to match current population estimates of U.S. households with more than $1 million in investable assets, derived from the Federal Reserve Board’s Survey of Consumer Finances.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: JPMorgan JPM, Bank of America BAC, Citigroup C and Wells Fargo WFC.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:FDIC-Insured Banks' Q1 Earnings Up on Higher NII, Two Banks FailThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”)-insured commercial banks and savings institutions reported first-quarter 2023 earnings of $79.8 billion, jumping 33.6% year over year. The increase was primarily attributable to a solid improvement in net interest income, which more than offset the rise in provisions and non-interest expenses.Banks, with assets worth more than $10 billion, accounted for a major part of earnings in the March-ended quarter. Though such banks constitute only 3% of the total number of FDIC-insured institutes, these account for approximately 80% of the industry’s earnings. Some of the notable names in this space are JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo.At present, JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.A rise in net operating revenues driven by solid growth in net interest income and an increase in non-interest income acted as a major tailwind. Also, higher interest rates and decent loan demand offered support.Nonetheless, banks’ earnings were adversely impacted by higher provisions on expectations of a deteriorating operating backdrop. Further, a rise in non-interest expenses and lower deposit balance were headwinds.Community banks, constituting 91% of all FDIC-insured institutions, reported a net income of $7 billion, up 6.1% year over year.Story continuesThe return on average assets in first-quarter 2023 rose to 1.36% from 1.16% as of Mar 31, 2022.Net Operating Revenues &amp; Expenses RiseNet operating revenues came in at $261.7 billion, up 21.9% year over year.Net interest income (NII) was $175.7 billion, increasing 27.3% year over year.Net interest margin (NIM) jumped 77 basis points (bps) to 3.31%, which is above the pre-pandemic average of 3.25%. JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo also witnessed an increase in NIM.Non-interest income grew 12.2% to $86 billion.Total non-interest expenses were $141.3 billion, increasing 5.6%. The rise was mainly due to higher compensation expenses.Despite the rise in expenses, the banking industry recorded a fall in efficiency ratio to 53% in the first quarter from 62% in the prior-year quarter. This was mainly attributable to “strong growth in net interest income.”Credit Quality DeterioratingNet charge-offs (NCOs) for loans and leases were $12.4 billion, surging 97.5% year over year. NCO rate was 0.41% in the first quarter, up 19 bps from the prior-year quarter. Despite the increase, the NCO rate was below the pre-pandemic average of 0.48%.Provisions for credit losses were $20.7 billion during the first quarter, up substantially from $5.2 billion in the year-ago quarter. Several lenders, including JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo, reported higher provisions.Loans &amp; Deposits FallAs of Mar 31, 2023, total loans and leases were $12.21 trillion, which declined marginally from the prior quarter. This was majorly due to loans transferred to the FDIC as receiver and a seasonal fall in credit card loan balances.Total deposits amounted to $18.74 trillion, down 2.5% sequentially, mainly due to an 8.3% decrease in uninsured deposits. This marked the largest fall on a quarterly basis and the fourth consecutive quarterly decline. As of Mar 31, 2023, the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) balance decreased 9.5% from the December 2022 level to $116.1 billion. A decline in the DIF was largely due to loss provisions because of the failure of two banks and amounts set aside for the anticipated failure of First Republic Bank.Two Bank Failures, One New BankDuring the reported quarter, two banks – Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank – failed, while one new bank was added. Further, 31 banks were absorbed following mergers.As of Mar 31, 2023, the number of ‘problem’ banks was 45, up from 41 in the prior quarter. Total assets of the ‘problem’ institutions increased to $58 billion from $47.5 billion reported in the fourth quarter of 2022.ConclusionThe FDIC Chairman Martin Gruenberg, said, “The banking industry continues to face significant downside risks from the effects of inflation, rising market interest rates, slower economic growth, and geopolitical uncertainty. Credit quality and profitability may weaken due to these risks and may result in a further tightening of loan underwriting, slower loan growth, higher provision expenses, and liquidity constraints.”Though rising deposit costs will weigh on banks’ top-line growth, higher interest rates and decent loan demand will offer much-needed support going forward. Also, banks have been changing the revenue mix toward non-interest sources, which are likely to provide additional support to revenues. Nonetheless, a worsening macroeconomic environment is expected to weigh on banks’ financials in the near term.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

(AP) — Oregon's attorney general announced Monday she has begun investigating the board of directors of Fox Corp. for breaching its fiduciary duties by allowing Fox News to broadcast false claims about the 2020 presidential election — claims that cost the broadcaster almost $800 million in a lawsuit.Also joining the investigation is Oregon State Treasurer Tobias Read, who oversees the Oregon Public Employees Retirement Fund, which owns more than 250,000 shares of Fox stock. Both Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum and Read are Democrats.“Treasurer Read and I believe that Fox’s board of directors breached its fiduciary duties by allowing Fox News to broadcast false claims that Dominion and Smartmatic rigged the 2020 presidential election,” Rosenblum said. “We hope to hold the board accountable and protect the long-term value of Oregon’s investment in Fox Corp.”Brian Nick, chief communications officer and executive vice president of Fox Corp., declined to comment on Rosenblum's announcement.In April, Fox News agreed to pay Dominion Voting Systems $787.5 million to avert a trial in the voting machine company’s lawsuit that would have exposed how the network promoted lies about the 2020 presidential election.Dominion had argued that the news outlet owned by Fox Corp. damaged Dominion’s reputation by peddling phony conspiracy theories that claimed its equipment switched votes from former President Donald Trump to Democrat Joe Biden.Lachlan Murdoch, chair and CEO of Fox Corp., said when the settlement was announced that it avoids ""the acrimony of a divisive trial and a multiyear appeal process, a decision clearly in the best interests of the company and its shareholders.”The Oregon Department of Justice said the investigation will explore leading a lawsuit against Fox’s management on behalf of the company’s harmed investors, which include Oregon’s public employees.“Fox directors and senior officers manage the company on behalf of its investors,” the department said in a statement. “They have a duty to manage the company competently, honestly, and in a manner that prevents foreseeable and catastrophic financial harm like that inflicted upon company’s shareholders by the Dominion and Smartmatic suits.”Story continues“We invest for Oregon’s public servants and we aim to hold Fox’s board of directors, including Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, accountable for their decisions,” said Read, who is a member of the Oregon Investment Council, which sets state investment policy. “Investigating Fox’s books and records is a necessary and significant step in fulfilling our obligation to our beneficiaries.”As of May 26, the Oregon pension fund owned 168,075 Class A common stock shares and 92,850 Class B shares of Fox stock, said Roy Kaufmann, Rosenblum’s spokesperson.Another voting machine company, Smartmatic USA, has also sued Fox News over Fox News' bogus election claims. Dominion had sued Fox for $1.6 billion.]"

173,96fa684a-4d27-3039-a079-0ed94c3c3487,IBM,2023-06-06,A Unique Way To Play The Coming $700 Billion Electric Vehicle Boom,Oilprice.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unique-way-play-coming-700-230100971.html,1686006060,STORY,"['AMD', 'VMAR', 'AAPL', 'SHOP', 'CSCO', 'MSFT', 'AMZN', 'IBM', 'GOOGL', 'NVDA', 'AMAT', 'META']","[The global electric vehicle market is a crowded space valued at nearly $194 billion in 2022 and set to reach an astounding $694 billion by 2030.Now it’s time to find more unique opportunities as many of these smaller car manufacturers find the market being overtaken by the traditional auto giants like Ford, Chevy and GM.Opportunity abounds, but phenomenal cash burn and a slower path to profitability have rendered this crowded space rather risky.But the EV market isn’t just about the roadways …The waterways are going electric, too, and the playing field is much less chaotic, with the clear first-mover advantage going to Vision Marine Technologies (NASDAQ:VMAR), with its proprietary PowerTrain outboard motor and the launch of the fastest electric speedboat in its class on the market.The electric boat market is set to grow at a CAGR of nearly 13%. By 2030, this market will be worth almost $15 billion, and it's much easier to navigate.As we speak, the multi-billion-dollar boat battery market is undergoing its biggest transition since the invention of the boat motor itself.And VMAR has successfully developed the world’s most powerful marine electric motor, with proprietary technology. First revenues from the PowerTrain are coming this year, along with a second revenue chain in the form of a disruption to the boat rental market.Sailing legend Ian Bruce is behind VMAR, and unique among EV offerings, the company has zero debt and is positioned to be free-cash-flow positive in 2024.That’s a good starting point for an electrified market that has few (if any) players who aren’t burning cash at an untenable rate.The Proprietary Tech Powering Clean BoatingThe newly unveiled H2e Bowrider speed boat took the Paris Boat Show by storm in December, and made its official debut in February in Miami, with deliveries to start this summer.The boat, developed in partnership with Four Winns, is special because it showcases VMAR’s E-Motion 180 HP electric outboard motor.Story continuesThat motor, with proprietary PowerTrain technology, makes the H2e Bowrider the first all-electric series production bowrider on the market.The E-Motion is the first fully electric, production-ready, high-performance 180 HP, which makes it the key market disruptor. With its proprietary technology, which includes the batteries, the engine and the software, Vision Marine’s E-Motion is now the only turn-key solution for boat manufacturers in its class. That’s a strong first-mover position to be in at the critical junction of a high-dollar energy transition.Vision Marine’s (NASDAQ:VMAR) E-Motion fully charges overnight with no additional infrastructure, has the highest horsepower engine in its class on the market, offers the first-ever custom design marine battery packs, and it all comes in at a lower cost than any competitors:Now, it’s all about capturing market share, and that’s where it gets interesting.How close are they? Well, the plan is to market the E-Motion Powertrain to Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) rather than the public, and they have already received hundreds of advance orders.And investors will get to see the first revenues from PowerTrain this year already.Flipping the Switch on the Boat Rental MarketVMAR has a broader vision beyond the most powerful outboard electric motor in its class, too: They also plan to flip the boat rental market and turn it electric.That $5-billion+ boat rental market (think: thousands of resorts and marinas worldwide) is ripe for flipping, and VMAR’s flagship Newport business managed to serve 300,000 clients in the first three years, annualizing $4 million in revenues with a 35% profit margin.For 2023, Vision Marine will be rolling out two more fully-owned electric boat rental locations and launching their franchise model. By 2024, it’s full speed ahead with scaling.The company’s proprietary technology gives it the opportunity to become one of the NASDAQ’s most exciting EV plays.By the end of 2024, Vision Marine expects to free-cash-flow positive, and by 2025, it expects to have two profitable and growing divisions, after which the scaling is expected to gain further momentum.Zero Debt at a Time of Serious Electric Cash-BurnThis summer should be interesting on the water.Vision Marine (NASDAQ:VMAR) not only has developed the most powerful electric motor solution on the recreational boating market, but it’s also a member of an elite club in this segment that has proprietary technology, zero debt and clear growth runways.With investors pouring money into anything electric in the wake of a major European push for zero-carbon and the Biden administration’s clean energy-friendly Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), a company that has already staked its claim on the market with a proprietary tech product and is going into its first major expansion push with zero debt has more than just first-mover advantage.Other tech companies investors should also be taking a look at:Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT): Applied Materials is an often overlooked powerhouse in the chip manufacturing and research industry. As a leading chip fabrication equipment maker, the company designs, manufactures, and sells complex machinery utilized by chip fabs - factories dedicated to semiconductor production. The company is currently the largest chip fab equipment provider in the sector and recently announced its plans to invest up to $4 billion over seven years in the creation of the EPIC Center—a facility aimed at testing new semiconductor technology and fostering collaboration across the industry. Notable partners expressing excitement about this initiative include Nvidia, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, AMD, Intel, and prominent universities such as MIT.While many chip stocks have experienced significant price surges, Applied Materials has not skyrocketed to the same extent. As of now, its shares trade at a modest 18 times trailing-12-month earnings per share (EPS). Although chip fab equipment spending has slowed this year due to economic uncertainties, Applied Materials has adapted by focusing on high-growth segments such as chip fabs for electric vehicles and industrial technology. In its most recent quarter, the company reported a 6% increase in revenue and a 7% rise in EPS year over year.Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL): Regardless of its recent slowdown in revenue growth, Alphabet has seen its shares rise by 40% in 2023, indicating positive market sentiment. The latest data shows that Google Search commands an impressive 92.8% share of the market while Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is gaining traction, outpacing competitors like Amazon Web Services in revenue growth. With a diverse client base and the potential for increased profitability, GCP is poised for further success in the expanding cloud market. Alphabet's culture of innovation, demonstrated by its integration of AI into various products and ventures like Waymo's autonomous driving, ensures the company remains at the forefront of technological advancements.Alphabet's strong financials, including substantial free cash flow and a robust balance sheet, limit downside risks despite global economic uncertainty. With multiple growth drivers, such as digital advertising, cloud infrastructure, and streaming services, Alphabet's diversified revenue streams provide a solid foundation for future growth. Its shares are currently trading at approximately 17 times its projected earnings in 2024, a price that looks attractive with its projected annual increase of over 16% in per-share profits over the next five years.Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL): With a market capitalization of $2.8 trillion, Apple is Berkshire Hathaway's largest equity holding. Its services segment, which includes offerings like Apple Music, Apple Pay, and Apple TV+, has been experiencing remarkable growth, with revenue totaling $20.9 billion in the most recent fiscal quarter. This burgeoning services segment not only benefits Apple's financials with its impressive gross margin of 71%, but it also contributes to the company's customer loyalty. The seamless integration of Apple's hardware and software ecosystem, coupled with its vast user base of over 2 billion active Apple devices, fosters a sense of stickiness among consumers, making it challenging for them to switch to competing platforms.Another compelling aspect of Apple is its proven pricing power, a hallmark of successful companies. Apple has consistently raised prices for its flagship product, the iPhone, without any significant impact on demand. This has helped the company’s remarkable growth in its gross margin, expanding from 38.5% in fiscal 2017 to 43.3% in fiscal 2022. Additionally, Apple generates substantial free cash flow, amounting to a staggering $111 billion in fiscal 2022. This enables the company to return capital to shareholders through share repurchases and a dividend yield of 0.5%. As a long-term holding, there are few companies as compelling as this tech giant.Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN): Amazon's recent first-quarter earnings report revealed impressive revenue figures, surpassing expectations and highlighting a compelling investment opportunity. With a commanding 38% share of online retail shopping in the U.S., Amazon remains the dominant force in e-commerce, bolstered by its unparalleled logistics and distribution capabilities. Additionally, Amazon Web Services (AWS), holding a substantial 32% share of the cloud infrastructure industry, continues to benefit from the growing demand for on-demand cloud environments.AWS's remarkable operating margin of 28% contributes significantly to Amazon's profitability, setting the stage for future expansion. Furthermore, Amazon's digital ads business witnessed strong growth, recording a 23% increase in sales in the first quarter, solidifying its position as a formidable player in the advertising space. With strategic investments in artificial intelligence, exemplified by the launch of Bedrock within AWS in April, Amazon is well-positioned to leverage emerging technologies. Currently trading at an attractive valuation, with shares down 34% from their 2021 peak, Amazon presents an enticing opportunity for investors seeking a dominant market leader with multiple growth drivers and a focus on AI initiatives.Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META): This social media giant has seen its shares soar by nearly 120% in 2023, but the stock is still down 31% from its all-time high. The company exceeded Wall Street's expectations in the first quarter of 2023 and, despite already being a dominant organization, it continues to experience growth, with 3.81 billion monthly active people across its Family of Apps. The opportunity to monetize users outside the U.S. and Canada provides the potential for further revenue growth over time.Reports suggest that Meta may be developing a decentralized alternative to Twitter. Furthermore, the company is heavily focused on leveraging artificial intelligence to enhance content recommendations, boost monetization, and optimize its data infrastructure. These efforts position Meta well for the upcoming technological shifts. Meta's profitability is also worth noting. Over the past five years, the company has maintained an average operating margin of 36.2%, generating substantial free cash flow amounting to $18.4 billion in 2022. This enabled the management team to repurchase $27.9 billion worth of shares last year. With $37 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities on its balance sheet and long-term debt of $10 billion as of March 31, Meta enjoys a solid financial position.IBM (NYSE: IBM): This tech giant has demonstrated resilience in its sales growth despite a challenging environment, yet its stock has declined by around 10% so far this year. The company’s restructuring efforts, including the divestment of its managed infrastructure services segment and the subsequent creation of three simplified segments—Software, Consulting, and Infrastructure—aim to streamline operations and drive future growth. IBM's constant-currency revenue growth rates have shown improvement this year, indicating a narrowing gap between reported and constant-currency growth rates.One major area of optimism lies in IBM's cloud business, which is leveraging its subsidiary Red Hat to expand its cloud ecosystem. With a hybrid cloud approach that capitalizes on Red Hat's open-source software, IBM is able to benefit from the cloud market's growth without directly competing against dominant platforms like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. Coupled with its expanding portfolio of AI services, IBM is well-positioned for long-term growth. Furthermore, the company's improving margins and rising cash flows, driven by cost-cutting measures and strategic layoffs, provide ample resources for investments in the hybrid cloud and AI sectors.Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT): With a market cap of $2.3 trillion, just behind Apple, Microsoft's renowned brands such as Windows, Office, Xbox, and LinkedIn have secured leading market shares across various tech sectors. This dominance has translated into remarkable stock growth, with shares surging over 800% in the past decade. The company's recent foray into artificial intelligence (AI) has only strengthened its investment appeal. Microsoft's early $1 billion investment in OpenAI has proven prescient, as the AI race unfolds, and competitors scramble to enter the burgeoning market. A subsequent $10 billion investment in OpenAI this year has solidified Microsoft's position as a leader. Integrating OpenAI's technologies across its platforms, including Office, Azure, and Bing, Microsoft has established itself as a go-to provider of AI services. Collaborations with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) in AI chip development further exemplify Microsoft's dedication to the field, ensuring optimal performance and effective AI offerings.In addition to AI, Microsoft has made significant strides in the gaming industry. Despite initial challenges competing against industry giants like Sony and Nintendo, Microsoft found success with the introduction of Xbox Game Pass in 2017. The subscription-based service offers access to a vast library of games, attracting millions of subscribers and transforming the Xbox console into a cost-effective option. The platform's popularity has driven Microsoft's acquisition of prominent game studios to enhance its Game Pass offerings.Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ: CSCO): Cisco Systems is a networking giant that develops, manufactures, and sells networking hardware, telecoms equipment, and other IT services and products. With $23.3 billion in cash and equivalents plus short-term investments, Cisco has the resources for potential acquisitions - an area that could heat up in the second half of 2023. The company is also well-positioned for long-term growth driven by the increasing usage of artificial intelligence software and its focus on shifting towards subscription-based software and services.Cisco has shown a decent performance in 2023 so far, with a year-to-date rise of around 10%. Although it has lagged behind the broader Nasdaq-100, which saw a 20% increase over the same period, the growth in the company's core networking business and improved supply chain conditions contributed to the positive performance. Cisco has also revised its full-year guidance, anticipating sales growth between 9% and 10.5%, compared to the previous range of 4% to 6%. The company has observed strong new orders, particularly from the commercial and enterprise sectors, with robust demand in the public sector. With a 3% dividend yield, the risk is limited and Cisco is seen by many investors as a strong long-term hold.Shopify (NYSE: SHOP): Despite experiencing a dip in its stock value in 2022 due to macroeconomic conditions, the company has shown signs of recovery and is poised for brighter days ahead. In the first quarter of 2023, Shopify reported impressive financial figures, with $1.5 billion in revenue and $116 million in monthly recurring revenue (MRR), marking a year-over-year increase of 25% and 10%, respectively. MRR is particularly significant for subscription-based businesses like Shopify as it provides a stable and predictable revenue stream.The company's strategic decision to streamline its focus on its core e-commerce software offerings should put it in good stead going forward. By refocusing on its software expertise, Shopify will look to enhance its gross profit margin and allocate resources more efficiently. As a software company at its core, Shopify recognizes that its primary value lies in providing top-notch e-commerce solutions rather than attempting to compete in the challenging logistics industry. With a solid track record and a renewed focus on e-commerce software, Shopify has the potential to deliver substantial value to investors in the long run.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD): AMD presents a compelling case for investors seeking exposure to the semiconductor industry. While Nvidia dominates the industry, AMD could be a less risky investment option while still providing significant upside potential. The company has the potential to continue capturing market share from Intel in the CPU markets for computers and servers while also challenging Nvidia in the artificial intelligence space.Another promising aspect of AMD's prospects is its partnership with Microsoft, which is actively purchasing the company's AI-focused MI250 chipset and collaborating on future endeavors. AMD is set to launch its MI300 accelerator processing unit later this year, expected to deliver a significant leap in performance for its data center customers. Similar to Nvidia, AMD is in the early stages of benefiting from AI-driven demand, but it still maintains a considerable discount compared to its previous high. The company's potential for continued market share gains, positive demand catalysts, and partnerships in the AI space positions it favorably for future growth.By.

176,2fd5d0de-a4bf-3107-be25-f3cb0c95f579,MPC,2023-06-06,Marathon Petroleum Supports United Way’s Expanded Reach for Days of Caring,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marathon-petroleum-supports-united-way-121000272.html,1686053400,STORY,['MPC'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / June 6, 2023 / Marathon Petroleum CorporationMarathon Petroleum Corporation, Tuesday, June 6, 2023, Press release pictureThe United Way of Hancock County in Ohio organized its spring Days of Caring event to bring together more than 900 volunteers to complete 100 service projects in five days.The volunteers logged 3,600 community service hours during the bi-annual event, which equates to more than $114,000 in savings for the nonprofit organizations.The United Way said the consistent level of volunteerism has allowed leaders to include smaller, home projects for residents in need of support through Backyard Mission Trip.The annual United Way spring Days of Caring event in Hancock County, Ohio, home to Marathon Petroleum's headquarters, featured another outstanding show of volunteers from the community. There were 900 volunteers working on more than 100 projects during the five-day event. From Awakening Minds Art to the YMCA, organizations benefited from the mass of people ready to work.""Our extensive network of employee volunteers accounted for 750 of the people who gave their time to these projects this spring,"" said Ashley Goecke, Advanced Community and Stakeholder Engagement Representative for Marathon Petroleum. ""This is an event that employees look forward to and get excited about doing.""United Way leaders said the consistent number of volunteers who signed up for the spring Days of Caring and the fall 2022 event has allowed them to include more organizations and more projects, including some for residents through Backyard Mission Trip.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read 10 S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats To Avoid. Over the years, there has been an observable shift in focus from growth stocks to dividend stocks in certain market environments. High inflationary periods have fared well for dividend stocks historically. Dividend investing also often aligns with a long-term investment strategy as investors may find comfort in the consistent dividend income and the potential for capital appreciation that quality dividend stocks can offer over time. In 2022, dividend aristocrat stocks outperformed the broader market, falling by just 6.21%, compared with a much harsher decline of 18.1% in the S&amp;P 500.Not only the performance of dividend stocks remained strong compared to other asset classes, but companies in the S&amp;P 500 also paid a record amount in dividend payments last year. According to a report by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, the S&amp;P 500 corporations distributed $561 billion in dividends in 2022, up from $511.2 billion in 2021. Though the market suffered some setbacks in the face of Silicon Bank Valley's failure earlier in March, global dividend payouts sustained their position. In the first quarter of 2023, global dividends grew by 12% on a headline basis to a record $327 billion, as reported by Janus Henderson Investors. The increase was mainly driven by special dividends paid by companies during the quarter.Analysts and economists are giving a positive outlook for dividend stocks as these equities held their ground during uncertain market conditions. Goldman Sachs Chief US Equity Strategist David Kostin spoke with Business Insider in April and mentioned that dividend payments are expected to grow this year as well. Here are some remarks from the analyst:""We expect that S&amp;P 500 DPS [dividend-per-share] will reach $70 in 2023 and $73 (+4%) in 2024. Recent company actions also point to a healthy dividend growth environment. The difference in outlooks for dividend and buyback growth suggests firms focusing on dividends will continue to outperform buyback stocks.""Story continuesDividend growth track records play an important role when investing in dividend stocks. These companies often exhibit solid financial health, strong cash flows, and a history of successful operations. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) are some of the most popular dividend aristocrat stocks, however, in this article, we will cover the least popular dividend aristocrats among hedge funds.25 S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats To AvoidDaily newspaper economy stock market chartOur Methodology:For this list, we scoured Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds as of Q1 2023 and picked the 25 least popular dividend aristocrats in terms of hedge fund positions.

UAL is being aided by buoyant air-travel demand and its goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. However, low liquidity is worrisome.Factors Favoring UALOwing to robust air-travel demand, United Airlines posted a significant year-over-year increase (about 51.1%) in first-quarter 2023 revenues. Passenger revenues (accounting for 89.8% of the top line) of $10,274 million, up 61.8%, resulted in this uptick.Driven by the rosy scenario with respect to air-travel demand, UAL expects revenues for the June quarter to grow 14-16% year over year.  It projects second-quarter earnings per share in the $3.50-$4.00 band. For full-year 2023, UAL expects earnings per share to be between $10 and $12.In line with its goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 without relying on traditional carbon offsets, United Airlines operated the first ever commercial flight using 100% sustainable aviation fuel in one of its two engines. The fuel was supplied by World Energy, North America's only commercial biofuel producer.Key RisksA decline in current ratio (a measure of liquidity) does not bode well for the company. The carrier exited first-quarter 2023 with a current ratio of 0.91, down from the reading of 1 in fourth-quarter 2022. Reduction in this key ratio generally implies that the company's ability to generate cash is on the decline.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCurrently, UAL carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks for investors interested in the Zacks Transportation sector is Copa Holdings, S.A.

Yahoo Finance Live's Julie Hyman and Brad Smith break down what analysts are saying.Video Transcript- We're also watching shares of some of the big retailers today. Analysts losing faith in two of those retailers for certain. Morgan Stanley, the latest firm to downgrade Dollar General after the discount retailer reported disappointing earnings and cut its full-year outlook on Thursday. Piper Sandler, Oppenheimer, and Atlantic equities, all downgraded the stock last week as well.Shares moving lower there by one and a half for Dollar General. Meanwhile, Target also got a cut today from KeyBank. The firm, worrying that student loan repayments will hurt margins. That is something similar to what we had heard from JP Morgan last week, around Target as well or target.However, you're pronouncing them at home. They're saying that given the recent sell-offs, they believe that the downside may be limited. But they see growing risk of student loan payments as likely pushing out the margin recovery story at least another year. Plus them pushing for this downgrade as well on the day hurting the stock.- That's really interesting. I wonder how you figure out of Target customers, how many have a certain debt load from student debt and how that affects their student-- their spending patterns.- At Target, specifically.- Right. I mean, why Target and not some of the other retailers coming out?- Why not Nordstrom? Or why not one of the more expensive ones out there?- I don't know. Maybe there's a cohort of-- an age cohort that has the highest level of debt and maybe they shop at Target.- I mean, it could also be-- and we saw even within some of the recent retail sales data, more of that push for digital comparison shopping as well. That was one of the themes that started to reemerge. And in the events of economic downturns past, we've seen consumers typically, look for more of that comparison shopping to try and hedge how much they might be spending on even discretionary items.And so for Target. Yeah, they've spent a lot on their e-commerce strategies. It was a weak spot though in this most recent quarter though, so perhaps, that's something that they read through and said, yeah, they're not as best positioned on the e-commerce front.- Interesting. I think we're going to be talking a lot more about the student debt story though and all of the unforeseen repercussions.]"

Ben Laidler, eToro Global Markets Strategist, and Tom Essaye, Sevens Report Research Founder and President, join Yahoo Finance Live to discuss what they're watching this summer.Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: But we've got to shift gears here as summer is right around the corner this morning. So what should investors be keeping an eye on is the big question. Our executive editor Brian Sozzi has a list of five key trends to watch out for between your vacations and beach days, and he's here with us now.Also, we've got eToro's Ben Laidler and Tom Essaye from the Sevens Report. They're still with us. They've stuck around. Thanks so much. All right, so help us walk through some of what you had to write this morning, Sozzi as well, just in the fact that there is a lot to be keeping an eye on over the course of this summer.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, let me just tee this one up for the team. I actually cut this list down from 25 down to five. There's a lot of things happening in the markets this summer. I'll start with Target. I'm watching Target share. Stock's down about 14% in the past two weeks as I think concern builds on Wall Street on two fronts.First, a sales impact from the consumer backlash we are seeing from them pulling LGBTQ+ merchandise from their stores a couple of weeks ago. How does sales look like in the second quarter? And then this falls into my second thing to watch that I mentioned in the newsletter. What is the impact to companies like Target that sell discretionary stuff as students start to repay their student loans in early September? That is real money that could come out of the registers of these retailers. By some estimates $400 or $500 a month could be the payments that a lot of college students have to start paying back. That is less money for many retailers.Next up, I'm also watching AI stocks, and I'm pumped to see Ben Axler, noted short seller, on our programming later on today to talk about his case against C3 AI because I think you will see a differentiation between companies like C3 that maybe are on the edge of the AI-- generative AI movement, maybe not even doing anything related to generative AI. But then big companies, more established companies like Hewlett-Packard trying to reinvent computers for the future of AI in various new powerful chips.Story continuesAnd then lastly, of course, I'm watching Apple stock on-- with WWC well underway. What is the market? How do estimates change as maybe some optimism starts to build regarding this new AR headset? And of course, the Fed-- that Fed meeting is coming up very, very soon. Expectations have been the Fed keeps-- does not raise rates at its next meeting, and I think that's what the market is melting up on. I could've went 25.JULIE HYMAN: No, you couldn't.BRIAN SOZZI: I could.JULIE HYMAN: No, you absolutely couldn't. People-- no, that's too much to keep track of, dude.BRIAN SOZZI: No?JULIE HYMAN: All right, so let's get to our guests then. Back to our guests. Ben, what are you watching over the summer? Is there something you're zeroing in on that you think maybe people have overlooked a little bit or that should be paying more attention to?BEN LAIDLER: So I think the economic slowdown is going to arrive, and I think one of the takeaways from Friday, right, is that it tells you how concerned investors are about that, right? We get better jobs market numbers, and instead of selling off, markets rally. That tells me that markets are and investors are, you know, very, very focused on the economy.I think the slowdown is coming. It's inevitable, I think, with rates of 5%, with tightening lending standards, with the spending cuts coming from the debt ceiling bill. So I think at some point over the summer, we're going to see worse economic data. I'm not sure that's necessarily bad for the market, but I think that's coming.We're going to get lower, volume lower-- you know, we're going to get some seasonality. People are worried about that. I think, Julie, volumes never traditionally fall as much as people think. And markets don't necessarily perform that badly, right? It's just more that it's not that very bullish fourth quarter as we reposition for the year ahead and it's not that very bullish first quarter with companies telling us all the fantastic things they're going to do this year. So I guess sort of seasonality and economic slowdown, those are the two things I'm watching.BRAD SMITH: Is Tom, from your perspective, the Fed the looming cloud over the summer forecast here?TOM ESSAYE: No, I don't think so. I think the Fed is sort of the third in my list of things I'm worried about this summer, and it's a flip from last year, right, where the Fed was really driving the market. This year, the data is driving the Fed. And so I think growth obviously-- how much do we slow during the summer?But then also that core services inflation because, at the end of the day, you're looking at core CPI still over 5%. Now, that'll come down gradually because of base effects as we roll the calendar. But at the end of the day, the Fed is not going to be able to sort of announce this dovish pivot that everybody's going to start hoping for in a couple of months until you get inflation down to some sort of an acceptable level.And I think that, for me, is one of the wild cards out there. It seems like people have kind of forgot about inflation, right? It's just sort of-- this disinflation is assumed. And we have come down in inflation, but we've got to keep going. You know, 5% is not good enough. You know, we've got to keep going down. So I think inflation could pop back up this summer as a market influence.BRIAN SOZZI: Tom, Brian here. In the newsletter this morning, like I just mentioned, we talk about Apple and how important that is to the market. But we're also seeing really melt-ups across the tech space. Valuations have gone up significantly. How concerned are you that we are looking at a potential 2000 type of situation here? You know, we saw this run up in 1999, and this might be to some starting to feel similar.TOM ESSAYE: Hi. Good morning, Brian. Yeah, I'm not worried about it yet mainly because I think that tech was coming out of such a hole from last year. The AI euphoria makes me a bit nervous, but this is somebody who has been through various waves of tech euphoria in my career that haven't always come to fruition. It seems like the really big things kind of come out of nowhere sometimes. So the pure momentum and sort of fervor behind AI just makes me a bit nervous. I get that it's transformational and all that. But I don't think we're at valuation levels that would make me super, super nervous on tech broadly.The one caveat here is on yield, right? Part of the reason the tech is outperformed this year is because yields have come off recent, recent highs. If you have yields go back-- which goes back to my inflation point. If you have yields start rallying again, tech's going to get hit kind of regardless of how awesome ChatGPT or AI is.JULIE HYMAN: Guys, thanks so much. Really fun stuff with you both this morning. Ben Laidler, eToro global market strategist and Tom Essaye, Sevens Report Research founder and president. Also, Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi. Thanks, guys.]"

And for most market goers, that means watching the action on the Yahoo Finance app (which I strongly encourage you to download) from a beach, a park, or a pool.While the natural inclination is to ""sell in May and go away,"" I humbly say: please don't do that. Not just because we have bills to pay here, but because there is a litany of interesting stories to track in the markets. I would argue there are many more compelling stories for investors compared to Summer 2022.Here is a tiny sampling of things I am watching during a summer that probably won't involve me going to a beach, pool, or house party because well — investing ""stuff"" is all I got going for me. The order is totally random and not in order of importance.1. Target's stockShares have been hammered by close to 14% in the past two weeks since the company removed LGBTQ+ merchandise from its stores. The fear is consumer backlash means weakening sales and a missed second quarter. The company also caught a JP Morgan downgrade on concerns the restart of student loan payments in Sept. 1 will hurt sales.Unclear if there is a near-term catalyst to jumpstart Target's stock considering all of this, which comes after another tough quarter of sales.2. The economic impact of student loan repaymentsThe downgrade to Target's stock could be a canary-in-the-coal-mine indicator of what analysts and market strategists do this summer before the repayments begin. Are more retailer ratings cut? Do strategists trim their S&amp;P 500 earnings estimates and year-end price targets? How will markets react? The market reaction to the Target downgrade was modest, but can it continue?Story continuesMake no mistake, the payment restart will be a headwind for an economy that doesn't need one.Goldman Sachs estimates student loan repayments will subtract 0.2 percentage points from personal consumption expenditures growth this year if the loan forgiveness plan is struck down, or 0.1 percentage point if the plan stands.Jefferies economist Thomas Simons thinks at least $400 a month in spending capacity will be removed from the pockets of those with student loans.""So as we're now adding this back in to balance sheets that are already pretty strained by two years of very high inflation that's run significantly higher than wage growth, the capacity to absorb this in a lot of budgets I think is much worse now,"" Simons said on Yahoo Finance Live.3. AI StocksIt's time for investors to draw a differentiation in AI stocks. Not doing so could prove very painful to one's portfolio.On the one hand, you have credible companies infusing generative AI into their businesses to unlock efficiencies and win new business. I was very impressed by what HP CEO Enrique Lores told me about how AI will transform the personal computer starting in 2024. With that, the company and rival Dell could be winners of a PC refresh cycle in 2024.I was also surprised to learn from Hewlett Packard Enterprise CFO Tarek Robbiati that the company has secured $800 million in new AI-related business.I fancy we may hear something positive very soon from AMD on the generative AI front. Maybe not as Earth-shattering as Nvidia, but strong enough to excite investors.Salesforce has an AI investor day slated a week from today. And Cisco Live is underway in Las Vegas — AI discussions will probably be front and center here.Again, these are credible companies working on cool AI stuff for the benefit of investors.On the other end of the spectrum, you have companies such as c3.AI.The money-losing company is being attacked by short sellers —such as the super-thorough Ben Axler at Spruce Point— for suspect accounting standards. I think many on the Street are beginning to drill down into the fundamentals of these more fringe AI plays to avoid getting burned —much like when the SPAC bubble burst.I expect a summer of AI scrutiny, leading to a possible rotation into more credible AI stocks.4. Apple's stockApple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) kicks off today (our tech editor Dan Howley will have full live coverage from Apple HQ), and it's time to see these AR/VR glasses the company has been working on for umpteen years.Shares of the tech giant are up almost 40% year to date, in part due to hype building for another new product category for Apple. And, Apple is generally viewed as a safe-haven play.But listen to the team at Morgan Stanley, and you get the sense these glasses have been the bigger tailwind for Apple's stock.""We estimate the AR/VR headset market can grow to $100 billion by 2030, and expand 5x by 2037, to over $500 billion,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring said in a research note ahead of the event.I am not sold on Apple's AR/VR glasses given the expected super high price point. And, I know I am not the only one who's skeptical about Apple having amazing success with a category that has always proven challenging. And how are they doing with that HomePod?Could we see a post-WWDC summer swoon in Apple's stock as glasses hype fades and recession talk resurfaces?Don't rule it out.5. The FedThe Fed could singlehandedly cut summer vacations short if it raises interest rates at its June 14 meeting. Why? The market has bet on the Fed pausing on rate hikes at the meeting, with maybe one more hike for the cycle coming at the July 26 gathering.Hopes for a Fed pause have fed (no pun intended) the markets' naturally bullish inclination — the Nasdaq Composite is up more than 25% on the year. The FANG+ Index is up about 65%.If the Fed doesn't deliver a pause, it may be a Summer Reset for markets.And that is one trend you won't want to be watching from a no-cell-service zone like the beach.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

But you can significantly boost your returns by picking above-average stocks. For example, the Westrock Coffee Company, LLC (NASDAQ:WEST) share price is up 14% in the last 1 year, clearly besting the market return of around 2.4% (not including dividends). So that should have shareholders smiling. Note that businesses generally develop over the long term, so the returns over the last year might not reflect a long term trend.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. See our latest analysis for Westrock Coffee Company Westrock Coffee Company isn't currently profitable, so most analysts would look to revenue growth to get an idea of how fast the underlying business is growing. Shareholders of unprofitable companies usually expect strong revenue growth. That's because fast revenue growth can be easily extrapolated to forecast profits, often of considerable size.Westrock Coffee Company grew its revenue by 22% last year. That's a fairly respectable growth rate. Buyers pushed the share price 14% in response, which isn't unreasonable. If the company can maintain the revenue growth, the share price could go higher still. But before deciding this growth stock is underappreciated, you might want to check out profitability trends (and cash flow)The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-and-revenue-growthIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. If you are thinking of buying or selling Westrock Coffee Company stock, you should check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Westrock Coffee Company shareholders have gained 14% over the last year. And the share price momentum remains respectable, with a gain of 3.7% in the last three months. Demand for the stock from multiple parties is pushing the price higher; it could be that word is getting out about its virtues as a business. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. So on that note, CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for CSX, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.16 = US$6.1b ÷ (US$41b - US$2.3b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Therefore, CSX has an ROCE of 16%. In absolute terms, that's a pretty normal return, and it's somewhat close to the Transportation industry average of 14%. Check out our latest analysis for CSX roceIn the above chart we have measured CSX's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering CSX here  for free.How Are Returns Trending?CSX's ROCE growth is quite impressive. Looking at the data, we can see that even though capital employed in the business has remained relatively flat, the ROCE generated has risen by 39% over the last five years. Basically the business is generating higher returns from the same amount of capital and that is proof that there are improvements in the company's efficiencies. On that front, things are looking good so it's worth exploring what management has said about growth plans going forward.The Bottom LineAs discussed above, CSX appears to be getting more proficient at generating returns since capital employed has remained flat but earnings (before interest and tax) are up. And with a respectable 53% awarded to those who held the stock over the last five years, you could argue that these developments are starting to get the attention they deserve. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.Story continuesLike most companies, CSX does come with some risks, and we've found 1 warning sign  that you should be aware of.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

The landmark test will contribute critical data and research on the fuel's capabilities and supply chain infrastructure needed to further the industry's alternative fuel ambitions.Celebrity Cruises’ Celebrity ApexDuring the three-month test, Celebrity Apex will depart from the Port of Rotterdam and Symphony of the Seas will depart from the Port of Barcelona, using a biofuel blend that reduces the ships' carbon emissions. The biofuel blend is produced by purifying renewable raw materials like oils and fats and combining it with fuel oil to create an alternative fuel that is cleaner and more sustainable.""Biofuels will play an increasingly important role in achieving, not only our own, but the entire maritime sector's decarbonization goals in the short and medium term. We take great pride in continuing to push our industry forward in exploring innovative fuel solutions that reduce carbon impact and preserve the vibrancy of the oceans we sail,"" said Jason Liberty, President and CEO, Royal Caribbean Group.The cruise company plans to continue increasing the use of alternative lower carbon fuel to meet the needs of its ships across the fleet.

With the completion of the trials our hope is to advance our ships' ability to meaningfully reduce emissions and propel forward strategic partnerships with suppliers and ports to ensure there is sufficient availability of biofuel and infrastructures to make maritime energy transition a reality,"" Liberty said.Story continuesThis key step in Royal Caribbean Group's pursuit of alternative fuels follows closely after a biofuel trial on its California-based Navigator of the Seas, became the first a cruise ship to sail from a U.S. port while using renewable diesel fuel this past fall.With a sustainability journey that began over 30 years ago, Royal Caribbean Group has remained steadfast in its commitment to innovate, and advance, the solutions necessary for a better future. Building on a robust portfolio of technologies that improve energy efficiency, water treatment and waste management, trialing biofuels is a step that moves the company closer to achieving Destination Net Zero, its vision for net-zero emissions by 2050. To learn more about Royal Caribbean Group's sustainability efforts, information is available at  www.royalcaribbeangroup.com/sustainability.About Royal Caribbean Group:Royal Caribbean Group (NYSE: RCL) is one of the leading cruise companies in the world with a global fleet of 64 ships traveling to approximately 1,000 destinations around the world.

Royal Caribbean Group President and CEO Jason Liberty sits down with Yahoo Finance's Diane King Hall to discuss the cruise operator's outlook and whether or not he's seeing the ""revenge travel"" trend continue.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]AKIKO FUJITA: Well, the strengthened travel demand is providing cruise liners with some wind in its sails, as Royal Caribbean looks to continue the travel optimism into the summer season. Yahoo Finance's Diane King Hall sat down with Royal Caribbean CEO Jason Liberty on the state of consumer demand and the type of customer the cruise line is servicing now. Take a listen.JASON LIBERTY: We saw incredible acceleration here in the first quarter and the demand environment, which caused outperformance in our first quarter. And we raised our guidance, the earnings guidance for the year, by over 40%. Those trends continue to be very strong. And we, you know, we get to deliver 150,000 vacations every single day to our guests. And they're super happy.DIANE KING HALL: What about 2024 and beyond? Is it still smooth-sailing?JASON LIBERTY: Yeah. Well, really, for the past couple of months and certainly right now, most of the bookings we're taking on is for 2024. So the demand trends that we've seen earlier in the year is very much flowing into 2024 and even into 2025.DIANE KING HALL: And what are your expectations for EBITDA through 2025? We know you have the trifecta program where you're trying to hit three benchmarks. Where do you stand with that?JASON LIBERTY: Yeah. So we're very much on track for our trifecta goals. You know, one is to get to triple digit EBITDA per APCD. The second one is to be well into the teens on an ROI basis and then getting our earnings up into the double digit zone, again, as we burn off a lot of this negative carry that we had to take in during the pandemic. So we feel really good about the cash flow generation of the business. And we feel we're very aligned with our trifecta goals.Story continuesDIANE KING HALL: And let's talk about the customer, the type of customer you have. Now, there were people during the pandemic who said they would never return to cruise. Are you seeing a return of loyalists, previous customers? Or are your customers now new to cruise?JASON LIBERTY: Yeah. So historically, you know, pre-pandemic, about a third of our guests were new to cruise, a third of our guests were loyalists, and the third of our guests refers to brand. What we see now is one propensity to cruise has completely returned back that was in 2019. But we're seeing more new to cruise than we had seen in 2019. We're seeing more first to brand, which is very much in line with our growth expectations for our capacity, growth as our new ships come on.DIANE KING HALL: And what about the demographics? Cruise tend to attract more of middle-aged customers. And of course, you have families. What are the demographics like now? And what are you doing to attract younger customers?JASON LIBERTY: Yeah. So we have really three core brands that are really in their different segments. And so they all address different age and demographic categories. Like our royal brand is very focused on multigenerational family. Our celebrity brand, people that are in their early 50s, more Gen X in nature. And our so received brand, which is Ultra Luxury and Expedition, tend to attract a little bit of the Baby Boomer side of things.What we are seeing is the guest is actually a little bit younger on average than what we saw pre-pandemic. And a lot of that is because there's more millennials that are now into the system as they got married and started to have kids and are looking to experience incredible travel experiences.DIANE KING HALL: That's awesome. All right. And talk to me about pricing. How is that holding up in the face of consumers starting to make cutbacks in different areas of their life? We're hearing that from different industries, different companies. What are you seeing and how are you dealing with that from a pricing basis?JASON LIBERTY: Yeah. So we've actually seen and we continue to see the ability to raise price in the current market, which is somewhat counterintuitive to, you know, the point you just made and also counterintuitive to some of the information out, that's out there. The main driver of that, one, I think, is having best brands, best ships win. And our guests get this incredible experience on our ships. And that gets broadcasted through advocacy of our guests, who are experiencing that.But there's also a pretty significant value gap to land-based vacation. And so as RevPAR and other things went up on the hotels and land-based vacations, we have that opportunity now to begin to close that gap. And that gap was about 15% to 20% pre-pandemic. Today, it's about 35% to 45%. And we're going to make, you know, a pretty good dent in it here in 2023.DIANE KING HALL: Is revenge travel still a thing?JASON LIBERTY: I think it's less about revenge travel. We don't really see in our surveying of our guests. It's more that the guest has shifted back to this trajectory of experiences outpacing buying stuff. And that's what we're seeing from our guests and what we-- and what we collect in our survey data is they bought enough stuff. What they want to do is collect experiences, create stories with their friends and family and loved ones. And fortunately, that's-- that's what we do for a living.DIANE KING HALL: OK. And I got to ask you about tipping. Tipping is a big part of cruise life-- your waiter, your steward, your purser. But there's been kind of this backlash about tip-flation. How do you keep customers and staff happy given that kind of climate?JASON LIBERTY: Yeah. So, you know, so we're not in a place where we're charging for a kitchen fee or those type of things. We have a gratuity. It raises typically just based off of how inflation is changing. And that's more what is. It's pretty much a standard fee. Of course, our guests and can provide more. The guests can also choose not to, you know, not to tip if they don't choose to.But-- but a gratuity-based system, a service-based system, we think is really important. But we're not chopping at every corner here on tipping. We have pretty much a standard fee for it.AKIKO FUJITA: And one more question for you. What's the China story like for you now as demand come back?JASON LIBERTY: Yeah. So we're now that-- you know, we now have a better view on how China was-- how China is going to start back up, our plan is to re-enter China next year.

They love our brand, the Royal Caribbean brand, in that marketplace. And we expect to be there next year.]"

(NASDAQ:ADI) With A Negative Sentiment As A Result Of Its Mixed Fundamentals?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/market-rewarding-analog-devices-inc-130034072.html,1685970034,STORY,['ADI'],"[It is hard to get excited after looking at Analog Devices' (NASDAQ:ADI) recent performance, when its stock has declined 2.8% over the past three months. It seems that the market might have completely ignored the positive aspects of the company's fundamentals and decided to weigh-in more on the negative aspects. Fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes so it makes sense to study the company's financials. Specifically, we decided to study Analog Devices'  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for Analog Devices How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Analog Devices is:10% = US$3.6b ÷ US$36b (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.10.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.A Side By Side comparison of Analog Devices' Earnings Growth And 10% ROEWhen you first look at it, Analog Devices' ROE doesn't look that attractive. Next, when compared to the average industry ROE of 16%, the company's ROE leaves us feeling even less enthusiastic. However, the moderate 18% net income growth seen by Analog Devices over the past five years is definitely a positive. We reckon that there could be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.Story continuesWe then compared Analog Devices' net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 32% in the same period, which is a bit concerning.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about Analog Devices''s valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is Analog Devices Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Analog Devices has a significant three-year median payout ratio of 75%, meaning that it is left with only 25% to reinvest into its business. This implies that the company has been able to achieve decent earnings growth despite returning most of its profits to shareholders.Besides, Analog Devices has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 36% over the next three years. As a result, the expected drop in Analog Devices' payout ratio explains the anticipated rise in the company's future ROE to 15%, over the same period.SummaryOverall, we have mixed feelings about Analog Devices. While the company has posted a decent earnings growth, We do feel that the earnings growth number could have been even higher, had the company been reinvesting more of its earnings at a higher rate of return. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

213,09f0ab7c-0cde-3973-ba6b-e73b40ce0d66,RF,2023-06-06,Regions Financial's (NYSE:RF) investors will be pleased with their notable 45% return over the last three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/regions-financials-nyse-rf-investors-135501485.html,1685973301,STORY,['RF'],"[Regions Financial Corporation (NYSE:RF) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 19% in the last quarter. But at least the stock is up over the last three years. Arguably you'd have been better off buying an index fund, because the gain of 30% in three years isn't amazing.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. View our latest analysis for Regions Financial To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Regions Financial was able to grow its EPS at 22% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. This EPS growth is higher than the 9% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has moderated its expectations for growth, somewhat. This cautious sentiment is reflected in its (fairly low) P/E ratio of 7.67.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthIt's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Regions Financial's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Regions Financial the TSR over the last 3 years was 45%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveInvestors in Regions Financial had a tough year, with a total loss of 14% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 4.2%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 3%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with Regions Financial , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Regions Financial is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

214,3fd4a926-0884-394f-9078-f09aa95149ad,V,2023-06-06,10 High Quality S&P 500 Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-high-quality-p-500-113601893.html,1686051361,STORY,"['^GSPC', '^DJI', 'MA', 'NVDA', 'GOOGL', 'V', 'WMT', 'MSFT', 'AMZN', 'CRM']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the ten high quality S&amp;P 500 stocks billionaires are loading up on. For more stocks, head on over to 5 High Quality S&amp;P 500 Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On.As the first half of 2023 comes to an end, the primary concern on anyone's mind is whether there will be a recession this year. Courtesy of modern day data collection and analysis capabilities, policymakers are able to have some insight into how the economy is performing to tailor their decisions accordingly. And this data is crucial in enabling the Federal Reserve to decide whether it will further increase interest rates or consider pausing and gradually bringing them down.On this front, June started with a crucial data reading from the Labor Department. This revealed that the labor market remained strong and added 339,000 jobs in May. This indicates that despite the record interest rate hikes by the Fed, the economy remains resilient - lending credence to speculation that perhaps more interest rate increases might be on the cards. However, for the interest rate bears, the unemployment rate also increased by 0.3% to sit at 3.7% - the largest jump since the start of the coronavirus pandemic's economic disruption in April 2020.So what does this mean for the stock market? In more normal times, a potential economic slowdown would lead to the stock market dropping as well - but the contrarian nature of the two primary metrics within this report made studying the immediate impact on the market even more interesting. Overall, markets reacted positively, as the NASDAQ index rose by 1%, the S&amp;P 500 by 1.45%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) by 2.12%. This indicated that investors had taken the rise in unemployment and a reduction in wage growth as the primary takeaway from the labor report, using these to form opinions that believe that the Fed will not deliver an interest rate hike late this month.Story continuesHowever, the jobs report is only one part of the Fed's decision making process. An equally important metric is the inflation report that will come out on the same day the Fed officials will meet to set the policy rate. And while there are few estimates available as to what might happen later this month, there are other metrics that point at the consumer and broader economic sentiment. One such metric is the Consumer Confidence Index which aims to look at household expectations of their financial situations for the near future. This index dropped to 102.3 in May from 103.7 in April as the broader gloom about the debt ceiling standoff between Congress and the President weighed on consumers' minds. At the same time, long term inflation expectations also dropped and stood at 6.1% for the next twelve months as they marked a new low since January 2021.Speaking of which, it's not only the households that believe inflation will come down. The two-year breakeven inflation (BEI) rate for inflation protection bonds dropped below 2% in May for the first time in years, indicating that bond investors believe that inflation will fall below this rate in the coming years as well. This is in strong contrast to a reading of 3% for the start of 2023. Finally, Fed Funds Futures pricing data gathered through the CME FedWatch Tool shows that there is a 75% probability that interest rates will remain unchanged this month. However, this might make for some early optimism since the picture changes when we consider the outlook for July. For July, there is a 53.5% probability that the Fed will deliver a 25 basis point hike.So how is this choppy environment making an impact on investment managers? Well, on this front, the management of Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) shared some insights at the bank's earnings call for the first quarter of 2023 where they outlined:Overall margin in the Wealth Management business was 26%, impacted by modest increases in credit reserves, slightly lower growth of NII versus forecast and ongoing integration expenses. We continue to focus on the levers within our control with an eye towards expense management. In ISG, underwriting and M&amp;A remain very subdued. As I have said previously, these are revenues delayed, not dead. Already, we are seeing a growing M&amp;A pipeline and some spring-like signs of new issuance emerging. That said, it largely remains a back half 2023 and full year 2024 story.On the positive side, our fixed income and equity trading teams performed very well in managing through some historic rate moves.Total trading revenues were solid. I expect the markets to remain choppy through this earnings season and for the next several months. However, absent any geopolitical surprise or limited progress on bringing down inflation, I think 2023 is likely to end on a constructive note in most areas. Morgan Stanley is very well positioned not just for 2023, but for several years ahead as we see significant growth opportunities across all three of our client platforms.I will now pass it over to Sharon for more details on the first quarter. Sharon Yeshaya Thank you, and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $14.5 billion in the first quarter, our EPS was $1.70, and our ROTCE was 16.9%. The firm’s results demonstrated the durability of our business model, evidenced by the resilient ROTCE, robust asset consolidation and wealth and our stable capital and liquidity levels.In institutional securities, fixed income and equity supported our clients while navigating volatile markets. Wealth Management showcased $110 billion of net new assets and investment management continued to benefit from the investments we have made to diversify our offerings.With these details in mind, let's take a look at the top S&amp;P 500 stocks that have found favor among billionaires, as the index and the individuals represent the best of both worlds, particularly in this uncertain economic environment.

Click to skip ahead and see Billionaire Bridgewater Founder Ray Dalio’s Top 5 Holdings in 2023.McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) are three of the top holdings in billionaire money manager Ray Dalio’s consumer-focused 13F portfolio.Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates has been the most successful fund in history in terms of net dollar gains since inception, delivering $52.2 billion in gains through the end of 2021 according to research conducted by LCH Investments. The fund continued to roll last year even in the midst of Dalio stepping down in October, as the Pure Alpha strategy returned 9.5%.Bridgewater has undertaken several initiatives under new chief executive Nir Bar Dea, including slashing 8% of its workforce and capping investments in its flagship fund as it looks to reallocate resources and restructure. Among other things, Bar Dea plans to invest heavily in Bridgewater’s AI and machine learning capabilities.Meanwhile, Dalio continues to expand his family office, which manages the billionaire’s greater than $16 billion in personal wealth, as well as his philanthropic donations. The Dalio Family Office’s newest branch is planned for Abu Dhabi, where it will work alongside the firm’s existing branches in Singapore and the United States.Dalio gave the recently agreed-upon debt-ceiling deal a D grade in a tweet on Twitter, adding that it was about the best that could be expected but simply wasn’t good enough. In a LinkedIn post published in May, Dalio warned that the U.S. faces a disastrous financial collapse if it continues to raise the debt ceiling without any meaningful limit being put in place.Dalio also engaged in a recent conversation of sorts with the AI chat platform ChatGPT as he relayed in a YouTube video posted in the middle of April. ChatGPT wondered what the most important investing-related lesson is that Dalio learned throughout his storied career, to which the Bridgewater founder responded that diversification was the “Holy Grail” of investing. Dalio added that by investing in 10 to 15 good, uncorrelated assets, an investor can reduce their risk by about 80% without impacting their potential returns.Story continuesIn the first quarter, Bridgewater Associates made significant adjustments to its 13F portfolio, selling off 228 of its former holdings while adding just 118 new positions in their place. The firm also trimmed the size of far more holdings than it was adding to. Of particular note was Bridgewater’s exposure to the finance sector, which was lowered by 330 basis points to 23%. In response, Bridgewater’s exposure to healthcare and communications stocks was raised by a combined 371 basis points. Bridgewater’s 13F portfolio dropped to $16.4 billion in assets as of the end of March, down from $18.3 billion at the end of 2022.Amid a turbulent quarter, the first full one in which Nir Bar Dea was at the helm of Dalio’s iconic firm, let’s take a look at the top ten holdings of the fund in 2023.Billionaire Bridgewater Founder Ray Dalio’s Top 10 Holdings in 2023Ray Dalio of Bridgewater AssociatesOur MethodologyThe following data is gathered from Bridgewater Associates’ latest 13F filing with the SEC. We follow hedge funds like Bridgewater Associates because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q1 2023 reporting period.Billionaire Bridgewater Founder Ray Dalio’s Top 10 Holdings in 202310. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $223 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 174 The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are a few of the longtime favorite top holdings of Bridgewater founder and CIO Ray Dalio. A newer addition to a top 10 spot among his holdings is Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), after Dalio grew his stake in the company by nearly 150% during Q3 of 2022. In the first quarter of this year he boosted the size of his V stake by another 19%, ending Q1 with 990,819 shares.Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) has broadly outperformed the S&amp;P 500 over the last decade and could very well do so in the decade to come. The credit card payments processor is still growing revenue at a low-double digit rate and has several tailwinds at its back that could allow it to continue doing for the foreseeable future. Chief among those tailwinds are the continued rise in the global penetration of credit cards and ecommerce’s growing share of global sales. And both of those tailwinds have plenty of room to run yet. As such, Visa shares are currently trading at somewhat of a premium at 29.5x earnings.Polen Global Growth Strategy shared some of the fundamental strengths that Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) enjoys in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“We trimmed Mastercard and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) to equal weights of the Portfolio. Mastercard and Visa operate as a duopoly in a large and growing market. Over the last 50 years, global personal consumer expenditures (PCE) has grown 7-9% annualized. We expect 4-5% long-term PCE growth going forward. Additionally, the shift from cash to credit continues unabated, with a total credit penetration of only approximately 50% globally.3 This shift provides Visa and Mastercard with another ~4-6% of growth. When combined with PCE, this gives both companies high-single-digit to low-double[1]digit revenue growth opportunities. This growth estimate is before accounting for growth amplifiers like the acceleration of e[1]commerce, the shift from offline to online, and additional services. Both companies enjoy extremely strong network effects that provide strong competitive advantages.We have trimmed Visa and Mastercard because their combined weight grew to over 12% of the Global Growth Portfolio because of their recent performance and to fund our increase in Amazon’s position size. We added to both positions when their prices were depressed due to cross-border transactions deteriorating materially from the pandemic. Cross-border volumes came roaring back when travel corridors reopened, and although we are several quarters removed from the cross-border nadir, Visa still grew volumes &gt;30% in 1Q23. Total cross-border volumes are now 132% of 2019 levels. At 4.5% each, both companies remain high conviction positions for Global Growth.”9. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $239 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 204 (GOOG), 155 (GOOGL) Bridgewater CIO Ray Dalio was bullish on Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) during Q1 after shares hit a two-year low at the end of 2022. Dalio more than tripled the size of his stake in Alphabet’s class A (GOOGL) shares during the quarter, holding just under 2.31 million of them at the end of March. GOOGL shares are having a much better 2023 so far, gaining 37%.As Baron Opportunity Fund discusses below, one of the biggest worries investors have about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) right now is how its search engine traffic will hold up against the rise of ChatGPT, which has already had 1.6 billion visitors. When users want general information on certain topics, they may be increasingly likely to seek out quick answers from the AI platform rather than wade through pages of search results (and ads), which frequently contain links to outdated or even irrelevant content. While Google plans to eventually release its own competing AI platform, if anything that will just further cannibalize its own search engine and eat into its ad revenue.Baron Opportunity Fund continues to lower its exposure to Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) given some of those worries, as it revealed in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“As we did last quarter, we continued to decrease our weighting in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) because, as stated earlier, we believe ChatGPT and/or similar AI-based services present a hard-to-measure risk to Google’s virtual search monopoly.”8. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $259 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 69 There’s been a 23% rise in hedge fund ownership of Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) over the past two quarters, with the stock sitting near its all-time high in smart money shareholders. Bridgewater Associates pared back its SBUX holding by 5% during the first quarter to 2.49 million shares.Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) continues to expand its global footprint, with plans to grow its store count to 45,000 within the next two years, which would double its store count since 2015. Starbucks plans to open about one-third of those new stores in China, where it’s understandably been facing headwinds of late, but the long-term opportunity there is tremendous. SBUX shares have dipped by 13% since the company’s latest earnings report in early May, driving their price down to 32.2x earnings, which looks reasonable.The Polen Global Growth Strategy isn’t as bullish on Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) as Bridgewater’s Ray Dalio, as it sold off its stake in the company in Q4 according to its Q4 2022 investor letter:“We also liquidated our remaining position in Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX). While the company remains a unique and resilient franchise, China is a very important growth market for the company, and zero-COVID policies have made it challenging for the company to operate in this important market. While we expect China to return to more “normal” operation at some point, any COVID flare-ups, in China or other markets, present a very real headwind to Starbucks’ profitability. L’Oreal, Estée Lauder, and other holdings continue to have meaningful exposure to China, but in each of these cases, our research indicates they’re able to better adapt to these operating challenges and realize the growth opportunity in China through their online businesses. In short, we think there are better risk-reward opportunities.”7. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $394 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 92 There was a massive spike in hedge fund ownership of Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) during Q1, as 37% more funds were long WMT at the end of Q1 than at the start of it. Louis Bacon’s Moore Global Investments and George Soros’ Soros Fund Management were among the funds adding Walmart to their 13F portfolios. On the other hand, Bridgewater’s Ray Dalio offloaded 22% of his Walmart shares during the quarter, ending March with 2.67 million of them.Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) grew e-commerce sales by 26% during the first quarter of its fiscal year 2024, while overall sales rose by 7.7% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Operating cash flow also rebounded to $4.6 billion in the quarter from a loss of $3.8 billion a year earlier.After buying back about $10 billion worth of its shares in FY 2023, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) scaled back to just $700 million in repurchases in the latest quarter. The company still has $18.6 billion remaining on its share repurchase authorization, which would buy back close to 5% of its outstanding shares.6. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $428 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 63 Closing out the first half of Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio’s top holdings in 2023 is Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), ranking sixth. The billionaire money manager trimmed his stake in the wholesale retailer by 9% during Q1, ending the quarter with 861,306 shares. He owned the largest COST position among the select group of hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey’s database.Hedge funds and analysts love Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) for its staunchly loyal customer base and its strong value proposition. Truist has a $568 price target on the stock and believes the tougher economic conditions will allow Costco to further grow its membership and gain market share. Deutsche Bank has a $574 target on COST shares.Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) has been experiencing some weakness in its discretionary categories, which led to soft March sales and negative comps for the first time in nearly seven years, excluding the pandemic. It’s likely that weakness was felt broadly across retail however and wasn’t Costco specific. Overall March sales grew by 0.5% to $21.7 billion.PepsiCo, Inc.

218,00e9319a-9cf2-373c-8c52-ebcb1a54b7f3,MAR,2023-06-06,Marriott CEO on the “Resilience of Travel” and New Paths for Growth,Skift,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marriott-ceo-resilience-travel-paths-205832646.html,1685998712,STORY,['MAR'],"[Marriott International CEO Anthony Capuano is shown here talking at Skift Global Forum 2022 in New York. Source: Skift.Anthony Capuano took the helm of Marriott International in early 2021 in what was in some ways a battlefield promotion, following the tragic death of the company’s president and CEO Arne Sorensen. After navigating the tumultuous post-pandemic era, Capuano finally has time to pause and fine-tune strategy at the world’s largest hotelier.“The speed with which we went from the depths of the pandemic and its impact on our business to achieving record-setting EBITDA in 2022 and the strongest quarterly EBITDA that we’ve ever had in the first quarter of 2023, to me, I say that illustrates the resilience of travel and that illustrates the wisdom of our business model,” said Capuano. “So you shouldn’t expect any deviation from our core strategy.”Yet fine-tuning may be in order. Capuano wants to see the company, which has more than 1.5 million rooms, expand faster internationally in hotel count and loyalty membership. He spoke with Skift on Monday during the New York University International Hospitality Industry Investment Conference.To strengthen the group’s core lodging business, Capuano’s team will look to drive down costs. Steps include “continuing to drive down affiliation costs in the franchise portion of the business” and boosting margins in the managed portion.Marriott’s announcement on Monday of a planned new extended-stay brand partly illustrated this. It’s in the mid-scale segment, meaning a typical nightly rate of $80 in the U.S. and Canada. That’s the first time Marriott has played at that low price level and with development costs of under $14 million per property. The move came just after Marriott closed on its acquisition of Mexico-based City Hotels, which also is mostly in the mid-scale segment and has relatively reduced costs to develop and operate.Capuano said his team is still evaluating if the City Hotels by Marriott brand should come to North America to appeal to transient leisure travelers and complement the new extended-stay brand.Story continuesGoing for Global GrowthMarriott, which is in 138 countries and territories today, has 20 more countries in the pipeline. The company has 1.5 million rooms, and about 60% of its development pipeline is outside the United States. It is aiming for at least 4 percent net rooms growth this year.Capuano credits the company’s overseas momentum with a decision to decentralize some decision-making away from its headquarters.“When I took over development in 2009, more than half of our transactors globally were ex-pats, which was pretty standard for the industry,” Capuano said. “You had a lot of Brits and Germans sprinkled around the world.”“Today, more than 90% of our international development teams are living and working in their home countries or regions,” Capuano said. “That’s why we’re getting a disproportionate share of the deals in those markets. At its core, I believe real estate is a local business.”Looking for Adjacent BusinessesCapuano wants to expand into adjacent categories, including recent entries into Ritz Carlton-branded yacht-style cruise ships, home rentals through Marriott Homes and Villas, and a rapidly expanding branded residential business.“We’ll continue to build off this extraordinarily strong core lodging foundation that we’ve built and explore adjacencies that we think will enhance your experience as a traveler and enhance the overall economic proposition of our shareholders,” Capuano said.Leaning Into LoyaltyCapuano also wants to continue strengthening the Marriott Bonvoy loyalty platform by growing it internationally.“In some ways, it’s the most important of our brands because it pulls together the entirety of the portfolio,” Capuano said.“We want to ensure that if you’re a member of Marriott Bonvoy, for any travel purpose anywhere in the world, you never need to look outside that ecosystem,” Capuano said. “So we need a broad portfolio across multiple price points and multiple geographic locations.”Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

The risks are lower and the margins are higher,"" said Evens Charles, chief executive officer of Washington-based real estate and hotel operator Frontier Development and Hospitality Group.Big brands like Marriott and Hilton are jumping in with new plans that target the sector.Marriott International Inc on Monday said it would expand in the affordable mid-scale lodging segment with a new extended-stay brand called Project MidX Studios to be built outside city centers that costs an average of $80 a night.Hilton Worldwide Holdings in May announced plans for a limited service, extended-stay option called Project H3 while Hyatt Hotels in April announced Hyatt Studios, the company's entry into upper-midscale lodging in the Americas.""A way to combat the lower supply outlook for those brands is to introduce these new brands in the lower chain where the money is flowing or developers are still developing, because the economics are still working,"" said Michael Bellisario, director of equity research at Baird, a private wealth management firm.(Reporting by Doyinsola Oladipo in New York and Bianca Flowers in Chicago; editing by Deepa Babington)]"

The hotel chain is announcing a new extended stay brand geared towards guests seeking options for longer accommodations. Anthony Capuano, Marriott International President CEO joins us now. Anthony, always good to see you. Thanks for coming down here.ANTHONY CAPUANO: Thanks for having me back.- So we're ready, summer travel season is underway. What are you seeing in terms of demand?ANTHONY CAPUANO: Well, again, the last time we spoke, I talked about the resilience of travel. And I think our Q1 results really underscored that resilience. Q1 was the strongest quarterly EBITDA the company has ever experienced. And Q1, normally, is a bit of a quiet quarter.We saw strong recovery across price tiers and across geographies. And that continues. I was just looking at some July 4th data. RevPAR, which is obviously Revenue Per Available Room, the metric we use to track performance, is up about 10% year over year. Forward group bookings through the end of the year look particularly strong, and that's what caused us, during that first quarter earnings call, to actually raise global RevPAR guidance to 10 to 13%.- You talk to a lot of people, a lot of global leaders, Anthony, what do you think is driving that? Because what I think a lot of investors hear the economy is slowing, maybe not doing as well as you would expect in this cycle, but that's not what we're hearing from your company and a lot of other hotel chains.ANTHONY CAPUANO: I'd say two things. Number one, even prior to the pandemic, you saw a bit of this shift away from consumer spending on hard goods and moving those dollars towards experiences. It certainly appears, when we look at the data, that the pandemic acted as an accelerant to that trend. And maybe pre-pandemic, that trend was more limited towards younger consumers. It appears to be across demographics now.Story continuesAnd then I would say, secondly, the consumer remains strong. You saw the jobs report last week. And of course, there are sectors, like tech, where you've seen some job losses. But in general, unemployment is low, consumers are feeling a bit more confident, and that's driving travel demand.- Is your business in the US back above pre-pandemic levels?ANTHONY CAPUANO: It is.- Wow. In terms of all brands or there are certain brands in your portfolio-- what? 31 brands, you have?ANTHONY CAPUANO: 31 brands, yeah.- What's driving it?ANTHONY CAPUANO: It's less about the brands and maybe more a little market-specific. So leisure destinations are well above where we were pre-pandemic. Urban markets that have some leisure element, New York is a great example of that, well beyond.There are some markets, San Francisco comes to mind, that are still working their way back. But most geographies are back, even mainland China is back above where we were pre-pandemic. Despite the fact that international airlift is only about 40% of what it was prior to the pandemic.- And what are you seeing in terms of business travel?ANTHONY CAPUANO: Business travel is kind of the tortoise in ""The Tortoise and Hare,"" slow and steady recovery. But you almost have to look at it in two categories. Small and medium sized businesses are long since recovered.- Big part of your business, right?ANTHONY CAPUANO: It is. About 60% of our business transient. That is long since recovered to pre-pandemic levels. The big multinationals continue to recover steadily, but they're not quite back.- What about China?ANTHONY CAPUANO: China-- mainland China has fully recovered. Greater China is getting dragged a bit by Hong Kong, which has not fully recovered. But again, most of China's recovery has been driven by domestic demand.In April, total airline capacity for cross-border travel was only about 40% of what it was pre-pandemic. As that airline capacity continues to recover through the back half of the year, we expect lots and lots of upside.- Are some of these trends in the US, in terms of RevPAR, Revenue Per Available Room, and even China, is that sustainable into the back half of the year?ANTHONY CAPUANO: We think so. When we look at it-- now, the one caveat is most of the questions I get about demand patterns sounds something like, given the interest rate environment, given inflationary environment, given talk of recession, aren't you worried? We don't see it in the data yet.The one caveat to that is for the transient component of our business, our booking window is only about 21 days. So that could shift a bit. If you started to see some real weakness for the consumer, weakness in consumer confidence, that could shift a bit. One of the things that does give me confidence, however, is the strength of our group demand.When we finished up the first quarter, we looked at US group demand. For the remaining quarters of this year, total group revenue is tracking up about 26% to where we were a year ago.- Before-- my newsroom knew we were talking so they had two questions. First up, in terms of developing properties, we're seeing a lot of concern. Rising interest rates could impact the commercial real estate market. Does that hurt your business in any way?ANTHONY CAPUANO: Yeah. Most of our development partners are long-term investors in the sector, they understand interest rates' ebb and flow. What's more impactful to them is just constriction in the debt markets and the actual availability of debt for new construction. That challenge has been exacerbated by some of the challenges we've seen in regional banks as a result of SVB and some of the other failures.It's one of the reasons you see most of the global brand companies so focused on conversions. We reported during the first quarter that nearly a third of both our signings volume and our openings were the result of conversions, and that will continue to be a strong focus.- Second question. Big focus by you guys on extended stay. I would say even the hotel industry is really focused on this, 20 to 30 day stays. And we were thinking about it, well, who's staying in a hotel for 20 or 30 days? How do you think about it at Marriott?ANTHONY CAPUANO: Well, it's interesting. If you look at the early days of the recovery from the pandemic for our company and for our industry, in many ways, our extended stay brands led that recovery, and we see that trend continuing.You've got folks who have learned that they can work from almost anywhere. Some of them are nomads, some are choosing rather than signing a year-long lease with security deposits and first and last month, they're taking on temporary assignments.They might be government contractors, they might be consultants, they might be construction workers, whatever it might be. And they are spending 30 days, 60 days, 90 days. And these sorts of accommodations really fit their needs to a tee.- How much does it cost per stay, and how many of these will you have?ANTHONY CAPUANO: Well, we think we'll have hundreds. I mean, we announced a new mid-scale extended stay platform today, and we already have active 350 projects under discussion.- This sounds like a lot better than signing a lease.ANTHONY CAPUANO: Yeah, for sure.- Absolutely. Well, Marriott CEO and President, Anthony Capuano. Always good to see you.ANTHONY CAPUANO: Great to see you.- Thank you so much.ANTHONY CAPUANO: Thanks for having me.]"

The study is the latest in a series of in-depth industry reports between PCMA and Marriott International, that began in 2015, and was initially previewed at Marriott's THE EXCHANGE: Association Masters Customer Conference, which took place May 30-June 1, 2023 at the reimagined Sheraton Phoenix Downtown. ""Business event professionals are looking to provide innovative experiences that break the mold for meetings and drive lasting results with their event attendees and clients,"" said Tammy Routh, Senior Vice President, Global Sales, Marriott International. ""Consumer patterns, behaviors, and motivators are constantly evolving, and we are excited to provide insights our customers have been asking for through this new research.""During the research process, Marriott, PCMA and CEMA conducted more than 60 one-on-one interviews. Each interview was followed by a series of global roundtables with experts and thought leaders in experience design, who assessed how these trends should be integrated into event strategies. The research, conducted by Storycraft Labs, was synthesized into six guiding principles intended to drive experience innovation for years to come:Exploring Identities: Humans seek the ability to find their own individualized uniqueness but also to find where they overlap with others. These intersections are fundamental to one's ability to connect and emphasize a need for connection to local communities. The role of the event designer will be to reimagine networking and create an environment where people feel open enough to stretch their minds and fully participate.Architecting Choice: Audiences desire choice and want to be involved in selecting the various pathways available to them. They also want adequate support and resources to make clear and informed choices. These tools, when leveraged effectively, can help audiences reduce complexity and make confident, informed decisions. To develop the user experience, event strategists need to understand the problem they're solving for from the perspective of the audience. Asking the audience why they are coming to an event may be a step in the right direction.Designing for Belonging: A sense of belonging for attendees should be a central mission for the experiences that event strategists create. When all audiences are able to participate as they are and feel included for who they are, they can have more positive and impactful experiences. Event strategists need to design events for inclusion, considering different abilities and varying needs related to mental health. As part of Marriott International's commitment to belonging, Marriott has collaborated with the Google Experience Institute (XI) on The Neu Project to enable more neuro-inclusive meetings and events.Value of Values: Audiences search for experiences that provide value beyond the dollar, prioritizing elements like sustainability, inclusion, hybrid channels, community engagement, time and uniqueness. Distinct offerings and value propositions continue to be crucial in meeting audience needs. For the time-conscious, the virtual-hybrid experience will remain essential to be connected to their communities wherever they are.Emotional Data: Understanding the emotional state of participants is key to driving loyalty and decision making. Event strategists need to discover how to leverage emotional data, measure it consistently and analyze it effectively. Audience segmentation tools use personalization to create dialogue and encourage preference sharing. When used pre-event as a vehicle for experience design, they can demonstrate how the emotional data collected has been used to create better experiences for the audience.Power of Play: The process of playing with something, breaking it apart and putting it back together creates opportunities for ideation and collaboration. Developments in AI are opening new avenues for experimenting and playing with new tech tools that can facilitate connection. Event designers may want to create play-first spaces that celebrate testing and experimentation to help audiences better understand new ideas and synthesize learnings.Story continues""Our ongoing relationship with Marriott International further underscores our commitment to deliver innovative education and resources for business event strategists around the world,"" said Sherrif Karamat, CAE, President and CEO, PCMA and CEMA. ""We're proud of this work, and hope the insights gathered from the report help drive engagement, build community and foster better business relationships.""This year's THE EXCHANGE: Association Masters Customer Conference theme, ""Step Beyond,"" was centered on breaking away from the traditional and embracing the shift toward meaningful event experiences, bringing together 750 association meeting professionals, as well as Marriott executives and sales professionals.The three-day event highlighted Marriott's innovative approaches to social impact and inclusion, food and beverage design and sustainability with educational and informative talks. Marriott speakers included Anthony Capuano, President and Chief Executive Officer, David S. Marriott, Chairman of the Board, Drew Pinto, Chief Revenue &amp; Technology Officer, Tammy Routh, Senior Vice President, Global Sales, and Julius Robinson, Chief Sales &amp; Marketing Officer, U.S. and Canada, among others. Attendees also participated in experiential activations designed to educate and communicate the intention of each of the report's guiding principles. Following these experiential activations, attendees went to a lab where they conducted exercises to synthesize these trends and discuss how they can be applied to future meetings and events.Further activations at Marriott International and PCMA/CEMA events around the world throughout the remainder of this year will be used as case studies, with a final report on ""Guiding Principles in Experience Design"" to be released in early 2024. The study will also be featured at PCMA EduCon, June 25-28, 2023 in Montreal, and CEMA Summit, August 6-8, 2023, in Salt Lake City.

224,246bdcf7-fd80-3bfe-9660-f2aeaf75c3a0,SNA,2023-06-06,Are You Looking for a High-Growth Dividend Stock?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-high-growth-dividend-stock-154505635.html,1685979905,STORY,['SNA'],"[Getting big returns from financial portfolios, whether through stocks, bonds, ETFs, other securities, or a combination of all, is an investor's dream. But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.Snap-On in FocusSnap-On (SNA) is headquartered in Kenosha, and is in the Consumer Discretionary sector. The stock has seen a price change of 13.66% since the start of the year. Currently paying a dividend of $1.62 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 2.5%. In comparison, the Tools - Handheld industry's yield is 0.84%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.74%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $6.48 is up 10.2% from last year. Over the last 5 years, Snap-On has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 14.80%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, Snap-On's payout ratio is 37%, which means it paid out 37% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.SNA is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $17.74 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 5.47%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.Story continuesBig, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that SNA is not only an attractive dividend play, but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Chief among its findings is the soaring cost of ransomware – malicious software (malware) that encrypts an organization’s data and then extorts large sums of money to restore access.The median cost per ransomware more than doubled over the past two years to $26,000, with 95% of incidents that experienced a loss costing between $1 and $2.25 million. This rise in cost coincides with a dramatic rise in frequency over the past couple of years when the number of ransomware attacks was greater than the previous five years combined. That prevalence held steady this year: Representing almost a quarter of all breaches (24%), ransomware remains one of the top cyberattack methods.The human element still makes up the overwhelming majority of incidents, and is a factor in 74% of total breaches, even as enterprises continue to safeguard critical infrastructure and increase training on cybersecurity protocols. One of the most common ways to exploit human nature is social engineering, which refers to manipulating an organization's sensitive information through tactics like phishing, in which a hacker convinces the user into clicking on a malicious link or attachment.“Senior leadership represents a growing cybersecurity threat for many organizations,” said Chris Novak, Managing Director of Cybersecurity Consulting at Verizon Business. “Not only do they possess an organization’s most sensitive information, they are often among the least protected, as many organizations make security protocol exceptions for them. With the growth and increasing sophistication of social engineering, organizations must enhance the protection of their senior leadership now to avoid expensive system intrusions.”Story continuesLike ransomware, social engineering is a lucrative tactic for cybercriminals, especially given the rise of those techniques being used to impersonate enterprise employees for financial gain, an attack known as Business Email Compromise (BEC). The median amount stolen in BECs has increased over the last couple of years to $50,000 USD, based on Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) data, which might have contributed to pretexting nearly doubling this past year. With the growth of BEC, enterprises with distributed workforces face a challenge that takes on greater importance: creating and strictly enforcing human-centric security best practices.""Globally, cyber threat actors continue their relentless efforts to acquire sensitive consumer and business data. The revenue generated from that information is staggering, and it's not lost on business leaders, as it is front and center at the board level,"" said Craig Robinson, Research Vice President at IDC. ""Verizon's Data Breach Investigations Report provides deep insights into the topics that are critical to the cybersecurity industry and has become a source of truth for the business community.""In addition to the increase in social engineering, other key findings in the 2023 DBIR include:While espionage garners substantial media attention, owing to the current geopolitical climate, only 3% of threat actors were motivated by espionage. The other 97% were motivated by financial gain.32% of yearly Log4j vulnerability scanning occurred in the first 30 days after its release, demonstrating threat actors’ velocity when escalating from a proof of concept to mass exploitation.External actors leveraged a variety of different techniques to gain entry to an organization, such as using stolen credentials (49%), phishing (12%) and exploiting vulnerabilities (5%).One of the ways that enterprises can help safeguard their critical infrastructure is through the adoption and adherence of industry leading protocols and practices. Verizon recently became the first nationwide telecom provider to become a participant of Mutually Agreed Norms for Routing Security (MANRS): a global initiative that provides crucial fixes to reduce the most common routing threats that can be exploited by attackers. Participation in MANRS demonstrates Verizon’s commitment to implementing industry best fixes to common routing threats and best practices geared at helping to prevent cyber incidents for customers on the network.Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE, Nasdaq: VZ) was formed on June 30, 2000 and is one of the world’s leading providers of technology and communications services. Headquartered in New York City and with a presence around the world, Verizon generated revenues of $136.8 billion in 2022.

In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector gained 12.17%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 4.14%.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Verizon Communications as it approaches its next earnings report date. In that report, analysts expect Verizon Communications to post earnings of $1.17 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 10.69%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $33.53 billion, down 0.75% from the prior-year quarter.VZ's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $4.68 per share and revenue of $135.08 billion.

Furthermore, the market is predicted to reach $125.27 billion in 2027, growing at a CAGR of 29.4%. Industries such as automotive, industrial, consumer electronics, healthcare, energy, and utilities are involved as end-users in this market. According to Jeff Fieldhack, the research director at Counterpoint Research, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is predicted to be among the select few original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) that will experience growth this year, along with Honor and possibly OnePlus. Fieldhack emphasized that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is at the forefront of the 5G competition. He further explained that companies are currently prioritizing profit margins over market share due to the economic downturn. Fieldhack also noted that Chinese OEMs are adopting a more cautious approach due to reduced growth projections in the smartphone industry. They are striving for sustainable margins rather than focusing solely on sales volume.Don't Miss: Billionaires Are Crazy About These 10 StocksAs per a Reuters report, the UK has set a target to provide 5G mobile coverage in populated areas by 2030 and stated that there is no specific requirement for the number of network operators needed to ensure a competitive market. All four major mobile networks in the UK, namely BT's EE, O2, Vodafone, and Three, are currently deploying 5G technology. The UK government expressed its desire for the next iteration of 5G, known as standalone 5G or 5G Plus, to be widely accessible by the end of the decade. This widespread availability aims to unlock the potential of new technologies such as autonomous vehicles, robots, and drones. Similarly, market research firm Counterpoint reported at the end of December 2022 that the shipment of 5G smartphones in India is expected to surpass that of 4G smartphones by the end of 2023. This surge in 5G smartphone shipments is attributed to the widespread adoption of high-speed 5G networks and the increasing sales of handsets in the lower price segments.Story continuesBillionaires, always keen on seizing profitable opportunities, are actively investing in companies like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Marvell Technology, Inc.

For more stocks, head on over to 5 High Quality S&amp;P 500 Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On.As the first half of 2023 comes to an end, the primary concern on anyone's mind is whether there will be a recession this year. Courtesy of modern day data collection and analysis capabilities, policymakers are able to have some insight into how the economy is performing to tailor their decisions accordingly. And this data is crucial in enabling the Federal Reserve to decide whether it will further increase interest rates or consider pausing and gradually bringing them down.On this front, June started with a crucial data reading from the Labor Department. This revealed that the labor market remained strong and added 339,000 jobs in May. This indicates that despite the record interest rate hikes by the Fed, the economy remains resilient - lending credence to speculation that perhaps more interest rate increases might be on the cards. However, for the interest rate bears, the unemployment rate also increased by 0.3% to sit at 3.7% - the largest jump since the start of the coronavirus pandemic's economic disruption in April 2020.So what does this mean for the stock market? In more normal times, a potential economic slowdown would lead to the stock market dropping as well - but the contrarian nature of the two primary metrics within this report made studying the immediate impact on the market even more interesting. Overall, markets reacted positively, as the NASDAQ index rose by 1%, the S&amp;P 500 by 1.45%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) by 2.12%. This indicated that investors had taken the rise in unemployment and a reduction in wage growth as the primary takeaway from the labor report, using these to form opinions that believe that the Fed will not deliver an interest rate hike late this month.Story continuesHowever, the jobs report is only one part of the Fed's decision making process. An equally important metric is the inflation report that will come out on the same day the Fed officials will meet to set the policy rate. And while there are few estimates available as to what might happen later this month, there are other metrics that point at the consumer and broader economic sentiment. One such metric is the Consumer Confidence Index which aims to look at household expectations of their financial situations for the near future. This index dropped to 102.3 in May from 103.7 in April as the broader gloom about the debt ceiling standoff between Congress and the President weighed on consumers' minds. At the same time, long term inflation expectations also dropped and stood at 6.1% for the next twelve months as they marked a new low since January 2021.Speaking of which, it's not only the households that believe inflation will come down. The two-year breakeven inflation (BEI) rate for inflation protection bonds dropped below 2% in May for the first time in years, indicating that bond investors believe that inflation will fall below this rate in the coming years as well. This is in strong contrast to a reading of 3% for the start of 2023. Finally, Fed Funds Futures pricing data gathered through the CME FedWatch Tool shows that there is a 75% probability that interest rates will remain unchanged this month. However, this might make for some early optimism since the picture changes when we consider the outlook for July. For July, there is a 53.5% probability that the Fed will deliver a 25 basis point hike.So how is this choppy environment making an impact on investment managers? Well, on this front, the management of Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) shared some insights at the bank's earnings call for the first quarter of 2023 where they outlined:Overall margin in the Wealth Management business was 26%, impacted by modest increases in credit reserves, slightly lower growth of NII versus forecast and ongoing integration expenses. We continue to focus on the levers within our control with an eye towards expense management. In ISG, underwriting and M&amp;A remain very subdued. As I have said previously, these are revenues delayed, not dead. Already, we are seeing a growing M&amp;A pipeline and some spring-like signs of new issuance emerging. That said, it largely remains a back half 2023 and full year 2024 story.On the positive side, our fixed income and equity trading teams performed very well in managing through some historic rate moves.Total trading revenues were solid. I expect the markets to remain choppy through this earnings season and for the next several months. However, absent any geopolitical surprise or limited progress on bringing down inflation, I think 2023 is likely to end on a constructive note in most areas. Morgan Stanley is very well positioned not just for 2023, but for several years ahead as we see significant growth opportunities across all three of our client platforms.I will now pass it over to Sharon for more details on the first quarter. Sharon Yeshaya Thank you, and good morning. The firm produced revenues of $14.5 billion in the first quarter, our EPS was $1.70, and our ROTCE was 16.9%. The firm’s results demonstrated the durability of our business model, evidenced by the resilient ROTCE, robust asset consolidation and wealth and our stable capital and liquidity levels.In institutional securities, fixed income and equity supported our clients while navigating volatile markets. Wealth Management showcased $110 billion of net new assets and investment management continued to benefit from the investments we have made to diversify our offerings.With these details in mind, let's take a look at the top S&amp;P 500 stocks that have found favor among billionaires, as the index and the individuals represent the best of both worlds, particularly in this uncertain economic environment.

Both companies are also trending names in the landscape of artificial intelligence which has continued to gain steam.Let’s see if now is a good time to buy Broadcom or Dell stock after their favorable quarterly results last Thursday.Broadcom Q2 ReviewBroadcom is starting to be brought up in artificial intelligence conversations as Wall Street believes the chip giant would likely be the next semiconductor company to benefit from the increasing demand for generative AI and infrastructure-related capacity.This comes after Nvidia (NVDA) was able to post strong quarterly results in late May driven by high demand for its AI chips. Like Nvidia, Broadcom was able to beat its top and bottom expectations with its fiscal second-quarter earnings coming in 2% above EPS expectations at $10.32 per share.Quarterly earnings were also up 14% from the prior-year quarter. On the top line, sales slightly topped estimates at $8.73 billion, up 8% from a year ago.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBroadcom stated that AI revenue accounted for 15% of its semiconductor business. The company expects this growth to continue with Broadcom providing Ethernet switches and fabric to foster AI networks.Based on Zacks estimates, Broadcom’s earnings are now forecasted to be up 9% in FY23 and rise another 5% in FY24 at $43.48 per share. Total sales are expected to rise 6% this year and edge up another 4% in FY24 to $36.84 billion.Dell Q1 Review Dell is another tech company receiving considerable attention as the information technology solutions provider is partnered with Nvidia on their generative AI venture Project Helix.The collaborators are assisting businesses with their use of generative AI to provide better customer service, market intelligence, and enterprise research among other capabilities.Dell blasted its fiscal first-quarter EPS estimates by 50% with earnings at $1.31 per share compared to expectations of $0.87 a share. However, this was still down -29% from the prior-year quarter as Dell stated its operating environment remains challenging with customers still cautious in their IT spending. Still, sales came in 4% higher than expected at $20.92 billion but declined -20% year over year.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAlready following a tougher to-compete-against year, Dell’s annual earnings are now expected to drop -30% in its current fiscal 2024 at $5.28 per share compared to EPS of $7.61 in FY23. With that being said, earnings are projected to rebound and rise 16% in FY25 at $6.15 per share. Total sales are now forecasted to decline -15% in FY24 and then stabilize and rise 5% in FY25 to $90.81 billion.Furthermore, optimism towards Dell’s AI possibilities has remained high with the company creating a portfolio of Validated Designs for AI to simplify the IT infrastructure and provide faster and deeper insights.Bottom LineAt the moment Dell and Broadcom stock both land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). With Broadcom stock already rising 43% this year and Dell stock up 13% there could be better buying opportunities ahead but holding shares of both AI players could still be rewarding.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

240,96fa684a-4d27-3039-a079-0ed94c3c3487,NVDA,2023-06-06,A Unique Way To Play The Coming $700 Billion Electric Vehicle Boom,Oilprice.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unique-way-play-coming-700-230100971.html,1686006060,STORY,"['AMD', 'VMAR', 'AAPL', 'SHOP', 'CSCO', 'MSFT', 'AMZN', 'IBM', 'GOOGL', 'NVDA', 'AMAT', 'META']","[The global electric vehicle market is a crowded space valued at nearly $194 billion in 2022 and set to reach an astounding $694 billion by 2030.Now it’s time to find more unique opportunities as many of these smaller car manufacturers find the market being overtaken by the traditional auto giants like Ford, Chevy and GM.Opportunity abounds, but phenomenal cash burn and a slower path to profitability have rendered this crowded space rather risky.But the EV market isn’t just about the roadways …The waterways are going electric, too, and the playing field is much less chaotic, with the clear first-mover advantage going to Vision Marine Technologies (NASDAQ:VMAR), with its proprietary PowerTrain outboard motor and the launch of the fastest electric speedboat in its class on the market.The electric boat market is set to grow at a CAGR of nearly 13%. By 2030, this market will be worth almost $15 billion, and it's much easier to navigate.As we speak, the multi-billion-dollar boat battery market is undergoing its biggest transition since the invention of the boat motor itself.And VMAR has successfully developed the world’s most powerful marine electric motor, with proprietary technology. First revenues from the PowerTrain are coming this year, along with a second revenue chain in the form of a disruption to the boat rental market.Sailing legend Ian Bruce is behind VMAR, and unique among EV offerings, the company has zero debt and is positioned to be free-cash-flow positive in 2024.That’s a good starting point for an electrified market that has few (if any) players who aren’t burning cash at an untenable rate.The Proprietary Tech Powering Clean BoatingThe newly unveiled H2e Bowrider speed boat took the Paris Boat Show by storm in December, and made its official debut in February in Miami, with deliveries to start this summer.The boat, developed in partnership with Four Winns, is special because it showcases VMAR’s E-Motion 180 HP electric outboard motor.Story continuesThat motor, with proprietary PowerTrain technology, makes the H2e Bowrider the first all-electric series production bowrider on the market.The E-Motion is the first fully electric, production-ready, high-performance 180 HP, which makes it the key market disruptor. With its proprietary technology, which includes the batteries, the engine and the software, Vision Marine’s E-Motion is now the only turn-key solution for boat manufacturers in its class. That’s a strong first-mover position to be in at the critical junction of a high-dollar energy transition.Vision Marine’s (NASDAQ:VMAR) E-Motion fully charges overnight with no additional infrastructure, has the highest horsepower engine in its class on the market, offers the first-ever custom design marine battery packs, and it all comes in at a lower cost than any competitors:Now, it’s all about capturing market share, and that’s where it gets interesting.How close are they? Well, the plan is to market the E-Motion Powertrain to Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) rather than the public, and they have already received hundreds of advance orders.And investors will get to see the first revenues from PowerTrain this year already.Flipping the Switch on the Boat Rental MarketVMAR has a broader vision beyond the most powerful outboard electric motor in its class, too: They also plan to flip the boat rental market and turn it electric.That $5-billion+ boat rental market (think: thousands of resorts and marinas worldwide) is ripe for flipping, and VMAR’s flagship Newport business managed to serve 300,000 clients in the first three years, annualizing $4 million in revenues with a 35% profit margin.For 2023, Vision Marine will be rolling out two more fully-owned electric boat rental locations and launching their franchise model. By 2024, it’s full speed ahead with scaling.The company’s proprietary technology gives it the opportunity to become one of the NASDAQ’s most exciting EV plays.By the end of 2024, Vision Marine expects to free-cash-flow positive, and by 2025, it expects to have two profitable and growing divisions, after which the scaling is expected to gain further momentum.Zero Debt at a Time of Serious Electric Cash-BurnThis summer should be interesting on the water.Vision Marine (NASDAQ:VMAR) not only has developed the most powerful electric motor solution on the recreational boating market, but it’s also a member of an elite club in this segment that has proprietary technology, zero debt and clear growth runways.With investors pouring money into anything electric in the wake of a major European push for zero-carbon and the Biden administration’s clean energy-friendly Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), a company that has already staked its claim on the market with a proprietary tech product and is going into its first major expansion push with zero debt has more than just first-mover advantage.Other tech companies investors should also be taking a look at:Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT): Applied Materials is an often overlooked powerhouse in the chip manufacturing and research industry. As a leading chip fabrication equipment maker, the company designs, manufactures, and sells complex machinery utilized by chip fabs - factories dedicated to semiconductor production. The company is currently the largest chip fab equipment provider in the sector and recently announced its plans to invest up to $4 billion over seven years in the creation of the EPIC Center—a facility aimed at testing new semiconductor technology and fostering collaboration across the industry. Notable partners expressing excitement about this initiative include Nvidia, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, AMD, Intel, and prominent universities such as MIT.While many chip stocks have experienced significant price surges, Applied Materials has not skyrocketed to the same extent. As of now, its shares trade at a modest 18 times trailing-12-month earnings per share (EPS). Although chip fab equipment spending has slowed this year due to economic uncertainties, Applied Materials has adapted by focusing on high-growth segments such as chip fabs for electric vehicles and industrial technology. In its most recent quarter, the company reported a 6% increase in revenue and a 7% rise in EPS year over year.Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL): Regardless of its recent slowdown in revenue growth, Alphabet has seen its shares rise by 40% in 2023, indicating positive market sentiment. The latest data shows that Google Search commands an impressive 92.8% share of the market while Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is gaining traction, outpacing competitors like Amazon Web Services in revenue growth. With a diverse client base and the potential for increased profitability, GCP is poised for further success in the expanding cloud market. Alphabet's culture of innovation, demonstrated by its integration of AI into various products and ventures like Waymo's autonomous driving, ensures the company remains at the forefront of technological advancements.Alphabet's strong financials, including substantial free cash flow and a robust balance sheet, limit downside risks despite global economic uncertainty. With multiple growth drivers, such as digital advertising, cloud infrastructure, and streaming services, Alphabet's diversified revenue streams provide a solid foundation for future growth. Its shares are currently trading at approximately 17 times its projected earnings in 2024, a price that looks attractive with its projected annual increase of over 16% in per-share profits over the next five years.Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL): With a market capitalization of $2.8 trillion, Apple is Berkshire Hathaway's largest equity holding. Its services segment, which includes offerings like Apple Music, Apple Pay, and Apple TV+, has been experiencing remarkable growth, with revenue totaling $20.9 billion in the most recent fiscal quarter. This burgeoning services segment not only benefits Apple's financials with its impressive gross margin of 71%, but it also contributes to the company's customer loyalty. The seamless integration of Apple's hardware and software ecosystem, coupled with its vast user base of over 2 billion active Apple devices, fosters a sense of stickiness among consumers, making it challenging for them to switch to competing platforms.Another compelling aspect of Apple is its proven pricing power, a hallmark of successful companies. Apple has consistently raised prices for its flagship product, the iPhone, without any significant impact on demand. This has helped the company’s remarkable growth in its gross margin, expanding from 38.5% in fiscal 2017 to 43.3% in fiscal 2022. Additionally, Apple generates substantial free cash flow, amounting to a staggering $111 billion in fiscal 2022. This enables the company to return capital to shareholders through share repurchases and a dividend yield of 0.5%. As a long-term holding, there are few companies as compelling as this tech giant.Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN): Amazon's recent first-quarter earnings report revealed impressive revenue figures, surpassing expectations and highlighting a compelling investment opportunity. With a commanding 38% share of online retail shopping in the U.S., Amazon remains the dominant force in e-commerce, bolstered by its unparalleled logistics and distribution capabilities. Additionally, Amazon Web Services (AWS), holding a substantial 32% share of the cloud infrastructure industry, continues to benefit from the growing demand for on-demand cloud environments.AWS's remarkable operating margin of 28% contributes significantly to Amazon's profitability, setting the stage for future expansion. Furthermore, Amazon's digital ads business witnessed strong growth, recording a 23% increase in sales in the first quarter, solidifying its position as a formidable player in the advertising space. With strategic investments in artificial intelligence, exemplified by the launch of Bedrock within AWS in April, Amazon is well-positioned to leverage emerging technologies. Currently trading at an attractive valuation, with shares down 34% from their 2021 peak, Amazon presents an enticing opportunity for investors seeking a dominant market leader with multiple growth drivers and a focus on AI initiatives.Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META): This social media giant has seen its shares soar by nearly 120% in 2023, but the stock is still down 31% from its all-time high. The company exceeded Wall Street's expectations in the first quarter of 2023 and, despite already being a dominant organization, it continues to experience growth, with 3.81 billion monthly active people across its Family of Apps. The opportunity to monetize users outside the U.S. and Canada provides the potential for further revenue growth over time.Reports suggest that Meta may be developing a decentralized alternative to Twitter. Furthermore, the company is heavily focused on leveraging artificial intelligence to enhance content recommendations, boost monetization, and optimize its data infrastructure. These efforts position Meta well for the upcoming technological shifts. Meta's profitability is also worth noting. Over the past five years, the company has maintained an average operating margin of 36.2%, generating substantial free cash flow amounting to $18.4 billion in 2022. This enabled the management team to repurchase $27.9 billion worth of shares last year. With $37 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities on its balance sheet and long-term debt of $10 billion as of March 31, Meta enjoys a solid financial position.IBM (NYSE: IBM): This tech giant has demonstrated resilience in its sales growth despite a challenging environment, yet its stock has declined by around 10% so far this year. The company’s restructuring efforts, including the divestment of its managed infrastructure services segment and the subsequent creation of three simplified segments—Software, Consulting, and Infrastructure—aim to streamline operations and drive future growth. IBM's constant-currency revenue growth rates have shown improvement this year, indicating a narrowing gap between reported and constant-currency growth rates.One major area of optimism lies in IBM's cloud business, which is leveraging its subsidiary Red Hat to expand its cloud ecosystem. With a hybrid cloud approach that capitalizes on Red Hat's open-source software, IBM is able to benefit from the cloud market's growth without directly competing against dominant platforms like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. Coupled with its expanding portfolio of AI services, IBM is well-positioned for long-term growth. Furthermore, the company's improving margins and rising cash flows, driven by cost-cutting measures and strategic layoffs, provide ample resources for investments in the hybrid cloud and AI sectors.Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT): With a market cap of $2.3 trillion, just behind Apple, Microsoft's renowned brands such as Windows, Office, Xbox, and LinkedIn have secured leading market shares across various tech sectors. This dominance has translated into remarkable stock growth, with shares surging over 800% in the past decade. The company's recent foray into artificial intelligence (AI) has only strengthened its investment appeal. Microsoft's early $1 billion investment in OpenAI has proven prescient, as the AI race unfolds, and competitors scramble to enter the burgeoning market. A subsequent $10 billion investment in OpenAI this year has solidified Microsoft's position as a leader. Integrating OpenAI's technologies across its platforms, including Office, Azure, and Bing, Microsoft has established itself as a go-to provider of AI services. Collaborations with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) in AI chip development further exemplify Microsoft's dedication to the field, ensuring optimal performance and effective AI offerings.In addition to AI, Microsoft has made significant strides in the gaming industry. Despite initial challenges competing against industry giants like Sony and Nintendo, Microsoft found success with the introduction of Xbox Game Pass in 2017. The subscription-based service offers access to a vast library of games, attracting millions of subscribers and transforming the Xbox console into a cost-effective option. The platform's popularity has driven Microsoft's acquisition of prominent game studios to enhance its Game Pass offerings.Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ: CSCO): Cisco Systems is a networking giant that develops, manufactures, and sells networking hardware, telecoms equipment, and other IT services and products. With $23.3 billion in cash and equivalents plus short-term investments, Cisco has the resources for potential acquisitions - an area that could heat up in the second half of 2023. The company is also well-positioned for long-term growth driven by the increasing usage of artificial intelligence software and its focus on shifting towards subscription-based software and services.Cisco has shown a decent performance in 2023 so far, with a year-to-date rise of around 10%. Although it has lagged behind the broader Nasdaq-100, which saw a 20% increase over the same period, the growth in the company's core networking business and improved supply chain conditions contributed to the positive performance. Cisco has also revised its full-year guidance, anticipating sales growth between 9% and 10.5%, compared to the previous range of 4% to 6%. The company has observed strong new orders, particularly from the commercial and enterprise sectors, with robust demand in the public sector. With a 3% dividend yield, the risk is limited and Cisco is seen by many investors as a strong long-term hold.Shopify (NYSE: SHOP): Despite experiencing a dip in its stock value in 2022 due to macroeconomic conditions, the company has shown signs of recovery and is poised for brighter days ahead. In the first quarter of 2023, Shopify reported impressive financial figures, with $1.5 billion in revenue and $116 million in monthly recurring revenue (MRR), marking a year-over-year increase of 25% and 10%, respectively. MRR is particularly significant for subscription-based businesses like Shopify as it provides a stable and predictable revenue stream.The company's strategic decision to streamline its focus on its core e-commerce software offerings should put it in good stead going forward. By refocusing on its software expertise, Shopify will look to enhance its gross profit margin and allocate resources more efficiently. As a software company at its core, Shopify recognizes that its primary value lies in providing top-notch e-commerce solutions rather than attempting to compete in the challenging logistics industry. With a solid track record and a renewed focus on e-commerce software, Shopify has the potential to deliver substantial value to investors in the long run.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD): AMD presents a compelling case for investors seeking exposure to the semiconductor industry. While Nvidia dominates the industry, AMD could be a less risky investment option while still providing significant upside potential. The company has the potential to continue capturing market share from Intel in the CPU markets for computers and servers while also challenging Nvidia in the artificial intelligence space.Another promising aspect of AMD's prospects is its partnership with Microsoft, which is actively purchasing the company's AI-focused MI250 chipset and collaborating on future endeavors. AMD is set to launch its MI300 accelerator processing unit later this year, expected to deliver a significant leap in performance for its data center customers. Similar to Nvidia, AMD is in the early stages of benefiting from AI-driven demand, but it still maintains a considerable discount compared to its previous high. The company's potential for continued market share gains, positive demand catalysts, and partnerships in the AI space positions it favorably for future growth.By.

Underwriting profitability is inversely related to the number of catastrophe occurrences.Colorado State University (CSU) predicted a near-average Atlantic hurricane season in 2023 with 15 named storms. These include seven hurricanes and three major hurricanes.For 2022, Aon had estimated a global economic loss of $313 billion from natural disasters, while insured losses were estimated to be more than $130 billion. Per a report published in Insurance Journal, net underwriting loss increased seven-fold to $26.9 billion in 2022. Per Verisk and APCIA, the combined ratio deteriorated 310 basis points year over year to 102.7% in 2022.Amid this, players like The Travelers Companies, Inc. TRV, AXIS Capital Holdings Limited AXS, CNA Financial, Inc. CNA, American Financial Group AFG and First American Financial FAF, with an impressive dividend history, offer a respite.Global commercial insurance prices rose for 22 straight quarters though the magnitude has slowed down, per Marsh Global Insurance Market Index. Improvement in pricing drives premiums and claims payment.Also, the interest rate environment is improving. The Fed has already made two hikes in 2023, taking the tally to nine since March 2022. An improving rate environment is a boon for insurers, especially long-tail insurers. Also, investment income is an important component of insurers’ top line. However, concerns related to whether Fed will pause further hikes, given apprehensions over economic growth, stay.Players are investing heavily in technology to improve scale and efficiencies. While a solid policyholders’ surplus will help the industry absorb losses, a sturdy capital level continues to aid insurers in pursuing strategic mergers and acquisitions, investing in growth initiatives, engaging in share buybacks, and increasing dividends or paying out special dividends.Story continuesDividend Stocks for Your PortfolioIn this volatile market, stocks that give regular dividends offer an attractive investment opportunity. Regular dividend hikes reflect confidence in operational strength, which, in turn, fuel earnings power.With the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have selected five property and casualty insurers with dividend yield and five-year historical dividend growth of more than 2% each.

(Check Travelers Companies’ dividend history here)Travelers’ comprehensive portfolio of coverages across nine lines of business is likely to help it maintain high levels of retention, improve pricing and increase new business while achieving a positive renewal premium change. TRV maintains a conservative balance sheet among its peers. At the end of the first quarter of 2023, statutory capital and surplus were nearly $23.7 billion. It aims to generate increased earnings and capital, in excess of growth needs, and maintain a balanced approach to rightsizing capital and growing book value per share over time as part of its long-term financial strategy.The Travelers Companies, Inc.

(AP) — Oregon's attorney general announced Monday she has begun investigating the board of directors of Fox Corp. for breaching its fiduciary duties by allowing Fox News to broadcast false claims about the 2020 presidential election — claims that cost the broadcaster almost $800 million in a lawsuit.Also joining the investigation is Oregon State Treasurer Tobias Read, who oversees the Oregon Public Employees Retirement Fund, which owns more than 250,000 shares of Fox stock. Both Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum and Read are Democrats.“Treasurer Read and I believe that Fox’s board of directors breached its fiduciary duties by allowing Fox News to broadcast false claims that Dominion and Smartmatic rigged the 2020 presidential election,” Rosenblum said. “We hope to hold the board accountable and protect the long-term value of Oregon’s investment in Fox Corp.”Brian Nick, chief communications officer and executive vice president of Fox Corp., declined to comment on Rosenblum's announcement.In April, Fox News agreed to pay Dominion Voting Systems $787.5 million to avert a trial in the voting machine company’s lawsuit that would have exposed how the network promoted lies about the 2020 presidential election.Dominion had argued that the news outlet owned by Fox Corp. damaged Dominion’s reputation by peddling phony conspiracy theories that claimed its equipment switched votes from former President Donald Trump to Democrat Joe Biden.Lachlan Murdoch, chair and CEO of Fox Corp., said when the settlement was announced that it avoids ""the acrimony of a divisive trial and a multiyear appeal process, a decision clearly in the best interests of the company and its shareholders.”The Oregon Department of Justice said the investigation will explore leading a lawsuit against Fox’s management on behalf of the company’s harmed investors, which include Oregon’s public employees.“Fox directors and senior officers manage the company on behalf of its investors,” the department said in a statement. “They have a duty to manage the company competently, honestly, and in a manner that prevents foreseeable and catastrophic financial harm like that inflicted upon company’s shareholders by the Dominion and Smartmatic suits.”Story continues“We invest for Oregon’s public servants and we aim to hold Fox’s board of directors, including Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, accountable for their decisions,” said Read, who is a member of the Oregon Investment Council, which sets state investment policy. “Investigating Fox’s books and records is a necessary and significant step in fulfilling our obligation to our beneficiaries.”As of May 26, the Oregon pension fund owned 168,075 Class A common stock shares and 92,850 Class B shares of Fox stock, said Roy Kaufmann, Rosenblum’s spokesperson.Another voting machine company, Smartmatic USA, has also sued Fox News over Fox News' bogus election claims.

Introduced with Steve Jobs’ trademark phrase — “one more thing” — the product vaults Apple into the first major new category since it began selling smartwatches in 2015. The Vision Pro also could be one of the riskiest launches in the company’s history.In a wide-ranging presentation, Apple demonstrated the headset’s myriad features and spotlighted content planned for the product, including games and interactive video from Walt Disney Co. The device, which resembles high-tech ski goggles, will have its own operating system, visionOS, and a dedicated App Store. It’s slated to arrive early next year in the US, followed by other regions later.The Vision Pro is the latest of what Apple hopes is a groundbreaking new product that can help the tech titan keep sales growing. It will attempt to redefine a still-nascent industry in the same vein as the Mac, iPod, iPhone and iPad. The difference this time is Apple is launching with a lofty price — and jumping into a market that hasn’t resonated with consumers.More broadly, it aims to change how people interact with the world. Apple has long been seeking a new platform to take it beyond the iPhone and iPad, and this could be that path. The wearable device mixes virtual and augmented reality, meaning it can fully engross a user in content with high-resolution displays — ideal for video watching — or overlay apps on top of the wearer’s field of view, letting messages and notifications pop up without overwhelming the person.Story continues“It’s the first Apple product you look through and not at,” Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said during the presentation.Read More: Apple Headset Looks Sleek in Person But Battery Pack Stands OutSo far, investors are skeptical. The shares had climbed near record levels on Monday but slipped back down after the Vision Pro was announced. By the close in New York, they were down 0.8% at $179.58.Apple’s marketing prowess is unmatched, and it has convinced consumers to spend more and more on their smartphones, but this product may be one of its biggest challenges. Rival headsets cost as little as a few hundred dollars. A $3,499 price would put the headset more in the realm of a high-end laptop than a gadget.The company describes the new interface as “spatial computing.” A feature called EyeSight shows an image of your eyes on the outside of headset when people are nearby. The product also will show those people in your field of vision while you’re wearing the device, an attempt to keep users more engaged with the outside world.A so-called digital crown — a term taken from the Apple Watch — switches the headset between augmented and virtual reality. Apple said it studied thousands of people’s heads to ensure the product would be comfortable and filed more than 5,000 patents. The headset has two main chips. There’s an M2 processor from the Mac that handles main computing tasks and a second chip, the R1, that works with the dedicated sensors that enable the mixed-reality capabilities.Apple’s launch sets up a showdown with Meta Platforms Inc., which currently owns 81% of the VR headset market, according to Counterpoint Research. Apple expects to sell about 900,000 units of the Vision Pro in its first year, and — given its price tag — that could give the company a commanding share of the market. Still, those numbers would be a fraction of what its other devices generate.Disney CEO Bob Iger also joined the presentation, saying that the Disney+ streaming service would be available for the device on the day it launches. Disney shares climbed less than 1% to $91.“We believe Apple Vision Pro is a revolutionary platform that can make our vision a reality,” Iger said.Other content providers — such as Netflix Inc. and app makers like Zoom Video Communications Inc. — also will be able to create their own apps for the device.Out of the box, the headset will run many of the millions of iPhone and iPad apps without additional work from their creators. And Apple announced a software development kit that lets third parties create their own software for the Vision Pro.Apple also cited Unity Software Inc. as a company it’s working with on the headset, sending Unity’s shares up 17% on Monday.From a technology standpoint, the Vision Pro is one of the most advanced consumer gadgets ever. The headset has a dozen cameras, dual 4K microLED displays, and the ability to take 3D photos and videos. It uses an external battery pack with two hours of life, or it can be plugged into a wall for all-day use.The headset’s debut served as the finale for a day of software and hardware announcements at WWDC, with Apple introducing new Macs and software for its major devices. But it was clear that Cook hoped to leave consumers with the Vision Pro on their minds — and that it would set the stage for something more.Apple is already working on a lower-cost version of the headset, Bloomberg has reported, as well as an even more upscale model.“This is just the beginning,” he said.(Updates with details on the rollout in third paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekAmerica’s Long, Tortured Journey to Build EV BatteriesWill Argentina Ditch the Peso for the Dollar?The Netflix Effect Chills Foreign Content CreatorsGiorgia Meloni Seeks to Cement Power by Remaking Corporate ItalyPayrolls, Prices, Productivity and Profits Hold the Answer to the Puzzling US Economy©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Taking on heavy-hitting competitors like Microsoft's Hololens, Meta's Oculus and Magic Leap, Apple has pegged its device as ""a revolutionary spatial computer that seamlessly blends digital content with the physical world, while allowing users to stay present and connected to others.""The sleek device, an expansion of Apple's existing hardware lineup, is controlled by a user's eyes, hands and voice inputs. Most impressively, Apple says that the device will ""interact with digital content in a way that feels like it is physically present in their space,"" meaning its high-resolution device can seamlessly project content into a user's physical space.""Vision Pro is years ahead and unlike anything created before – with a revolutionary new input system and thousands of groundbreaking innovations,"" said Apple CEO Tim Cook in a press release. ""It unlocks incredible experiences for our users and exciting new opportunities for our developers.”Apple Vision Pro headset (Apple)The device carries some impressive specs: it boasts 23 million pixels across two displays, features a custom Apple silicon chip and introduces VisionOS, a spatial operating system that offers a three-dimensional interface, releasing applications from the boundaries of traditional screens and bringing them into real-world spaces. To start, Apple says that users can play over 100 Apple Arcade games, though the Silicon Valley giant says that the device ""makes new types of games possible with titles that can span a spectrum of immersion.""Additionally, the device includes what Apple has dubbed ""EyeSight,"" which allows the user to see other people while also displaying the user’s eyes, taking away the creepiness that often comes with wearing a headset.While some purists may say that the product borrows ideas from existing devices, its release is meaningful for the development of our immersive digital future. Not only is the Apple App Store one of the most lucrative platforms for developers, Apple also has an expansive and passionate customer base, recently announcing that it has surpassed two billion active devices.Story continuesWhile Apple explicitly avoided the use of words like ""virtual reality"" or ""metaverse"" in its marketing materials, it's clear that this technology represents a new paradigm for immersive digital experiences and will likely shape the way we build in Web3.Designing the Blueprint for a digital futurePrevious discussions about the metaverse have been vague, maybe intentionally so, and typically centered on the idea of a single immersive, digital space where users can converge. The term, originally coined in 1992 by science-fiction author Neal Stephenson, has been co-opted by brands and virtual world-building platforms to point to their version of this concept, though data suggests that none of these versions have yet to stick.As my colleague Cam Thompson wrote in April, the execution of the metaverse so far has been ""multiple spaces, centralized or decentralized, where users can access multiple different metaverse experiences, each siloed away from the other without interoperability.""Many blockchain-native companies and funds are still invested in its development and continue to make meaningful progress, though it appears that the path forward for the conceptual metaverse remains paved with potholes, as evidenced by Web3 giant Animoca Brands recently scaling back its metaverse funding target.Apple's entry into virtual tech may signal a meaningful shift for an otherwise stagnant space. It is among the largest tech companies in the world, though historically it has been quiet when it comes to discussions about blockchain technology or the future of Web3. While its App Store supports some blockchain games, it has simultaneously signaled a rejection of Web3 by refusing to exempt NFTs from its 30% “Apple Tax” on in-app purchases.Cook has previously expressed skepticism over the concept of the metaverse – or at least the amorphous way in which the metaverse has thus far been described.""I always think it’s important that people understand what something is,” Cook told Dutch publication Bright in September 2022 when rumors first began to swirl that Apple was eyeing virtual reality. “And I’m really not sure the average person can tell you what the metaverse is.”Cook has previously dismissed immersive digital and virtual technology as something that can be used for short periods but ""is not a way to communicate properly.""""I don't think you want to live your whole life that way,"" he told Bright, though he has been more bullish on the idea of augmented reality (AR), calling it ""a profound technology that will affect everything.""Without using the word, the Vision Pro is Apple's decisive statement on the future of the metaverse. By creating the technological framework, Apple has set the bar for what immersive digital experiences can – and should – look like, opening the door for developers within and outside of the Web3 space to create products that fit within its realm.""Apple's Vision Pro shows that the future of the Internet is 3D,"" said Kenneth Landau, CEO and co-founder of cloud-based metaverse platform Mytaverse. ""Tim Cook cemented this theory when he compared Vision Pro to the next wave of computing, following the Mac and iPhone.""""It builds upon theories built by the metaverse industry over the past few years,"" added Mytaverse co-founder and CTO Jaime Lopez.For example, at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday, the company introduced its take on digital personas, a concept central to Web3. The device uses machine learning and the front sensors on the device to create a natural-looking and dynamic digital avatar that mimics a user's facial and hand movements.The Disney connectionIn addition to rolling out its new device, the company announced a partnership with The Walt Disney Company, allowing users to interact with Disney sports, shows and movies in a newly-immersive way.""This platform will allow us to bring Disney to our fans in ways that were previously impossible,"" said Disney CEO Bob Iger during the WWDC presentation.The integration of Disney media onto Apple's new device is likely a continuation of its metaverse strategy that it first began touting in mid-2022. At the time, Disney announced it had picked blockchain Polygon and brought on executives to lead its foray into immersive virtual experiences. They followed this with a push to ramp up resources for Web3 efforts via a job posting for a specialized in-house counsel for NFTs and decentralized finance (DeFi).But Disney appeared to put a nail into its plans in March, reportedly laying off 7,000 staff members, including those on its metaverse team.Disney's renewed interest in virtual technology may signal a reopening of that chapter, albeit alongside Apple's resources. It further legitimizes the emerging technology and shows the depth of its possible use cases for billions of Disney fans around the world.Mainstream appeal?While the Vision Pro certainly has the potential to transform our future digital landscape, experts say the device in its current state is not meant for mainstream consumption, limiting the scope of its impact, at least initially, to early adopters willing to pay the $3,500 price tag.“They know this is an evolution that’s going to take some time,” Jeff Fieldhack, a research director at Counterpoint Research, told The New York Times.But experts also acknowledge that this is a major technological leap forward that will impact many industries to come. It's not yet clear if the new device will inspire Web3 developers to create new wearables with similar functions or if Apple will eventually allow Web3 platforms and applications into its expansive, multi-dimensional ecosystem, though it has certainly laid the groundwork.Cathy Hackl, chief metaverse officer at Journey, believes the Vision Pro ""will take entertainment and communications to the next level.""Hackl, who previously worked at both Oculus and Magic Leap, told CoinDesk, ""This is the most advanced tech product ever created.""""It’s a supercomputer. This device is a stepping stone toward a future AR device that Apple will continue to work on.""]"

The WGA began its strike in early May in protest of higher wages and other demands amid the streaming boom. That set off a production shutdown across the entire industry.Moody's has said that some media companies could see credit ratings suffer as a result of the strike, with studio executives like Paramount Global (PARA) CEO Bob Bakish warning it could impact the company's bottom line the longer it continues.In a statement provided to Yahoo Finance, the WGA said while it congratulates the DGA on reaching an agreement, ""the AMPTP will not be able to negotiate a deal for writers with anyone but us,"" adding the studios' ""divide and conquer strategy won’t work this time.""Story continues""As always, we will see you out on the picket lines this week,” the union said.Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich wrote in a note to clients on Monday the DGA agreement does not necessitate a WGA deal due to the differences in their demands.""Studios will benefit from a temporary (i.e. a few months) but not prolonged strike as they are prepared for such a pause due to a robust backlog of content while the strike also enables a pare back in content spending,"" she added. ""If more prolonged, we anticipate studios to lean into unscripted shows and internationally produced content.""Photo by: NDZ/STAR MAX/IPx 2023 6/1/23 Members of the Writers Guild of America (WGA) and its supporters picket outside of Warner Bros Discovery, Inc. on June 1, 2023 in New York City.'Doesn't make any sense'Chris Keyser, co-chair of WGA’s Negotiating Committee, told Yahoo Finance's Akiko Fujita streaming giants like Netflix (NFLX) have fundamentally changed the way they both employ and pay writers.“A bunch of tech companies came in during the streaming era and imposed a kind of efficiency and productivity onto the creative process that doesn’t make any sense,” Keyser said. “They pay us by the week and say, give us your great idea and go home. Doesn’t work anymore.”In a statement to Yahoo Finance, the AMPTP said: “Member companies remain united in their desire to reach a deal that is mutually beneficial to writers and the health and longevity of the industry, and to avoid hardship to the thousands of employees who depend upon the industry for their livelihoods.”SAG-AFTRA — the union which represents approximately 160,000 actors, announcers, recording artists, and other media professionals around the world — is set to enter its negotiations with the AMPTP on Wednesday. It is currently conducting a strike authorization vote and will announce the results on Monday.In a statement, SAG-AFTRA said the DGA deal does not influence any of its own negotiating tactics.""Our bargaining strategy has never relied upon nor been dependent on the outcome or status of any other union’s negotiations, nor do we subscribe to the philosophy that the terms of deals made with other unions bind us,"" said Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, executive director at SAG-AFTRA.""We continue to stand in strong solidarity with the members of the WGA and with their strike, and we congratulate the DGA on their bargaining and look forward to reviewing the detailed terms of their agreement as soon as possible.""Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

VSAT, recently announced the launch of Fleet Reach Coastal LTE service for seamless broadband connectivity near the coast or while docked in a port. Powered by Fleet Xpress, a uniquely flexible solution that leverages some of the most advanced satellite constellation, the service is likely to be available on regional plans for vessels operating in one region or multi-regional plans for those sailing around the globe.Fleet Reach combines both satellite and terrestrial connectivity for faster speed, increased signal strength and lower latency. It forms an integral part of Inmarsat ORCHESTRA, the “network of networks,” which uses multiple technologies in multiple orbits for uninterrupted connectivity. Fleet Reach constantly monitors signal quality and selects the right technology (from mobile terrestrial technologies and satellite connectivity) to ensure an always-on connection.In addition, the service is fortified by improved security credentials to maintain the safety and integrity of data and protect users from the hazards of cyber espionage. With the average vessel spending up to 40% of its time in-ports or in coastal areas, the service offers seafarers an opportunity to stay connected with their families or business endeavors.With more than 40 years of experience, Inmarsat operates a diverse portfolio of mobile telecommunications satellite networks, boasting a multi-layered global spectrum spanning L-band, Ka-band and S-band airwaves. It has established itself as a key player in the mobility segment and has achieved an edge in network design with its multi-dimensional mesh network.Viasat recently completed the buyout of Inmarsat to create a leading communications service provider with complementary assets and enhanced scale for offering affordable, secure and reliable connectivity. The combined company intends to integrate the spectrum, satellite and terrestrial assets of both firms to create a framework incorporating multi-band, multi-orbit satellites and terrestrial air-to-ground systems that can deliver higher speeds and greater density of bandwidth at high-demand locations like airport and shipping hubs and low latency at a lower cost.In particular, the merged entity boasts a broad portfolio of spectrum licenses across the Ka-, L- and S-bands and a fleet of 19 satellites in service with an additional 10 spacecraft under construction and slated for launch within the next three years. The global Ka-band footprint will support bandwidth-intensive applications driven by L-band assets that support all-weather resilience and highly reliable, narrowband and IoT connectivity. It will help unlock greater value by incorporating Viasat’s state-of-the-art beamforming, end-user terminal and payload technologies and hybrid multi-orbit space-terrestrial networking capabilities.The stock has gained 24.4% over the past year against the industry fall of 14.2%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchViasat currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

It takes one of cinema's most storied and popular global franchises to new heights while piloting clean energy practices, reducing emissions, and cutting back on waste.Emission reduction efforts went all the way to the screen. If you keep an eye out, you'll see one of the iconic Fast characters driving an all new, not yet released, sleek electric DeLorean Alpha5.Behind the scenes, the filmmakers hired a local sustainable consulting team to help implement a range of sustainable initiatives across production. They built a customized action plan to reduce the production's environmental impact, working with every department to ensure that practices were fully integrated and supported.The film ultimately earned a Gold Seal from the Environmental Media Association, which annually recognizes sustainable production and environmental messaging in the media.To earn this award, the production team worked diligently to reduce energy emissions while filming in the UK and other remote locations across Europe. They piloted two hybrid battery systems, which successfully cut carbon emissions in both trials.The studio teams also used 100% renewable energy at Leavesden Studios. Throughout shooting, approximately 70% of set lighting came from LEDs, which use significantly less energy than conventional counterparts.100% Renewable energy used by studio teams at Leavesden Studios.The high-action movie also reduced use of traditional diesel fuel. Many vehicles and generators were fueled with renewable diesel, or Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO). HVO has approximately 80% less lifecycle carbon emissions than standard diesel making it a low carbon alternative, which helped to reduce the carbon footprint of Fast X.Additional efforts on set included low-carbon food consumption and conscious waste management. Leftover meals were donated to City Harvest, one of London's largest food rescue organizations, which collects and delivers food to hundreds of food pantries, soup kitchens and other community partners. Beyond food, the crew continually worked to limit waste on set, ultimately achieving a waste diversion rate of 76%, up from 66% at the beginning of productionStory continuesThe Fast X efforts were part of the NBCUniversal Sustainable Production Program, which was launched in 2009 to empower production teams to integrate environmental best practices into on-set protocols for NBCUniversal film and TV productions.

Despite its relatively attractive valuation and dividend profile, the bank’s performance tells an entirely different story. It’s akin to “catching a falling knife,” a risky proposition for investors that could potentially lead to massive losses. BOH’s consistent underperformance compared to its sector peers and poor price performance paints a sordid picture for its future.The bank’s first-quarter earnings report further highlights these challenges. Both its top and bottom lines missed their marks by a considerable margin. Moreover, while BOH’s diversified deposit base provided a degree of a buffer, more was needed to counterbalance these setbacks. Moreover, amid the banking crisis, the government’s stance is clear in choosing depositors over shareholders. However, as more banks teeter on the brink of failure, it’s becoming increasingly apparent that not everyone can be saved. Given these steep risks, BOH is a stock to sell.Community Bank Systems, Inc. (CBU)Economic crisis, financial background.

Despite its stellar deposit franchise and fee-generating non-banking businesses, its growth prospects have already been factored into its lofty share price. It currently trades at almost four times forward sales estimates, almost 91% higher than the sector median.Unfortunately for the firm, revenue growth has slowed substantially, with net interest income weakening than expected. Moreover, the bank’s non-spread income, a significant contributor to earnings, has been severely impacted by weaker equity markets. Though its credit quality is more in tune with the market, its loan growth and yield expansion have been modest. Some would look at its relatively attractive dividend yield of more than 3.5%, but if you factor in its lackluster 5-year dividend growth rates at just 5.5%, you’re likely to be disappointed.On the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Muslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

John D. Linehan, portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price, discussed in a report that the ongoing market conditions favor value stocks as central banks are unlikely to cut interest rates this year. Here is an excerpt from the report:“I believe that an extended period of higher interest rates and the maturing of the recent period of disruptive technology may establish a better environment for value stocks. This is not to suggest that value will dominate the next 10 years in the way that growth has dominated the past 10, but it does mean that value investing is likely to play a more important role in investor portfolios as higher rates create broader earnings growth and investors focus more on cash flows.”Story continuesThe positive outlook for value investing has billionaires flocking toward value stocks this year.

I will now turn the call over to GitLab's Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Sid Sijbrandij.Story continuesSytse SijbrandijThank you for joining us today. I want to start off by thanking so many of you for the well wishes I've received regarding my health. I'm doing well, and I remain committed, as ever, to GitLab's success. I'm pleased with how our business performed in the first quarter of FY '24. We exceeded our own guidance for both revenue growth and non-GAAP profitability. We executed well towards our goal of making our customers successful on our AI-powered DevSecOps platform. This quarter, we generated revenue of $126.9 million. This represents growth of 45% year-over-year. Our dollar-based net retention rate was 128%. Our first quarter results continue to demonstrate improving operating leverage in our business. Our non-GAAP operating margin improved by almost 1,700 basis points year-over-year, and we remain committed to growing in a responsible manner. I want to start this call with one of the most exciting technology developments of our time. AI and ML. AI represents a major shift for our industry. It fundamentally changes the way that software is developed, and we believe it will accelerate our ability to help organizations make software faster. I'm excited about this new wave of technology innovation. We continue to focus on incorporating AI throughout our DevSecOps platform. We're innovating at a fast pace. In 1Q, we delivered 5 new AI features. And in the first half of May alone, we delivered 5 additional features. All of these are available to customers now, and we continue to iterate on code suggestions. This feature allows developers to write code more efficiently by receiving code suggestions as they type. Code suggestions is available on GitLab.com for all users while in beta. We expect code suggestions will be generally available later this year. One of the guiding principles with code suggestions is to make it available and accessible to all developers everywhere. We also extended language support so that more developers can realize the benefits of AI on our platform. In 1Q, we increased language support from the initial 6 languages to now 13 languages. Code suggestions is uniquely built with privacy first as a critical foundation. Our customers' proprietary source code never leaves GitLab's cloud infrastructure. This means that their source code stays secure. In addition, model output is not stored and not used as training data. AI is not only changing how software is developed. It's also amplifying the value of having a DevSecOps platform. DevSecOps is a category that we created, and we're seeing it enter a mainstream adoption phase. We are seeing industry analysts recognizing this. I'm pleased to share that GitLab was recently recognized as the only leader in a Forrester Wave for integrated software delivery platforms 2023. We are excited to see the market mature and recognize the value of an integrated software delivery platform, a strategy that GitLab has followed from the start. This quarter, we had many conversations with senior-level customers, but one with the CTO from a top 5 European bank really stands out. At first, we focused on many of our differentiated features that only a DevSecOps platform can provide. For example, we talked about the benefits of Value Stream Dashboards, DORA metrics and compliance on a single platform. When the conversation moved into AI, a CTO said something extremely interesting. He said code generation is only one aspect of the development cycle. If we only optimize code generation, everything else downstream from the development team, including QAs, security and operations, breaks because these other teams involved in software development can't keep up. This point, incorporating AI throughout the software development life cycle is at the core of our AI strategy. Today, our customers have the ability to use Code Suggestions for co-creation, Suggested Reviewers for code review, Explain This Vulnerability for vulnerability remediation, Value Stream Forecasting for predicting future team efficiency and much more. We're proud to have 10 AI features available to customers today, almost 3x more than the competition. Applying AI to a single data store for a full software development life cycle also creates compelling business outcomes. We believe that this is something that can only be done with GitLab. We see a lot of excitement surrounding AI at the executive level. We are hearing from customers that AI is motivating them to assess how they develop, secure and operate software through a new lens. Enterprise-level companies who may not have been in the market until 2024, 2025, 2026 are reevaluating their strategies. On top of that, there's new personas entering the mix. As chief information security officers navigate this new AI-powered world, they are working to empower their teams to benefit from AI and apply appropriate governance, security, compliance and auditability. In all, we believe that AI will increase the total addressable market for several reasons. First, AI will make writing code easier which, we believe, will expand the audience of people, such as junior and citizen developers who build software. Second, as these developers become more productive, we see software becoming less expensive to create. We believe this will fuel demand for even more software. More developers will be needed to meet this additional demand. And third, we expect customers will increasingly turn to GitLab as they build machine learning models and AI into their applications. As we add ModelOps capabilities to our DevSecOps platform, this will provide data science teams as new personas, and we'll allow these teams to work alongside their DevSecOps counterparts. We see ModelOps as a big opportunity for GitLab. Expanding the addressable market will also create an opportunity to capture greater value. Later this year, we plan to introduce an AI add-on focused on supporting development teams. This new add-on will include Code Suggestions functionality. We anticipate this will be priced at $9 per user per month billed annually. This add-on will be available later this year across all our tiers. All of this innovation accentuates a broader theme for our business -- the differentiation between a Dev and DevSecOps platform. We believe that an AI-powered platform focused solely on the developer persona is incomplete. It is missing essential security operations and enterprise functionality. Remember, developers spend only a small fraction of their time developing code. The real promise of AI extends far beyond code creation. And this is where GitLab has a structural advantage. We are the most comprehensive DevSecOps platform in the market. Features like Code Suggestions and Remote Development are important accelerants for developer efficiency. And to date, GitLab has more AI features geared towards developers than our competitors. However, that isn't enough. In order to achieve a 10x faster cycle time on projects, enterprises need an end-to-end platform that works across the entire software development life cycle. Let me describe some of GitLab's key security operations and enterprise differentiators. For security, only GitLab has dynamic application security testing, container scanning, API security, compliance management and security policy management. In operations, only GitLab has featured flags, infrastructure as code, error tracking, service desk and incident management. And for enterprises, only GitLab has portfolio management, OKR management, Value Stream management, DORA metrics and design management. Let me illustrate the value of a DevSecOps platform with one of our customers, Lockheed Martin. Lockheed Martin's customers depend on them to help them overcome their most complex challenges and to stay ahead of emerging threats. Their customers need the most technologically advanced solutions. Lockheed Martin's engineering teams require speed and flexibility to meet the specific mission needs of each customer. They also require shared expertise and infrastructure to ensure affordability. Lockheed Martin has a history of using a wide variety of DevOps tools. They need it to improve automation, standardize security practices and collaboration. They choose to go big with GitLab, greatly reducing their tool chain and cutting complexity while reducing cost and workload. The Lockheed Martin team has reported 80x faster CI pipeline builds, 90% less time spent on system maintenance. They've retired thousands of Jenkin service. Lockheed Martin continues to grow with GitLab and is looking to migrate even more projects to their DevSecOps platform. One of their software strategy executives said, by switching to GitLab and automating deployment, teams have moved from monthly or weekly deliveries to daily or multiple daily deliveries. Lockheed is a great example of the power of a DevSecOps platform. And we see this in other use cases as well, such as compliance. In the quarter, a large health care provider purchased GitLab Ultimate for our platform features. They needed to meet specific compliance requirements from their auditors. They determined that GitLab is the best way to achieve their objectives. Another customer we expanded business with in Q1 is NatWest Group, a relationship bank for the digital world. NatWest Group is focused on delivering sustainable growth and results while fostering a better, simpler banking experience. Last year, NatWest Group chose GitLab Dedicated. They wanted to enable their engineers to use a common cloud engineering platform to deliver a better experience for customers and colleagues. 5 months into the program, we are pleased that NatWest has reported shorter onboarding times and productivity gains. This led to NatWest choosing GitLab professional services to accelerate their transformation by supporting training certifications and developer days. In summary, we're confident in the strong value proposition that GitLab provides to customers. GitLab is the most comprehensive AI-powered DevSecOps enterprise platform. The significant return on investment, quick payback period and well-documented positive business outcomes are resonating globally. We're trusted by more than 50% of the Fortune 100 to secure and protect their most valuable assets. We also believe we're in the early stages of capturing an estimated $40 billion addressable market, a market that we've seen evolve from point solutions to a platform from DIY DevOps to a DevSecOps platform. And AI will speed up different aspects of software creation and development. This, in turn, creates the need for a more robust security, compliance and planning capabilities. In today's era of rapid innovation, the power of a platform like GitLab to enable faster cycle times truly shines. I'll now turn it over to Brian Robbins, GitLab's Chief Financial Officer.Brian G. RobbinsThank you, Sid, and thank you again for everyone joining us today. I'd like to spend a moment discussing the macro environment, the financial impact of our recently implemented premium pricing change and provide some insights into the financial impact of our AI products. Then I will quickly recap our first quarter financial results and key operating metrics and conclude with our guidance. Let me first touch on some of the watch points I discussed on prior calls. We continue to see sales cycles remaining at 4Q levels due to more people involved in deal approvals. Contraction improved over 4Q, but is higher than prior quarters. Like 4Q, contraction is driven almost entirely by lower seat counts with minimal down tiering. I was pleased with the bookings predictability in 1Q. It was much better than 4Q. As we mentioned on the prior call, we raised the price of our premium SKU for the first time in 5 years. Over that time frame, we added over 400 new features, transitioned from a dev platform to a DevSecOps platform. We shared that we expected the premium price increase had minimum impact in FY '24 with greater impact in FY '25 and beyond. The price increase, which took effect on April 3, is going as planned. We only had 1 month of renewals impacted by the price increase in the quarter. To date, customer churn is unchanged for the premium customers who renewed in April, and our average ARR per customer increased in line with our expectations. Now on to the way we are thinking about the financials and the impact of our AI products. We continue to invest in people and infrastructure to support AI. While we have had some teams working on AI features, we recently shifted additional engineers from other teams to support the work on AI. As a result, this has not led to significant incremental expenses on engineering talent. Additionally, we have made investments in our cloud provider spend to support our AI and R&amp;D efforts. In addition, we also continue to leverage partners help drive our AI vision. This has included partnership announcements with Google Cloud and Oracle. The Google partnership allows us to use Google Cloud AI functionality to make our own AI offerings better by leveraging their tool set. The partnership with Oracle makes it easier for our customers to deploy their own AI and machine learning workloads using Oracle's cloud infrastructure. Both of these partnerships help create strategic differentiation for our customers in a financially responsible manner. Now turning to the quarter. Revenue of $126.9 million this quarter represents an increase of 45% organically from the prior year. We ended 1Q with over 7,400 customers with ARR of at least $5,000, compared to over 7,000 customers in the fourth quarter of FY '23 and over 5,100 customers in the prior year. This represents a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 43%. Currently, customers with greater than 5,000 ARR represent approximately 95% of our total ARR. We also measure the performance and growth of our larger customers, who we define as those spending more than $100,000 in ARR with us. At the end of the first quarter of FY '24, we had 760 customers with ARR of at least $100,000 compared to 697 customers in 4Q of FY '23, and 545 customers in the first quarter of FY '23. This represents a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 39%. As many of you know, we do not believe calculated billings to be a good indicator of our business, given that prior period comparisons can be impacted by a number of factors, most notably our history of large prepaid multiyear deals. This quarter, total RPO grew 37% year-over-year to $460 million, and cRPO grew 44% to $324 million for the same time frame. We ended our first quarter with a dollar-based net retention rate of 128%. As a reminder, this is a trailing 12-month metric that compares the expansion activity of customers over the last 12 months with the same cohort of customers during the prior 12 months period. The dollar-based net retention of 128% was driven by lower seat expansion and contraction due to seats. The Ultimate tier continues to be our fastest-growing tier, representing 42% of ARR for the first quarter of FY '24 compared with 39% of ARR in the first quarter of FY '23. Non-GAAP gross margins were 91% for the quarter, which has slightly improved from both the immediate preceding quarter for the first quarter of FY '23. SaaS represents over 25% of total ARR, and we've been able to maintain non-GAAP gross margins despite the higher cost of delivery. This is another example of how we continue to drive efficiencies in the business. We saw improved operating leverage this quarter, largely driven by realizing greater efficiencies as we continue to scale the business. Non-GAAP operating loss of $15 million or negative 12% of revenue compared to a loss of $24.8 million or negative 28% of revenue in 1Q of last year. 1Q FY '24 includes $5.6 million of expenses related to our JV and majority-owned subsidiary compared to $3.7 million in 1Q FY '23. Operating cash use was $11 million in the first quarter of FY '24 compared to $28.2 million used in the same quarter of last year. Now let's turn to guidance. We're assuming the macroeconomic headwinds and trends in the business we have seen over the last few quarters continue. There has been no change to our overall guidance philosophy. For the second quarter of FY '24, we expect total revenue of $129 million to $130 million, representing a growth rate of 28% to 29% year-over-year. We expect a non-GAAP operating loss of $11 million to $10 million. And we expect a non-GAAP net loss per share of negative $0.03 to negative $0.02, assuming 153 million weighted average shares outstanding. For the full year FY '24, we now expect total revenue of $541 million to $543 million, representing a growth rate of approximately 28% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP operating loss of $47 million to $43 million. And we expect non-GAAP net loss per share of negative $0.18 to negative $0.14, assuming 153 million weighted average shares outstanding. On a percentage basis, our new annual FY '24 guidance implies a non-GAAP operating improvement of approximately 1,200 basis points year-over-year at the midpoint of our guidance. Over the longer term, we believe that a continued targeted focus on growth initiatives and scaling the business will yield further improvements in unit economics. The guidance has us on track to achieve cash flow breakeven for FY '25. For modeling purposes, we estimate that our fully diluted share count is 173 million. Separately, I would like to provide an update on JiHu, our China joint venture. Our goal remains to deconsolidate JiHu However, we cannot predict the likelihood or timing of when this may potentially occur. Thus, for modeling purposes for FY '24, we now forecast approximately $29 million of expenses related to JiHu compared with $19 million in FY '23. These JiHu expenses represent approximately negative 5% of our total implied negative 8% non-GAAP operating loss for FY '24. Our #1 priority as a management team is to drive revenue growth, but we'll do that responsibly. There has been no philosophical change in how we run the business to maximize shareholder value over the long term. Before we take questions, I'd like to thank our customers for trusting GitLab to help them achieve their business objectives. I also want to thank our team members, partners and the wider GitLab community for their contributions this quarter. With that, we'll now move to Q&amp;A. (Operator Instructions) We're ready for the first question.Question and Answer SessionDarci TadichOur first question comes from Rob with Piper Sandler.Robbie David OwensAll right. I think I did that correctly after 3 years of using Zoom.Sytse SijbrandijHey, Rob.Robbie David OwensI'm curious to hear an update on customer conversations. Obviously, a stronger-than-expected quarter, but we are seeing this deceleration, I think, across all high-growth tech companies. So both Gen AI in the macro, how should we think about pressure on net retention rates, customer acquisition that's coming from customers taking a more prudent approach in the current budgetary environment versus, I guess, rethinking needs for dev head count and reevaluating which dev tools to purchase just given all the Gen AI innovations lately?Sytse SijbrandijThanks, Rob. And before I answer that question, maybe an update on my health. I just completed my last round of systemic chemotherapy, so happy about that.Robbie David OwensCongratulations.Sytse SijbrandijThanks. And also no sign of detectable disease, and I'm excited about GitLab's future, and I'll continue my role as CEO and Chair. Yes, lots of things to unpack in your question. We see the macro trends continuing, and that's putting pressure on seat count. That was the same last quarter, and we anticipate that trend to continue. At the same time, we're super excited of what the macro is doing to the mindset of customers, because they say, hey, now we -- it's time to consolidate. And at the same time, we see that the analysts are seeing that, hey, this is consolidating as a market. So we believe that DevOps platform is going to be the way that people will consolidate. And we have the most comprehensive DevSecOps platform, which is also great if you look at the application of AI. We're able to apply AI not just for Code Suggestions but apply it across the entire spectrum. We have more than 10 features that we were able to ship. And those 10 features, they drive value at every part along the stage. And as for how that influences the TAM, which you alluded to, we think AI is going to make it easier for more people to enter the fray. So we think it was a supply of more people using the product. At the same time, when you see that software development becomes easier, we believe there's going to be more demand for it. Software development used to be very expensive. AI makes it more affordable. There's going to be more demand. And more demand, again, means more people entering the fray. And last but certainly not least, it's an opportunity for us to manage not just the code that companies have, but also their models. And that's what we do with our MLOps functionality. We already allow you to run experiments with GitLab. We want to extend to a full MLOps managed platform where we add the data engineers to the constituents that use GitLab.Robbie David OwensGreat. And if I can sneak a quick one in for Brian. Just regarding DPOs in the linearity of the quarter, was that either large deals at the end? Or was it very back-end weighted? And if I look at that receivable base and assume collections on it, looks like you could turn the corner from a cash flow perspective relatively soon. So any commentary on turning free cash flow positive?Brian G. RobbinsI'll touch on DSOs, and I'll touch on free cash flow breakeven. And so from a DSO perspective, we were more weighted towards the end of the quarter. But the good news is that we -- our amount of bad debt over the last 3 years has not exceeded 1%, and our age receivables has been very, very consistent. And so some of our European customers have requested net 45, net 60. And so we've accommodated that just because of the macro and the bad debt expense being so low. From a free cash flow breakeven perspective, we committed to be free cash flow breakeven in FY 2025. And we've also stated some of the actions that we've taken previously will accelerate our path to profitability, but haven't given a specific time line on that.Darci TadichUp next, we have Joel with Truist.Joel P. FishbeinThank you. And Sid, I'm sending prayers to you, and congrats on making it through the treatment.Sytse SijbrandijThank you.Joel P. FishbeinBrian, just a quick follow-up for you on Rob's question. Any -- can you -- congrats on the margin improvement. I think that's -- you've done a really good job. Can you give us a little bit more color on some of the things that you're doing to continue to drive towards cash flow breakeven while still investing in some of these new initiatives that you're doing, which obviously you've spent a lot of time talking about some of these AI programs that are coming out. And then just as a follow-up to that, is -- have you like tested this $9 increased -- license increase to your customer base and whether or not that they'll -- there's going to be any pushback there?Brian G. RobbinsYes, Joel, absolutely. Thanks for the question. As Sid and I have always stated since we went public is the #1 objective at GitLab is to grow, but we'll do that responsibly. And we've tried to demonstrate that every quarter. And so nothing has changed in that front. Non-GAAP -- our gross -- non-GAAP gross margin percent went up to 91%, even though we continue to have really high SaaS growth in size is greater than 25% of our overall revenue. And so we're continuing to look at all areas within the business where we can optimize, but we aren't doing that at the expense of growth because that's the #1 objective at the company. I think we demonstrated that across all cost categories, and we'll continue to look at that quarter-over-quarter. On the $9 increase, we haven't tested that yet. We -- from a guidance perspective, most of the cost for that is in headcount and cloud costs, and that's included in the guidance that we gave. And so we don't expect any changes from a guidance perspective.Darci TadichNext, we have Sterling with MoffettNathanson.Peter Sterling AutySid, congratulations as well on the completion of the treatments. Hopefully, you got a chance to actually ring the bell. Brian, just to -- and Sid, just another follow-up question just on the pricing. So you touched upon it, but I want to make sure to put a fine point here. Did it have any impact on win rates or length of deals where maybe customers were asking and negotiating a little bit harder because of the price increase? Or anything in terms of size of initial lands that may have been impacted because of the price increase? And if not, does that actually change when you think some of the benefits of the pricing increase will actually flow through the revenue line?Brian G. RobbinsYes. Thanks, Sterling. I guess for everyone on the call, let me just briefly touch on the price increase. We haven't raised prices in 5 years. And over that time period, we added 400 new features to the platform. And so that was the genesis of the price increase. The guidance we gave last quarter and today include the price increase. As you know, the price was effective in early April. And so we really only had a short period of less than a month for that. But I am happy to say that the renewal rates and the churn and the land of new customers have been better than expected. And so we're happy with the results that we've seen in just that 1 month time period.Darci TadichOur next question comes from Matt with RBC.Matthew George HedbergAnd I'll offer my congrats, Sid. That's the best news of the call, really good to hear you doing well. I noticed Ultimate ticked up. I believe, Brian, you said it was 42%, which, last year, was kind of flattish, really the whole year. I was curious what was driving that? Is that sort of AI showing up some of those migrations? Is it more of the not security? Or perhaps is it -- is there any of the price increase on premium that's maybe driving folks to Ultimate?Brian G. RobbinsYes. Thanks, Matt. When we talk about Ultimate, as we said before, is we don't set the sales compensation to basically compensate on Ultimate versus Premium. We want to try to take as much friction out of the process. For the consumer as well, we do the same on SaaS and self-managed as well. And so Ultimate, the strength in Ultimate is really based on the underlying value that we're driving to our customers. The ROI on Ultimate, Forrester did a study, it was 427% over 3 years, and payback was around 6 months. And so when I looked at the quarter and looked at sort of Premium, Ultimate and sort of the breakout between contraction, churn, first order and expansion, Ultimate had -- churn was consistent with a bunch of prior quarters. Contraction was very consistent. Our growth was just as good as prior quarters, and we had a really strong first order quarter as well. And so Ultimate continues to do well. It's our fastest-growing tier, and we're happy with the results.Matthew George HedbergThat's fantastic. And then maybe just if I could follow up with one with Sid. One of the questions that we get from developer -- from investors the most is -- does Gen AI put pressure on developers secops. I think you talked about a little bit in your prepared remarks, but maybe could you put a finer point on sort of the question of P times Q. And does the number of seats go down in the future? Or do you think it stays consistent or maybe even goes up?Sytse SijbrandijYes. The -- we believe that generative AI will expand the market. So first of all, you make the product easier. Like coding today is hard, and AI makes it easier. So we expect the citizen developers, these junior developers to start coding. That code needs to be managed somewhere. And that is in GitLab. The second thing is you make it -- you -- when a developer can do more, you bring down the price, and that should increase demand for development and software development activities. Third, what you have is today is a DevSecOps platform, but we've already articulated that we want to be a place where you manage not just code but also MLOps. MLOps is the management of data and the management of models. Models are harder to manage than code. They change over time, and they have a lot of risks, security risks, discrimination risks, risks that you're doing the wrong thing, risk that they are outdated. So it's a really interesting space to expand the product to. And for example, today, if you have an experiment in MLFlow, you can link it to the experiment in GitLab. And in the future, we'll plan to come out with a model registry in GitLab. So those are all reasons why we think the market will expand. One other way to look at it is you have generative AI. It produces more code. All that codes also needs to be secured, also need to put in operations. So if you don't have a good DevSecOps platform, you create a bottleneck at the beginning. That bottleneck is solved with the DevSecOps platform.Darci TadichWe will now hear from Koji with Bank of America.Koji IkedaMaybe a question for Sid or Brian here. I wanted to ask you a question about how you plan on attacking the other 50% of the Fortune 500 -- or I'm sorry, the Fortune 100 that you don't have. Is it still a primary land-and-expand strategy? Or is it going to be more of a higher level sale for these customers? I was just kind of hoping you could dig into that a little bit more, please.Sytse SijbrandijYes. I think it's certainly that it is both the bottoms-up sale but also the top-down sales. So we have a direct sales motion, but also a channel sales motion that's getting more important. Channel sales, think of our partners, AWS and GCP, where we work with them to go to customers. And we're talking to CTOs, CSOs, CIOs, and we help them see the picture. What we commonly do as a value stream analysis. We point out all the different tools they use throughout the cycle and how that adds up in cycle time. And with GitLab, they're going to save on tooling costs, they can save on the cost of integrating that tooling. They can make their people more productive, and they can go faster through that cycle and get initiatives out. So it's certainly something we're going to market with. And as you said, our goal is 100% of the Fortune 100.Koji IkedaGot it. And maybe a follow-up here for Brian on kind of going back to free cash flow. This quarter, free cash flow is higher than non-GAAP operating income. And I recall there's some cash flow mechanics around contract duration. That should be mostly be out of the model by this point. So is that right with the cash flow mechanics? And does free cash flow trend higher than non-GAAP operating income from here on an annual basis? Just could you just dig into that just a little bit more for me, please?Brian G. RobbinsYes, absolutely. When we joined -- when I first joined the company, we were not incentivizing the sales force to do multiyear deals because we had such a high gross retention rate. And so we really pushed for 1-year deals in this. That's why you saw billings and RPO is -- go down and wouldn't grow at the same rate as cRPO or short-term calculated billings. But we still continue to have prepaid multiyear deals within our existing book of business. And so as those contracts renew, you'll see some lumpiness in our billings and collections, and Q1 was one of those quarters.Darci TadichNext, we have Michael with KeyBanc.Michael TuritsCan you hear me?Brian G. RobbinsWe can. Go ahead.Michael TuritsSo can you -- you're getting the (inaudible) competition has gone. Microsoft, obviously, they have been very visible around covalent. You announced a lot of (inaudible). But how has the sort of day in and day out competition go. As you said, Brian, sales cycles have not extended. But people sizing you up -- other and differently. How are they entering this discussion (inaudible)Brian G. RobbinsYes. I think I got most of it, Michael. And I think I'll repeat the question was how has the sales cycle changed with -- between us and Microsoft, and what -- if you had noticed any change -- noticeable things within the quarter. So one thing to note this quarter is on last earnings call, I talked about how the first month of the quarter was very different than the second and third month of the quarter. This quarter is really predictable. And so I was happy with the predictability of the quarter. Week 3, we called the quarter and landed really close to that. The sales cycles in first quarter remained at fourth quarter levels. And so there wasn't a lot of change there. As I talked about earlier, Ultimate being greater than 50% of the bookings and continue to do well. I think that shows some of the differentiation between us and Microsoft. The hyperscalers as well had a great quarter as well. They grew over 200% year-over-year from a bookings perspective. And also this quarter, we had lower discounting than the previous quarter. And so the trends with Microsoft remain pretty consistent where we still don't see any competition at about 50% of the deals. We see them in very little deals, but there is more discussion around OpenAI, ChatGPT and Copilot. All right. Darci, we'll go into the next one.Darci TadichDerrick with Cowen is next.James Derrick WoodGreat. And Sid, congrats on the news. I wanted to start -- in the press release, you talked about an expanded partnership with Oracle and a new AI/ML offering, enabling customers to speed up model train and inference. Can you give us a little more detail around those new partner initiatives? And then just from a broader perspective, how you're thinking about the gen AI-related revenue opportunities in the quarters ahead?Sytse SijbrandijYes, thanks for the question. So we're really excited about our partnership with Oracle Cloud. They have a great customer base. And what it means is that our customers now can now run AI and ML workloads on DPU-enabled GitLab runners on the Oracle Cloud infrastructure, and that's a great powerful infrastructure. Additionally, we're available in Oracle's marketplace, expanding our distribution. So our strategy, with AI in mind, is to partner closer with the hyperscalers. And the toughest one is Microsoft. We try to partner there too, but with everyone else, we see a lot of momentum, and that's AWS, GCP and Oracle. We want to get closer. We want to enable our customers to run their normal workloads, their AI workloads there, and where you can expect us to have more announcements going forward.James Derrick WoodOkay. Maybe a quick one for you, Brian. Appreciate getting more exact numbers on net revenue retention rates. Kind of looking forward and with respect to your guidance for the rest of the year, is there any kind of target ranges that you'd guide us towards? Or how we should be thinking about trends around gross retention and expansion factors?Brian G. RobbinsWe didn't give out the specifics of those metrics. What I will say is this quarter -- last quarter was more predictable. And so it makes it easier from a modeling perspective. And everything is factored into guidance. And so we didn't give specific metrics for those.Darci TadichKash with Goldman Sachs.Kasthuri Gopalan RanganOkay. Great. Sid, good to see that you're recovering very well. And congratulations on the quarter. It looks like business stabilized for you guys. I had a question on the generative AI capabilities. At what point are we looking to -- is there any need for further differentiation of GitLab versus the competition? This auto code generation feature that has been made much off, right? Is that a real sticking point in conversations? Do you think the customer base really values and appreciates the broader set of AI capabilities that GitLab has to offer? So it looks like there is a bit of a perception issue in the market that you don't have those kinds of features that the competition appears to have. If you can debunk that mix for us, that will be great. And then one point to you, Brian. What does the month of May look like from a linearity standpoint? The net expansion rates that you saw as improving in the March quarter, it does hold up in the month of May.Sytse SijbrandijThanks, Kash. Like in AI, you have the code generation. If you just produce a whole bunch more code, then it's going to get log jammed later down the pipeline. You also need to do more security fixes. You need to deploy more. So we're really fortunate that we have a single application, a single data store for the entire DevSecOps cycle, and we can apply to AI to all of them. And that's led us to having 3x as many publicly usable AI features as our competition. That is a big advantage. As long as at the beginning that, of course, you also need the code suggestions. But having the whole rest make sure that if you get more effective there, it works, and you get a faster cycle time throughout, and that's a really exciting development.Kasthuri Gopalan RanganAnd Brian, I had one for you.Brian G. RobbinsAnd just on the second part of the question, as you would expect, we track a number of metrics internally from top of the pipeline to bottom conversion rates, piecing, expansion, churn, contraction and so forth. And I'm happy quarter-to-date, things are as expected. And so like I've mentioned last quarter, it was more predictable in fourth quarter and quarter-to-date, and we'll see how the quarter finishes out, but it's as expected on all those metrics that we track internally.Kasthuri Gopalan RanganGreat. Good to see the quarter results.Sytse SijbrandijThanks, Kash.Darci TadichNext is Karl with UBS.Karl Emil KeirsteadMaybe, Brian, I'll point this to you. So as all of us try to run back of the envelope math about what the $9 per seat monetization plan might mean for fiscal '25, can you offer any guardrails as to things we should keep in mind so we're -- maybe we're a little bit tight on what it could mean. And I guess maybe as 2 quick follow-ups. Is there any reason to believe that it wouldn't be applicable to all of your paying users? Or does it feel like it would be relevant only for a subset? And then on top of that, do you think this could actually accelerate the conversion of the free user base to the paid user base such that the opportunity set is beyond our estimate of what you're paying user base looks like?Brian G. RobbinsLots in there to unpack. Just on FY 2025, we haven't given out guidance for next year yet. And so I really can't comment on that. The $9 that Sid talked about in the script is baked into our guidance for this year.Karl Emil KeirsteadOkay. But Brian, does it -- could it accelerate a free-to-paid conversion? I'm not asking you for fiscal '25 guidance, just kind of framework as we try to model out what it could mean. Anything you'd offer up as we take our best shot?Brian G. RobbinsI think that all that we're doing is to make the developer, the security and operations percent is more efficient, to allow the make better, faster, cheaper, more secure. And so I think anything that you do that enables that should help out on all the metrics that you track and model.Karl Emil KeirsteadOkay. Great. Congrats on the quarter.Brian G. RobbinsAppreciate it, Karl.Darci TadichWe will now hear from Jason with William Blair.Jason Noah AderYes, hear me okay?Brian G. RobbinsWe can.Jason Noah AderAll right. Great. I wanted to ask about whether you're exploring a consumption element to your pricing model and how that might work, especially on the cloud side.Sytse SijbrandijYes, thanks for that. We already have consumptives elements in our model. So for example, for compute and for storage, you pay on a consumption basis. We're adding features to that consumption, for example, in GitLab 16 released on June 22, we released MacOS runners, we released Linux runners, we had the Oracle partnership where we have more runners, DPU runners. So that is a small part of our revenue today, but we're releasing additional features. I think over time, you see that the licensing is going to become more flexible. We have cloud licensing today, and that allows us to be more flexible in what you pay for. For example, the add-on we are envisioning for AI, right now, it's efficient to something if you use it, you pay for it, otherwise not. We'll see what we end up releasing, but that's what we're thinking about. So I think you're right that the mindset of customers is going more consumption, and we don't -- we want to be meeting the expectations there.Jason Noah AderGot you. All right. And then one quick follow-up just on that AI SKU. What is going to be included in that SKU beyond Code Suggestions?Sytse SijbrandijRight now, we've only talked about Code Suggestions being part of it.Jason Noah AderPerfect. Good to see you looking good, Sid.Sytse SijbrandijThanks, Jason. Appreciate it..Darci TadichGregg with Mizuho.Brian G. RobbinsDon't see him on. We can go to the next one.Darci TadichPinjalim with JPMorgan.Pinjalim BoraGreat. Sid, good to see you doing well. Sid, maybe one on MLOps. Can you help us understand where are we in the maturity curve for GitLab with respect to MLOps. Is DataOps kind of the gap at this point? I'm trying to understand with the current craze of kind of developing gen AI application, are you seeing new or existing customers kind of talking about using GitLab as part of their MLOps workflow when they're thinking about building this gen AI apps? And then one follow-up. The $9 per user per month add-on, is that basically an extension into visual code? Is there a difference between a SaaS user or a self-managed user?Sytse SijbrandijYes. Thanks for that. So to answer the last question first, that $9 will be the same $9, whether you're a SaaS user or a self-managed user, you'll be able to use the Code Suggestion features in our Web IDE as well as in the usual editors like Visual Studio Code. Regarding ModelOps, we're really, really early. So I don't want to oversell this. It's a vision of where we're going to the future, of where we see the TAM expanding. Today, we have the functionality to link experiments in MLFlow to GitLab, and the next feature that will come out is a model registry. And when you have a model registry, that's going to form the basis of new functionality we can do is then you have the model kind of control in GitLab as well, and you can start adding more functionality. We expect that MLOps functionality to come before the DataOps functionality. The model learning looks a lot more like code in many ways than the data. So it's kind of the logical step is first models and then data. With data, it's -- we don't have functionality yet, and that will come later. I think it's -- the thing to know is that we have the ambition. We have the ambition to go beyond code. We have the ambition to manage your code, your models and your data because we think the application of the future is going to have all 3, and all 3 are going to be governed. All 3 are going to have security and compliance questions that you want your tool, your DevSecOps platform to figure out for you. And that's why we are doing this, not because it's easy, but because it's super, super useful. And because every application is going to have interactions between the 3, if we can bring all those constituents together, that's going to be super valuable for our customers.Darci TadichNext is Mike with Needham.Michael Joseph CikosYou have Mike Cikos on the line here. First one for Sid, and Sid, great to hear on the health. That's tremendous news, and I appreciate you giving us all an update. Wanted to circle up on the AI add-on that we've been talking about. And I know the Code Suggestions is the only one that we're talking to today that's going to be part of that add-on. Can you help us think through, will GitLab be offering up AI features or certain products, however you want to phrase it, independent of that add-on? Or are you going to have to adopt that AI add-on be able to reap the benefits of the AI technology investments that you guys are making today? And then I have one follow-up for Brian.Sytse SijbrandijYes, it's a great question. Like will every AI -- piece of AI functionality be in that add-on? And how does it work? Will there be additional add-ons? Will it be part of Premium or Ultimate? Those are pricing and packaging questions. We're still looking into today so I can't comment on that. It's a valid question though.Michael Joseph CikosOkay, okay. And to Brian then, if I just look at Q1, obviously, the revenue was well ahead of the guidance and your expectations. Can you help us think through what was better than expected during the quarter? And similarly, what is management embedding in its guidance, if I look at the much more, I guess, modest sequential revenue growth that we're now looking for in 2Q?Brian G. RobbinsYes. Thanks for the question, Mike. I was happy with the predictability in the quarter, as I said earlier. When we talked about guidance on the last call, because we had more variability in fourth quarter, the range got higher. And so we looked at the bottom end of the range and selected that. And so if you compare us 1Q to 4Q, sales cycles remained at 4Q levels. I did discuss how the hyperscalers bookings were over 200% year-over-year. We also had the lower discounting, and I touched on the strength of Ultimate in the quarter. And so the guidance approach hasn't changed. When we look at the history of what we've done and we look at the assumptions that we have in the model, we have a very detailed bottoms-up model to come up with guidance. And we use the same guidance approach given the macro conditions, and that's how we planned.Darci TadichLet's try Gregg with Mizuho. He has reconnected.Gregg Steven MoskowitzAll right. The connection is holding. And Sid, very glad to hear the encouraging news regarding your health. I'd like to follow up on ModelOps, and I know it's really early. I do think the native registry is an interesting enhancement. And just curious to get your expectation with regard to attracting data science teams to the platform going forward as that starts to ramp? And then I have a follow-up for Brian.Sytse SijbrandijYes, because it's really early, we want them to work together hand in hand. You see that many changes need both the change in the code and a change in the models, and it's going to lead to different data being outputted. So these changes that today happen in different platform, different tool chains and sometimes very manual, we expect that it's going to be more and more important to happen on the same level. You think about the financial industry, what you execute, what you have to prove to your auditors is going to be based on procedural code plus a model you're running, plus that model you're changing based on data that you need to prove like what data did you use to train the model that, that was then called from your code, that's the questions we need to answer, that our customers need to answer, and we want to help them do that in a way that's friction-free where it's not up to the developers to document it each and every time but the platform just takes care of it and you only have to point out a transaction and you can immediately see how you did that. And that's really hard to achieve today without a platform. And that's what we're going for. As I said, very, very early, but I hope, a compelling ambition.Gregg Steven MoskowitzAll right. Very helpful. And then for Brian, in the Q4, you mentioned that your NRR decreased almost equally, I think, across seats, tier upgrades and price yield. Any change to that mix in the Q1?Brian G. RobbinsIt's been relatively the same. And so seats is about 50%, price increase is about 25%, and the last is 25%. So there really hasn't been any change whatsoever.Darci TadichNext is Nick with Scotiabank.Nicholas William AltmannSid, great to hear you're doing well. Just a follow-up on Matt's question on the Ultimate mix ticking up. It sounds like some of the strength there was driven from a business that was up for renewal in a smaller price point delta between Premium, Ultimate, and it also sounds like there was some strength there just on net new customers landing at Ultimate. But I'm just curious given there's more renewal businesses sort of we progressed through 2Q in the second half, should we expect the Ultimate mix to continue to uptick here?Brian G. RobbinsYes. Thanks for the question, Nick. As we said before, and I think it's worth saying again, we don't compensate the sales team to sell Ultimate versus Premium. And so that is an output and not something that we're solving for. We want to deliver the best solution for the customer and get them a quick time to value and a positive business outcome. And so Ultimate had strength in the quarter. It's really driven by compliance, security and all the additional product features that Ultimate has. When you go through and look at Ultimate and look at expansion, first orders and so forth, Ultimate performed well in a lot of the categories as expected. And so where we saw some pockets of weakness was really in Premium on expansion of our existing clients as well as the contraction. Churn was relatively low, but we still saw some contraction as well. And so like I said, Ultimate had a good quarter. There was some pockets of weakness in premium, I'll call them watch points that we continue to watch. But overall, happy with what we delivered.Darci TadichOur final question comes from Ryan with Barclays.Ryan Patrick MacWilliamsSid, how are enterprises evaluating adopting AI for their code development today? So like what are some of the key items that they would grade you on? And would this happen via something like an RFP process? Or would this be something that they handle internally?Sytse SijbrandijThanks. I believe it's more organic today. They're trying different things. I think what is really important to a lot of customers is the privacy of their code. And what they're looking for is a provider who can guarantee that, for example, the output of the models that they ask questions to isn't used for other models. So that's something that's top of mind for us as we build our features. Other than that, it also has to be kind of accessible to everyone in the company. It has to work on the most popular editors. And we have a lot of revenue from self-managed. So we want to make sure that, over time, functionality also is available to self-manage customers where they can connect to the Internet to offer that functionality.Ryan Patrick MacWilliamsSo are you seeing a lot of questions from customers around securing the output of code from large language models?Sytse SijbrandijI think it's top of mind for customers is that the -- with some of the third-party services today, you don't get a guarantee that the output isn't used to train the Code Suggestions for another organization. And that's certainly top of mind for them.Ryan Patrick MacWilliamsAppreciate that. And one for Brian. Do you see any pull forward of demand or early contract negotiations from customers looking to take advantage of that $24 transition price in the quarter?Brian G. RobbinsI'll answer this, but this is the last one, Ryan. We got to close out and get back on the call backs. The -- we did not allow early renewals. Your contract had to be up renewal 2 weeks prior to expiration. And so there was no pull forward in the quarter related to that.Darci TadichThat concludes our 1Q FY '24 earnings presentation. Thanks again, once more, for joining us. Have a great day.]"

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis software maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.58 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +2.6%.Revenues are expected to be $13.74 billion, up 16% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Oracle?For Oracle, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.63%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Oracle will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Oracle would post earnings of $1.20 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.22, delivering a surprise of +1.67%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Oracle doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Click to skip ahead and see Billionaire Bridgewater Founder Ray Dalio’s Top 5 Holdings in 2023.McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) are three of the top holdings in billionaire money manager Ray Dalio’s consumer-focused 13F portfolio.Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates has been the most successful fund in history in terms of net dollar gains since inception, delivering $52.2 billion in gains through the end of 2021 according to research conducted by LCH Investments. The fund continued to roll last year even in the midst of Dalio stepping down in October, as the Pure Alpha strategy returned 9.5%.Bridgewater has undertaken several initiatives under new chief executive Nir Bar Dea, including slashing 8% of its workforce and capping investments in its flagship fund as it looks to reallocate resources and restructure. Among other things, Bar Dea plans to invest heavily in Bridgewater’s AI and machine learning capabilities.Meanwhile, Dalio continues to expand his family office, which manages the billionaire’s greater than $16 billion in personal wealth, as well as his philanthropic donations. The Dalio Family Office’s newest branch is planned for Abu Dhabi, where it will work alongside the firm’s existing branches in Singapore and the United States.Dalio gave the recently agreed-upon debt-ceiling deal a D grade in a tweet on Twitter, adding that it was about the best that could be expected but simply wasn’t good enough. In a LinkedIn post published in May, Dalio warned that the U.S. faces a disastrous financial collapse if it continues to raise the debt ceiling without any meaningful limit being put in place.Dalio also engaged in a recent conversation of sorts with the AI chat platform ChatGPT as he relayed in a YouTube video posted in the middle of April. ChatGPT wondered what the most important investing-related lesson is that Dalio learned throughout his storied career, to which the Bridgewater founder responded that diversification was the “Holy Grail” of investing. Dalio added that by investing in 10 to 15 good, uncorrelated assets, an investor can reduce their risk by about 80% without impacting their potential returns.Story continuesIn the first quarter, Bridgewater Associates made significant adjustments to its 13F portfolio, selling off 228 of its former holdings while adding just 118 new positions in their place. The firm also trimmed the size of far more holdings than it was adding to. Of particular note was Bridgewater’s exposure to the finance sector, which was lowered by 330 basis points to 23%. In response, Bridgewater’s exposure to healthcare and communications stocks was raised by a combined 371 basis points. Bridgewater’s 13F portfolio dropped to $16.4 billion in assets as of the end of March, down from $18.3 billion at the end of 2022.Amid a turbulent quarter, the first full one in which Nir Bar Dea was at the helm of Dalio’s iconic firm, let’s take a look at the top ten holdings of the fund in 2023.Billionaire Bridgewater Founder Ray Dalio’s Top 10 Holdings in 2023Ray Dalio of Bridgewater AssociatesOur MethodologyThe following data is gathered from Bridgewater Associates’ latest 13F filing with the SEC. We follow hedge funds like Bridgewater Associates because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q1 2023 reporting period.Billionaire Bridgewater Founder Ray Dalio’s Top 10 Holdings in 202310. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $223 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 174 The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are a few of the longtime favorite top holdings of Bridgewater founder and CIO Ray Dalio. A newer addition to a top 10 spot among his holdings is Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), after Dalio grew his stake in the company by nearly 150% during Q3 of 2022. In the first quarter of this year he boosted the size of his V stake by another 19%, ending Q1 with 990,819 shares.Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) has broadly outperformed the S&amp;P 500 over the last decade and could very well do so in the decade to come. The credit card payments processor is still growing revenue at a low-double digit rate and has several tailwinds at its back that could allow it to continue doing for the foreseeable future. Chief among those tailwinds are the continued rise in the global penetration of credit cards and ecommerce’s growing share of global sales. And both of those tailwinds have plenty of room to run yet. As such, Visa shares are currently trading at somewhat of a premium at 29.5x earnings.Polen Global Growth Strategy shared some of the fundamental strengths that Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) enjoys in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“We trimmed Mastercard and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) to equal weights of the Portfolio. Mastercard and Visa operate as a duopoly in a large and growing market. Over the last 50 years, global personal consumer expenditures (PCE) has grown 7-9% annualized. We expect 4-5% long-term PCE growth going forward. Additionally, the shift from cash to credit continues unabated, with a total credit penetration of only approximately 50% globally.3 This shift provides Visa and Mastercard with another ~4-6% of growth. When combined with PCE, this gives both companies high-single-digit to low-double[1]digit revenue growth opportunities. This growth estimate is before accounting for growth amplifiers like the acceleration of e[1]commerce, the shift from offline to online, and additional services. Both companies enjoy extremely strong network effects that provide strong competitive advantages.We have trimmed Visa and Mastercard because their combined weight grew to over 12% of the Global Growth Portfolio because of their recent performance and to fund our increase in Amazon’s position size. We added to both positions when their prices were depressed due to cross-border transactions deteriorating materially from the pandemic. Cross-border volumes came roaring back when travel corridors reopened, and although we are several quarters removed from the cross-border nadir, Visa still grew volumes &gt;30% in 1Q23. Total cross-border volumes are now 132% of 2019 levels. At 4.5% each, both companies remain high conviction positions for Global Growth.”9. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $239 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 204 (GOOG), 155 (GOOGL) Bridgewater CIO Ray Dalio was bullish on Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) during Q1 after shares hit a two-year low at the end of 2022. Dalio more than tripled the size of his stake in Alphabet’s class A (GOOGL) shares during the quarter, holding just under 2.31 million of them at the end of March. GOOGL shares are having a much better 2023 so far, gaining 37%.As Baron Opportunity Fund discusses below, one of the biggest worries investors have about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) right now is how its search engine traffic will hold up against the rise of ChatGPT, which has already had 1.6 billion visitors. When users want general information on certain topics, they may be increasingly likely to seek out quick answers from the AI platform rather than wade through pages of search results (and ads), which frequently contain links to outdated or even irrelevant content. While Google plans to eventually release its own competing AI platform, if anything that will just further cannibalize its own search engine and eat into its ad revenue.Baron Opportunity Fund continues to lower its exposure to Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) given some of those worries, as it revealed in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“As we did last quarter, we continued to decrease our weighting in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) because, as stated earlier, we believe ChatGPT and/or similar AI-based services present a hard-to-measure risk to Google’s virtual search monopoly.”8. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $259 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 69 There’s been a 23% rise in hedge fund ownership of Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) over the past two quarters, with the stock sitting near its all-time high in smart money shareholders. Bridgewater Associates pared back its SBUX holding by 5% during the first quarter to 2.49 million shares.Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) continues to expand its global footprint, with plans to grow its store count to 45,000 within the next two years, which would double its store count since 2015. Starbucks plans to open about one-third of those new stores in China, where it’s understandably been facing headwinds of late, but the long-term opportunity there is tremendous. SBUX shares have dipped by 13% since the company’s latest earnings report in early May, driving their price down to 32.2x earnings, which looks reasonable.The Polen Global Growth Strategy isn’t as bullish on Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) as Bridgewater’s Ray Dalio, as it sold off its stake in the company in Q4 according to its Q4 2022 investor letter:“We also liquidated our remaining position in Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX). While the company remains a unique and resilient franchise, China is a very important growth market for the company, and zero-COVID policies have made it challenging for the company to operate in this important market. While we expect China to return to more “normal” operation at some point, any COVID flare-ups, in China or other markets, present a very real headwind to Starbucks’ profitability. L’Oreal, Estée Lauder, and other holdings continue to have meaningful exposure to China, but in each of these cases, our research indicates they’re able to better adapt to these operating challenges and realize the growth opportunity in China through their online businesses. In short, we think there are better risk-reward opportunities.”7. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $394 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 92 There was a massive spike in hedge fund ownership of Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) during Q1, as 37% more funds were long WMT at the end of Q1 than at the start of it. Louis Bacon’s Moore Global Investments and George Soros’ Soros Fund Management were among the funds adding Walmart to their 13F portfolios. On the other hand, Bridgewater’s Ray Dalio offloaded 22% of his Walmart shares during the quarter, ending March with 2.67 million of them.Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) grew e-commerce sales by 26% during the first quarter of its fiscal year 2024, while overall sales rose by 7.7% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Operating cash flow also rebounded to $4.6 billion in the quarter from a loss of $3.8 billion a year earlier.After buying back about $10 billion worth of its shares in FY 2023, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) scaled back to just $700 million in repurchases in the latest quarter. The company still has $18.6 billion remaining on its share repurchase authorization, which would buy back close to 5% of its outstanding shares.6. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $428 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 63 Closing out the first half of Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio’s top holdings in 2023 is Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), ranking sixth. The billionaire money manager trimmed his stake in the wholesale retailer by 9% during Q1, ending the quarter with 861,306 shares. He owned the largest COST position among the select group of hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey’s database.Hedge funds and analysts love Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) for its staunchly loyal customer base and its strong value proposition. Truist has a $568 price target on the stock and believes the tougher economic conditions will allow Costco to further grow its membership and gain market share. Deutsche Bank has a $574 target on COST shares.Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) has been experiencing some weakness in its discretionary categories, which led to soft March sales and negative comps for the first time in nearly seven years, excluding the pandemic. It’s likely that weakness was felt broadly across retail however and wasn’t Costco specific. Overall March sales grew by 0.5% to $21.7 billion.PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) are three of Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio’s top 2023 holdings.

A resilient labor market and steady wage growth are also prompting consumers to spend lavishly at restaurants and bars.In fact, the restaurant industry has been doing well despite rising costs and is projected to have the best summer of hiring since 2017. Given this situation, stocks like Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. CMG, McDonald's Corporation MCD, Wingstop Inc. WING and Yum China Holdings, Inc. YUMC are expected to benefit in the near term.Restaurant Sales JumpSales at restaurants and bars rose a solid 0.6% in April, as consumers spent more on eating out, according to the latest retail sales report by the Commerce Department. This came as retail sales rebounded in April, growing 0.4% month over month in April, following a decline of 0.7% in March.Higher sales at restaurants are being driven by steady consumer spending. Restaurant sales is the only service category that is part of the retail sale report.The robust sales at restaurants in April also indicate that people have once again started spending more on services as demand for consumer goods continues to slow amid growing price pressures.Higher interest rates have been making people spend cautiously, but that hasn’t stopped them from shelling out more at restaurants and bars.One of the primary reasons behind the steady growth in consumer spending is the resilient labor market. Although the unemployment rate increased slightly to 3.7% in May, the economy added 339,000 jobs in the month, way above economists’ expectations of a rise of 190,000, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Jun 2. Out of the total job additions, 48,000 were in leisure and hospitality.A separate report from Automatic Data Processing, Inc. ADP, showed that private payrolls increased by 278,000 in May, of which 208,000 jobs were added in leisure and hospitality.Story continuesAlso, the National Restaurant Association (NRA), predicts that half a million jobs will be added to bars and restaurants this summer. According to the NRA, if this target is achieved, it will be the best summer for hiring since 2017.The restaurant industry should do well in the coming days as higher traveling will drive sales, as predicted by Deloitte. According to a Deloitte survey, 50% of Americans plan to travel and stay in paid lodging, which is up 46% from 2022.In a separate report, the NRA said that the restaurant industry is projected to grow at a faster pace in 2023. Restaurant sales are expected to reach $997 billion in 2023, up 11% from the 2022 estimates of $898 billion.Our ChoicesGiven this situation, it would be ideal to invest in these four restaurant stocks.Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, operates quick-casual and fresh Mexican food restaurant chains.

Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 2%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 1.8%. For the tech-heavy Nasdaq, this was a sixth consecutive winning week.Throughout the week, trade remained upbeat about a probable breakthrough in the debt-ceiling negotiations between the Democrats and the Republicans, and a deal was finally struck. This was confirmed by a bipartisan vote in the House of Representatives in favor of raising the debt ceiling of $31.4 trillion by another two years. Whenever investor mood reflects lesser chances of an economic slowdown, mega-cap growth stocks do well because their future valuation looks lucrative. Thus, tech stocks made the most of the news.However, with mixed economic numbers from the manufacturing sector and the labor market, opinion is divided on whether a rate pause will be announced at the June Fed meeting. Now that the debt-ceiling crisis has finally been averted, all eyes are set on the central bank’s next policy move.Regardless of market conditions, we, here at Zacks, provide investors with unbiased guidance on how to beat the market. As usual, Zacks Research guided investors over the past three months with its time-tested methodologies. Given the prevailing market uncertainty, you may want to look at our feats to prepare better for your next action.Here are some of our key achievements:Mitie and Usio Surge Following Zacks Rank UpgradeShares of Mitie Group plc MITFY have soared 25.5% (versus the S&amp;P 500’s 7.4% increase) since it was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) on March 22.Another stock, Usio, Inc. USIO, which was also upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 on March 20, has returned 20.5% (versus the S&amp;P 500’s 9.8% increase) since then.Zacks Rank, our short-term rating system, has earnings estimate revisions at its core. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. Story continuesThis stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +24.8% since 1988.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;A hypothetical portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 stocks has returned 9.7% this year (through March 6) versus 5.4% for the S&amp;P 500 Index.Check Mitie Group’s historical EPS and Sales here&gt;&gt;&gt;Check Usio’s historical EPS and Sales here&gt;&gt;&gt;Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Recommendation Upgrade Drives Lisata and Comfort Systems HigherShares of Lisata Therapeutics, Inc.

While individual stocks can be big winners, plenty more fail to generate satisfactory returns. For example, the Robert Half International Inc. (NYSE:RHI) share price is down 23% in the last year. That's disappointing when you consider the market returned 4.2%. On the bright side, the stock is actually up 17% in the last three years. Furthermore, it's down 13% in about a quarter. That's not much fun for holders.While the last year has been tough for Robert Half International shareholders, this past week has shown signs of promise. So let's look at the longer term fundamentals and see if they've been the driver of the negative returns. Check out our latest analysis for Robert Half International To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Unhappily, Robert Half International had to report a 4.7% decline in EPS over the last year. The share price decline of 23% is actually more than the EPS drop. So it seems the market was too confident about the business, a year ago.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.A Different PerspectiveInvestors in Robert Half International had a tough year, with a total loss of 21% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 4.2%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 2% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering.

286,7dbc7e42-bc84-34c9-ab50-edfa6d3b3301,PCAR,2023-06-06,10 Construction Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-construction-stocks-billionaires-loading-170022172.html,1685984422,STORY,"['PCAR', 'TOL', 'MLM', 'TEX', 'CAT']","[In this article, we discuss 10 construction stocks that billionaires are buying. If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Construction Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On.According to Oxford Economics, global construction output is anticipated to experience a growth of 1.9% in 2023. The primary driving force behind this expansion is expected to be the Asia-Pacific region, which is predicted to observe a construction output growth of 6.4%. Meanwhile, the Americas and Europe are set to experience a contraction in construction output growth of 3.9% and 1.1%, respectively. Over the next 15 years, it is estimated that construction work worth $4.7 trillion will be performed, resulting in a total of $13.9 trillion in construction activity in 2037. This prediction assumes an average annual growth rate of 2.78% during the period.The long-term expansion in the construction industry is expected to be driven by the growing economic activities in China, India, and the United States. However, in the short term, the construction industry in developed economies is facing a challenging outlook due to high levels of economic uncertainty. There is a strong probability of an economic recession due to high commodity prices and rising interest rates, which have adversely impacted the growth outlook for this year. The tighter monetary policy has limited the buying power of households, leading to a reduction in demand for new buildings for housing facilities. To combat inflation, the US Federal Reserve has raised benchmark interest rates ten times since March 2022. The increase in benchmark interest rates resulted in monthly mortgage payments observing a year-over-year (YoY) increase of 38% for a median-price new home in the US, assuming a down payment of 20%. The higher cost of a mortgage has resulted in the demand for mortgages plummeting to a 26-year low, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Experts believe that the residential construction market will remain depressed as the Federal Reserve is expected to increase benchmark interest rates further.Story continuesOpportunities for GrowthIt is important to note that the construction industry does not face an entirely gloomy outlook. There is a significant backlog of construction work due to supply chain disruptions over the last year, presenting an opportunity for the industry to work on delayed projects and achieve growth. The conflict between Russia and Ukraine, along with the 2023 earthquakes in Turkey and Syria, is also expected to result in a reconstruction effort of $1 trillion in the next 15 years. In addition, the growing demand for data centres by leading technology companies like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is driving large-scale construction projects. Furthermore, public investment in infrastructure projects is also expected to drive growth in the construction industry. Governments are trying to boost their economies following the COVID-19 lockdowns by taking major infrastructure initiatives. For instance, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) revealed in January 2023 that it intends to invest $2.1 trillion to improve the bridge infrastructure across the US. The rising investment is likely to present opportunities for construction companies, resulting in a positive impact on some of the best construction stocks such as Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR), and Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN).The move towards sustainability has emerged as a key theme in the construction industry, driven by the global goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) introduced by the US Federal Government in August 2022 intends to divert $500 billion in federal spending towards cutting down carbon emissions by executing projects that enhance the transition towards cleaner energy and promote sustainable construction. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the construction industry is responsible for using 36% of global energy and contributes 40% to the global carbon emissions. Major production facilities related to the construction industry still use conventional fuel sources for energy, and the global cement sub-industry is alone responsible for 8% of global carbon emissions. These figures emphasize the construction industry's significant role in carbon emissions and its potential for environmental improvement. The public sector, including government agencies and institutions, plays a vital role in driving sustainability initiatives within the construction industry. An example of this is the National Highways in the UK, which has announced that it intends to cut construction activity-related carbon emissions in half by the end of this decade.10 Construction Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up OnPhoto by scott-blake on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe used Insider Monkey’s database of billionaire-owned stocks to shortlist the construction stocks that attracted the highest number of billionaire investors during Q1 2023.

The analyst appreciated Terex Corporation’s (NYSE:TEX) better-than-expected Q1 2022 results as they reflected strong plan execution by the company in a tough macroeconomic environment. Terex Corporation's (NYSE:TEX) strong business fundamentals make it one of the best construction stocks to purchase.9. Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.

It is one of the largest suppliers of aggregates, asphalt, ready-mixed concrete, and cement in the US. The company is at ninth position on our list of the best construction stocks attracting billionaires.In a report issued to investors on May 10, an analyst at DA Davidson increased the price target on Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE:MLM) from $450 to $465 and reiterated a Buy rating on the stock. The analyst highlighted that the Q1 2023 results were solid and shared that the organization has a constructive view of its end markets. The financial services firm anticipates significant momentum in the infrastructure-based construction markets.Here’s what TimesSquare Capital Management said about Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE:MLM) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE:MLM), a supplier of aggregates to the construction industry, edged forward by 5%. Its third quarter results were in line with Street estimates. Pricing for aggregates and cement were higher than expected while volumes were strong.

Demand is projected to be higher in public infrastructure and commercial activities, though weak within the single-family residential segment.”8. PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR)Number of Billionaire Investors: 11Dollar Value of Billionaire Holdings: $663,793,837Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 33PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR) is a Bellevue, Washington-based company that focuses on the design, manufacture, and distribution of heavy-duty trucks, engines, and related parts for the construction industry.In an investor update issued on May 9, David Raso at Evercore ISI highlighted that the broader weakness in the North American construction industry is more factored into PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR) as opposed to its competitors. The analyst recommended going long on PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR) as the company has strong business fundamentals, making it one of the best construction stocks.Here’s what Madison Investments said about PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Heavy duty truck manufacturer PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR) has quietly been one of our best performers over the past year. It, too, has surprised us to some extent, with the resiliency that it’s showing in a slowing trucking market. We think there’s a decent chance that weakness in its end markets will eventually catch up with PACCAR, but we believe the stock is cheap, and its steady parts business will act as a moderate stabilizer in such a scenario.”As of Q1 2023, 33 hedge funds held a stake in PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR).7. ChampionX Corporation (NASDAQ:CHX)Number of Billionaire Investors: 12Dollar Value of Billionaire Holdings: $64,908,021Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25ChampionX Corporation (NASDAQ:CHX) is a Sugar Land, Texas-based provider of speciality chemicals and services that offers solutions for water management and treatment relevant to oil and gas drilling sites. The company also provides industrial cleaning solutions applicable to certain construction sites.Experts think ChampionX Corporation (NASDAQ:CHX) has been able to transfer the rising costs to the end customer, allowing it to protect its margins. Gates Capital Management was the biggest hedge fund investor in ChampionX Corporation (NASDAQ:CHX) as of Q1 2023, with a stake of $130.6 million.Alger Capital made the following comments on one of the best construction stocks in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“ChampionX Corporation (NASDAQ:CHX) provides equipment and services that assist in the drilling. completion and production phases of well drilling. The company also provides production and reservoir chemicals, along with highly engineered equipment and technologies, such as artificial lift and drill bit inserts, for the oil and gas industry. Notably, ChampionX has a global footprint and favorable product mix, where its chemicals and artificial lift businesses are tied to the production phase of the life of a well. We believe this produces lower earnings variability and potentially stronger operating results. Shares outperformed during the quarter as the company reported strong fiscal third quarter results and gave better-than-expected fourth quarter guidance. Moreover, the company expanded its capital return program by committing to return 60% of its free cash flow (FCF) to shareholders through opportunistic buybacks. Management also raised its share buyback authorization program from $250m to $750m over next 2 to 3 years. We believe the company is well positioned to deliver strong revenue growth, driven by their production focused Performance Chemicals business, which may lead to margin improvement and FCF generation.”6. Toll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL)Number of Billionaire Investors: 12Dollar Value of Billionaire Holdings: $284,726,153Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37Toll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL) is a Fort Washington, Pennsylvania-based company that has the distinction of being one of the biggest home construction companies in the US. The company specializes in building luxury homes and operates in multiple states across the country.On May 31, Joe Ahlersmeyer at Deutsche Bank commenced coverage of Toll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL) stock with a Buy rating and a target price of $94. Ahlersmeyer initiated coverage on nine homebuilder stocks as investors question whether these stocks will experience a period of consolidation following their 40% to 80% rally from their lows in October 2022. The analyst believes that the demand outlook for the industry will continue to improve, making Toll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL) an appealing stock in terms of valuation.Baron Funds shared its stance on Toll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“Toll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL) is the leading luxury homebuilder in the U.S. with a capable management team as well as a large and valuable owned land portfolio. Toll Brothers is more insulated than its peers from elevated mortgage rates because 20% of the buyers of Toll homes pay 100% in cash.At its year-end 2022 price of only $49.92/share, the company is valued at only 0.83 times our estimate of 2023 tangible book value of $60/share. Historically, Toll Brothers’ shares have been valued, on average, at 1.4 times book value and a peak multiple of approximately 2.0 times tangible book value. If the shares recover in the next few years and trade only to the company’s long-term average multiple of 1.4 times book value, Toll Brothers’ share price would increase 82% to $91 per share.”In addition to Toll Brothers, Inc.

While these snazzy tech entities tend to dominate top rankings lists -- wowing critics with their innovations and enhancements -- there's a lot to be said for brands that have proven their resilience and endurance by standing the test of time. Read More: 5 Brand-New Items at Dollar Tree That Cost Way More at TargetFind Out: How To Build Your Savings From ScratchThere are more than a handful of big-name companies that were founded over a century ago and are still going strong today. When they were created, there was no internet, no computer and many deadly viruses like polio and H1N1 influenza (the root of the Spanish Flu pandemic) -- no vaccine. These businesses weathered the Great Depression, World War II and more. It's safe to say they've gone through their own ups and downs over the years.Here's a look at 10 brands that have been around for more than 100 years.phloxii / Shutterstock.com1. Coca-ColaThe Coca-Cola Company was founded back in 1892, several years after the beverage was invented by the pharmacist John S. Pemberton. Back then, the fizzy drink spun as a tonic for numerous health ailments contained cocaine -- which wasn't removed from the formula until 1903. Over the years, the Coca-Cola Company has grown to become a giant in the beverage industry, ushering in other popular soda brands, including Sprite, Fanta, Schweppes and Diet Coke.Find Out: 8 Companies Behind Costco's Kirkland Brand ProductsSee: 9 Things You Should Never Buy at Thrift StoresJonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com2. J.C. PenneyJ.C. Penney has had its ups and downs, and then more downs in recent years as in-store retail struggles to stay relevant, but 100 years ago, the brand had nothing but potential. Founded in 1902 by James Cash Penney, J.C. Penney was originally named The Golden Rule, named after the concept that one should treat others as they wish to be treated. The company had just one locale in Kemmerer, Wyoming, but grew in part because of its savvy expansion overseas and its adoption of mail-order catalogs.Story continuesAlso See: 4 Reasons You Should Cancel Amazon PrimeRayOneMedia / Getty Images3. UPSThe United Parcel Service is young in comparison to the USPS, which was founded back in 1775, but UPS still weighs in at over 100 years old, having been established back in 1908 by a 19-year-old Seattleite named James E. Case and fellow teen Claude Ryan. Launched as American Messenger Company, the brand was renamed United Postal Service in 1925. UPS didn't go public until 1999.Digital Media Pro / Shutterstock.com4. BoeingThe Boeing Company dates back to 1916, founded by timber merchant William E. Boeing as Aero Products Company. The aircraft manufacturer was renamed Boeing Airplane Company in 1917. The brand made major strides in the military, air-mail and, of course, passenger space, and for decades it looked like nothing could take Boeing down.In the past few years, two events changed all that: first, the regulatory ban placed on Boeing's 737 Max, the company's star aircraft, following two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019. Second is the pandemic, which bulldozed the air travel industry and prompted mass layoffs at Boeing. Since the 737 Max's comeback in 2021 however, investor interest in Boeing has been resuscitated. As of the morning of June 5, 2023, Boeing stock was at $209.53.Wallstreethotrod / Wikimedia Commons5. L.L. BeanL.L. Bean, the retail giant famed for its no-nonsense winter wear with a cozy twist and its hefty mail-order catalogs, launched in 1912 under the helm of Leon Leonwood Bean. Originally, the brand focused on hunting shoes but grew over the decades to include other apparel for outdoorsy types. After all this time, L.L. Bean is still privately held. As of 2018, it employed 5,200 people yearly and garnered $1.6 billion in annual sales.Harley-Davidson / Unsplash6. Harley-DavidsonFounded in 1903, Harley-Davidson is the oldest motorcycle brand in America. Harley-Davidson has as strong a brand heritage as they come and has honed an image that is practically synonymous with leather jacket-clad machismo, but the company has been struggling of late as it fails to lure younger generations. The Harley-Davidson stock price on June 5, 2023 was $32.41; its all-time high, back in November 2006, was $75.50.Costco's Best Deals?

Kraft, Kraft Foods started as a cheese delivery service catering to the Chicago area. Soon after, James and his brother Charles Kraft patented a spoil-proof processed cheese that became a big hit with the U.S. Army during World War I. As a brand, Kraft has been moved around within various mega-corporations. In 1988, the tobacco giant Philip Morris scooped up Kraft, integrating it into its other food businesses, Nabisco and General Foods. Philip Morris eventually changed its name to Altria Group and Kraft split into two brands: one serving North America as Kraft, the other with a focus on international snacks as Mondel?""z International. In 2015, Heinz acquired Kraft.jetcityimage / Getty Images8. Kellogg'sIt all started with a bowl of corn flakes back in 1894, and then the formal founding of the company, Kellogg's, in 1900. Previously known as The Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company, Kellogg's took on its new and lasting name in 1922, once it expanded into making other cereals. Kellogg's has continued to innovate over the years and now owns a number of major food brands such as MorningStar and NutriGrain.Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com9. EquifaxThe consumer credit reporting giant Equifax was founded in 1899, under the name Retail Credit Company. The credit bureau grew to become one of the largest in the U.S. by the mid-1900s. Perhaps best known for the 2017 data breach that compromised the personal information of 147 million people, Equifax is one of those companies that, thanks to its crucial role in modern finance, can survive even the worst of scandals. Despite the public shaming and costly legal fees, Equifax's data breach didn't put the company out of business, but it did set the company back by about $1.4 billion.ZikG / Shutterstock.com10. TargetOne of America's favorite destinations, Target might be an expert in the latest trends, but it's a very old business. Founded under the name Goodfellow Dry Goods in 1902, Target has stood out from the big-box competition over the years by staying focused on its appeal to younger shoppers and doubling down on the fashion space with top designer collaborations.More From GOBankingRates10 Aldi Brand Products Worth BuyingSee GOBankingRates' Top 100 Most Influential Money Experts and Get Advice3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000What's the Best Small Business in Your State?

(UPS): Here is What You Need to Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-united-parcel-130007995.html,1685970007,STORY,['UPS'],"[United Parcel Service (UPS) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this package delivery service have returned -3.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Transportation - Air Freight and Cargo industry, which UPS falls in, has lost 3.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, UPS is expected to post earnings of $2.54 per share, indicating a change of -22.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +2% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.78 points to a change of -16.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.4%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.40 indicates a change of +5.7% from what UPS is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for UPS.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of UPS, the consensus sales estimate of $22.93 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -7.4%. The $96.45 billion and $99.22 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -3.9% and +2.9%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUPS reported revenues of $22.93 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -6%. EPS of $2.20 for the same period compares with $3.05 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.94 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.05%. The EPS surprise was +0.46%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.UPS is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about UPS. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Construction Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On.According to Oxford Economics, global construction output is anticipated to experience a growth of 1.9% in 2023. The primary driving force behind this expansion is expected to be the Asia-Pacific region, which is predicted to observe a construction output growth of 6.4%. Meanwhile, the Americas and Europe are set to experience a contraction in construction output growth of 3.9% and 1.1%, respectively. Over the next 15 years, it is estimated that construction work worth $4.7 trillion will be performed, resulting in a total of $13.9 trillion in construction activity in 2037. This prediction assumes an average annual growth rate of 2.78% during the period.The long-term expansion in the construction industry is expected to be driven by the growing economic activities in China, India, and the United States. However, in the short term, the construction industry in developed economies is facing a challenging outlook due to high levels of economic uncertainty. There is a strong probability of an economic recession due to high commodity prices and rising interest rates, which have adversely impacted the growth outlook for this year. The tighter monetary policy has limited the buying power of households, leading to a reduction in demand for new buildings for housing facilities. To combat inflation, the US Federal Reserve has raised benchmark interest rates ten times since March 2022. The increase in benchmark interest rates resulted in monthly mortgage payments observing a year-over-year (YoY) increase of 38% for a median-price new home in the US, assuming a down payment of 20%. The higher cost of a mortgage has resulted in the demand for mortgages plummeting to a 26-year low, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Experts believe that the residential construction market will remain depressed as the Federal Reserve is expected to increase benchmark interest rates further.Story continuesOpportunities for GrowthIt is important to note that the construction industry does not face an entirely gloomy outlook. There is a significant backlog of construction work due to supply chain disruptions over the last year, presenting an opportunity for the industry to work on delayed projects and achieve growth. The conflict between Russia and Ukraine, along with the 2023 earthquakes in Turkey and Syria, is also expected to result in a reconstruction effort of $1 trillion in the next 15 years. In addition, the growing demand for data centres by leading technology companies like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is driving large-scale construction projects. Furthermore, public investment in infrastructure projects is also expected to drive growth in the construction industry. Governments are trying to boost their economies following the COVID-19 lockdowns by taking major infrastructure initiatives. For instance, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) revealed in January 2023 that it intends to invest $2.1 trillion to improve the bridge infrastructure across the US. The rising investment is likely to present opportunities for construction companies, resulting in a positive impact on some of the best construction stocks such as Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR), and Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN).The move towards sustainability has emerged as a key theme in the construction industry, driven by the global goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) introduced by the US Federal Government in August 2022 intends to divert $500 billion in federal spending towards cutting down carbon emissions by executing projects that enhance the transition towards cleaner energy and promote sustainable construction. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the construction industry is responsible for using 36% of global energy and contributes 40% to the global carbon emissions. Major production facilities related to the construction industry still use conventional fuel sources for energy, and the global cement sub-industry is alone responsible for 8% of global carbon emissions. These figures emphasize the construction industry's significant role in carbon emissions and its potential for environmental improvement. The public sector, including government agencies and institutions, plays a vital role in driving sustainability initiatives within the construction industry. An example of this is the National Highways in the UK, which has announced that it intends to cut construction activity-related carbon emissions in half by the end of this decade.10 Construction Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up OnPhoto by scott-blake on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe used Insider Monkey’s database of billionaire-owned stocks to shortlist the construction stocks that attracted the highest number of billionaire investors during Q1 2023.

It, too, has surprised us to some extent, with the resiliency that it’s showing in a slowing trucking market. We think there’s a decent chance that weakness in its end markets will eventually catch up with PACCAR, but we believe the stock is cheap, and its steady parts business will act as a moderate stabilizer in such a scenario.”As of Q1 2023, 33 hedge funds held a stake in PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ:PCAR).7. ChampionX Corporation (NASDAQ:CHX)Number of Billionaire Investors: 12Dollar Value of Billionaire Holdings: $64,908,021Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25ChampionX Corporation (NASDAQ:CHX) is a Sugar Land, Texas-based provider of speciality chemicals and services that offers solutions for water management and treatment relevant to oil and gas drilling sites.

Gates Capital Management was the biggest hedge fund investor in ChampionX Corporation (NASDAQ:CHX) as of Q1 2023, with a stake of $130.6 million.Alger Capital made the following comments on one of the best construction stocks in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“ChampionX Corporation (NASDAQ:CHX) provides equipment and services that assist in the drilling. completion and production phases of well drilling. The company also provides production and reservoir chemicals, along with highly engineered equipment and technologies, such as artificial lift and drill bit inserts, for the oil and gas industry. Notably, ChampionX has a global footprint and favorable product mix, where its chemicals and artificial lift businesses are tied to the production phase of the life of a well. We believe this produces lower earnings variability and potentially stronger operating results. Shares outperformed during the quarter as the company reported strong fiscal third quarter results and gave better-than-expected fourth quarter guidance. Moreover, the company expanded its capital return program by committing to return 60% of its free cash flow (FCF) to shareholders through opportunistic buybacks. Management also raised its share buyback authorization program from $250m to $750m over next 2 to 3 years. We believe the company is well positioned to deliver strong revenue growth, driven by their production focused Performance Chemicals business, which may lead to margin improvement and FCF generation.”6.

Ahlersmeyer initiated coverage on nine homebuilder stocks as investors question whether these stocks will experience a period of consolidation following their 40% to 80% rally from their lows in October 2022.

Here’s what the firm said:“Toll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL) is the leading luxury homebuilder in the U.S. with a capable management team as well as a large and valuable owned land portfolio. Toll Brothers is more insulated than its peers from elevated mortgage rates because 20% of the buyers of Toll homes pay 100% in cash.At its year-end 2022 price of only $49.92/share, the company is valued at only 0.83 times our estimate of 2023 tangible book value of $60/share.

If the shares recover in the next few years and trade only to the company’s long-term average multiple of 1.4 times book value, Toll Brothers’ share price would increase 82% to $91 per share.”In addition to Toll Brothers, Inc.

This means the annual payment is 2.8% of the current stock price, which is above the average for the industry. Check out our latest analysis for NetApp NetApp's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsImpressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained. Before making this announcement, NetApp was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.EPS is set to fall by 14.2% over the next 12 months. If the dividend continues along the path it has been on recently, we estimate the payout ratio could be 46%, which is comfortable for the company to continue in the future.historic-dividendNetApp Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.60 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $2.00. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 13% a year over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. NetApp has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 69% per annum. Earnings have been growing rapidly, and with a low payout ratio we think that the company could turn out to be a great dividend stock.We Really Like NetApp's DividendOverall, we like to see the dividend staying consistent, and we think NetApp might even raise payments in the future. The earnings easily cover the company's distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. However, it is worth noting that the earnings are expected to fall over the next year, which may not change the long term outlook, but could affect the dividend payment in the next 12 months. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Story continuesIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

The Energizing the Future initiative will likely add to its overall operational strength.However, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has to face risks related to ongoing increases in interest rates and any delay in completing a capital project.TailwindsThe utility’s efforts to expand its regulated generation mix increased earnings predictability.

In the first quarter, the Critical Care segment witnessed balanced contributions from all product lines.The company continued to successfully deliver on its strategy and achieve milestones in pursuit of the significant opportunity to transform care for a large number of patients with mitral and tricuspid disease. However, mounting expenses and an unfavorable foreign currency impact are worrisome.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has decreased 11.5% against the 2.6% rise of the industry and a 4.2% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned global medical device company has a market capitalization of $51.73 billion. Edward Lifesciences has an earnings yield of 2.99% compared to the industry’s -6.92%. EW’s earnings surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in one, delivering an average surprise of 1.24%.Let’s delve deeper.UpsidesSurgical Structural Heart Looks Promising: In the first quarter, Edward Lifesciences’ Surgical Structural Heart business improved on a constant-currency basis, driven by the penetration of its premium products across all regions. The valve surgery growth was higher than the company’s expectations as hospital staffing levels improved, leading to some catch-up in procedures.The RESILIA portfolio continues to hold strong momentum globally. In addition, the company began the enrolment of its MOMENTIS clinical trial to demonstrate the durability of RESILIA in the mitral position. The increased adoption of the MITRIS Valve in the United States is encouraging.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCritical Care Business Holds Potential: In the first quarter, Critical Care sales growth was led by the Smart Recovery portfolio and the strong adoption of the Acumen IQ sensor and finger cuff featuring a unique Hypotension Prediction Index algorithm. The demand for Swan-Ganz pulmonary artery catheters and the HemoSphere monitoring platform also remained strong in the first quarter.Story continuesThe company remains excited about its pipeline of Critical Care innovations as it continues to shift its focus to Smart Recovery technologies designed to help clinicians make better decisions and get patients home to their families faster.TMTT (Transcatheter Mitral and Tricuspid Therapies) Stands Strong: In the first quarter, the segment’s performance was driven by overall transcatheter edge-to-edge repair procedure growth. The ongoing launch and the growing adoption of PASCAL Precision in Europe and the initial launch in the United States also contributed to the segment’s sales. Clinician feedback on PASCAL Precision has been consistently positive, particularly highlighting the differentiated premium features of the system.In mitral, Edwards Lifesciences looks forward to presenting one-year data from the full cohort of the CLASP IID pivotal trial later in 2023. In mitral replacement, the enrollment of the ENCIRCLE pivotal trial with SAPIEN M3 is anticipated to complete the enrollment of the main cohort around the end of 2023.Within tricuspid, FDA recently approved continued access allowing domestic hospitals involved in the clinical trial to continue to offer EVOQUE as a therapy option. In addition, the CLASP II TR pivotal trial with PASCAL continues to enroll well.DownsidesForeign Exchange Headwinds: We remain worried about the significant challenges Edward Lifesciences had to face due to an unfavorable foreign currency impact that has been adversely affecting the company’s gross margin over the past few quarters. Per management, significant currency fluctuations could have a material effect on revenues, the cost of sales and operational results.Escalated Expenses: The contraction of both the margins in the first quarter is discouraging. A year-over-year increase in SG&amp;A expenses reflected increased investments over the prior year in transcatheter field-based personnel to support the growth strategy. For the full-year 2023, EW expects R&amp;D expenses to be 17%-18% of sales, with investments in developing new technologies and generating evidence to support TAVR and TMTT.Estimate TrendEdward Lifesciences has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings per share (EPS) has moved up from $2.54 to $2.55 in the past 30 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $5.96 billion.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read 10 S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats To Avoid. Over the years, there has been an observable shift in focus from growth stocks to dividend stocks in certain market environments. High inflationary periods have fared well for dividend stocks historically. Dividend investing also often aligns with a long-term investment strategy as investors may find comfort in the consistent dividend income and the potential for capital appreciation that quality dividend stocks can offer over time. In 2022, dividend aristocrat stocks outperformed the broader market, falling by just 6.21%, compared with a much harsher decline of 18.1% in the S&amp;P 500.Not only the performance of dividend stocks remained strong compared to other asset classes, but companies in the S&amp;P 500 also paid a record amount in dividend payments last year. According to a report by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, the S&amp;P 500 corporations distributed $561 billion in dividends in 2022, up from $511.2 billion in 2021. Though the market suffered some setbacks in the face of Silicon Bank Valley's failure earlier in March, global dividend payouts sustained their position. In the first quarter of 2023, global dividends grew by 12% on a headline basis to a record $327 billion, as reported by Janus Henderson Investors. The increase was mainly driven by special dividends paid by companies during the quarter.Analysts and economists are giving a positive outlook for dividend stocks as these equities held their ground during uncertain market conditions. Goldman Sachs Chief US Equity Strategist David Kostin spoke with Business Insider in April and mentioned that dividend payments are expected to grow this year as well. Here are some remarks from the analyst:""We expect that S&amp;P 500 DPS [dividend-per-share] will reach $70 in 2023 and $73 (+4%) in 2024. Recent company actions also point to a healthy dividend growth environment. The difference in outlooks for dividend and buyback growth suggests firms focusing on dividends will continue to outperform buyback stocks.""Story continuesDividend growth track records play an important role when investing in dividend stocks. These companies often exhibit solid financial health, strong cash flows, and a history of successful operations. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) are some of the most popular dividend aristocrat stocks, however, in this article, we will cover the least popular dividend aristocrats among hedge funds.25 S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats To AvoidDaily newspaper economy stock market chartOur Methodology:For this list, we scoured Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds as of Q1 2023 and picked the 25 least popular dividend aristocrats in terms of hedge fund positions.

Automation was up in the high-single-digit percentage range. Backed by these tailwinds, the company delivered record quarterly revenues in the March-end quarter.Upbeat Growth Projections: Robust backlog and acquisitions are expected to benefit the company’s performance throughout this year. It has also been effectively managing to counter raw material inflation through pricing actions and improved productivity, which is expected to support its margins.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LECO’s 2023 bottom line has increased 4.7% in the past 60 days and the same for 2024 has moved up 5.5%.

300,f995d0b1-fbfb-3765-b962-960dc0409518,PNR,2023-06-06,Packaging Corp (PKG) Declines 20% in a Year: Will It Recover?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/packaging-corp-pkg-declines-20-143100878.html,1685975460,STORY,"['PKG', 'PNR', 'WOR']","[Shares of Packaging Corporation of America PKG have lost 20.4% in a year compared with the industry’s fall of 12.6%, reflecting the ongoing weakness in volume in the Paper segment. Elevated costs are also denting the company’s margins.Weak Packaging Demand &amp; Low Paper Volumes Ail PKGGlobal and domestic economic conditions continue to be challenging, with ongoing inflationary pressures, high interest rates and persisting supply-chain disruptions creating headwinds. Customers are working to lower their high inventory levels, impacting the order flow and demand for Packaging Corporation’s products. Containerboard production is anticipated to be lower in the upcoming quarters, and the company plans to match production with demand.The company anticipates lower prices in the Packaging segment in the second quarter of 2023 as a result of the recent decreases in the published domestic containerboard prices and lower export prices. In the Paper segment, the company will continue implementing the price increase that took effect in September 2022, with a fairly flat sales volume. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Cost Headwinds Hurt ResultsLabor costs and certain indirect costs are expected to be elevated in the upcoming quarters. Inflated prices for many chemicals, particularly starch and caustic soda, remain headwinds. This will be somewhat offset by lower wood and recycled fiber prices, energy prices, and reduced scheduled maintenance outage expenses. High interest and non-operating pension expenses and a higher tax rate are expected to hurt margins.Packaging Corp has a market capitalization of around $11 billion. It currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Let’s discuss the factors that indicate that the stock may stage a comeback despite the near-term headwinds.Solid E-commerce Growth to Buoy Packaging DemandDespite the current weakness, Packaging Corp stands to gain from strong growth in e-commerce activities that will continue to support demand for its packaging solutions.The Packaging segment accounts for around 91% of the company’s revenues. Also, packaging products are essential for distributing food, beverage and pharmaceutical products. The Packaging segment will continue to be supported by stable packaging demand for meat, fruit and vegetables, processed food, beverages, medicine, and other consumer products.Although demand in the Packaging segment fell short of the company's initial expectations in the first quarter of 2023, Packaging Corp was able to offset the negative impacts through outstanding cost-management and process-optimization efforts at its mills and corrugated product plants. Despite the weak demand, PKG continues to perform above pre-COVID levels. In spite of one fewer shipping day in the second quarter of 2023, the company anticipates increased volume for the Packaging segment.Story continuesLow Debt Levels &amp; Acquisitions to Aid GrowthThe company completed debt refinancing in October 2021, which extended its overall debt maturity from 8.5 years to 16.3 years, and lowered its overall interest rate from 3.9% to 3.5%. As of Mar 31, 2023, the company’s total debt to total capital ratio stood at 0.40, much lower than the industry’s 0.63.In December 2021, the company acquired all assets of the United States-based packaging solutions company, Advanced Packaging Corporation, in a cash-free transaction. The company acquired a full-line 500,000-square-foot corrugated products facility in Grand Rapids, MI. The deal supports Packaging Corp’s focus on enhancing its containerboard portfolio through organic box volume growth and strategic box plant acquisitions.Following the buyout, the company’s containerboard integration increased almost 80,000 tons. This will also boost its mill capacity and box plant operations. The deal is expected to be accretive to earnings.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the Industrial Products sector are Worthington Industries, Inc. WOR, The Manitowoc Company, Inc.

AMN is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its broad array of services. The optimism led by a solid first-quarter 2023 performance and its healthcare Managed Services Program (“MSP”) are expected to contribute further. However, healthcare industry regulations and the consolidation of healthcare delivery units are major downsides.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 0.2% against a 23.1% decline of the industry and 4.2% rise of the S&amp;P 500.This renowned player in the healthcare total talent services space has a market capitalization of $3.95 billion. The company projects 3.3% growth for the next five years and expects to witness continued improvements in its business. AMN Healthcare surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, delivering an earnings surprise of 10.5%, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Broad Array of Services: We are upbeat about AMN Healthcare’s business’ gradual evolution beyond traditional healthcare staffing. The company has become a strategic total talent solutions partner for its clients. The company’s suite of healthcare workforce solutions includes MSPs, vendor management systems and medical language interpretation services.On the first-quarter 2023 earnings call in May, management confirmed that the company is continuing to elevate AMN Passport to be a digital staffing solution for all healthcare jobseekers at any stage of their careers across all businesses of AMN Healthcare.Healthcare MSP: AMN Healthcare’s unique MSP is helping the company gain market traction. Notably, the program helps streamline the entire workforce planning process, which facilitates the delivery of improved patient care. This has resulted in a large network of improved patient care and efficiency.In 2022, AMN Healthcare had approximately $5.3 billion in spend under management through its MSPs, and approximately 64% of its consolidated revenues flowed through MSP relationships.Story continuesStrong Q1 Results: Per management, the Technology and Workforce Solutions and Physician and Leadership Solutions segments exceeded expectations in the first quarter of 2023. The continued strength in AMN Healthcare’s Language Services also looks promising. The expansion of the gross margin bodes well. AMN Healthcare’s management confirmed that the company will be rolling out major enhancements to key parts of its technology. This looks promising for the stock.DownsidesHealthcare Industry Regulations: The healthcare industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state laws and regulations. AMN Healthcare provides talent solutions and technologies on a contractual basis to its clients who pay the company directly. Accordingly, Medicare, Medicaid and insurance reimbursement policy changes generally do not directly impact the company. Nevertheless, reimbursement changes in government programs, particularly Medicare and Medicaid, can and do indirectly affect the demand and the prices paid for the company’s services.Consolidation of Healthcare Delivery Units: Healthcare delivery organizations are consolidating, giving them greater leverage in negotiating service pricing. Consolidations may also result in AMN Healthcare losing its ability to work with certain clients because the party acquiring or consolidating with its client may have a previously established service provider they opt to maintain.Estimate TrendAMN Healthcare has been witnessing a negative estimate revision trend for 2023. Over the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings per share has moved 0.6% south to $8.26.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $987.9 million, suggesting a 30.8% decline from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

But the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, the Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX) share price is 51% higher than it was five years ago, which is more than the market average. It's also good to see a healthy gain of 32% in the last year.So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. View our latest analysis for Boston Scientific While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, Boston Scientific achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 48% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 9% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days. Of course, with a P/E ratio of 88.06, the market remains optimistic.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Boston Scientific has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.A Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Boston Scientific has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 32% in the last twelve months. That's better than the annualised return of 9% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified   3 warning signs for Boston Scientific (1 is a bit unpleasant)  that you should be aware of.Story continuesIf you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of companies that have proven they can grow earnings.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

The latter two measures also aim to give farmers additional revenue streams.""We have observed encouraging trends, including improved incomes in some countries, and increased adoption of important regenerative practices,"" said environmental group Rainforest Alliance, which helps Nestle conduct impact assessments.A major coffee report published in 2021 said there was little evidence that efforts by the world's top coffee firms to protect human rights and the environment were having any impact, with most farmers unable to fund sustainable coffee farming.Partly as a result of failed voluntary efforts by companies to source sustainably, the European Union has agreed a landmark law aimed at preventing companies importing commodities and related products linked to deforestation anywhere in the world.The coffee sector is valued at $200-250 billion a year at the retail level, based on the report, but producing countries receive less than 10% of that value when exporting beans, and farmers even less than that.Story continuesAround 125 million people around the world depend on coffee for their livelihoods, while an estimated 80% of coffee-farming families live at or below the poverty line, according to non-profit organisations Fairtrade and Technoserve.(This story has been refiled to remove extraneous words in paragraph 2)(Reporting by Maytaal Angel; Editing by Bernadette Baum)]"

Look no further than New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art, which through the years has partnered with several iconic beauty brands — including the time it released a custom-designed Estée Lauder eyeshadow palette for the art institution’s 150th birthday.A good collaboration in any industry pushes boundaries, inspiring customers to experiment with new ideas and forms of self-expression. So it’s no wonder that skincare and makeup brands are entering Web3 with the same aspirational energy that the beauty industry has always served.Through new forms of digital artistry and cutting-edge technological innovation, today’s leading beauty companies hope to reach Web3-native consumers, create meaningful experiences and perhaps even clean up their supply chain.It helps brands expand to new audiencesYann Joffredo, Global Brand President at NYX Professional Makeup, said that the L’Oréal-owned cosmetics brand has always championed inclusivity through its collaborations with independent content creators, bloggers and makeup artists. Joffredo sees Web3 as the next evolution of this mission, with the added benefit of connecting with new audiences.“As the brand continues to evolve, it is important to advocate for this same representation in Web3,” said Joffredo. “Additionally, we understood the untapped territory within beauty in the metaverse.”In early 2023, NYX launched GORJS, the world’s first beauty-focused decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to spotlight creators building beauty experiences within the Web3 ecosystem.“GORJS integrates Web3 artists and beauty enthusiasts to lead the cultural conversation around what digital makeup artistry will be in the metaverse and beyond,” Joffredo said.It fosters meaningful opportunities for self-expressionJoffredo also said that transparency and self-expression in the metaverse is a natural extension of NYX Professional Makeup’s brand values, adding that digital spaces give beauty enthusiasts unique avenues to express themselves and interact with products.Story continuesMore poignantly, digital spaces can also provide physical safety amid a politically polarized physical world. Last year, NYX partnered with inclusive avatar company People Of Crypto (POC) and The Sandbox, a user-generated virtual environment, to launch a week-long Pride Month celebration. The event featured gender non-conforming NFT avatars donning makeup styled in a pixelated, or rather “voxelized,” fashion using colors representing the Progress Pride flag.In a recent panel at the extended reality (XR) industry conference, AWE Live, NYX vice president of digital innovation and e-commerce Maya Kosovalic spoke to how the Pride event foreshadowed a more immersive digital future: “Self-expression is really the core tenant of future gaming platform experiences, which are no longer singular, solitary game loops but very immersive, engaging social experiences where younger generations can engage with their in-real-life friends.”Celebrating one’s personality and identity through skins and digital goods, she added, is what makes Web3 so interesting for both beauty and fashion brands.Also on the panel was Agustina Sartori, senior innovation director at the American beauty store chain Ulta Beauty. “Beauty is a way to be yourself and be who you want to be,” she said. “Why wouldn't we care about the same thing in the digital world?”According to Sartori, Ulta Beauty has been experimenting with digital activations on Roblox since 2022. Roblox is a popular user-generated gaming platform that does not utilize blockchain or cryptocurrency but nonetheless appeals to major brands interested in building virtual worlds for customers. Ulta’s virtual Roblox world is called the “Ultaverse.” In May, Ulta Beauty partnered with the cruelty-free eyeshadow brand Urban Decay to throw a virtual party inside the Ultaverse. Makeup influencers Emmy Combs, Leilani Green and Manny MUA hosted the event, which attracted some 500,000 visitors to the platform, said Sartori.Ulta Beauty was also one of the first beauty brands to announce its participation in the upcoming Metaverse Beauty Week, which will take place from June 12 to 16 in three different metaverse environments (Decentraland, Roblox and Spatial). Interested participants can learn how to set up the necessary crypto wallets and create their first avatar by reading instructions on the event website.It could solve trust issuesLast, blockchain offers potential solutions for one of the most consistent challenges faced by the beauty industry: greenwashing. Amid growing market pressure to be cruelty-free, eco-friendly and natural, clean beauty brands have been on the receiving end of increased scrutiny in recent years.It’s almost impossible for consumers to track their favorite brands’ ingredients sourcing. But now, there are many supply chain-related use cases for blockchain — most of them still new. The blockchain-based platform created by French luxury skincare company Clarins allows customers to trace their products’ manufacturing journeys on chain. By scanning a QR code on each package, people can trace ingredients’ origins and learn about how the product was made and even packaged.Another way blockchain can help boost trust issues is by weeding out counterfeit products, which is a growing issue in the world of “superfakes.” Luxury fashion giant LMVH launched a blockchain to help prove the authenticity of Louis Vuitton bags and Parfums Christian Dior.Unrelated to supply chains, other beauty brand blockchain experiments include experimental bitcoin “cash-back” programs that incentivize consumers by rewarding them with satoshis for each purchase.Blockchain-based beauty is exciting, but still experimentalAs we see in all facets of Web3, the beauty industry is still experimenting with how to most seamlessly use new technology to create lasting impact among its existing and emerging customer base.“This is a process and it will take time,” said Leya Kaufman, head of brand, publisher and senior vice president of sales at media company Coveteur. “We will need to cultivate and engage audiences in this new arena while simultaneously maintaining our core consumer base,” she said.Alongside leading Web3 infrastructure provider, MoonPay, Coveteur partnered with hair care company Wella Professionals to launch The Wella Generator, a gamified digital sweepstakes hosted on the Ethereum blockchain.“It was important for us to create a program that was seamless for existing and new Web3 users,” Kaufman said, adding that the partnership with MoonPay made this vision possible.Despite growing pains, as digital identity becomes an increasingly important factor in our lives and personalities, it makes sense that people want to feel good about how they look and shop, both on-chain and off, and it looks like blockchain is very on-trend for beauty brands in the future.See Also: How Crypto Influencers Are Following the Beauty Playbook ]"

Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Textron's current trading price of US$64.05 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Textron’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Textron Is Textron Still Cheap?Good news, investors! Textron is still a bargain right now. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $96.90, but it is currently trading at US$64.05 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. What’s more interesting is that, Textron’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.Can we expect growth from Textron?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Textron's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 29%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since TXT is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on TXT for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy TXT.

Those laws ""expansively"" regulate railroad operations and bar those sorts of claims based in state law, Norfolk said.Jayne Conroy, an attorney representing the plaintiffs with the law firm Simmons Hanly Conroy, on Monday called the motion to dismiss “routine” and said “we have every expectation that the motion will be denied in its entirety.”The plaintiffs have claimed the company is liable for the property damage, health concerns and business impacts caused by the Feb. 3 crash of the Norfolk-operated train.A total of 38 cars fell off the tracks that day, including 11 carrying hazardous materials, some of which were burned off sending a black plume of smoke into the sky.The company has repeatedly promised to help the local community, including by setting up a home value reimbursement program, a water testing program and a healthcare fund. The company said Friday that it has paid “over $16 million” directly to residents.In March, the state of Ohio and the U.S. Justice Department also sued Norfolk Southern seeking to ensure that the railroad pays the full cost of cleanup and any long-term effects of the derailment.Story continuesThe railroad has also been sued by shareholders over the derailment, and faces other lawsuits including at least three filed by Pennsylvania school districts near the crash site.The case is In Re: East Palestine Train Derailment, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, No. 4:23-cv-00242.For the plaintiffs: Jayne Conroy of Simmons Hanly Conroy; Seth Katz of Burg Simpson Eldredge Hersh &amp; Jardine; Elizabeth Graham of Grant &amp; Eisenhofer; and Michael Morgan of Morgan &amp; MorganFor Norfolk Southern: Alan Schoenfeld, Davina Pujari, Chris Rheinheimer of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr; and Lawson Johnston and Scott Clements of Dickie, McCamey &amp; ChilcoteRead more:Law firms chosen to lead lawsuits over East Palestine derailmentNorfolk Southern to set up home value reimbursement fund after Ohio derailmentU.S. Justice Department sues Norfolk Southern over Ohio train derailmentOhio sues Norfolk Southern over Feb. 3 train derailment (Reporting by Clark Mindock)]"

(Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)Norfolk Southern has reached sick leave agreements with all of its craft unions. The railroad says it is the first U.S. Class I railroad to have sick leave deals for 100% of its craft workforce.The last deal to be struck was with yardmasters affiliated with the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers — Transportation Division (SMART-TD). The tentative agreement, which will affect nearly 300 yardmasters, calls for up to four new days of paid sick leave, plus the opportunity to use up to three additional days of existing paid time off as sick leave.Yardmasters with SMART-TD must still ratify the agreement. Other craft employees affiliated with SMART-TD ratified an agreement last Friday with NS that included sick leave.“This agreement will provide our hardworking yardmasters the time they need and deserve to take care of their personal well-being,” SMART-TD President Jeremy Ferguson said in a Monday news release. “I want to thank Norfolk Southern for their partnership on this deal and for leading the industry as the first railroad to sign sick leave agreements for every one of our dedicated union members. And most importantly, I want to thank our SMART-TD general chairmen, Joe Borders and Dan Weir, for negotiating this important new benefit for Norfolk Southern yardmasters.”NS (NYSE: NSC) President and CEO Alan Shaw said: “Following national labor negotiations, we committed to address quality of life issues for our craft railroaders. With today’s agreement, we make good on that promise. I am proud of our team for working collaboratively with union leadership over the last four months to reach agreements that benefit all of our craft colleagues.”NS added that it is still “actively engaged” with rail labor on other quality-of-life issues.Predictable schedules and sick leave have been key issues for the unions — and particularly for train conductors and locomotive engineers — during the most recent round of collective bargaining between the unions and the Class I railroads.

(AP) — Norfolk Southern became the first major North American freight railroad with deals to provide paid sick time to all of its workers Monday, but the other railroads are making progress, with nearly 65% of all rail workers securing this basic benefit since the start of the year.All of the major freight railroads have said they are committed to resolving this key issue that nearly led to a strike in last year's bitter contract talks. But most of those railroads — which include CSX, Union Pacific, BNSF, Canadian National and Canadian Pacific Kansas City — are still negotiating with a number of their unions.Also Monday, Union Pacific announced a deal that will provide paid sick leave to about 5,600 engineers in the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen union that gives that railroad agreements with 12 of its 13 unions.Most of the sick time deals, including the one Norfolk Southern announced for yardmasters Monday, provide four days of paid sick time and give workers the option to convert three days of personal leave time into sick days. The conductors and engineers who endure the most unpredictable schedules while operating the trains have been getting five days of paid sick leave with the option to convert two leave days into sick time. The Union Pacific deal follows that five-day model.So all of these deals provide up to seven days of paid sick time, and the railroads promised to pay workers for any unused sick time at the end of each year.Last fall, the railroads refused to add paid sick time to the deal they had already been negotiating for several years, but they relented this year after intense pressure from the public, the Biden administration and several key lawmakers, including Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Rail workers were forced to accept a five-year deal that provided 24% raises and $5,000 in bonuses after Congress blocked their ability to strike because of fears of an economic catastrophe, but that agreement didn't address their quality-of-life concerns.Story continuesThe engineers' union said providing sick time to train crews can help make sure they aren't fatigued while at the controls of a locomotive.“This agreement is really about health and safety,” said Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen National President Eddie Hall. “It’s not in our members’, the public’s or the railroad’s best interest for engineers to be operating trains when they’re sick.""Union Pacific CEO Lance Fritz said these agreements show “the well-being and quality of life for all employees are critically important to us.”About 300 workers are covered by this latest Norfolk Southern agreement. Jeremy Ferguson, president of the Transportation Division of the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers union that represents the Norfolk Southern yardmasters and conductors nationwide, praised the progress that has been made.“This agreement will provide our hardworking yardmasters the time they need and deserve to take care of their personal wellbeing,” Ferguson said.A separate larger agreement between SMART-TD and Norfolk Southern that also addresses schedule concerns for conductors was ratified Friday.“Following national labor negotiations, we committed to address quality of life issues for our craft railroaders. With today’s agreement, we make good on that promise,” said Norfolk Southern President and CEO Alan Shaw.Norfolk Southern and the other major railroads tout the progress they have made so far, but officials with the Transportation Trades Department — the AFL-CIO labor coalition that includes all the rail unions — said much work remains to address workers' concerns.“For months, railroads have been at the table individually with their unions to find a path forward on the quality-of-life matters that came into the spotlight during the round’s final days. Today, railroads have new paid sick leave agreements in place to cover the majority of the unionized rail workforce,"" said Ian Jefferies, who leads the Association of American Railroads trade group. ""Additionally, multiple railroads have secured deals to give operating craft employees greater scheduling predictability.""Greg Regan, president of the TTD labor coalition, said the unions have been keeping up the pressure on the railroads ever since last year's contract talks.“I think the the railroads probably realize the only way this is going to go away is if they actually bargain in good faith. And you know, so far it has yielded some decent results,” Regan said.]"

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. Having said that, from a first glance at Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Coca-Cola:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.17 = US$12b ÷ (US$97b - US$23b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Therefore, Coca-Cola has an ROCE of 17%. In absolute terms, that's a pretty normal return, and it's somewhat close to the Beverage industry average of 15%. View our latest analysis for Coca-Cola roceIn the above chart we have measured Coca-Cola's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Can We Tell From Coca-Cola's ROCE Trend?Over the past five years, Coca-Cola's ROCE and capital employed have both remained mostly flat. This tells us the company isn't reinvesting in itself, so it's plausible that it's past the growth phase. With that in mind, unless investment picks up again in the future, we wouldn't expect Coca-Cola to be a multi-bagger going forward. That probably explains why Coca-Cola has been paying out 67% of its earnings as dividends to shareholders. These mature businesses typically have reliable earnings and not many places to reinvest them, so the next best option is to put the earnings into shareholders pockets.Story continuesThe Bottom LineIn a nutshell, Coca-Cola has been trudging along with the same returns from the same amount of capital over the last five years. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 61% over the last five years. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high.Like most companies, Coca-Cola does come with some risks, and we've found 2 warning signs  that you should be aware of.While Coca-Cola isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

(NYSE:DVA) A Top Quality Stock?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boasting-30-return-equity-davita-134254942.html,1685972574,STORY,['DVA'],"[One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA).Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. Check out our latest analysis for DaVita How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for DaVita is:30% = US$733m ÷ US$2.4b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.30.Does DaVita Have A Good ROE?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, DaVita has a higher ROE than the average (11%) in the Healthcare industry.roeThat is a good sign. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk . You can see the 3 risks we have identified for DaVita by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesCombining DaVita's Debt And Its 30% Return On EquityWe think DaVita uses a significant amount of debt to maximize its returns, as it has a significantly higher debt to equity ratio of 3.47. Its ROE is clearly quite good, but it seems to be boosted by the significant use of debt by the company.SummaryReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider.

324,d6f45aaf-0e3e-326b-acfc-c7d4863f3e9e,VRSN,2023-06-06,Rambus and Hibbett Sports have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rambus-hibbett-sports-highlighted-zacks-112600525.html,1685964360,STORY,"['RMBS', 'DASTY', 'VRSN', 'CRM']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – June 5, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares Rambus RMBS as the Bull of the Day and Hibbett Sports HIBB as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Salesforce CRM, VeriSign VRSN and Dassault Systemes DASTY.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:The latest craze to hit the market this year is Artificial Intelligence, AI. The ground-breaking technology is causing not just ripples, but seismic waves across the market. It has helped kickoff a rally that sent NVIDIA through the roof. It is also bleeding over to many other names in the semiconductor industry. Among them, is today’s Bull of the Day.Today’s Bull of the Day is Rambus. Rambus is an American technology company that designs, develops, and licenses chip interface technologies and architectures used in digital electronic products. The company's primary business model is based on developing and licensing intellectual property related to memory technologies for semiconductors, which are then used in consumer, enterprise, and industrial applications.Currently, Rambus is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The reason for the favorable Zacks Rank is that recent earnings estimate revisions have been coming into the upside. Over the last thirty days, analysts have pushed up their estimates for the current year and next year. The bullish moves have increased our Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current year from $1.74 to $1.78 while next year’s numbers are up from $2.04 to $2.21.That represents earnings growth of 1.71% this year, swelling to 24.16% for next year. That comes on revenue growth of 4.87% for the current year and 18.7% for next year.Taking a look at the Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chart, you can see the consistent year-over-year moves higher in both the price and the earnings. Earnings growth has been not only solid since 2020, but there has been a pretty consistent move higher in those estimates throughout the course of the year. FY2024 estimates now seem to be taking off, helping pull the price along with it.Story continuesBear of the Day:Retailers, specifically those having to do with athletics, have been coming under pressure. Earnings estimates have been squeezed to the downside, input prices have been rising, and the overall outlook has taken a turn for the worse. It should come as no surprise then, that’s today’s Bear of the Day is in this industry.The Bear of the Day is Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) Hibbett Sports. Hibbett, Inc. together with its subsidiaries, engages in the retail of athletic-inspired fashion products in the United States. Its stores offer a range of merchandise, including athletic footwear, athletic and fashion apparel, team sports equipment, and related accessories. The company operates Hibbett stores, City Gear stores, and Sports Additions athletic shoe stores. It also sells its products through online channels.Over the course of the last 30 days, four analysts have cut their earnings estimates for the current year while four have also done so for next year. The bearish moves have dropped our Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current year from $10.18 to $7.88 while next year’s number is down from $11.01 to $9.04.That means that the current year Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for an 18% contraction in earnings this year. That number is expected to grow by 14.78% for next year. That’s on 2.14% revenue growth this year and 5.48% revenue growth for next year.The Retail – Apparel and Shoes industry ranks in the Bottom 15% of our Zacks Industry Rank.Additional content:Salesforce Offers Limited Near-Term Upside: 2 Stocks to Buy Instead Salesforce, the customer relationship management software giant, reported earnings on Thursday after the market close. Although CRM beat earnings handily, raised guidance, and returned cash to shareholders the stock sold off, nonetheless.After rallying close to 60% YTD, completing a major restructuring, and dramatically boosting profits, it seems Salesforce may have been priced to perfection. With so much good news discounted in the stock price, it may be time for CRM to take a break.·         Earnings: $1.69 per share, adjusted, vs. $1.61 per share as expected by analysts·         Revenue: $8.25 billion, vs. $8.18 billion as expected by analysts·         Returned $2.1 Billion in First Quarter to Stockholders through Share BuybacksSalesforce is a member of the Software industry, which currently ranks in the top 46% of the Zacks Industry Rank. It has been extremely strong YTD, so we know there are other stocks investors can rotate into if they are ready to take profits in CRM.Two stocks that boast strong long-term performance, that also currently have superior earnings revision trends are VeriSign and Dassault Systemes. VeriSign has averaged an annualized return of 15.7% over the last 20 years, and Dassault Systemes 14.4% over that same period.VeriSignVeriSign is a leading provider of domain name registry services and internet infrastructure solutions. With a focus on managing the stability and security of the DNS infrastructure, VeriSign ensures the reliable functioning of .com and .net domain names. By leveraging advanced technologies and offering additional services like DDoS protection, VeriSign plays a crucial role in maintaining a secure online environment and enabling seamless internet accessibility.VeriSign has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Current quarter earnings have been revised higher by nearly 2% and are expected to grow 10.4% YoY and FY23 earnings have been upgraded by 2.7%, with estimates of 10.9% YoY growth.VRSN has done almost nothing over the last five years, trading in a large range. The stock made a huge run up from 2011 to 2019, more than 10’xing over that time.Now that VRSN has had some time to cool off, and grow into its valuation, it should be ready for another bull run soon. Moreover, the presence of catalysts driving positive earnings revisions and an attractive valuation further contribute to the breakout potential.VRSN is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 32x, which is above the industry average of 30x, and below its five-year median of 37x. This below average valuation could draw in buyers looking for undervalued tech stocks.Dassault SystemesDassault Systemes is a renowned global leader in 3D design, engineering, and collaborative software solutions. The company, founded in 1981 and headquartered in France, offers a comprehensive portfolio of innovative products and services that cater to various industries, including aerospace, automotive, manufacturing, and life sciences.Dassault Systemes' flagship software, CATIA, is widely recognized as a leading design and modeling tool, while its other offerings, such as SOLIDWORKS and SIMULIA, provide advanced simulation and virtual testing capabilities. With a strong focus on digital transformation and sustainable innovation, Dassault Systemes empowers businesses to enhance their product development processes, improve efficiency, and drive meaningful customer experiences.Through its cutting-edge technologies and industry expertise, DASTY continues to shape the future of design and engineering, enabling companies to stay at the forefront of their respective sectors.Dassault Systemes has seen near unanimous upgrades in its earnings estimates, earning it a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Current quarter earnings have been upgraded by 11% and are expected to grow 7% YoY. FY23 earnings have been revised 9% higher and are expected to climb 9% YoY.Additionally, current quarter sales are expected to grow 8.8% YoY and FY23 sales are projected to grow 10% YoY. These are extremely steady numbers for a $60 billion company.DASTY is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 37.5x, which is above the industry average, and in line with its 10-year median. Dassault Systemes clearly trades at a premium valuation; however, it is for good reason.Dassault Systemes’ applications are the leader in PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) and Engineering software. It is estimated that it owns the largest share in the market at 17% and increased that share by 8.3% over the last year. DASTY has over 300,000 customers in more than 140 countries.Bottom LineThere is no doubt that Salesforce is a powerhouse in the stock market, but with the incredible run it has gone on, it may be time to look for value elsewhere. With its mixed earnings revisions, and limited bullish catalysts, investors may want to proceed with caution in holding the software giant.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

The HRSG will be planted at Chiba Prefecture (east of Tokyo) located at Goi Thermal Power Station.The Goi Thermal Power Station is fueled by three GE 9HA.02 gas turbines. This LNG-fueled combined cycle power plant has an installed capacity of about 2,340 megawatts and is likely to begin commercial operation in 2024 in phases.

However, improving supply chains and reduced delivery lead times bode well for the industry’s growth. Focus on inorganic activities to expand network and product offerings, and investments in product development and innovation should drive the industry’s growth.Companies like Ingersoll Rand Inc. IR, Graco Inc. GGG and Flowserve Corporation FLS are well-placed to capitalize on the buoyancy in the industry.About the IndustryThe Zacks Manufacturing – General Industrial industry comprises companies engaged in the production of a wide range of industrial equipment. Some industry players offer power transmission products, bearings, engineered fluid power components and systems, industrial rubber products, vapor-abrasive blasting equipment, vehicle-powered truck refrigeration systems, adhesive, gel coat equipment, flow-control components and linear motion components. In addition, industrial manufacturing companies reconstruct and assemble pumps, valves, speed reducers and hydraulic motors. The companies provide services to original equipment manufacturing, and maintenance, repair and overhaul customers. These end users belong to the mining, oil and gas, forest products, agriculture and food processing, fabricated metals, chemicals and petrochemicals, transportation and utilities industries.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Manufacturing General Industrial IndustryPersistent Weakness in the Manufacturing Sector: Continued weakness in the manufacturing sector signals a low demand environment for the industry players. Per the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) report, in May, the Manufacturing PMI (Purchasing Manager’s Index) touched 46.9%, contracting for the seventh consecutive month. A figure less than 50% indicates a contraction in manufacturing activity. The New Orders Index remained in contraction territory at 42.6%, declining 3.1 percentage points from the figure recorded in April. As recession fears loom large amid a slowdown in the U.S. economy, businesses expect continued softness in demand at least in the near term.Easing Supply Chain Disruptions: While supply chain disruptions persist, especially related to the availability of electronic components, the situation has improved as evident from the ISM report’s Supplier Deliveries Index, which reflected faster deliveries for the eighth straight month in May. Easing supply chain issues should support industrial manufacturing companies’ growth in 2023.Acquisition-Based Growth Strategy: The industry participants focus on an acquisition-based growth strategy to expand their network and product offerings. This helps them foray into new markets and solidify their competitive position. Exposure to various end-markets helps industrial manufacturing companies offset risks associated with a single market. Continuous investments in product development and innovation, automation and technological advancements augur well for the industry’s growth.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Manufacturing – General Industrial industry, housed within the broader Zacks Industrial Products sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #40.

Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the group’s 2023 earnings per share has increased 9.8% since the end of January.Given the industry’s bright near-term prospects, we will present a few stocks, worth considering for your portfolio. But before that, it’s worth taking a look at the industry’s stock market performance and current valuation.Industry Outperforms Both Sector &amp; S&amp;PThe Zacks Manufacturing – General Industrial industry has outperformed both the broader sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite index over the past year.Over this period, the industry has appreciated 10.2% compared with the sector and the S&amp;P 500 Index’s increase of 2.3% and 4.1%, respectively.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of forward 12-month Price-to-Earnings (P/E), which is a commonly used multiple for valuing manufacturing stocks, the industry is currently trading at 17.74X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 19.01X.

LYB announced plans to defer the exit of its refining business from year-end 2023 to the end of the first quarter of 2025. Favorable inspections and consistent performance have given the company confidence that operations at the Houston location will continue to be safe and reliable.LyondellBasell anticipates modest maintenance spending to sustain this extension in 2023 and 2024 but remains committed to shutting down its oil refining operations. The extension will mitigate the impact on the workforce as the company continues to research future alternatives for the site and will allow for a better transition between the shutdown and the implementation of the retrofitting and circular initiatives.One of the three pillars of the company's new strategy is to develop an attractive Circular and Low Carbon Solutions business. LyondellBasell is creating long-term planning for the Houston refinery site in support of this strategy. Green and blue hydrogen, as well as recycled and renewable feedstocks, are a few of the solutions being considered.The growth projects currently under construction would leverage the infrastructure already present on the refining site, including hydrotreaters, pipes, tanks, utilities, buildings, and laboratories, as well as existing assets in the Houston region. The 700-acre refinery facility is expected to eventually become a part of a Houston regional hub for LyondellBasell's Circular and Low Carbon Solutions division and support the expansion of its Circulen product line.Shares of the company have lost 18.2% over the past year compared with the 9.6% decline of its industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLyondellBasell, on its first-quarter call, said that it anticipates a slight increase in global demand driven by usual seasonal trends. The demand for transportation fuels is expected to increase over the summer, supporting oxyfuels and refining margins. Delays at the beginning of industry-wide capacity expansions for polyethylene in North America are likely to lower new market supply and support polyethylene margins.In order to keep pace with the market expectation, LyondellBasell estimates operating Intermediates &amp; Derivatives assets at 80% and modestly raises global olefins and polyolefins operating rates to 85%. The company will continue to monitor the impact of shifting global monetary policies and strengthening economic conditions in China on petrochemical markets in the second half of 2023.Story continuesLyondellBasell Industries N.V.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read 10 S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats To Avoid. Over the years, there has been an observable shift in focus from growth stocks to dividend stocks in certain market environments. High inflationary periods have fared well for dividend stocks historically. Dividend investing also often aligns with a long-term investment strategy as investors may find comfort in the consistent dividend income and the potential for capital appreciation that quality dividend stocks can offer over time. In 2022, dividend aristocrat stocks outperformed the broader market, falling by just 6.21%, compared with a much harsher decline of 18.1% in the S&amp;P 500.Not only the performance of dividend stocks remained strong compared to other asset classes, but companies in the S&amp;P 500 also paid a record amount in dividend payments last year. According to a report by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, the S&amp;P 500 corporations distributed $561 billion in dividends in 2022, up from $511.2 billion in 2021. Though the market suffered some setbacks in the face of Silicon Bank Valley's failure earlier in March, global dividend payouts sustained their position. In the first quarter of 2023, global dividends grew by 12% on a headline basis to a record $327 billion, as reported by Janus Henderson Investors. The increase was mainly driven by special dividends paid by companies during the quarter.Analysts and economists are giving a positive outlook for dividend stocks as these equities held their ground during uncertain market conditions. Goldman Sachs Chief US Equity Strategist David Kostin spoke with Business Insider in April and mentioned that dividend payments are expected to grow this year as well. Here are some remarks from the analyst:""We expect that S&amp;P 500 DPS [dividend-per-share] will reach $70 in 2023 and $73 (+4%) in 2024. Recent company actions also point to a healthy dividend growth environment. The difference in outlooks for dividend and buyback growth suggests firms focusing on dividends will continue to outperform buyback stocks.""Story continuesDividend growth track records play an important role when investing in dividend stocks. These companies often exhibit solid financial health, strong cash flows, and a history of successful operations. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) are some of the most popular dividend aristocrat stocks, however, in this article, we will cover the least popular dividend aristocrats among hedge funds.25 S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats To AvoidDaily newspaper economy stock market chartOur Methodology:For this list, we scoured Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds as of Q1 2023 and picked the 25 least popular dividend aristocrats in terms of hedge fund positions.

334,fd7f2508-a8e6-3caa-a8a2-ee4c8ceba12c,VLO,2023-06-06,Valero Energy Corporation (VLO) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/valero-energy-corporation-vlo-attracting-130012224.html,1685970012,STORY,['VLO'],"[Valero Energy (VLO) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this oil refiner have returned +2.1%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, which Valero Energy falls in, has lost 0.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Valero Energy is expected to post earnings of $5.65 per share, indicating a change of -50.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -8% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $22.54 points to a change of -22.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -4.7%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $14.85 indicates a change of -34.1% from what Valero Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.4%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Valero Energy.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Valero Energy, the consensus sales estimate of $35.65 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -31%. The $143.41 billion and $136.74 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -18.7% and -4.7%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryValero Energy reported revenues of $36.44 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -5.5%. EPS of $8.27 for the same period compares with $2.31 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $28.89 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +26.14%. The EPS surprise was +14.23%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Valero Energy is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Valero Energy.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this largest U.S. health insurer have returned +1.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.1% change. The Zacks Medical - HMOs industry, to which UnitedHealth belongs, has gained 0.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.UnitedHealth is expected to post earnings of $6.08 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +9.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4%.The consensus earnings estimate of $24.97 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +12.5%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $28.05 indicates a change of +12.3% from what UnitedHealth is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, UnitedHealth is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of UnitedHealth, the consensus sales estimate of $90.54 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +12.7%. The $364.75 billion and $388.22 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +12.5% and +6.4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUnitedHealth reported revenues of $91.93 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.7%. EPS of $6.26 for the same period compares with $5.49 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $89.33 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.92%. The EPS surprise was +0.32%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.UnitedHealth is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers.

(NYSE:EL) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies Estée Lauder Companies Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the President, Fabrizio Freda, for US$5.3m worth of shares, at about US$268 per share. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$181. So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.Estée Lauder Companies insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year.

Specifically, Executive Group President Jane Hudis ditched US$3.9m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesDoes Estée Lauder Companies Boast High Insider Ownership?Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Estée Lauder Companies insiders own 12% of the company, currently worth about US$8.3b based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Estée Lauder Companies Tell Us?An insider sold Estée Lauder Companies shares recently, but they didn't buy any. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read 10 S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats To Avoid. Over the years, there has been an observable shift in focus from growth stocks to dividend stocks in certain market environments. High inflationary periods have fared well for dividend stocks historically. Dividend investing also often aligns with a long-term investment strategy as investors may find comfort in the consistent dividend income and the potential for capital appreciation that quality dividend stocks can offer over time. In 2022, dividend aristocrat stocks outperformed the broader market, falling by just 6.21%, compared with a much harsher decline of 18.1% in the S&amp;P 500.Not only the performance of dividend stocks remained strong compared to other asset classes, but companies in the S&amp;P 500 also paid a record amount in dividend payments last year. According to a report by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, the S&amp;P 500 corporations distributed $561 billion in dividends in 2022, up from $511.2 billion in 2021. Though the market suffered some setbacks in the face of Silicon Bank Valley's failure earlier in March, global dividend payouts sustained their position. In the first quarter of 2023, global dividends grew by 12% on a headline basis to a record $327 billion, as reported by Janus Henderson Investors. The increase was mainly driven by special dividends paid by companies during the quarter.Analysts and economists are giving a positive outlook for dividend stocks as these equities held their ground during uncertain market conditions. Goldman Sachs Chief US Equity Strategist David Kostin spoke with Business Insider in April and mentioned that dividend payments are expected to grow this year as well. Here are some remarks from the analyst:""We expect that S&amp;P 500 DPS [dividend-per-share] will reach $70 in 2023 and $73 (+4%) in 2024. Recent company actions also point to a healthy dividend growth environment.

348,fa3f8aa9-63b8-3c64-9b89-914bd48e4b07,PG,2023-06-06,Boston Beer (SAM) Relies on Growth Strategic Amid Cost Woes,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boston-beer-sam-relies-growth-143400430.html,1685975640,STORY,"['SAM', 'CELH', 'PG']","[The Boston Beer Company SAM has been gaining from pricing actions, product innovation and growth of its non-beer categories. This, along with brand development to boost its operational performance and position in the market, bodes well.The company is on track with growth of its Beyond Beer category, wherein it currently holds the 2nd position. Beyond Beer is growing faster than the traditional beer market, and the company expects this trend to continue for the next several years.As part of product innovation, the company expects to improve the Truly brand trends through a renewed focus on core business, smart brand innovation, and strong distributor support and retail execution. The company’s recent innovation for the Truly brand — Truly flavored bottle Vodka — sold by Beam Suntory has been well-received by consumers. With regard to revisiting the core flavors, the company announced the reformulation and improvement of core Truly flavors, including the addition of real fruit juice for an even smoother, easy-to-drink and refreshing taste.Coming to Twisted Tea, the brand drove most growth of Boston Beer in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, owing to an effective brand-building campaign, increased investment in media and an additional retail program focused on the Super Bowl. The Twisted Tea brand's first-quarter dollar sales growth in off-premise measured channels accelerated to 34%. Consequently, the brand is likely to witness strong double-digit growth for the remainder of 2023.The company is committed to the three-point growth plan focused on the revival of its Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands, cost-saving initiatives, and long-term innovation. Management plans to revive the Samuel Adams brand through packaging, innovation, promotion and brand communication initiatives.Further, Boston Beer has been keen on retaining Angry Orchard and Twisted Tea’s momentum, while ensuring Truly Spiked &amp; Sparkling's leadership position in the hard sparkling water category. The company is focused on accelerated cost savings and efficiency projects, with savings directed toward further brand development.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research We note that this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has rallied 7.4% in the past three months against the industry’s decline of 1.1%.Headwinds to OvercomeDespite these upsides, SAM continues to reel under declines in shipments and depletions, as well as continued challenges in the hard seltzer category. An unfavorable product mix and supply-chain inefficiencies also affected the company in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.The adjusted loss per share of 73 cents in first-quarter 2023 was wider than the year-ago quarter’s loss of 16 cents. Net revenues declined 4.7% year over year to $410 million. Excluding excise taxes, the top line fell 4.8% year over year to $435.2 million.Higher inventory obsolescence costs and rising brewery processing mainly hurt the company’s gross margin, offset by price increases. The rise in inventory obsolescence costs mainly resulted from rebranding Truly Vodka Seltzer to Truly Vodka Soda and a non-recurring payment to a third-party contract brewery.These factors resulted in an unfavorable impact of 210 bps on the gross margin. Also, general and administrative expenses increased 10.1% year over year to $43.7 million mainly due to increased consulting costs.Boston Beer has been witnessing a slowdown in the hard seltzer category for some time now. The slowing hard seltzer trends hurt the company’s depletions to some extent in first-quarter 2022. The hard seltzer category witnessed continued declines in the first quarter due to a dismal macroeconomic environment, which caused a volume shift from hard seltzers back to premium light beers due to their lower pricing. The slowed hard seltzer sales mainly impacted the company’s Truly hard seltzer performance, which is expected to continue through the first half of 2023.For 2023, Boston Beer envisions depletions and shipments to decline 2-8%. This view includes the adverse impact of 1% due to the fact that fiscal 2022 had 53 weeks and fiscal 2023 will have 52 weeks. On a 52-week comparable basis, the company expects depletions and shipments to decline 1-7%. For the first quarter of 2023, shipments are likely to be at the low end of the 2023 guidance, backed by the launch of Truly Margarita. Also, the company expects a loss for the aforementioned quarter.Bottom LineAlthough a drab hard seltzer unit, weakness in shipments and depletions, and cost headwinds have been concerning, Boston Beer’s solid strategies are likely to drive growth. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s earnings has moved up 2.6% over the past seven days. Topping it, investors can’t ignore the stock’s Momentum Score of A, which is a testament to its sound fundamentals.Stocks to ConsiderWe highlighted some better-ranked stocks from the broader Consumer Staples space, namely Conagra Brands CAG Celsius Holdings CELH and Procter &amp; Gamble PG.Conagra Brands, a consumer-packaged goods food company, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

349,e29af83f-762f-35d4-bcf4-2e619fd88f98,PG,2023-06-06,Billionaire Bridgewater Founder Ray Dalio’s Top 10 Holdings in 2023,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/billionaire-bridgewater-founder-ray-dalio-132338597.html,1685971418,STORY,"['PEP', 'PG', 'V', 'SBUX', 'GOOGL', 'WMT', 'COST', 'MCD']","[In this article we present the list of Billionaire Bridgewater Founder Ray Dalio’s Top 10 Holdings in 2023. Click to skip ahead and see Billionaire Bridgewater Founder Ray Dalio’s Top 5 Holdings in 2023.McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) are three of the top holdings in billionaire money manager Ray Dalio’s consumer-focused 13F portfolio.Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates has been the most successful fund in history in terms of net dollar gains since inception, delivering $52.2 billion in gains through the end of 2021 according to research conducted by LCH Investments. The fund continued to roll last year even in the midst of Dalio stepping down in October, as the Pure Alpha strategy returned 9.5%.Bridgewater has undertaken several initiatives under new chief executive Nir Bar Dea, including slashing 8% of its workforce and capping investments in its flagship fund as it looks to reallocate resources and restructure. Among other things, Bar Dea plans to invest heavily in Bridgewater’s AI and machine learning capabilities.Meanwhile, Dalio continues to expand his family office, which manages the billionaire’s greater than $16 billion in personal wealth, as well as his philanthropic donations. The Dalio Family Office’s newest branch is planned for Abu Dhabi, where it will work alongside the firm’s existing branches in Singapore and the United States.Dalio gave the recently agreed-upon debt-ceiling deal a D grade in a tweet on Twitter, adding that it was about the best that could be expected but simply wasn’t good enough. In a LinkedIn post published in May, Dalio warned that the U.S. faces a disastrous financial collapse if it continues to raise the debt ceiling without any meaningful limit being put in place.Dalio also engaged in a recent conversation of sorts with the AI chat platform ChatGPT as he relayed in a YouTube video posted in the middle of April. ChatGPT wondered what the most important investing-related lesson is that Dalio learned throughout his storied career, to which the Bridgewater founder responded that diversification was the “Holy Grail” of investing. Dalio added that by investing in 10 to 15 good, uncorrelated assets, an investor can reduce their risk by about 80% without impacting their potential returns.Story continuesIn the first quarter, Bridgewater Associates made significant adjustments to its 13F portfolio, selling off 228 of its former holdings while adding just 118 new positions in their place. The firm also trimmed the size of far more holdings than it was adding to. Of particular note was Bridgewater’s exposure to the finance sector, which was lowered by 330 basis points to 23%. In response, Bridgewater’s exposure to healthcare and communications stocks was raised by a combined 371 basis points. Bridgewater’s 13F portfolio dropped to $16.4 billion in assets as of the end of March, down from $18.3 billion at the end of 2022.Amid a turbulent quarter, the first full one in which Nir Bar Dea was at the helm of Dalio’s iconic firm, let’s take a look at the top ten holdings of the fund in 2023.Billionaire Bridgewater Founder Ray Dalio’s Top 10 Holdings in 2023Ray Dalio of Bridgewater AssociatesOur MethodologyThe following data is gathered from Bridgewater Associates’ latest 13F filing with the SEC. We follow hedge funds like Bridgewater Associates because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q1 2023 reporting period.Billionaire Bridgewater Founder Ray Dalio’s Top 10 Holdings in 202310. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $223 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 174 The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are a few of the longtime favorite top holdings of Bridgewater founder and CIO Ray Dalio. A newer addition to a top 10 spot among his holdings is Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), after Dalio grew his stake in the company by nearly 150% during Q3 of 2022. In the first quarter of this year he boosted the size of his V stake by another 19%, ending Q1 with 990,819 shares.Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) has broadly outperformed the S&amp;P 500 over the last decade and could very well do so in the decade to come. The credit card payments processor is still growing revenue at a low-double digit rate and has several tailwinds at its back that could allow it to continue doing for the foreseeable future. Chief among those tailwinds are the continued rise in the global penetration of credit cards and ecommerce’s growing share of global sales. And both of those tailwinds have plenty of room to run yet. As such, Visa shares are currently trading at somewhat of a premium at 29.5x earnings.Polen Global Growth Strategy shared some of the fundamental strengths that Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) enjoys in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“We trimmed Mastercard and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) to equal weights of the Portfolio. Mastercard and Visa operate as a duopoly in a large and growing market. Over the last 50 years, global personal consumer expenditures (PCE) has grown 7-9% annualized. We expect 4-5% long-term PCE growth going forward. Additionally, the shift from cash to credit continues unabated, with a total credit penetration of only approximately 50% globally.3 This shift provides Visa and Mastercard with another ~4-6% of growth. When combined with PCE, this gives both companies high-single-digit to low-double[1]digit revenue growth opportunities. This growth estimate is before accounting for growth amplifiers like the acceleration of e[1]commerce, the shift from offline to online, and additional services. Both companies enjoy extremely strong network effects that provide strong competitive advantages.We have trimmed Visa and Mastercard because their combined weight grew to over 12% of the Global Growth Portfolio because of their recent performance and to fund our increase in Amazon’s position size. We added to both positions when their prices were depressed due to cross-border transactions deteriorating materially from the pandemic. Cross-border volumes came roaring back when travel corridors reopened, and although we are several quarters removed from the cross-border nadir, Visa still grew volumes &gt;30% in 1Q23. Total cross-border volumes are now 132% of 2019 levels. At 4.5% each, both companies remain high conviction positions for Global Growth.”9. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $239 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 204 (GOOG), 155 (GOOGL) Bridgewater CIO Ray Dalio was bullish on Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) during Q1 after shares hit a two-year low at the end of 2022. Dalio more than tripled the size of his stake in Alphabet’s class A (GOOGL) shares during the quarter, holding just under 2.31 million of them at the end of March. GOOGL shares are having a much better 2023 so far, gaining 37%.As Baron Opportunity Fund discusses below, one of the biggest worries investors have about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) right now is how its search engine traffic will hold up against the rise of ChatGPT, which has already had 1.6 billion visitors. When users want general information on certain topics, they may be increasingly likely to seek out quick answers from the AI platform rather than wade through pages of search results (and ads), which frequently contain links to outdated or even irrelevant content. While Google plans to eventually release its own competing AI platform, if anything that will just further cannibalize its own search engine and eat into its ad revenue.Baron Opportunity Fund continues to lower its exposure to Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) given some of those worries, as it revealed in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“As we did last quarter, we continued to decrease our weighting in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) because, as stated earlier, we believe ChatGPT and/or similar AI-based services present a hard-to-measure risk to Google’s virtual search monopoly.”8. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $259 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 69 There’s been a 23% rise in hedge fund ownership of Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) over the past two quarters, with the stock sitting near its all-time high in smart money shareholders. Bridgewater Associates pared back its SBUX holding by 5% during the first quarter to 2.49 million shares.Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) continues to expand its global footprint, with plans to grow its store count to 45,000 within the next two years, which would double its store count since 2015. Starbucks plans to open about one-third of those new stores in China, where it’s understandably been facing headwinds of late, but the long-term opportunity there is tremendous. SBUX shares have dipped by 13% since the company’s latest earnings report in early May, driving their price down to 32.2x earnings, which looks reasonable.The Polen Global Growth Strategy isn’t as bullish on Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) as Bridgewater’s Ray Dalio, as it sold off its stake in the company in Q4 according to its Q4 2022 investor letter:“We also liquidated our remaining position in Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX). While the company remains a unique and resilient franchise, China is a very important growth market for the company, and zero-COVID policies have made it challenging for the company to operate in this important market. While we expect China to return to more “normal” operation at some point, any COVID flare-ups, in China or other markets, present a very real headwind to Starbucks’ profitability. L’Oreal, Estée Lauder, and other holdings continue to have meaningful exposure to China, but in each of these cases, our research indicates they’re able to better adapt to these operating challenges and realize the growth opportunity in China through their online businesses. In short, we think there are better risk-reward opportunities.”7. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $394 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 92 There was a massive spike in hedge fund ownership of Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) during Q1, as 37% more funds were long WMT at the end of Q1 than at the start of it. Louis Bacon’s Moore Global Investments and George Soros’ Soros Fund Management were among the funds adding Walmart to their 13F portfolios. On the other hand, Bridgewater’s Ray Dalio offloaded 22% of his Walmart shares during the quarter, ending March with 2.67 million of them.Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) grew e-commerce sales by 26% during the first quarter of its fiscal year 2024, while overall sales rose by 7.7% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Operating cash flow also rebounded to $4.6 billion in the quarter from a loss of $3.8 billion a year earlier.After buying back about $10 billion worth of its shares in FY 2023, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) scaled back to just $700 million in repurchases in the latest quarter. The company still has $18.6 billion remaining on its share repurchase authorization, which would buy back close to 5% of its outstanding shares.6. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $428 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 63 Closing out the first half of Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio’s top holdings in 2023 is Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), ranking sixth. The billionaire money manager trimmed his stake in the wholesale retailer by 9% during Q1, ending the quarter with 861,306 shares. He owned the largest COST position among the select group of hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey’s database.Hedge funds and analysts love Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) for its staunchly loyal customer base and its strong value proposition. Truist has a $568 price target on the stock and believes the tougher economic conditions will allow Costco to further grow its membership and gain market share. Deutsche Bank has a $574 target on COST shares.Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) has been experiencing some weakness in its discretionary categories, which led to soft March sales and negative comps for the first time in nearly seven years, excluding the pandemic. It’s likely that weakness was felt broadly across retail however and wasn’t Costco specific. Overall March sales grew by 0.5% to $21.7 billion.PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) are three of Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio’s top 2023 holdings.

You can skip our detailed analysis of value stocks and their performance, and go directly to read 5 Undervalued S&amp;P 500 Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On. The value investing approach, popularized by Benjamin Graham and practiced by billionaire Warren Buffett, has attracted the attention of numerous other successful money managers, especially since growth stocks started taking a beating in 2022. Globally, value stocks declined by over 7% last year, compared to a 28.6% drop in growth equities. In the US, the outperformance of value stocks was the highest since the dot-com crash in 2000. In our article titled 12 Cheap Dividend Stocks With High Yields, we reported an analysis from Dimensional Funds, highlighting that value stocks outperformed their growth counterparts by 4.1% annually in the US from 1927 to 2021.Also read: 16 Most Profitable Value Stocks NowGoldman Sachs reported that value stocks dominated growth equities between 1970 and 2007 on a cumulative basis. On the other hand, growth outperformed from mid-2007 until 2020, when the pandemic hit the market, giving way to value stocks all over again. The report pointed out that the success of either of these strategies is characterized by economic growth. Value stocks tend to outperform when inflation is high, whereas growth equities dominate during low inflationary periods.Analysts have a positive outlook on value investing for the near future, even though growth stocks are outperforming so far in 2023. John D. Linehan, portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price, discussed in a report that the ongoing market conditions favor value stocks as central banks are unlikely to cut interest rates this year. Here is an excerpt from the report:“I believe that an extended period of higher interest rates and the maturing of the recent period of disruptive technology may establish a better environment for value stocks. This is not to suggest that value will dominate the next 10 years in the way that growth has dominated the past 10, but it does mean that value investing is likely to play a more important role in investor portfolios as higher rates create broader earnings growth and investors focus more on cash flows.”Story continuesThe positive outlook for value investing has billionaires flocking toward value stocks this year. In this article, we will take a look at undervalued S&amp;P 500 stocks billionaires are loading up on. Some of these include Citigroup Inc.

He tells Yahoo Finance Live's Seana Smith and Akiko Fujita why.Video TranscriptAKIKO FUJITA: Welcome back to Yahoo Finance Live. Major indices red across the board right now, with the Dow seeing the biggest losses with 45 minutes left in the trading day. Down about 156 points. Well, CAPTRUST's Christian Ledoux is back with us to share some stock picks he says are worth eyeing as well some that he's trying to avoid.So Christian, before the break, we were talking about the huge gains that we've seen in tech, AI being a big driver. Let's start with the pick that you like, Alphabet. Because they got to a bit of a rocky start when it comes to their AI play. What do you like there?CHRISTIAN LEDOUX: Well, two parts, really. The first part being the main business being the advertising model is starting to show signs of recovery. We had about 12 months in the last 12 months of declines in ad growth. And it seems to have stabilized now and is looking promising in the next 12 months.The other part of it is AI, like you mentioned. And Microsoft made quite a splash with their ChatGPT. And many were suggesting that Google was being left behind. But if you look at Google's most recent developer conference, not as exciting as the Apple conference today, but it was really great to see some of the AI programs that they had in works.And really, they're going to be more the developer tools that are going to be assisting the engineers with AI. And that's where they're really going to make the money. And it's not going to be about the chat bots as much.SEANA SMITH: Christian, when you take a look and to account so many of the thoughts out there just on the street, you mentioned how Google has stacked up to Microsoft in their AI initiatives. Do you think then maybe Google is closer to Microsoft with its AI play than many are giving it credit for today?Story continuesCHRISTIAN LEDOUX: Oh, I'd wager that Google is actually ahead in the technology. They've been doing this for decades. So I would imagine they actually have a technological lead. Now it's about packaging and getting products to market, when they didn't anticipate that they would have to get to market so quickly. Microsoft kind of forced their hand. And now that it's out there, I think Google is going to see a nice runway here.AKIKO FUJITA: Let's talk about another name that you're liking right now, and that is Jefferies Group. Interesting to note here, this, you also tie to an AI play that you think this could generate a lot of capital markets activity, specifically benefiting somebody like Jefferies. Walk me through your case.CHRISTIAN LEDOUX: Yeah. Well, first about Jeffrey. So Jeffrey's is sort of an unloved investment bank. They're living in the shadow of Goldman and Morgan Stanley and Bank of America. But they've come up from the ranks, and they're now the number five in the US and growing faster than all of their leading peers.But what's really exciting is that when we have a new technology come out like AI is coming out now, what's going to happen real quickly is the venture capitalists are going to sense opportunity for investors in the public markets to want to buy into the trend. And that means they're going to bring a bunch of companies public. And it's going to be companies like Jefferies that benefit from that.SEANA SMITH: On the flip side, Chris, you have a couple of stocks that you're saying that people should avoid right now. One of those names, American Airlines. And it comes at a time when people it seems like are willing to pay whatever they can to get out there and travel. The demand numbers have looked very, very strong. What's the risk that you see?CHRISTIAN LEDOUX: Well, the strength of travel demand, we've all seen it. We've been to the airports, so we've seen everybody full. And that really actually is the beginning of the negative case on this. It's about as good as it's going to get. We've got about as much capacity utilization in the airline industry as we can handle. We've seen the shortages of staff. And companies like American have had to make deals with their unions to lock in higher costs for those elements of their business.And then on top of that is the debt that came from the pandemic period. And that debt is a pretty big burden, especially for American. They have the biggest debt load in the industry. And there's some significant maturities coming in '25 and '26 that they're going to have to refinance at likely higher rates. And at the same time, they're probably going to see a downturn in their main business. So that's going to be a struggle for them.AKIKO FUJITA: So the debt's certainly a concern for American. But is it about the debt more than the industry as a whole? Because to your point, you say it's only as good as it gets. But travel really has reached a peak. You see people shelling out a lot of money, you've seen international travel come back. Hopefully, business travel comes back. I mean, isn't there more upside? And would you be willing to put your money behind some of these other competitors of American?CHRISTIAN LEDOUX: I would not. I believe that the industry is going to have a hard time adding capacity in an economic way. What I mean by that is, the ability to buy new airplanes, get new gates, get new routes, staff those routes at a time when ticket prices are already starting to soften a little bit. So I would anticipate that we are truly seeing about as good as it gets. And by this time next year, we're going to be seeing negative year-over-year growth rates in almost all the metrics.SEANA SMITH: Chris, the other name that you have that you're telling people to avoid right now is Lucid. Certainly run into its own set of challenges here over the last several months. Selling off just recently last week. Why do you see more downside ahead for Lucid, given the fact that the EV market is certainly starting to heat up?CHRISTIAN LEDOUX: Yeah. And it is hard to say negative things about a company that has such a fantastic product. If you've seen their car, it's quite exciting. But what's the problem is that these companies are really having a hard time manufacturing profitably. It took Tesla over a decade from the first production unit came off the line to break into free cash flow profitability.And the fact that Lucid and it and its peers-- I would say Lucid is in the same situation as all the other EV pure plays-- they are burning cash at a very rapid rate. You saw a couple of weeks ago that they raised additional capital. But that capital at the current burn rate is only going to last for about nine months. They have a little bit more cash in that on their balance sheet, but that's really only going to take them in the 12 to 24-month range of operations.So they're not likely going to get through the burn for the next few years that people are hoping that they do. And they're going to have to raise additional money in a best case scenario, which will dilute investors. Or they're going to be facing a bankruptcy, which some of their peers are already facing.AKIKO FUJITA: All right. Christian Ledoux, it's good to talk to you today. Appreciate you sticking around.]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read 10 S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats To Avoid. Over the years, there has been an observable shift in focus from growth stocks to dividend stocks in certain market environments. High inflationary periods have fared well for dividend stocks historically. Dividend investing also often aligns with a long-term investment strategy as investors may find comfort in the consistent dividend income and the potential for capital appreciation that quality dividend stocks can offer over time. In 2022, dividend aristocrat stocks outperformed the broader market, falling by just 6.21%, compared with a much harsher decline of 18.1% in the S&amp;P 500.Not only the performance of dividend stocks remained strong compared to other asset classes, but companies in the S&amp;P 500 also paid a record amount in dividend payments last year. According to a report by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, the S&amp;P 500 corporations distributed $561 billion in dividends in 2022, up from $511.2 billion in 2021. Though the market suffered some setbacks in the face of Silicon Bank Valley's failure earlier in March, global dividend payouts sustained their position. In the first quarter of 2023, global dividends grew by 12% on a headline basis to a record $327 billion, as reported by Janus Henderson Investors. The increase was mainly driven by special dividends paid by companies during the quarter.Analysts and economists are giving a positive outlook for dividend stocks as these equities held their ground during uncertain market conditions. Goldman Sachs Chief US Equity Strategist David Kostin spoke with Business Insider in April and mentioned that dividend payments are expected to grow this year as well. Here are some remarks from the analyst:""We expect that S&amp;P 500 DPS [dividend-per-share] will reach $70 in 2023 and $73 (+4%) in 2024. Recent company actions also point to a healthy dividend growth environment. The difference in outlooks for dividend and buyback growth suggests firms focusing on dividends will continue to outperform buyback stocks.""Story continuesDividend growth track records play an important role when investing in dividend stocks. These companies often exhibit solid financial health, strong cash flows, and a history of successful operations. Walmart Inc.

If you want to read about some more copper stocks, go directly to 5 Best Copper Stocks to Buy.The copper mining industry is experiencing significant market trends that have far-reaching implications for the global landscape. These trends are crucial for understanding the current dynamics and future prospects of the industry. The demand for copper has been steadily rising, driven by various factors. Rapid urbanization and industrialization in emerging economies, such as China and India, have fueled the need for copper in infrastructure development, construction projects, and electrical wiring. Additionally, the growing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), renewable energy systems, and advancements in technology, including 5G networks, are driving the demand for copper as a vital component in these applications.However, the copper mining industry is facing supply constraints due to several factors. Aging mines, declining ore grades, and operational challenges in existing mining operations have led to a slowdown in production growth. Furthermore, geopolitical factors, including trade tensions, labor strikes, and regulatory changes, can disrupt the supply chain and affect the availability of copper in the market. In addition, environmental sustainability has become a significant focus in the mining industry, including copper mining. Companies are under increasing pressure to adopt sustainable practices, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and minimize water usage.The copper mining industry is also embracing technological advancements to improve efficiency, productivity, and sustainability. Automation, artificial intelligence, and data analytics are being utilized to optimize mining operations, reduce costs, and enhance safety. Furthermore, innovations in mineral exploration techniques are helping identify new copper deposits and improve the efficiency of resource estimation. The emphasis on responsible sourcing and ethical supply chains is gaining momentum in the copper mining industry. Companies are increasingly expected to adhere to strict social and environmental standards, ensuring the ethical extraction and processing of copper. Story continuesConsumers and investors are demanding transparency and accountability throughout the supply chain, prompting mining companies to adopt responsible sourcing practices and certifications. Understanding these market trends is vital for stakeholders in the copper mining industry. Mining companies need to anticipate and adapt to changing market dynamics to ensure long-term sustainability and profitability. Governments and regulatory bodies play a crucial role in setting policies that balance environmental concerns with the industry's economic significance. The global market for copper is projected to experience significant growth, with an expected increase from $160.7 billion in 2022 to $176.74 billion in 2023, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.0%. However, the recent Russia-Ukraine war has had disruptive effects on the global economy, particularly in the short term. This conflict has led to economic sanctions, commodity price surges, and supply chain disruptions, resulting in inflation and impacting various markets worldwide. Nonetheless, the copper market is anticipated to continue expanding, reaching $254.33 billion by 2027, with a CAGR of 9.5%.Within the copper industry, ore mining is a lucrative business. It involves a complex process that begins with extracting ore containing less than 1% copper and concludes with the production of cathodes. These cathodes are sheets of copper that are 99.99% pure and are eventually transformed into everyday items. Copper oxide and copper sulfide are the two main types of ores found in the mining process. The copper ore mining market encompasses several countries, including Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Russia, South Korea, the UK, and the USA. These countries are involved in the extraction and production of copper ore.In 2022, the Asia-Pacific region emerged as the largest market for copper ore mining. The copper ore mining industry encompasses different types, such as the refining industry, metal processing industry, chemical industry, and other related sectors. The refining industry involves the production and delivery of oil and oil products. The global copper market is expected to witness substantial growth despite the short-term disruptions caused by the Russia-Ukraine war. The market is driven by the demand for copper in various industries, including construction, transportation, and electronics. While the ongoing conflict poses challenges, the overall outlook for the copper market remains positive, with the industry continuing to evolve and meet the demand for this versatile metal. Some of the companies that are at the forefront of copper production and could cash in on the expected boom for the metal in the long-term include Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX), Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO), and Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM).Our MethodologyFor this article, we selected mining stocks that have interests in the copper business based on overall hedge fund sentiment.

The firm also said that gold production was on track to grow by 40% from 2022 levels to 55K-60K oz/year beginning in 2024.On April 21, investment advisory Barclayes maintained an Equal Weight rating on Southern Copper Corporation (NYSE:SCCO) stock and raised the price target to $64 from $53, maintaining a preference for gold over other base equities in the macro environment. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Chicago-based investment firm Citadel Investment Group is a leading shareholder in Southern Copper Corporation (NYSE:SCCO) with 723,894 shares worth more than $55 million. 8. BHP Group (NYSE:BHP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 24   BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) is an Australian natural resources firm with interests in petroleum, copper, iron, and coal. The firm owns a copper mine in Chile, as well as other copper-related assets elsewhere. On May 30, the firm announced that it had partnered with Microsoft to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) technology to enhance the recovery process at a large copper mine.

The collaboration with Microsoft will involve utilizing their Azure cloud computing platform to analyze vast amounts of geological and operational data in real-time. On May 3, investment advisory Goldman Sachs upgraded BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) stock to Buy from Neutral with a price target of A$49.90, noting that the stock was attractively valued given the price drop since January. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Chicago-based investment firm Citadel Investment Group is a leading shareholder in BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) with 863,916 shares worth more than $54 million. In its Q1 2021 investor letter, Harding Loevner, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and BHP Group Ltd. (NYSE:BHP) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Our purchase of Australian mining company BHP Group Ltd. (NYSE:BHP) is an example of a quality company at a moderate valuation that should deliver attractive long-term returns. We believe the market has undervalued its enduring competitive advantage due to its low cost iron and copper mining operations which has allowed the company to deliver consistent profits and cash flows across the inevitable ups and downs of the global metals cycle. While the variability of commodity prices prevents BHP from scoring in the top ranks of measured quality, we are willing to bear some of that uncertainty in return for a more attractive valuation given the company’s strong business fundamentals.”7. Hudbay Minerals Inc. (NYSE:HBM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25     Hudbay Minerals Inc. (NYSE:HBM) operates in North and South America. The company has mined for precious metals in the Flin Flon area of Manitoba for over nine decades. The area has reserves of copper, zinc, gold, and silver.

The acquisition is expected to strengthen the position of the former in the copper mining sector and expand a portfolio of copper assets. The deal includes the acquisition of the Copper Mountain mine in British Columbia, Canada. The move is part of a wider strategy by Hudbay to enhance copper production and leverage the increasing demand for copper in various industries, including clean energy. On May 18, Stifel analyst Alex Terentiew resumed coverage of Hudbay Minerals Inc. (NYSE:HBM) stock with a Buy rating and a price target of C$10.70, predicting upside driven by higher copper and gold grades at Constancia over the next three years. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Atlanta-based investment firm GMT Capital is a leading shareholder in Hudbay Minerals Inc. (NYSE:HBM) with 30 million shares worth more than $161 million. 6. Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29    Vale S.A.

Click to skip ahead and see Billionaire Bridgewater Founder Ray Dalio’s Top 5 Holdings in 2023.McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) are three of the top holdings in billionaire money manager Ray Dalio’s consumer-focused 13F portfolio.Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates has been the most successful fund in history in terms of net dollar gains since inception, delivering $52.2 billion in gains through the end of 2021 according to research conducted by LCH Investments. The fund continued to roll last year even in the midst of Dalio stepping down in October, as the Pure Alpha strategy returned 9.5%.Bridgewater has undertaken several initiatives under new chief executive Nir Bar Dea, including slashing 8% of its workforce and capping investments in its flagship fund as it looks to reallocate resources and restructure. Among other things, Bar Dea plans to invest heavily in Bridgewater’s AI and machine learning capabilities.Meanwhile, Dalio continues to expand his family office, which manages the billionaire’s greater than $16 billion in personal wealth, as well as his philanthropic donations. The Dalio Family Office’s newest branch is planned for Abu Dhabi, where it will work alongside the firm’s existing branches in Singapore and the United States.Dalio gave the recently agreed-upon debt-ceiling deal a D grade in a tweet on Twitter, adding that it was about the best that could be expected but simply wasn’t good enough. In a LinkedIn post published in May, Dalio warned that the U.S. faces a disastrous financial collapse if it continues to raise the debt ceiling without any meaningful limit being put in place.Dalio also engaged in a recent conversation of sorts with the AI chat platform ChatGPT as he relayed in a YouTube video posted in the middle of April. ChatGPT wondered what the most important investing-related lesson is that Dalio learned throughout his storied career, to which the Bridgewater founder responded that diversification was the “Holy Grail” of investing. Dalio added that by investing in 10 to 15 good, uncorrelated assets, an investor can reduce their risk by about 80% without impacting their potential returns.Story continuesIn the first quarter, Bridgewater Associates made significant adjustments to its 13F portfolio, selling off 228 of its former holdings while adding just 118 new positions in their place. The firm also trimmed the size of far more holdings than it was adding to. Of particular note was Bridgewater’s exposure to the finance sector, which was lowered by 330 basis points to 23%. In response, Bridgewater’s exposure to healthcare and communications stocks was raised by a combined 371 basis points. Bridgewater’s 13F portfolio dropped to $16.4 billion in assets as of the end of March, down from $18.3 billion at the end of 2022.Amid a turbulent quarter, the first full one in which Nir Bar Dea was at the helm of Dalio’s iconic firm, let’s take a look at the top ten holdings of the fund in 2023.Billionaire Bridgewater Founder Ray Dalio’s Top 10 Holdings in 2023Ray Dalio of Bridgewater AssociatesOur MethodologyThe following data is gathered from Bridgewater Associates’ latest 13F filing with the SEC. We follow hedge funds like Bridgewater Associates because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q1 2023 reporting period.Billionaire Bridgewater Founder Ray Dalio’s Top 10 Holdings in 202310. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $223 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 174 The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are a few of the longtime favorite top holdings of Bridgewater founder and CIO Ray Dalio. A newer addition to a top 10 spot among his holdings is Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), after Dalio grew his stake in the company by nearly 150% during Q3 of 2022. In the first quarter of this year he boosted the size of his V stake by another 19%, ending Q1 with 990,819 shares.Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) has broadly outperformed the S&amp;P 500 over the last decade and could very well do so in the decade to come. The credit card payments processor is still growing revenue at a low-double digit rate and has several tailwinds at its back that could allow it to continue doing for the foreseeable future. Chief among those tailwinds are the continued rise in the global penetration of credit cards and ecommerce’s growing share of global sales. And both of those tailwinds have plenty of room to run yet. As such, Visa shares are currently trading at somewhat of a premium at 29.5x earnings.Polen Global Growth Strategy shared some of the fundamental strengths that Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) enjoys in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“We trimmed Mastercard and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) to equal weights of the Portfolio. Mastercard and Visa operate as a duopoly in a large and growing market. Over the last 50 years, global personal consumer expenditures (PCE) has grown 7-9% annualized. We expect 4-5% long-term PCE growth going forward. Additionally, the shift from cash to credit continues unabated, with a total credit penetration of only approximately 50% globally.3 This shift provides Visa and Mastercard with another ~4-6% of growth. When combined with PCE, this gives both companies high-single-digit to low-double[1]digit revenue growth opportunities. This growth estimate is before accounting for growth amplifiers like the acceleration of e[1]commerce, the shift from offline to online, and additional services. Both companies enjoy extremely strong network effects that provide strong competitive advantages.We have trimmed Visa and Mastercard because their combined weight grew to over 12% of the Global Growth Portfolio because of their recent performance and to fund our increase in Amazon’s position size. We added to both positions when their prices were depressed due to cross-border transactions deteriorating materially from the pandemic. Cross-border volumes came roaring back when travel corridors reopened, and although we are several quarters removed from the cross-border nadir, Visa still grew volumes &gt;30% in 1Q23. Total cross-border volumes are now 132% of 2019 levels. At 4.5% each, both companies remain high conviction positions for Global Growth.”9. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $239 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 204 (GOOG), 155 (GOOGL) Bridgewater CIO Ray Dalio was bullish on Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) during Q1 after shares hit a two-year low at the end of 2022. Dalio more than tripled the size of his stake in Alphabet’s class A (GOOGL) shares during the quarter, holding just under 2.31 million of them at the end of March. GOOGL shares are having a much better 2023 so far, gaining 37%.As Baron Opportunity Fund discusses below, one of the biggest worries investors have about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) right now is how its search engine traffic will hold up against the rise of ChatGPT, which has already had 1.6 billion visitors. When users want general information on certain topics, they may be increasingly likely to seek out quick answers from the AI platform rather than wade through pages of search results (and ads), which frequently contain links to outdated or even irrelevant content. While Google plans to eventually release its own competing AI platform, if anything that will just further cannibalize its own search engine and eat into its ad revenue.Baron Opportunity Fund continues to lower its exposure to Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) given some of those worries, as it revealed in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“As we did last quarter, we continued to decrease our weighting in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) because, as stated earlier, we believe ChatGPT and/or similar AI-based services present a hard-to-measure risk to Google’s virtual search monopoly.”8. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $259 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 69 There’s been a 23% rise in hedge fund ownership of Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) over the past two quarters, with the stock sitting near its all-time high in smart money shareholders. Bridgewater Associates pared back its SBUX holding by 5% during the first quarter to 2.49 million shares.Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) continues to expand its global footprint, with plans to grow its store count to 45,000 within the next two years, which would double its store count since 2015. Starbucks plans to open about one-third of those new stores in China, where it’s understandably been facing headwinds of late, but the long-term opportunity there is tremendous. SBUX shares have dipped by 13% since the company’s latest earnings report in early May, driving their price down to 32.2x earnings, which looks reasonable.The Polen Global Growth Strategy isn’t as bullish on Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) as Bridgewater’s Ray Dalio, as it sold off its stake in the company in Q4 according to its Q4 2022 investor letter:“We also liquidated our remaining position in Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX). While the company remains a unique and resilient franchise, China is a very important growth market for the company, and zero-COVID policies have made it challenging for the company to operate in this important market. While we expect China to return to more “normal” operation at some point, any COVID flare-ups, in China or other markets, present a very real headwind to Starbucks’ profitability. L’Oreal, Estée Lauder, and other holdings continue to have meaningful exposure to China, but in each of these cases, our research indicates they’re able to better adapt to these operating challenges and realize the growth opportunity in China through their online businesses. In short, we think there are better risk-reward opportunities.”7. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $394 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 92 There was a massive spike in hedge fund ownership of Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) during Q1, as 37% more funds were long WMT at the end of Q1 than at the start of it. Louis Bacon’s Moore Global Investments and George Soros’ Soros Fund Management were among the funds adding Walmart to their 13F portfolios. On the other hand, Bridgewater’s Ray Dalio offloaded 22% of his Walmart shares during the quarter, ending March with 2.67 million of them.Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) grew e-commerce sales by 26% during the first quarter of its fiscal year 2024, while overall sales rose by 7.7% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Operating cash flow also rebounded to $4.6 billion in the quarter from a loss of $3.8 billion a year earlier.After buying back about $10 billion worth of its shares in FY 2023, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) scaled back to just $700 million in repurchases in the latest quarter. The company still has $18.6 billion remaining on its share repurchase authorization, which would buy back close to 5% of its outstanding shares.6. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $428 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 63 Closing out the first half of Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio’s top holdings in 2023 is Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), ranking sixth. The billionaire money manager trimmed his stake in the wholesale retailer by 9% during Q1, ending the quarter with 861,306 shares. He owned the largest COST position among the select group of hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey’s database.Hedge funds and analysts love Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) for its staunchly loyal customer base and its strong value proposition. Truist has a $568 price target on the stock and believes the tougher economic conditions will allow Costco to further grow its membership and gain market share. Deutsche Bank has a $574 target on COST shares.Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) has been experiencing some weakness in its discretionary categories, which led to soft March sales and negative comps for the first time in nearly seven years, excluding the pandemic. It’s likely that weakness was felt broadly across retail however and wasn’t Costco specific. Overall March sales grew by 0.5% to $21.7 billion.PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) are three of Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio’s top 2023 holdings.

See our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Independent Director, Arthur Ryan, sold US$4.3m worth of shares at a price of US$622 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$750). We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. We note that the biggest single sale was only 26% of Arthur Ryan's holding.

365,6f76af7b-4724-3e27-861a-5d91b175fcb7,UNP,2023-06-06,A Closer Look At Union Pacific Corporation's (NYSE:UNP) Impressive ROE,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/closer-look-union-pacific-corporations-140026035.html,1685973626,STORY,['UNP'],"[While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. We'll use ROE to examine Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), by way of a worked example.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. View our latest analysis for Union Pacific How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Union Pacific is:56% = US$7.0b ÷ US$12b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.56 in profit.Does Union Pacific Have A Good ROE?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Union Pacific has a better ROE than the average (21%) in the Transportation industry.roeThat's what we like to see. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk.How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesUnion Pacific's Debt And Its 56% ROEUnion Pacific does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 2.70. Its ROE is pretty impressive but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.SummaryReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.Of course Union Pacific may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have high ROE and low debt.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

366,3c4f17c5-c861-37bc-b183-42c873aae6c4,DGX,2023-06-06,Should You Think About Buying Quest Diagnostics Incorporated (NYSE:DGX) Now?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/think-buying-quest-diagnostics-incorporated-153445535.html,1685979285,STORY,['DGX'],"[Let's talk about the popular Quest Diagnostics Incorporated (NYSE:DGX). The company's shares saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$147 and falling to the lows of US$131. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Quest Diagnostics' current trading price of US$136 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Quest Diagnostics’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for Quest Diagnostics What Is Quest Diagnostics Worth?According to my price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average, the stock price seems to be justfied. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 19.24x is currently trading slightly below its industry peers’ ratio of 22.51x, which means if you buy Quest Diagnostics today, you’d be paying a decent price for it. And if you believe Quest Diagnostics should be trading in this range, then there isn’t much room for the share price to grow beyond the levels of other industry peers over the long-term. Furthermore, Quest Diagnostics’s share price also seems relatively stable compared to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. This may mean it is less likely for the stock to fall lower from natural market volatility, which suggests less opportunities to buy moving forward.What kind of growth will Quest Diagnostics generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 36% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Quest Diagnostics. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in DGX’s positive outlook, with shares trading around industry price multiples. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at DGX? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below the industry PE ratio?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on DGX, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around industry price multiples. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for DGX, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

368,96fa684a-4d27-3039-a079-0ed94c3c3487,CSCO,2023-06-06,A Unique Way To Play The Coming $700 Billion Electric Vehicle Boom,Oilprice.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unique-way-play-coming-700-230100971.html,1686006060,STORY,"['AMD', 'VMAR', 'AAPL', 'SHOP', 'CSCO', 'MSFT', 'AMZN', 'IBM', 'GOOGL', 'NVDA', 'AMAT', 'META']","[The global electric vehicle market is a crowded space valued at nearly $194 billion in 2022 and set to reach an astounding $694 billion by 2030.Now it’s time to find more unique opportunities as many of these smaller car manufacturers find the market being overtaken by the traditional auto giants like Ford, Chevy and GM.Opportunity abounds, but phenomenal cash burn and a slower path to profitability have rendered this crowded space rather risky.But the EV market isn’t just about the roadways …The waterways are going electric, too, and the playing field is much less chaotic, with the clear first-mover advantage going to Vision Marine Technologies (NASDAQ:VMAR), with its proprietary PowerTrain outboard motor and the launch of the fastest electric speedboat in its class on the market.The electric boat market is set to grow at a CAGR of nearly 13%. By 2030, this market will be worth almost $15 billion, and it's much easier to navigate.As we speak, the multi-billion-dollar boat battery market is undergoing its biggest transition since the invention of the boat motor itself.And VMAR has successfully developed the world’s most powerful marine electric motor, with proprietary technology. First revenues from the PowerTrain are coming this year, along with a second revenue chain in the form of a disruption to the boat rental market.Sailing legend Ian Bruce is behind VMAR, and unique among EV offerings, the company has zero debt and is positioned to be free-cash-flow positive in 2024.That’s a good starting point for an electrified market that has few (if any) players who aren’t burning cash at an untenable rate.The Proprietary Tech Powering Clean BoatingThe newly unveiled H2e Bowrider speed boat took the Paris Boat Show by storm in December, and made its official debut in February in Miami, with deliveries to start this summer.The boat, developed in partnership with Four Winns, is special because it showcases VMAR’s E-Motion 180 HP electric outboard motor.Story continuesThat motor, with proprietary PowerTrain technology, makes the H2e Bowrider the first all-electric series production bowrider on the market.The E-Motion is the first fully electric, production-ready, high-performance 180 HP, which makes it the key market disruptor. With its proprietary technology, which includes the batteries, the engine and the software, Vision Marine’s E-Motion is now the only turn-key solution for boat manufacturers in its class. That’s a strong first-mover position to be in at the critical junction of a high-dollar energy transition.Vision Marine’s (NASDAQ:VMAR) E-Motion fully charges overnight with no additional infrastructure, has the highest horsepower engine in its class on the market, offers the first-ever custom design marine battery packs, and it all comes in at a lower cost than any competitors:Now, it’s all about capturing market share, and that’s where it gets interesting.How close are they? Well, the plan is to market the E-Motion Powertrain to Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) rather than the public, and they have already received hundreds of advance orders.And investors will get to see the first revenues from PowerTrain this year already.Flipping the Switch on the Boat Rental MarketVMAR has a broader vision beyond the most powerful outboard electric motor in its class, too: They also plan to flip the boat rental market and turn it electric.That $5-billion+ boat rental market (think: thousands of resorts and marinas worldwide) is ripe for flipping, and VMAR’s flagship Newport business managed to serve 300,000 clients in the first three years, annualizing $4 million in revenues with a 35% profit margin.For 2023, Vision Marine will be rolling out two more fully-owned electric boat rental locations and launching their franchise model. By 2024, it’s full speed ahead with scaling.The company’s proprietary technology gives it the opportunity to become one of the NASDAQ’s most exciting EV plays.By the end of 2024, Vision Marine expects to free-cash-flow positive, and by 2025, it expects to have two profitable and growing divisions, after which the scaling is expected to gain further momentum.Zero Debt at a Time of Serious Electric Cash-BurnThis summer should be interesting on the water.Vision Marine (NASDAQ:VMAR) not only has developed the most powerful electric motor solution on the recreational boating market, but it’s also a member of an elite club in this segment that has proprietary technology, zero debt and clear growth runways.With investors pouring money into anything electric in the wake of a major European push for zero-carbon and the Biden administration’s clean energy-friendly Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), a company that has already staked its claim on the market with a proprietary tech product and is going into its first major expansion push with zero debt has more than just first-mover advantage.Other tech companies investors should also be taking a look at:Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT): Applied Materials is an often overlooked powerhouse in the chip manufacturing and research industry. As a leading chip fabrication equipment maker, the company designs, manufactures, and sells complex machinery utilized by chip fabs - factories dedicated to semiconductor production. The company is currently the largest chip fab equipment provider in the sector and recently announced its plans to invest up to $4 billion over seven years in the creation of the EPIC Center—a facility aimed at testing new semiconductor technology and fostering collaboration across the industry. Notable partners expressing excitement about this initiative include Nvidia, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, AMD, Intel, and prominent universities such as MIT.While many chip stocks have experienced significant price surges, Applied Materials has not skyrocketed to the same extent. As of now, its shares trade at a modest 18 times trailing-12-month earnings per share (EPS). Although chip fab equipment spending has slowed this year due to economic uncertainties, Applied Materials has adapted by focusing on high-growth segments such as chip fabs for electric vehicles and industrial technology. In its most recent quarter, the company reported a 6% increase in revenue and a 7% rise in EPS year over year.Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL): Regardless of its recent slowdown in revenue growth, Alphabet has seen its shares rise by 40% in 2023, indicating positive market sentiment. The latest data shows that Google Search commands an impressive 92.8% share of the market while Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is gaining traction, outpacing competitors like Amazon Web Services in revenue growth. With a diverse client base and the potential for increased profitability, GCP is poised for further success in the expanding cloud market. Alphabet's culture of innovation, demonstrated by its integration of AI into various products and ventures like Waymo's autonomous driving, ensures the company remains at the forefront of technological advancements.Alphabet's strong financials, including substantial free cash flow and a robust balance sheet, limit downside risks despite global economic uncertainty. With multiple growth drivers, such as digital advertising, cloud infrastructure, and streaming services, Alphabet's diversified revenue streams provide a solid foundation for future growth. Its shares are currently trading at approximately 17 times its projected earnings in 2024, a price that looks attractive with its projected annual increase of over 16% in per-share profits over the next five years.Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL): With a market capitalization of $2.8 trillion, Apple is Berkshire Hathaway's largest equity holding. Its services segment, which includes offerings like Apple Music, Apple Pay, and Apple TV+, has been experiencing remarkable growth, with revenue totaling $20.9 billion in the most recent fiscal quarter. This burgeoning services segment not only benefits Apple's financials with its impressive gross margin of 71%, but it also contributes to the company's customer loyalty. The seamless integration of Apple's hardware and software ecosystem, coupled with its vast user base of over 2 billion active Apple devices, fosters a sense of stickiness among consumers, making it challenging for them to switch to competing platforms.Another compelling aspect of Apple is its proven pricing power, a hallmark of successful companies. Apple has consistently raised prices for its flagship product, the iPhone, without any significant impact on demand. This has helped the company’s remarkable growth in its gross margin, expanding from 38.5% in fiscal 2017 to 43.3% in fiscal 2022. Additionally, Apple generates substantial free cash flow, amounting to a staggering $111 billion in fiscal 2022. This enables the company to return capital to shareholders through share repurchases and a dividend yield of 0.5%. As a long-term holding, there are few companies as compelling as this tech giant.Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN): Amazon's recent first-quarter earnings report revealed impressive revenue figures, surpassing expectations and highlighting a compelling investment opportunity. With a commanding 38% share of online retail shopping in the U.S., Amazon remains the dominant force in e-commerce, bolstered by its unparalleled logistics and distribution capabilities. Additionally, Amazon Web Services (AWS), holding a substantial 32% share of the cloud infrastructure industry, continues to benefit from the growing demand for on-demand cloud environments.AWS's remarkable operating margin of 28% contributes significantly to Amazon's profitability, setting the stage for future expansion. Furthermore, Amazon's digital ads business witnessed strong growth, recording a 23% increase in sales in the first quarter, solidifying its position as a formidable player in the advertising space. With strategic investments in artificial intelligence, exemplified by the launch of Bedrock within AWS in April, Amazon is well-positioned to leverage emerging technologies. Currently trading at an attractive valuation, with shares down 34% from their 2021 peak, Amazon presents an enticing opportunity for investors seeking a dominant market leader with multiple growth drivers and a focus on AI initiatives.Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META): This social media giant has seen its shares soar by nearly 120% in 2023, but the stock is still down 31% from its all-time high. The company exceeded Wall Street's expectations in the first quarter of 2023 and, despite already being a dominant organization, it continues to experience growth, with 3.81 billion monthly active people across its Family of Apps. The opportunity to monetize users outside the U.S. and Canada provides the potential for further revenue growth over time.Reports suggest that Meta may be developing a decentralized alternative to Twitter. Furthermore, the company is heavily focused on leveraging artificial intelligence to enhance content recommendations, boost monetization, and optimize its data infrastructure. These efforts position Meta well for the upcoming technological shifts. Meta's profitability is also worth noting. Over the past five years, the company has maintained an average operating margin of 36.2%, generating substantial free cash flow amounting to $18.4 billion in 2022. This enabled the management team to repurchase $27.9 billion worth of shares last year. With $37 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities on its balance sheet and long-term debt of $10 billion as of March 31, Meta enjoys a solid financial position.IBM (NYSE: IBM): This tech giant has demonstrated resilience in its sales growth despite a challenging environment, yet its stock has declined by around 10% so far this year. The company’s restructuring efforts, including the divestment of its managed infrastructure services segment and the subsequent creation of three simplified segments—Software, Consulting, and Infrastructure—aim to streamline operations and drive future growth. IBM's constant-currency revenue growth rates have shown improvement this year, indicating a narrowing gap between reported and constant-currency growth rates.One major area of optimism lies in IBM's cloud business, which is leveraging its subsidiary Red Hat to expand its cloud ecosystem. With a hybrid cloud approach that capitalizes on Red Hat's open-source software, IBM is able to benefit from the cloud market's growth without directly competing against dominant platforms like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. Coupled with its expanding portfolio of AI services, IBM is well-positioned for long-term growth. Furthermore, the company's improving margins and rising cash flows, driven by cost-cutting measures and strategic layoffs, provide ample resources for investments in the hybrid cloud and AI sectors.Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT): With a market cap of $2.3 trillion, just behind Apple, Microsoft's renowned brands such as Windows, Office, Xbox, and LinkedIn have secured leading market shares across various tech sectors. This dominance has translated into remarkable stock growth, with shares surging over 800% in the past decade. The company's recent foray into artificial intelligence (AI) has only strengthened its investment appeal. Microsoft's early $1 billion investment in OpenAI has proven prescient, as the AI race unfolds, and competitors scramble to enter the burgeoning market. A subsequent $10 billion investment in OpenAI this year has solidified Microsoft's position as a leader. Integrating OpenAI's technologies across its platforms, including Office, Azure, and Bing, Microsoft has established itself as a go-to provider of AI services. Collaborations with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) in AI chip development further exemplify Microsoft's dedication to the field, ensuring optimal performance and effective AI offerings.In addition to AI, Microsoft has made significant strides in the gaming industry. Despite initial challenges competing against industry giants like Sony and Nintendo, Microsoft found success with the introduction of Xbox Game Pass in 2017. The subscription-based service offers access to a vast library of games, attracting millions of subscribers and transforming the Xbox console into a cost-effective option. The platform's popularity has driven Microsoft's acquisition of prominent game studios to enhance its Game Pass offerings.Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ: CSCO): Cisco Systems is a networking giant that develops, manufactures, and sells networking hardware, telecoms equipment, and other IT services and products. With $23.3 billion in cash and equivalents plus short-term investments, Cisco has the resources for potential acquisitions - an area that could heat up in the second half of 2023. The company is also well-positioned for long-term growth driven by the increasing usage of artificial intelligence software and its focus on shifting towards subscription-based software and services.Cisco has shown a decent performance in 2023 so far, with a year-to-date rise of around 10%. Although it has lagged behind the broader Nasdaq-100, which saw a 20% increase over the same period, the growth in the company's core networking business and improved supply chain conditions contributed to the positive performance. Cisco has also revised its full-year guidance, anticipating sales growth between 9% and 10.5%, compared to the previous range of 4% to 6%. The company has observed strong new orders, particularly from the commercial and enterprise sectors, with robust demand in the public sector. With a 3% dividend yield, the risk is limited and Cisco is seen by many investors as a strong long-term hold.Shopify (NYSE: SHOP): Despite experiencing a dip in its stock value in 2022 due to macroeconomic conditions, the company has shown signs of recovery and is poised for brighter days ahead. In the first quarter of 2023, Shopify reported impressive financial figures, with $1.5 billion in revenue and $116 million in monthly recurring revenue (MRR), marking a year-over-year increase of 25% and 10%, respectively. MRR is particularly significant for subscription-based businesses like Shopify as it provides a stable and predictable revenue stream.The company's strategic decision to streamline its focus on its core e-commerce software offerings should put it in good stead going forward. By refocusing on its software expertise, Shopify will look to enhance its gross profit margin and allocate resources more efficiently. As a software company at its core, Shopify recognizes that its primary value lies in providing top-notch e-commerce solutions rather than attempting to compete in the challenging logistics industry. With a solid track record and a renewed focus on e-commerce software, Shopify has the potential to deliver substantial value to investors in the long run.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD): AMD presents a compelling case for investors seeking exposure to the semiconductor industry. While Nvidia dominates the industry, AMD could be a less risky investment option while still providing significant upside potential. The company has the potential to continue capturing market share from Intel in the CPU markets for computers and servers while also challenging Nvidia in the artificial intelligence space.Another promising aspect of AMD's prospects is its partnership with Microsoft, which is actively purchasing the company's AI-focused MI250 chipset and collaborating on future endeavors. AMD is set to launch its MI300 accelerator processing unit later this year, expected to deliver a significant leap in performance for its data center customers. Similar to Nvidia, AMD is in the early stages of benefiting from AI-driven demand, but it still maintains a considerable discount compared to its previous high. The company's potential for continued market share gains, positive demand catalysts, and partnerships in the AI space positions it favorably for future growth.By.

Due to fluctuating market conditions, analysts recommend dividend-paying stocks to stay afloat. Ford Donohue, a financial advisor at Homrich Berg, spoke with Fortune in May to emphasize the importance of dividend-growing companies. Here are some comments from the analyst:Story continues“A diversified portfolio of dividend-growing stocks provides income in the form of dividends that should grow over time to offset the impact of inflation. We also believe that consistent dividend growth is a sign of a sound business model, balance sheet strength, and strong corporate governance, all of which should lead to the growth of the underlying business over time and increase the chances of capital appreciation of the stock.”Some of the best tech stocks like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon.com, Inc.

Sustainability 101 is a blog series that you can turn to for information about different environmental terms that may come up at work, during discussions with friends, and even at your annual holiday gathering.""It's possible to reach net-zero carbon emissions. Here's how"" 1""UN tells governments to ‘fast forward' net zero targets"" 2These are just a few of many headlines from 2023 so far that center around the concept of ""net zero."" You may hear the phrase frequently in the context of climate change and global warming, but do you know the intricacies behind it?According to the United Nations (UN) Climate Action website, net zero ""means cutting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to as close to zero as possible, with any remaining emissions re-absorbed from the atmosphere, by oceans and forests for instance.""Similarly, the World Resources Institute (WRI) says net zero ""will be achieved when all emissions released by human activities are counterbalanced by removing carbon from the atmosphere in a process known as carbon removal.""Simply put, it is a state where emissions are balanced with an equal amount of GHG removal.Why has net zero become such a commonly used term? Because our future depends on it. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), ""climate-related risks to health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security, and economic growth are projected to increase with global warming of 1.5°C"" [compared to pre-industrial levels]. To stay below that temperature threshold, global emissions must decline by about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050.Achieving a state of net zero requires a two-part approach, according to WRI:Story continuesReduce human-caused emissions, such as those from fossil-fueled vehicles and factories, as close to zero as possible.Remove any remaining emissions by balancing those with an equivalent amount of carbon removal from the atmosphere.How can we reduce human-caused emissions?According to the UN's Climate Action website, burning fossil fuels - think coal, natural gas, and oil - to generate power, manufacture goods, and fuel transportation accounts for over 75 percent of global GHG emissions and nearly 90 percent of all carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.Some other activities that create emissions include: deforestation or wildfires (because trees absorb carbon from the atmosphere during their lifespan and release it when they are destroyed) and non-sustainable food production, which releases large amounts of CO2, methane, and other GHGs into the atmosphere. (You can read more about GHG emissions sources in our previous Sustainability 101 blog.)Actions that can reduce GHG emissions, according to the WRI, include:Shifting to electric vehiclesTransitioning to clean, renewable energy from sources like wind and solarIncreasing public transportation, biking, and walkingRetrofitting buildings and improving energy efficiencyReducing food loss and wasteHow can we remove carbon from the atmosphere?Carbon removal can either be nature based or technology based. Common examples of nature-based removal projects are afforestation (planting new trees to create a forest) or reforestation (replanting trees where they previously existed) - because trees absorb CO2 through photosynthesis. Protecting and restoring other natural ecosystems, such as peatlands, coastal wetlands, savannas and grasslands, can contribute to carbon sequestration as well.A number of technology-based carbon removal solutions are in various stages of development. One is direct air capture - the process of ""chemically scrubbing CO2 from the ambient air and then sequestering it either underground or in long-lived products like concrete,"" according to the WRI.Another example that is in the demonstration phase according to the IPCC is a process known as ""bioenergy with carbon capture and storage"" (BECCS). Atmospheric CO2 is absorbed by plants and trees as they grow, and then the plant material (biomass) is burned to produce energy. The CO2 released in the production of this energy is then captured before it reaches the atmosphere and stored in geological formations deep underground on long time scales. This allows us to produce energy without adding additional GHGs to our atmosphere.What actions are organizations taking?Given the dire warnings from the IPCC and other scientific organizations, many companies, countries, and even individual cities are setting their own goals to reach net zero. According to Net Zero Tracker, as of 2023, more than 900 companies and 130 countries have set targetsIn November 2022, a UN High-Level Expert Group issued a report that ""set tight definitions for what it means to be net zero and net zero-aligned"" for corporations, financial institutions, and local and regional governments. The report identified five principles for these ""non-state"" entities to set net zero goals:Ambition which delivers significant near- and medium-term emissions reductions on a path to global net zero by 2050Demonstrated integrity by aligning commitments with actions and investmentsRadical transparency in sharing relevant, non-competitive, comparable data on plans and progressEstablished credibility through plans based in science and third-party accountabilityDemonstrable commitment to both equity and justice in all actionsOne organization offering third-party accountability on corporate net zero goals is the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), a partnership between CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project), the UN Global Compact (UNGC), WRI and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).In October 2021, the SBTi established its Net-Zero Standard, the world's first framework for corporate net zero target setting in line with climate science. Cisco was among the first technology hardware and equipment companies to have its net-zero goal and near-term targets validated under the SBTi Net-Zero Standard. SBTi validation requires companies to reduce emissions across their value chains by at least 90 percent. Companies with SBTi validation can use offsets for no more than 10 percent of their emissions reduction. According to the SBTi, a company is only considered to have reached net zero when it has achieved its long-term science-based target and neutralized any residual emissions.Learn more about Cisco's goal to reach net zero GHG emissions across our value chain by 2040 on cisco.com and our environmental, social, and governance (ESG) Reporting Hub.Willing to learn and engage more on environmental sustainability?
