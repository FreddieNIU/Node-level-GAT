It has amassed assets over $11.62 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap ValueCompanies that find themselves in the large cap category typically have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Overall, they are usually a stable option, with less risk and more sure-fire cash flows than mid and small cap companies.Carrying lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, value stocks also have lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. When you look at long-term performance, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in nearly all markets. But in strong bull markets, growth stocks are more likely to be winners.CostsExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts, other things remaining the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.25%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.92%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 18.50% of the portfolio. Financials and Healthcare round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 4.47% of total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT) and Berkshire Hathaway Inc Class B (BRKB).The top 10 holdings account for about 20.13% of total assets under management.Story continuesPerformance and RiskFNDX seeks to match the performance of the Russell RAFI US Large Co. Index before fees and expenses. The Russell RAFI US Large Company Index measures the performance of the large company size segment by fundamental overall company scores.The ETF return is roughly 9.78% so far this year and is up about 15.83% in the last one year (as of 07/13/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $47.76 and $58.13.The ETF has a beta of 1 and standard deviation of 17.21% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 735 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab Fundamental U.S. Large Company Index ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, FNDX is a sufficient option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Value area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.The iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD) and the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV) track a similar index. While iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF has $51.45 billion in assets, Vanguard Value ETF has $100.02 billion. IWD has an expense ratio of 0.18% and VTV charges 0.04%.Bottom-LineRetail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Its revenues and earnings in the quarter are expected to have declined on a year-over-year basis.In the first quarter of 2023, Schwab’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results benefited from higher rates, which led to a rise in net interest income. Also, the absence of fee waivers and solid brokerage account numbers acted as tailwinds. However, higher expenses created a headwind.The company has an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three and missed in one of the trailing four quarters.The Charles Schwab Corporation Price and EPS Surprise The Charles Schwab Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseThe Charles Schwab Corporation price-eps-surprise | The Charles Schwab Corporation QuoteSchwab’s activities in the to-be-reported quarter did not encourage analysts to revise earnings estimates upward. In the past seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for SCHW’s second-quarter earnings has been revised 2.6% lower to 74 cents per share. The estimate indicates a decline of 23.7% from the year-ago quarter’s reported number. Our estimate for second-quarter earnings is pinned at 87 cents.The consensus estimate for sales is pegged at $4.61 billion, which indicates a fall of 9.6% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. Our estimate for total revenues is $4.59 billion, indicating a year-over-year decline of 10%.SCHW also expects second-quarter revenues to witness a year-over-year decline of 10-11% because of margin compression, a smaller interest-earning asset base and softer trading activity.Before we take a look at what our quantitative model predicts, let’s check the factors that are likely to have impacted Schwab’s second-quarter performance.Key Factors &amp; Estimates for Q2Market volatility and client activity were subdued in the second quarter due to the Congressional debate over the debt ceiling. Also, the risks of an economic downturn/recession, the central banks’ hawkish monetary policy stance to stem out “sticky” inflation and geopolitical concerns led to ambiguity among investors.These factors resulted in lower volatility in equity markets and other asset classes, including commodities, bonds and foreign exchange.While investors did seem somewhat interested in entering the markets (in April and May, SCHW opened 331,000 and 314,000 new brokerage accounts, respectively), Schwab’s trading performance is expected to have been impacted because of lower volatility and subdued client activity.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter trading revenues is pegged at $800 million, which suggests a decline of 9.6% from the prior-year quarter’s reported number. Our estimate for trading revenues is pinned at $733.7 million, indicating a decline of 17.1%.The consensus estimate for asset management and administration fees of $1.15 billion implies a rise of 9.3% from the prior-year quarter’s reported number.Then, the consensus estimate for average interest-earning assets for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $506 billion, which suggests a decline of 18.9% from the prior-year quarter’s reported level.While the Federal Reserve continued to tighten its monetary policy in the second quarter, raising interest rates by another 25 basis points, SCHW’s interest income is not expected to have improved much because of weaker loan demand. Moreover, the inversion of the yield curve and rising funding costs are expected to have weighed on net interest margin (NIM) to some extent.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter net interest revenues is pegged at $2.35 billion, which indicates a year-over-year decline of 7.8%.SCHW’s chief financial officer, Peter Crawford, said that the company’s second-quarter NIM is expected to contract 35 basis points sequentially.Coming to expenses, Schwab’s operating expenses have been elevated in the past few quarters. Due to the persistent regulatory spending and strategic buyouts to drive efficiency, overall expenses are expected to have been high in the to-be-reported quarter. We project total expenses of $2.55 billion.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsAccording to our quantitative model, the chances of Schwab beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings this time are low. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: The Earnings ESP for Schwab is -2.39%.Zacks Rank: The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Stocks Worth a LookA few finance stocks, which you may want to consider, as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases per our model, are Wells Fargo WFC and PNC Financial PNC.The Earnings ESP for Wells Fargo is +0.16% and it carries a Zacks Rank #3 at present.

Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Charles Schwab The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Charles SchwabOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Founder &amp; Co-Chairman, Charles Schwab, for US$25m worth of shares, at about US$80.10 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$57.58). So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.Happily, we note that in the last year insiders paid US$7.9m for 135.84k shares. But they sold 1.72m shares for US$130m. Over the last year we saw more insider selling of Charles Schwab shares, than buying. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeI will like Charles Schwab better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insider OwnershipAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Charles Schwab insiders own 1.4% of the company, currently worth about US$1.5b based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Charles Schwab Insiders?The fact that there have been no Charles Schwab insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. While we feel good about high insider ownership of Charles Schwab, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. Therefore, you should definitely take a look at this FREE report showing analyst forecasts for Charles Schwab.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

But striking the right chord each time is not easy unless blessed with Midas touch. When it comes to the investment market, experts consider value style as one of the most effective approaches. Value investing is essentially about selecting stocks that have good things going on for them, even at a time when they have been beaten down by some external factors.There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock’s inherent strength but a random selection of ratios cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company’s financial position. For this, we recommend Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) as one of the key metrics. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis — the lower the number, the better. G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. GIII, StoneCo Ltd. STNE, Unum Group UNM and Magna International Inc. MGA boast a low P/CF ratio.Price to Cash Flow Reveals Financial HealthQuestions may arise as to why we are considering the Price to Cash Flow valuation metric, when the most widely used metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E). Well, what makes P/CF stand out is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly reflecting the financial health of a company.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. It is net cash flow that reveals how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is putting the same to use.A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company’s liquid assets. This gives the company the means to settle debt, shell out for its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Then again, a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.Story continuesWhat’s the Best Strategy?An investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and also consider the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.Here are the parameters for selecting true value stocks:P/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.P/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to their peers.P/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.P/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company’s sales — the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.PEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospects.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.Here are four of the eight stocks that qualified the screening.G-III Apparel, which designs, sources, and markets women's and men's apparel, sports a Zacks Rank #1.

10,2916bc2d-1df7-30dd-b3a3-909bc7b9425d,UNM,2023-07-13,5 Low Price-to-Book Stocks Worth Buying in July,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-low-price-book-stocks-113800042.html,1689161880,STORY,"['MG.TO', 'UNM', 'PGRE', 'MGA', 'STNE']","[When evaluating a company’s value, investors mostly look at a stock’s price-to-earnings (P/E) or price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio. While P/E is the ratio of annual earnings to stock price, P/S reflects the amount investors pay for each dollar of revenues generated by the company.Though P/E and P/S valuation tools are more commonly used for stock selection, the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) is also an easy-to-use metric for identifying low-priced stocks with high-growth prospects.P/B is the ratio of stock price to book valueIt is calculated as below:P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equityThe P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks that have high growth prospects. Magna International MGA, Paramount Group PGRE, Unum Group UNM, StoneCo Ltd. STNE and Varex Imaging Corporation VREX are some such stocks.Now let us understand the concept of book value.Understanding Book Value?Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.A P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and, therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.Story continuesFor example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses — like finance, investments, insurance, and banking or manufacturing companies — with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&amp;D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share — a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.PEG less than 1: PEG links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospects.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are our five picks out of the nine stocks that qualified the screening:Based in Aurora, Canada, Magna International is a manufacturer and supplier of complete automotive components. The company designs, develops and manufactures automotive systems, assemblies, modules and components, apart from engineering and assembling complete vehicles, primarily for sale to original equipment manufacturers of cars and light trucks.Magna International has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Value Score of A.

That’s good news for savers, but bad news for lenders as they prepare to release their second-quarter results.US banks spent the last several months competing with each other to keep or bring back depositors following the turmoil that took down three sizable regional institutions and triggered outflows across the banking system.That scramble pushed rates on savings accounts to 5.05% at the end of the second quarter, according to Bankrate, their steepest level since February 2008.Read more: The best high-yield savings account rates for July 2023The challenge for banks across the US is that these higher funding costs are eating into a key measure of profitability known as net interest margin, which measures the difference between what lenders make from their loans and what they pay for their deposits.That will likely act as a drag on results for some banks in the quarter, especially the mid-sized regional institutions that ran into trouble last spring, while reducing estimates of what they can earn for the rest of the year.“The surprises this quarter will be for the banks that do not lower expectations,” Wells Fargo bank analyst Mike Mayo told Yahoo Finance.Banks, added Argus Research's Stephen Biggar, ""have a deposit conundrum.""'Green shoots'?These pressures will be at the front of mind for investors starting Friday as they digest the first set of second quarter earnings from JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), and State Street (STT).Bank of America (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS) report next Tuesday and Goldman Sachs (GS) next Wednesday. A slew of other regional banks will also report in the coming weeks.Some of the biggest US banks are expected to once again demonstrate their resilience and diversity, showing they can continue to charge more for their loans while leaning on their sprawling franchises to generate additional revenue.Story continuesJPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America are all expected to show jumps in net income when compared to the year-earlier period, according to analyst estimates, while Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley are expected to report profit declines.JPMorgan's headquarters in New York City. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File)Those that are more dependent on investment banking, such as Goldman, are expected to be particularly challenged by a recent drought in deal making.Global investment banking revenues for the second quarter fell by 8% from the first quarter and 52% from a year ago, according to Dealogic. However, the business improved through the second half of the quarter, prompting some observers to predict “green shoots” ahead.“I’m turning to believing investment banking will not have great earnings but they’re going to be surprising, and I think better than expected,” said Dick Bove, a bank analyst with Odeon Capital.Investors will also be watching to see whether many of these big banks increase the amounts they set aside for future loan losses, a sign that they expect the US economy and credit conditions to worsen.“We're starting to see some increased delinquencies, particularly in the credit card and auto lending market,” said Biggar, Argus Research's director of financial services.'A huge amount of problems'Smaller regional banks are clearly not under the same amount of pressure as they were in March, when the fall of Silicon Valley Bank triggered panic across the country.But they still “face a huge amount of problems,” Bove said.The core issue is an aggressive campaign by the Federal Reserve to bring down inflation with higher interest rates. That campaign is lowering the value of the assets banks hold, such as bonds, while deposit costs creep higher and loan demand slows.Read more: Why now is a good time to open a savings account“We view accelerating deposit costs, not accelerating deposit outflows, as the most significant headwind to earnings for the next several quarters,“ Manan Gosalia, a regional bank analyst for Morgan Stanley, said in a research note.Higher rates have traditionally worked to the advantage of banks since it allows them to charge more for their loans than their deposits.But the panic of the spring “has changed the calculus a bit” for some banks, the Fed’s vice chair of supervision Michael Barr said Monday. Some lenders “are now paying up more for deposits,” and the Fed is “paying careful attention to that.”Silicon Valley Bank was seized on March 10. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File)The Fed has made it clear that more hikes are coming this year. Regulators are also preparing new capital requirements for banks with more than $100 billion in assets that will force some to hold greater buffers against losses. That will increase the stability of those lenders but will also make it even more difficult to earn robust profits in the near term.Many banks have already warned at a conference in June that their net interest margins are going to drop by more than they expected for the quarter or the year, including executives for US Bancorp (USB), Citizens Financial Group (CFG), Comerica (CMA), Huntington (HBAN), KeyCorp (KEY), and Zions (ZION).“I’ve only been a banker for 10 years, so I haven’t seen a time when we’ve needed deposits as an industry as much as we do now,” Darrin Williams, the CEO of the 58-branch Southern Bancorp, told Yahoo Finance.The amount Southern Bancorp is paying customers has risen 600% since the Fed’s interest rate hiking cycle began, Williams added.“Our cost of funds continues to rise just because our customers demand that.”The larger banks aren’t immune to some of these same challenges.“Deposits will continue the trend of being slightly down from here,” Jennifer Piepszak, co-CEO of JPMorgan Chase's massive consumer and community bank, said at a conference in June.The bank has predicted it will earn net interest income of $84 billion in 2023, but if the deposit pressure keeps up, that figure could experience a “mild reprice,” she said.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of popular hedge funds and their performance, head directly to 5 Most Owned Stocks by Hedge Funds. In 2022, the hedge fund industry experienced a decline of 2.4%, showing some improvement from a challenging first half of the year when the industry was down 4.6%. The losses were primarily influenced by the difficult market circumstances for high-risk assets, particularly impacting hedge funds with a long-biased approach and/or higher volatility. This marked the weakest performance for the hedge fund industry since 2018 when it also posted a 2.4% loss. Looking at the five-year performance, hedge funds have achieved a compounded annual return of +4.2%, demonstrating a more favorable performance compared to bonds, which experienced a decline of 2.0%. Aurum, a hedge fund investment specialist, noted that there were clear winners and losers in the hedge fund industry in 2022. The best-performing strategies were multi-strategy (+9.5%), quant (+8.5%), and macro (+6.7%). Strategies that typically have a higher correlation to equities and fixed income, which experienced poor performance, struggled the most. Patrick Ghali, managing partner of hedge fund advisory firm Sussex Partners, told Reuters on January 10, 2023: ""Investors need to look under the surface to understand the industry performance last year. Long-short hedge funds are the biggest asset-weighted part of the industry. Overall, I believe it was a good year for hedge funds.""Don't Miss: 15 Most Profitable Hedge Funds in the WorldAccording to Hedge Fund Research (HFR), the total global capital invested in hedge funds reached $3.83 trillion by the end of 2022, reflecting a quarterly increase of $44 billion. Hedge funds managed by The Citco Group Limited experienced a weighted-average return of -7.02% for the entire year. Smaller funds generally outperformed larger ones, as indicated by the median return of -2.86%. HFR also highlighted that macro strategies, including fundamental commodity, discretionary, and quantitative trend-following CTA sub-strategies, were the leading hedge fund strategies globally. Story continuesDespite the dull performance of hedge funds, Citadel, led by Ken Griffin, achieved an exceptional feat by generating an unprecedented $16 billion in profits for its clients in 2022. This performance not only surpassed other players in the industry but also stands as one of the most prominent financial successes in history. Chairman Rick Sopher of LCH Investments commented: “The largest gains were once again made by the large multi-strategy hedge funds like Citadel, DE Shaw and Millennium. The strong gains they have generated in recent years reflect their increasing dominance in strategies which do not depend on rising asset prices, and their substantial size.”Individual investors often look up to elite hedge funds and try to imitate their performance.

(NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 91Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) operates supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs, cash and carry stores, and discount stores. On February 21, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) declared a $0.57 per share quarterly dividend, a 1.8% increase from its prior dividend of $0.56. The next dividend payment is to be made on September 5, to shareholders of record as of August 11. 2023 marks the 50th consecutive year of dividend increases for the retail giant. In the first quarter of 2023, D E Shaw held the largest stake in the company, comprising 4.8 million shares worth approximately $710 million. In addition to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is one of the most owned stocks by hedge funds. In its Q2 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“The pandemic has created challenges for businesses large and small; one major challenge for large essential retailers such as ClearBridge holdings Home Depot, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Costco have been ensuring adequate staffing to meet demand under trying conditions. All three instituted enhanced pay practices during the pandemic, with raises, unplanned bonuses and other benefits helping compensate employees for their efforts in a difficult environment. In September 2020 Walmart raised wages for 165,000 employees, including a number of entry positions to $15 an hour. It followed this in February with a raise for 425,000 workers that moved its average pay above $15 an hour.”24. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 91Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) provides banking and financial products and services. The company’s operations are divided into Consumer Banking, Global Wealth &amp; Investment Management, Global Banking, and Global Markets segments. It is one of the top most owned stocks by hedge funds. On July 5, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) announced that it will increase its quarterly dividend from $0.22 per share to $0.24 per share, beginning in the third quarter. This decision comes after successfully completing the Federal Reserve's annual stress test and is subject to approval from the board of directors. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 91 hedge funds were long Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), compared to 100 funds in the earlier quarter. ClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy made the following comment about Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“Our quality bias has always led us to gravitate toward banks with strong and diverse deposit bases; those we own tend to be the larger players, which we also expect to be the biggest beneficiaries from a flight to safety in terms of deposits. JPMorgan Chase comes to mind especially here, but so does Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) despite its weakness in March, as well as U.S. Bancorp, to which we added opportunistically in the quarter.”23. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 95On June 27, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) stock saw a slight increase in pre-market trading after Bank of America expressed confidence in the company's strategic direction. Despite concerns regarding the box office, streaming business, and other challenges, analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich maintained a Buy rating and set a price target of $135 on the shares. The analyst acknowledged that some recent content, including the Pixar film Elemental, did not meet audience expectations, but attributed this to production circumstances during the pandemic and past leadership. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is one of the most owned stocks by hedge funds. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) was part of 95 hedge fund portfolios, with Nelson Peltz’s Trian Partners holding the largest stake, consisting of 5.9 million shares worth $592.4 million. VGI Partners made the following comment about The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) in its 2022 annual investor letter:“The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is a diversified media conglomerate operating media networks, theme parks, film and TV studios and direct-to-consumer streaming services. It is the global leader in theme parks with hotels and cruise lines aimed at families. Key assets within Disney are the instantly recognisable entertainment franchises that have multiple avenues of monetisation such as Mickey Mouse, Star Wars, ABC and Marvel’s Avengers.Disney’s share price declined due to a number of factors in 2022, presenting us the chance to purchase a long-admired business and its unique collection of valuable intellectual property assets at what we consider to be a very attractive valuation. Summarily, the EPS of Disney has declined from US$7 in 2018 to ~US$2.60 in 2022 but we believe that the earnings power of the assets has not diminished to anywhere near this extent.Disney is currently undergoing a business transition within the Media and Entertainment Distribution division (DMED) from traditional media property distribution via third parties (i.e. cinemas and broadcast networks) to a Direct-To-Consumer (DTC) model via the Disney+ streaming service. A key element of our thesis is that the earnings power of the company is currently being masked by the marketing and content investments within Disney+ and that this will normalize over the next several years.

According to the Payments Journal, PayPal has been used (over the last 12 months) by 62% of American consumers, followed by Apple Pay at 41% and Google Pay at 32%.Over the last several years, P2P payments have made tremendous strides in adoption and usage. Whenever something becomes a verb, like just Venmo me $10, you know that it has been widely embraced by society. The concept of allowing individuals to pay each other, via our smartphones, has clearly taken off.However, the biggest flaw or issue (that we’ve identified) is interoperability. Digital wallets allow users to pick their favorite card to make payments with. P2P acts as a bit of a “walled garden” and its funding source is still siloed. This is a critical aspect for future P2P growth, as Venmo users can’t pay Cash App users who can’t pay Zelle users. Visa is launching Visa+ next year and it has already signed up PayPal and Venmo as its initial customers. The global card networks seem like the perfect piece to solve this interoperability puzzle. Of course, this will only work if banks allow an independent network to serve as the gateway between disparate user bases…” (Click here to read the full text)17. Netflix, Inc.

(NYSE:JPM) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“It will be interesting to see what kind of policy decisions are made around regulation for institutions that are between $100 billion of assets and $700 billion of assets. As JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM)’s purchase of First Republic shows, scale is a competitive advantage. It now has 13% of total US deposits and it manages 21% of America’s credit card spending. With additional regulatory burdens coming, banks are facing a profitability headwind and 100 to 300 basis points of possible ROE erosion.The banking sector is facing a slow-moving crisis, but we aren’t sure it is enough to sink the overall health of the US consumer or economy. Credit will contract and lending standards will continue to rise. However, we do not see this problem escalating to the size and scale of previous banking crises.Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JP Morgan Chase clearly sees the risks these FINTECH companies present. In his annual letter to shareholders, he stated that all incumbent banks should be “scared shitless” of these FINTECH rivals. Not only is his bank being attacked from multiple angles, but Apple just launched a cash management program with Goldman Sachs. On the first day of Apple’s savings program, it raised $400 million and eclipsed $1 billion in its first four days. Dimon specifically labeled Apple a bank the other day in an interview when he said, “It may not have insured deposits, but it’s a bank.

We did take advantage of improving sentiment to higher growth technology companies and the share price of more defensive companies drifting down to divest our investment in Adobe and increase the Fund’s investment in UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH). United Health’s share price was also under moderate pressure due to regulatory announcements being very slightly adverse. We believe the market over-reacted to these announcements and the share price has recovered strongly over recent weeks.”13.

We retain conviction that Alibaba is well positioned to benefit from China’s reopening and the ongoing growth in online commerce and cloud in China.”12. Activision Blizzard, Inc.

Technology rebounded from a challenging 2022 and many large tech companies are performing quite well this year. Through mid-May 2023, year-to-date performance of some of the most popular and largest tech names is impressive. For tech companies with market capitalizations over $1 trillion, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is up +35%, Microsoft +33%, Amazon +39%, and Google is +40%. In terms of contribution to the S&amp;P 500’s year-to-date return, Apple and Microsoft represent roughly half of its 2023 performance. Apple, and Microsoft now account for 13.9% of the entire S&amp;P 500 or 80% more concentrated than 2008. For additional perspective, Apple’s market cap is at $2.8 trillion and that is larger than the market cap of the entire Russell 2000. To conclude, it’s distinctly getting more concentrated at the top.For our purposes, we are just going to focus on software digital wallets, as they are much more common and accessible. If you own an iPhone, then you have an Apple Pay preloaded digital wallet. If you have a Samsung phone, you have Samsung Pay available for use.

According to the Payments Journal, PayPal has been used (over the last 12 months) by 62% of American consumers, followed by Apple Pay at 41% and Google Pay at 32%.Digital wallets have tons of advantages that we are embracing. When we attend Tampa Bay Lightning games, we love having our season tickets easily accessible on our phones (via the Apple Pay wallet), as well as our timed parking pass. When we travel, loading the airline ticket into our Apple Pay wallet is much more convenient than printing out a paper boarding pass. Others are using digital wallets to track their expenses, budget properly, and even help them easily pay their bills. Digital wallets are still in their infancy and have decades of future growth; we believe the smartphone is simply the best interface and platform for digital wallets…” (Click here to read the full text)10.

Nvidia is a good example of a select growth stock bought opportunistically where our long-term thesis has bloomed. We initiated the position in the fourth quarter of 2018 knowing that inference and training in the data center was an interesting although still early-stage growth driver. We knew that GPUs could be used to solve complex computing problems, but we didn’t know how quickly the training and learning efforts by Nvidia’s mega cap customers would hit an inflection point. Volatility in the gaming business created the entry point into the stock and we have built the position accordingly over time. Since the end of 2021, the stock’s portfolio weight grew from 4.5% to a high of 7.2% earlier in the second quarter before we trimmed it to manage our overall position sizing.We will continue to monitor and adjust Nvidia’s position sizing to manage risk. Despite the sharp run up, we believe the company’s long-term runway remains compelling due to its advantaged positioning in a very large addressable market for GPUs. The current valuation looks expensive, yet Nvidia has real earnings and cash flow and the longer-term multiple looks more reasonable because of GPU pricing power.”9. Salesforce, Inc.

(NYSE:CRM) is the largest pure-play cloud software company, holding a leading market share in customer relationship management applications and a top-five market share position in the company’s other clouds (Marketing, Service, Platform, Analytics, Integration, and Commerce). The company’s software subscription term-license model differs from the traditional perpetual-license software model in two respects: (1) the software is hosted on centralized servers and delivered over the internet, as opposed to traditional enterprise software that is loaded directly onto customers’ hard drives or servers; and (2) the revenue model is subscription-based, typically charging monthly fees per user as opposed to charging one-time licensing fees. The stock’s strong relative performance followed a strong F4Q23 earnings release that easily beat Street expectations on the top- and bottom-lines. In addition to the beat, management announced a number of initiatives that activist investors have been clamoring for, specifically a halt to large M&amp;A transactions and a focus on operating profitability.”8.

We are FINTECH investors, and we define Fintech as “anything utilizing technology to improve an established process.” We realize that half of Fintech is financial, but we don’t invest in traditional, credit sensitive banks. Having managed money during the Financial Crisis, we learned firsthand how certain opaque and balance sheet intensive financials could go bankrupt or insolvent.We prefer transaction-based businesses, generating recurring revenue, with sustainable margins, and significant cash flow. From our perspective, the perfect example of a FINTECH business is the secularly growing payments industry. Names like Visa or Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), that generate revenue and profit per swipe or transaction, without the underlying credit sensitivity or risk associated with that underlying line of credit.”7. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 144Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is an American mobility technology firm. On May 24, Uber Technologies, Inc.

Gross Bookings grew 19% year over year to $31 billion, driven by 31% Mobility Gross Bookings growth and 6% Delivery Growth Bookings growth. 4Q Adjusted EBITDA of $665 million, up $579 million year over year, significantly beating management’s $600-$630 million guidance. Management guided to continuing growth in 1Q for Gross Bookings (20%- 24% growth) and Adjusted EBITDA (of $660-$700 million).UBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing, with a greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates. The company is also a leader in food delivery, where it is number one or two in the more than 25 countries in which it operates. Moreover, after a history of losses, the company is now solidly profitable with the potential for substantial margin expansion and free cash flow generation to come. We view UBER as more than just ride sharing and food delivery, but also as a global mobility platform with the ability to sell to its 131 million users (by comparison, Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and penetrate new markets of on-demand services, such as package and grocery delivery, travel, truck brokerage (the company had $1.5 billion in Freight revenue for 4Q22), and worker staffing for shift work. Given its $4 billion of unrestricted cash and $5 billion of investments, the company today has an enterprise value of $70 billion, indicating that UBER trades at 1.6x next year’s estimated revenue.”6.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (U.S.) was the top contributor to the Fund’s performance for the quarter. Alphabet’s first-quarter search revenue growth accelerated slightly sequentially, which was notable given that advertising spending has decreased across the board. Management cited the company’s travel and retail segments for their strong performance in contrast to the declines experienced in the finance and in the media and entertainment businesses. Advertising spending has also stabilized at YouTube, and the focus on “shorts” has driven strong viewership growth. In the near term, YouTube’s investment in shorts may not generate significant revenue, but we believe its profitability will accelerate over time. Alphabet’s cloud business reached GAAP profitability this quarter, moving from a -12% margin this quarter last year to a 3% margin this quarter. On the AI front, Alphabet upgraded Bard to run on its more powerful PaLM language model, and Bard can now assist with coding and software development. CEO Sundar Pichai compared AI’s evolution to the transition from desktop to mobile computing a decade ago and said there is “a lot more to come” in terms of its consumer AI applications. CFO Ruth Porat revised 2023 capital expenditures guidance due to higher spending on data center construction and servers that will support AI developments in consumer products, advertiser tools and the cloud business.

It is worth considering U.S. Bancorp (USB), which belongs to the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry.This company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 5.38%.For the last reported quarter, U.S. Bancorp came out with earnings of $1.16 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.13 per share, representing a surprise of 2.65%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.11 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.20 per share, delivering a surprise of 8.11%.For U.S. Bancorp, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.U.S. Bancorp has an Earnings ESP of +0.39% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on July 19, 2023.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230712112410/en/U.S. Bank has committed $100 million over the next five years to the Access Home Loan program. (Photo: Business Wire)U.S. Bank has committed $100 million over the next five years to the Access Home Loan program, which is now available to qualified buyers in multiple markets. The new mortgage offering aligns with the U.S. Bank Access Home initiative focused on advancing Black homeownership.The goal of the initiative is to address some of the historical obstacles that communities of color face in the homeownership process. With improved access to credit, financial education and mortgage professionals that represent the communities served, U.S. Bank Access Home supports wealth building through homeownership and helps close the wealth gap that persists within communities of color.""We know that homeownership is the No. 1 way to build long-term wealth, but far too many minority families and individuals simply can’t come up with the upfront costs to buy a home,"" said Lenny McNeill, who leads strategic markets and affordable lending for U.S. Bank. ""There was a need that needed to be met. Our Access Home initiative, and now the U.S. Bank Access Home Loan, provide the level of financial support that can make sustainable homeownership a reality for underserved populations.""In addition to down payment assistance and lender credit, buyers using the Access Home Loan have the option to use lender credit to buy down their interest rate, a way for borrowers to obtain a lower interest rate at closing.Story continuesAccess Home Loan joins the long-standing U.S. Bank American Dream mortgage focused on assistance to help homebuyers with limited resources overcome thresholds to buying, including down payments as low as 3% and assistance funds that can be used towards a down payment, closing costs, required repairs or improvements.The new Access Home Loan goes a step further providing additional financial assistance for buyers in pilot markets where the minority population is more than 50%. While the Access Home Loan is primarily designed to support first-time homebuyers, borrowers do not need to be a first-time buyer to qualify.According to the National Association of Realtors, the gap in homeownership rates between white Americans (72.7%) and Black Americans (44%) is at its highest in a decade at 29 percent. The rate of homeownership among Hispanic Americans (50.6 %) and Asian Americans (62.8%) also falls below the white American homeownership rate1. The Access Home Loan program is just one way U.S. Bank is working in the communities it serves to increase access to homeownership within underserved segments of the community.About the U.S. Bank Access Home Loan:Down payment as low as 3%Up to $12,500 in down payment assistanceUp to $5,000 lender credit that can be used toward closing costs, including the ability to buy down mortgage interest rateBorrower can combine with other down payment assistance grants and programs$1,000 minimum contribution from borrower’s own fundsHow to qualify:Borrower must currently reside in a majority/minority location, determined by census tract dataBorrower income is equal to or below the HUD Area Median Income in the area where they want to buy.

Within this commitment, the broader Access Home initiative has invested nearly $1.6 million to support a wide range of outreach, engagement and educational efforts within the Black community across five initial markets, all of which are initial markets where the Access Home Loan is available. Access Home has also supported the hiring of a new cohort of Black mortgage loan officers who will serve diverse communities across the country to help demystify the homebuying process.For more information, visit the U.S. Bank Access Home Loan webpage.About U.S. BankU.S. Bancorp, with approximately 77,000 employees and $682 billion in assets as of March 31, 2023, is the parent company of U.S. Bank National Association.

16,267316e2-c079-31cc-b88f-953ae2fa62d1,USB,2023-07-13,U.S. Bancorp (USB) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-bancorp-usb-reports-next-140035350.html,1689170435,STORY,"['USB', 'PNC']","[U.S. Bancorp (USB) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 19, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.13 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +3.7%.Revenues are expected to be $7.15 billion, up 19.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 7.73% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for U.S. Bancorp?For U.S. Bancorp, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.39%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that U.S. Bancorp will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that U.S. Bancorp would post earnings of $1.13 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.16, delivering a surprise of +2.65%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.U.S. Bancorp appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc (PNC), is soon expected to post earnings of $3.31 per share for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -3.2%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $5.43 billion, up 6.1% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc has been revised 1.3% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, reflecting an equal Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

First quarter was supposed to be dramatic due to the banking crisis, but instead, it was fairly typical. No actual drama ensued.The big banks will lead off earnings season, as usual, with JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup leading the pack. But those aren’t the earnings charts to watch this week. I’ll be watching a group of five companies that represent a diverse look at the economy. Several of them have strong momentum this year. Will that continue?They all have solid earnings surprise histories as well. But the beat isn’t going to matter much this quarter. Guidance is the name of the game as the Street is looking for any clues to the US economy, a possible recession and whatever else may be on the near-term horizon.5 of the Most Important Earnings Chart this Week 1.    Delta Airlines, Inc. (DAL) has missed on earnings three of the last four quarters. But the Street doesn’t care as Delta Airlines has recently reported strong bookings. Shares have popped in 2023 and are up 48.4%. Delta Airlines is cheap, with a forward P/E of just 7.7. Is it time to buy Delta Airlines?2.    PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP) hasn’t missed on earnings in 5 years. What an impressive track record. That includes the quarter when the pandemic hit. PepsiCo is a true earnings all-star. Shares are up 63% over those 5 years. PepsiCo is not a cheap stock. It trades with a forward P/E of 25. Is PepsiCo too hot to handle?3.    ConAgra Brands, Inc. (CAG) has beat 5 quarters in a row. Shares haven’t participated in 2023’s rally, however. ConAgra shares are down 14.4% year-to-date. It’s cheap, though, with a forward P/E of 11.7. ConAgra also pays a dividend, currently yielding about 4%. Is ConAgra a hidden value gem?4.    Cintas Corp. (CTAS) has beat every quarter for 5 years. That’s an incredible record for this uniform company. Cintas is trading near 5-year highs and is up 145% over that time period versus just 73.7% for the S&amp;P 500. You won’t get Cintas cheap though. It trades with a forward P/E of 34.3. How much more does Cintas have left in the tank?Story continues5.    Fastenal Co. (FAST) has beat 13 quarters in a row. It’s last beat was just before the pandemic started, in early 2020. That’s an impressive earnings surprise streak. Shares of Fastenal are up 24.6% year-to-date, easily beating the S&amp;P 500, up 14.8%. Fastenal pays a dividend, yielding 2.4%. But it’s not cheap. It trades with a forward P/E of 29.

18,e48bff9e-c1f2-3081-a84a-e21f2c50c8f0,CTAS,2023-07-13,Here's Why We Think Cintas (NASDAQ:CTAS) Is Well Worth Watching,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-think-cintas-nasdaq-130018534.html,1689166818,STORY,['CTAS'],"[It's common for many investors, especially those who are inexperienced, to buy shares in companies with a good story even if these companies are loss-making. But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Cintas (NASDAQ:CTAS), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Cintas with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. See our latest analysis for Cintas Cintas' Earnings Per Share Are GrowingGenerally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Over the last three years, Cintas has grown EPS by 12% per year. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. Not all of Cintas' revenue this year is revenue from operations, so keep in mind the revenue and margin numbers used in this article might not be the best representation of the underlying business. Cintas maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 13% to US$8.6b. That's a real positive.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Cintas' future EPS 100% free.Story continuesAre Cintas Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Cintas, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$7.5b. Coming in at 15% of the business, that holding gives insiders a lot of influence, and plenty of reason to generate value for shareholders. Very encouraging.While it's always good to see some strong conviction in the company from insiders through heavy investment, it's also important for shareholders to ask if management compensation policies are reasonable. Our quick analysis into CEO remuneration would seem to indicate they are. For companies with market capitalisations over US$8.0b, like Cintas, the median CEO pay is around US$12m.Cintas offered total compensation worth US$7.8m to its CEO in the year to May 2022. That is actually below the median for CEO's of similarly sized companies. While the level of CEO compensation shouldn't be the biggest factor in how the company is viewed, modest remuneration is a positive, because it suggests that the board keeps shareholder interests in mind. Generally, arguments can be made that reasonable pay levels attest to good decision-making.Is Cintas Worth Keeping An Eye On?One important encouraging feature of Cintas is that it is growing profits. The fact that EPS is growing is a genuine positive for Cintas, but the pleasant picture gets better than that. With a meaningful level of insider ownership, and reasonable CEO pay, a reasonable mind might conclude that this is one stock worth watching. Still, you should learn about the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Cintas.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

The highest-priced pharmacy wanted $330.Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi , which dominate the insulin market, announced in March that they would slash their insulin prices by at least 70% later in the year.That came after U.S. President Joe Biden’s push to extend to most Americans a $35 cap on out-of-pocket insulin costs available to recipients of the government's Medicare health program. Americans with insurance typically pay a fraction of the list prices for prescription drugs, but uninsured people sometimes have to pay the full prices, forcing some to ration or skip taking their medicine.Lilly said at the time it would drop the price of its Lispro insulin injection, a generic version of its own branded Humalog, to $25 a vial. The Indianapolis-based drugmaker said it charges $25 per vial to wholesalers and retailers, but pharmacies can charge more.A spokesperson for the National Community Pharmacists Association said contracts with pharmacy benefit managers, the middlemen that negotiate discounts with drugmakers and reimburse pharmacies for patients' prescriptions, contributed to the distorted prices.Warren, a Democrat, has long campaigned for consumer protection reform, including within the U.S. healthcare system that forces Americans to pay more for medicines than any other country.The senator’s office found chain stores charged uninsured customers an average of $123 per vial for the generic insulin, compared to $63 at independent pharmacies.Story continuesWalgreens Boots Alliance, Walmart, Rite Aid and CVS Health asked for an average of $166, $161, $89 and $39, respectively for Insulin Lispro at their surveyed stores.Warren’s staff also said that less than a quarter of CVS pharmacies stocked the generic insulin, whereas 74% of Walgreens pharmacies did, along with 82% of Rite Aid and Walmart drug stores. Almost half - 43% - of all stores surveyed said they did not carry the drug.“This is a deeply troubling finding, revealing that the pharmacies offering the most affordable Insulin Lispro were the least likely to have it in stock,” the report said.CVS in a statement said since May 4th its cash price per vial has been $28.99. ""If an individual pharmacy doesn’t have a medication in stock, they typically can order it for arrival in about 1-2 business days.""Walgreens, Walmart and Rite Aid did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Around 8.4 million of the 37 million people in the United States with diabetes use insulin, according to the American Diabetes Association.(Reporting by Patrick Wingrove in New York Editing by Caroline Humer and Bill Berkrot)]"

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of popular hedge funds and their performance, head directly to 5 Most Owned Stocks by Hedge Funds. In 2022, the hedge fund industry experienced a decline of 2.4%, showing some improvement from a challenging first half of the year when the industry was down 4.6%. The losses were primarily influenced by the difficult market circumstances for high-risk assets, particularly impacting hedge funds with a long-biased approach and/or higher volatility. This marked the weakest performance for the hedge fund industry since 2018 when it also posted a 2.4% loss. Looking at the five-year performance, hedge funds have achieved a compounded annual return of +4.2%, demonstrating a more favorable performance compared to bonds, which experienced a decline of 2.0%. Aurum, a hedge fund investment specialist, noted that there were clear winners and losers in the hedge fund industry in 2022. The best-performing strategies were multi-strategy (+9.5%), quant (+8.5%), and macro (+6.7%). Strategies that typically have a higher correlation to equities and fixed income, which experienced poor performance, struggled the most. Patrick Ghali, managing partner of hedge fund advisory firm Sussex Partners, told Reuters on January 10, 2023: ""Investors need to look under the surface to understand the industry performance last year. Long-short hedge funds are the biggest asset-weighted part of the industry. Overall, I believe it was a good year for hedge funds.""Don't Miss: 15 Most Profitable Hedge Funds in the WorldAccording to Hedge Fund Research (HFR), the total global capital invested in hedge funds reached $3.83 trillion by the end of 2022, reflecting a quarterly increase of $44 billion. Hedge funds managed by The Citco Group Limited experienced a weighted-average return of -7.02% for the entire year. Smaller funds generally outperformed larger ones, as indicated by the median return of -2.86%. HFR also highlighted that macro strategies, including fundamental commodity, discretionary, and quantitative trend-following CTA sub-strategies, were the leading hedge fund strategies globally. Story continuesDespite the dull performance of hedge funds, Citadel, led by Ken Griffin, achieved an exceptional feat by generating an unprecedented $16 billion in profits for its clients in 2022. This performance not only surpassed other players in the industry but also stands as one of the most prominent financial successes in history. Chairman Rick Sopher of LCH Investments commented: “The largest gains were once again made by the large multi-strategy hedge funds like Citadel, DE Shaw and Millennium. The strong gains they have generated in recent years reflect their increasing dominance in strategies which do not depend on rising asset prices, and their substantial size.”Individual investors often look up to elite hedge funds and try to imitate their performance.

(NYSE:WMT) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“The pandemic has created challenges for businesses large and small; one major challenge for large essential retailers such as ClearBridge holdings Home Depot, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Costco have been ensuring adequate staffing to meet demand under trying conditions. All three instituted enhanced pay practices during the pandemic, with raises, unplanned bonuses and other benefits helping compensate employees for their efforts in a difficult environment. In September 2020 Walmart raised wages for 165,000 employees, including a number of entry positions to $15 an hour.

JPMorgan Chase comes to mind especially here, but so does Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) despite its weakness in March, as well as U.S. Bancorp, to which we added opportunistically in the quarter.”23. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 95On June 27, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) stock saw a slight increase in pre-market trading after Bank of America expressed confidence in the company's strategic direction. Despite concerns regarding the box office, streaming business, and other challenges, analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich maintained a Buy rating and set a price target of $135 on the shares.

It is the global leader in theme parks with hotels and cruise lines aimed at families. Key assets within Disney are the instantly recognisable entertainment franchises that have multiple avenues of monetisation such as Mickey Mouse, Star Wars, ABC and Marvel’s Avengers.Disney’s share price declined due to a number of factors in 2022, presenting us the chance to purchase a long-admired business and its unique collection of valuable intellectual property assets at what we consider to be a very attractive valuation. Summarily, the EPS of Disney has declined from US$7 in 2018 to ~US$2.60 in 2022 but we believe that the earnings power of the assets has not diminished to anywhere near this extent.Disney is currently undergoing a business transition within the Media and Entertainment Distribution division (DMED) from traditional media property distribution via third parties (i.e. cinemas and broadcast networks) to a Direct-To-Consumer (DTC) model via the Disney+ streaming service. A key element of our thesis is that the earnings power of the company is currently being masked by the marketing and content investments within Disney+ and that this will normalize over the next several years. To put this in perspective, Disney+ (DTC sub-segment) currently generates operating losses of over US$3.3bn (a negative 14% operating margin) compared to operating margins at its nearest streaming competitor, Netflix, of +15.5%…” (Click here to read the full text)22.

Core organic growth, excluding COVID-19 testing revenue which fell 16%, grew a very strong 13%.

(NASDAQ:PYPL) in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom. PayPal will still carry out customer-facing operations, including underwriting and servicing associated with its European BNPL products.

(NASDAQ:PYPL) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“For our purposes, we are just going to focus on software digital wallets, as they are much more common and accessible. If you own an iPhone, then you have an Apple Pay preloaded digital wallet. If you have a Samsung phone, you have Samsung Pay available for use. Those two, along with Google Pay and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), are the four most popular digital wallets today. According to the Payments Journal, PayPal has been used (over the last 12 months) by 62% of American consumers, followed by Apple Pay at 41% and Google Pay at 32%.Over the last several years, P2P payments have made tremendous strides in adoption and usage. Whenever something becomes a verb, like just Venmo me $10, you know that it has been widely embraced by society. The concept of allowing individuals to pay each other, via our smartphones, has clearly taken off.However, the biggest flaw or issue (that we’ve identified) is interoperability. Digital wallets allow users to pick their favorite card to make payments with. P2P acts as a bit of a “walled garden” and its funding source is still siloed. This is a critical aspect for future P2P growth, as Venmo users can’t pay Cash App users who can’t pay Zelle users. Visa is launching Visa+ next year and it has already signed up PayPal and Venmo as its initial customers. The global card networks seem like the perfect piece to solve this interoperability puzzle. Of course, this will only work if banks allow an independent network to serve as the gateway between disparate user bases…” (Click here to read the full text)17. Netflix, Inc.

(NASDAQ:NFLX), compared to 117 funds in the prior quarter. Artisan Developing World Fund made the following comment about Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Top contributors to performance for the quarter included global streaming giant Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX).

(NYSE:JPM) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“It will be interesting to see what kind of policy decisions are made around regulation for institutions that are between $100 billion of assets and $700 billion of assets. As JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM)’s purchase of First Republic shows, scale is a competitive advantage. It now has 13% of total US deposits and it manages 21% of America’s credit card spending. With additional regulatory burdens coming, banks are facing a profitability headwind and 100 to 300 basis points of possible ROE erosion.The banking sector is facing a slow-moving crisis, but we aren’t sure it is enough to sink the overall health of the US consumer or economy. Credit will contract and lending standards will continue to rise. However, we do not see this problem escalating to the size and scale of previous banking crises.Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JP Morgan Chase clearly sees the risks these FINTECH companies present. In his annual letter to shareholders, he stated that all incumbent banks should be “scared shitless” of these FINTECH rivals. Not only is his bank being attacked from multiple angles, but Apple just launched a cash management program with Goldman Sachs. On the first day of Apple’s savings program, it raised $400 million and eclipsed $1 billion in its first four days. Dimon specifically labeled Apple a bank the other day in an interview when he said, “It may not have insured deposits, but it’s a bank. If you move money, hold money, manage money, lend money — that’s a bank.”14.

We did take advantage of improving sentiment to higher growth technology companies and the share price of more defensive companies drifting down to divest our investment in Adobe and increase the Fund’s investment in UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH). United Health’s share price was also under moderate pressure due to regulatory announcements being very slightly adverse. We believe the market over-reacted to these announcements and the share price has recovered strongly over recent weeks.”13.

Alibaba operates shopping platforms Taobao and Tmall and owns 33% of Ant Group, which operates Alipay, China’s largest third-party online payment provider. Shares of Alibaba were up this quarter, given meaningful margin expansion, guidance to stabilize core commerce market share in China, and an announced plan to split the company into six units which could further unlock value. We retain conviction that Alibaba is well positioned to benefit from China’s reopening and the ongoing growth in online commerce and cloud in China.”12. Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 128Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) develops and publishes interactive entertainment content. It is one of the favorite stocks of elite hedge funds.

We initiated the position in November 2021 and, despite crystalizing a gain on the investment, we are admittedly a little frustrated with how this has played out. In January 2022, Microsoft (MSFT) agreed to acquire the company for $95/share, but regulators are determined to block the transaction, and appear increasingly activist, in our opinion.”11. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 131At the end of June 2023, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s valuation surpassed $3 trillion, solidifying its position as the world's most valuable company.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) with a Buy rating and a price target of $240, noted that investors are underestimating the potential for gross margin expansion by the tech giant. Malik also emphasized Apple's consistent market share gains over Android smartphones, its favorable position with the higher-end iPhone Pro and iPhone Pro Max models, continuous growth in China and India, the addition of high-margin Services revenue, and cost-cutting measures through chip development.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 915.5 million shares worth approximately $151 billion. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) remains a popular choice in the stock portfolios of elite hedge funds. Manole Capital Management made the following comment about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Despite this, the S&amp;P 500 is up 7% this year and the Nasdaq is up +11%. Technology rebounded from a challenging 2022 and many large tech companies are performing quite well this year. Through mid-May 2023, year-to-date performance of some of the most popular and largest tech names is impressive. For tech companies with market capitalizations over $1 trillion, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is up +35%, Microsoft +33%, Amazon +39%, and Google is +40%. In terms of contribution to the S&amp;P 500’s year-to-date return, Apple and Microsoft represent roughly half of its 2023 performance. Apple, and Microsoft now account for 13.9% of the entire S&amp;P 500 or 80% more concentrated than 2008. For additional perspective, Apple’s market cap is at $2.8 trillion and that is larger than the market cap of the entire Russell 2000. To conclude, it’s distinctly getting more concentrated at the top.For our purposes, we are just going to focus on software digital wallets, as they are much more common and accessible. If you own an iPhone, then you have an Apple Pay preloaded digital wallet. If you have a Samsung phone, you have Samsung Pay available for use. Those two, along with Google Pay and PayPal, are the four most popular digital wallets today. According to the Payments Journal, PayPal has been used (over the last 12 months) by 62% of American consumers, followed by Apple Pay at 41% and Google Pay at 32%.Digital wallets have tons of advantages that we are embracing. When we attend Tampa Bay Lightning games, we love having our season tickets easily accessible on our phones (via the Apple Pay wallet), as well as our timed parking pass. When we travel, loading the airline ticket into our Apple Pay wallet is much more convenient than printing out a paper boarding pass. Others are using digital wallets to track their expenses, budget properly, and even help them easily pay their bills. Digital wallets are still in their infancy and have decades of future growth; we believe the smartphone is simply the best interface and platform for digital wallets…” (Click here to read the full text)10. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 132NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), an American semiconductor giant, is one of the most owned stocks among smart investors. On July 10, Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari reaffirmed a Buy rating on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and expressed confidence in the company's advancement in the field of general artificial intelligence.

Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is a significant stakeholder of the company, with 8.2 million shares worth $2.3 billion. ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“The Strategy’s IT holdings also drove performance in the second quarter, led by the continued rerating of graphics chipmaker NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as a key beneficiary of the generative AI boom. Nvidia is a good example of a select growth stock bought opportunistically where our long-term thesis has bloomed. We initiated the position in the fourth quarter of 2018 knowing that inference and training in the data center was an interesting although still early-stage growth driver. We knew that GPUs could be used to solve complex computing problems, but we didn’t know how quickly the training and learning efforts by Nvidia’s mega cap customers would hit an inflection point. Volatility in the gaming business created the entry point into the stock and we have built the position accordingly over time. Since the end of 2021, the stock’s portfolio weight grew from 4.5% to a high of 7.2% earlier in the second quarter before we trimmed it to manage our overall position sizing.We will continue to monitor and adjust Nvidia’s position sizing to manage risk. Despite the sharp run up, we believe the company’s long-term runway remains compelling due to its advantaged positioning in a very large addressable market for GPUs. The current valuation looks expensive, yet Nvidia has real earnings and cash flow and the longer-term multiple looks more reasonable because of GPU pricing power.”9. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 136Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is an American tech company specializing in customer relationship management. On June 29, Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) revealed its plans to invest $4 billion in its U.K. business over the span of five years, with the aim of enhancing artificial intelligence innovation.

Harris Associates is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 7.7 million shares worth $1.5 billion. Ithaka US Growth Strategy made the following comment about Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is the largest pure-play cloud software company, holding a leading market share in customer relationship management applications and a top-five market share position in the company’s other clouds (Marketing, Service, Platform, Analytics, Integration, and Commerce). The company’s software subscription term-license model differs from the traditional perpetual-license software model in two respects: (1) the software is hosted on centralized servers and delivered over the internet, as opposed to traditional enterprise software that is loaded directly onto customers’ hard drives or servers; and (2) the revenue model is subscription-based, typically charging monthly fees per user as opposed to charging one-time licensing fees. The stock’s strong relative performance followed a strong F4Q23 earnings release that easily beat Street expectations on the top- and bottom-lines. In addition to the beat, management announced a number of initiatives that activist investors have been clamoring for, specifically a halt to large M&amp;A transactions and a focus on operating profitability.”8.

Charles Akre’s Akre Capital Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 5.8 million shares worth $2.13 billion. Manole Capital Management made the following comment about Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“We like to start out all of our discussions by telling investors who we are. We are FINTECH investors, and we define Fintech as “anything utilizing technology to improve an established process.” We realize that half of Fintech is financial, but we don’t invest in traditional, credit sensitive banks. Having managed money during the Financial Crisis, we learned firsthand how certain opaque and balance sheet intensive financials could go bankrupt or insolvent.We prefer transaction-based businesses, generating recurring revenue, with sustainable margins, and significant cash flow. From our perspective, the perfect example of a FINTECH business is the secularly growing payments industry. Names like Visa or Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), that generate revenue and profit per swipe or transaction, without the underlying credit sensitivity or risk associated with that underlying line of credit.”7. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 144Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is an American mobility technology firm. On May 24, Uber Technologies, Inc.

Gross Bookings grew 19% year over year to $31 billion, driven by 31% Mobility Gross Bookings growth and 6% Delivery Growth Bookings growth. 4Q Adjusted EBITDA of $665 million, up $579 million year over year, significantly beating management’s $600-$630 million guidance. Management guided to continuing growth in 1Q for Gross Bookings (20%- 24% growth) and Adjusted EBITDA (of $660-$700 million).UBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing, with a greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates. The company is also a leader in food delivery, where it is number one or two in the more than 25 countries in which it operates. Moreover, after a history of losses, the company is now solidly profitable with the potential for substantial margin expansion and free cash flow generation to come. We view UBER as more than just ride sharing and food delivery, but also as a global mobility platform with the ability to sell to its 131 million users (by comparison, Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and penetrate new markets of on-demand services, such as package and grocery delivery, travel, truck brokerage (the company had $1.5 billion in Freight revenue for 4Q22), and worker staffing for shift work. Given its $4 billion of unrestricted cash and $5 billion of investments, the company today has an enterprise value of $70 billion, indicating that UBER trades at 1.6x next year’s estimated revenue.”6.

(NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the most owned stocks by hedge funds.Oakmark Global Select Fund made the following comment about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (U.S.) was the top contributor to the Fund’s performance for the quarter. Alphabet’s first-quarter search revenue growth accelerated slightly sequentially, which was notable given that advertising spending has decreased across the board. Management cited the company’s travel and retail segments for their strong performance in contrast to the declines experienced in the finance and in the media and entertainment businesses. Advertising spending has also stabilized at YouTube, and the focus on “shorts” has driven strong viewership growth. In the near term, YouTube’s investment in shorts may not generate significant revenue, but we believe its profitability will accelerate over time. Alphabet’s cloud business reached GAAP profitability this quarter, moving from a -12% margin this quarter last year to a 3% margin this quarter. On the AI front, Alphabet upgraded Bard to run on its more powerful PaLM language model, and Bard can now assist with coding and software development. CEO Sundar Pichai compared AI’s evolution to the transition from desktop to mobile computing a decade ago and said there is “a lot more to come” in terms of its consumer AI applications. CFO Ruth Porat revised 2023 capital expenditures guidance due to higher spending on data center construction and servers that will support AI developments in consumer products, advertiser tools and the cloud business. Porat reiterated that the company plans to continue to hold expense growth below revenue growth and that Alphabet’s cost-reduction initiatives should bear fruit later this year and into 2024. At Alphabet’s annual developer conference in May, the company showcased an impressive array of new AI-powered consumer tools, which will be rolled out over the course of the year. Investors reacted positively to these presentations, which highlighted the extent of AI innovation occurring at Alphabet.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Most Owned Stocks by Hedge Funds. Suggested articles:10 Best Economic Recovery Stocks to Buy11 Best Breakout Stocks to Buy Now12 Best Mining Stocks Hedge Funds Are Buying Disclosure: None. 25 Most Owned Stocks by Hedge Funds is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

If you are not interested in reading the details, head straight to the 5 Most Hated Brands in the World.Starting a business in the US is the first step in building a global brand since it is a land of opportunities, where anyone with a great idea, the drive to succeed, and a willingness to work hard can prosper. Some well-known brands that originated in the United States and have now gone global include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), The Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT). Brands offer the innovations, concepts, and solutions that customers demand. In addition, they also contribute to the economy by generating wealth and income, paying taxes, supporting services, and making jobs available to the active population of a country.Although businesses and brands make our lives easier, there are a number of negative aspects to them, which is why some people have such a strong disdain or even hatred for them. Don’t Miss: 15 Most Hated Companies in America last year.Americans believe businesses are performing below expectations in various areas, according to a Bentley-Gallup Force for Good survey. 53% of Americans, who participated in the study, said that businesses generally have a negative impact on the environment. For large businesses, this number increased to 65%. Americans also believe that businesses are failing in the area of pay disparity. 82% of respondents said that it is crucial to treat all workers fairly and 72% agreed that they would be ready to pay more for a product from a company that treats its employees well. Moreover, the study also found that 55% of American workers, including 71% of those aged 18 to 29, would switch jobs to work for a company that had a greater beneficial impact on the globe.In a similar vein, Millennials' tolerance for large companies declined in 2019. According to a Deloitte Millennial Survey, fewer Millennials (from 76% in 2017 to 55% in 2019) agreed that business had a beneficial impact on society. Additionally, 26% of Millennials expressed no faith in corporate executives.Story continuesMost Loved and Successful Brands Have the Most HatersMany experts believe that if you want to be great, you must be prepared to face hatred. So, it should come as no surprise that some of the most admired brands in the world are also some of the most despised. Moreover, this hatred toward a brand isn't always detrimental to its financial standing. For instance, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has faced significant backlash following the announcement of 27,000 layoffs since November 2022. Nevertheless, the e-commerce behemoth, which has a large product range, a user-friendly website, is simple to use, and offers quick and dependable shipping, is still one of the most loved and trusted brands by customers. 89% of consumers think that they are more inclined to purchase things from Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) than from any other e-commerce websites.Similarly, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) appears to be loved and despised by people everywhere. Many hate it due to privacy concerns, but more than 77% of Internet users are active on at least one of its platforms. This clearly shows how successful the brand is.Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), one of the largest retailers in the world, is yet another example of a brand that people claim to dislike, but it continues to be profitable every year. It is accused of treating its employees unfairly. Furthermore, critics argue that the big-box giant has swooped in many places and destroyed local small businesses, leaving customers no other options. We believe that success of its business model is much to blame for that.It's easy to understand why brands people dislike persist. If there are significant benefits, customers will stick with a brand they don't like. Many customer decisions are heavily influenced by elements like price, convenience, and easy availability. For example, if a better airline cannot provide equal availability and affordability, consumers will continue to fly with the airline they dislike.Therefore, it is crucial to keep in mind that just because a brand is listed in this article as one of the most despised brands in the world, it doesn't automatically mean that it is no longer significant. This brand had to be on the list even though more people love it than hate it because we were focusing on the latter criteria.With these considerations in mind, let's look at the most hated brands in the world.20 Most Hated Brands in the WorldMilles Studio/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyWe used reputable sources for our rankings of the most hated brands in the world, including the 2023 Axios Harris Poll, 24/7 Wall Street, Business Insider, and USA Today. In addition, we took into account a number of online reviews and customer survey platforms. We assigned scores to each brand based on the number of mentions, so each time a brand was mentioned, it received a score of 1. Consequently, the more mentions and references, the higher the score and rank in our article. Basically, this list of the most hated brands in the world doesn't reflect our opinion but the consensus opinion of various sources.So, without further ado, let's examine the most hated brands in the world that must work very hard to regain the faith of their customers.Most Hated Brands in the World20. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), as reported in one of articles earlier, is one of the top drug companies in the world by revenue. It headquartered in New Brunswick, New Jersey.The company came under intense criticism following many lawsuits that claim its baby powder causes ovarian cancer. However, the pharmaceutical giant agreed to pay $8.9 billion in April 2023 to settle all cancer lawsuits related to its talc-based powders.19. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), with around 232.5 million subscribers, is a streaming service that offers a wide variety of award-winning TV shows, movies, anime, documentaries, and more on thousands of internet-connected devices.Although the streaming service continues to be a favorite among many, it recently attracted public criticism for only allowing members of the same household to share passwords, with outside users having to pay an extra $7.99 per month. However, we don't think that Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)’s inclusion on our list of the most hated brands in the world will have a negative impact on its reputation.18. Navient Corporation (NASDAQ:NAVI)Navient Corporation (NASDAQ:NAVI), one of the most hated brands in the world on our list, is an American student loan servicer based in Wilmington, Delaware.People despise the company because it takes advantage of borrowers by disregarding concerns, providing false information, processing payments improperly, and directing borrowers to more expensive repayment plans. Between November 2016 and January 2017, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau claims receiving over 1,500 consumer complaints about the company.A $1.85 billion settlement was reached between 39 states and Navient Corporation (NASDAQ:NAVI) last year on claims that the company used unfair and deceptive loan practices.17. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), with 32,800 employees as of 2022, primarily offers taxi services, allowing customers to hail a taxi through a mobile app.The company is disliked for its surge pricing as well as the negative effects of gig work replacing secure employment. Moreover, it is also disliked for causing disruption to the taxi industry and aggravating traffic congestion.However, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) offers several benefits, such as door-to-door convenience, safety, and dependable quality, thus we don't believe it deserves to be one of the most hated brands in the world.16. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), as reported in one our articles earlier, is one of the largest banks in the US by asset size.The bank earned the ire of general public when common people lost their homes, their jobs and their savings during the 2008 recession. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) agreed to pay $5.06 billion in 2016 to resolve charges that it mislead mortgage bond investors during the financial crisis.Furthermore, it has also received criticism from its employees. A 2021 poll of 13 first-year analysts at Goldman Sachs found that they were subjected to extremely long work hours, deadline pressure, and harsh behavior from superiors, which deteriorates their personal lives.15. The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI)The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI), with 71,300 employees as of 2022, engages in the provision of global health services. Forbes claims that state regulators get more consumer complaints about the company's health insurance than the national average. Based on ratings from the National Committee for Quality Assurance, it receives an average of 3.3 out of 5 stars.Moreover, the Guardian reported in 2021 that the company's call center employees complained about unfavorable working conditions. High demands for output, the risk of losing one's job, lack of training, and lengthy processing timeframes for consumers seeking reimbursement for Covid-19 testing expenses were the driving forces behind this.14. Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC)Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC), engaged in the provision of banking, insurance, investments, mortgage, and consumer and commercial finance, is headquartered in San Francisco, California. The bank received a lot of criticism in 2016 when it became known that its staff had been engaging in illicit practices for years. These included activities like overcharging clients, creating fake accounts, and unlawfully repossessing cars and homes.13. Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD)Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD), headquartered in Menlo Park, California, is an online discount brokerage that offers a commission-free investing and trading platform.The company was at the center of the short squeeze saga between retail investors and hedge funds in early 2021, resulting in losses worth billions to hedge funds. Despite the benefits enjoyed by retail traders on the platform, like no-fee trading, users on internet platform Reddit, many of whom are retail traders, accused the company of bias towards big finance. The platform halted trading in volatile stocks like GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AMC), favored by retail traders, at the height of the short squeeze drama. In July 2021, the firm was fined $70 million by authorities in the US for operational and regulatory lapses.12. United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL)United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL), founded in 1926, is an American international airline serving North America, Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean, and Europe.The airline, one of the most disliked brands on our list, has previously dealt with widely reported instances of poor customer service, including events in which staff members injured clients, threatened them, and mistreated their pets.United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL) faced a turbulent public reaction over its treatment of a passenger who was forcibly hauled out of his seat and off the plane, with blood streaming down his face, after the airline stated it needed ""volunteers"" to give up their seats for employees.11. Equifax Inc. (NYSE:EFX)Equifax Inc. (NYSE:EFX), headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, is a credit bureau that collects information about an individual's credit history to create a credit report.Given that it failed to secure the enormous amount of personal information stored on its network, which resulted in a data breach in 2017 that exposed millions of names and dates of birth, Social Security numbers, physical addresses, and other personal information that could result in identity theft and fraud, the general public is less forgiving of Equifax Inc. (NYSE:EFX).10. BitcoinBitcoin, introduced to the public in 2009, is a decentralized digital currency that you can buy, sell and exchange directly, without an intermediary like a bank.Bitcoin has drawn criticism for its high volatility and lack of regulation. In addition, it is also harmful to the environment. The University of Cambridge estimates that since its launch, Bitcoin has released 200 million tons of carbon dioxide.However, it is viewed by some, especially in the developing world, as a safe haven amid economic storms, despite being disliked for its volatility. In September 2021, El Salvador became the first nation to recognize Bitcoin as a legal tender, followed by the Central African Republic last year.9. FTXFTX, formerly one of the leading crypto exchanges in the world, filed for bankruptcy on November 11, 2022. US crypto investors sued the company in November last year, alleging that its top executives stole their digital assets and purposely blocked them from making withdrawals. Users of the platform also claim they received scam messages asking for their account details on FTX. In some instances, the founder of the firm, Sam Bankman-Fried, was featured in a deep fake video claiming to double customer crypto compensation.8. BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP)BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP), headquartered in London, is a British multinational oil and gas company. The firm has faced criticism for lowering its climate targets and increasing its investments in oil and gas. The energy giant has lowered its initial objective of a 35%-40% reduction in carbon emissions to a target of 20%-30%.Furthermore, BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP) is also remembered for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill disaster.7. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA)Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is one of the largest telecommunications companies in the world, as we previously reported in an article. Federal officials fined the company $2.3 million in 2016 for billing customers with unnecessary services and hidden fees. According to the Consumer Reports National Research Center’s 2013 annual telecom survey, the company ranked 15th out of 17 television service providers. Consumers gave it extremely low ratings for customer service and value for the money.6. TikTokTikTok, owned by Chinese technology company ByteDance, is a video-sharing app that allows users to create and share short-form videos on any topic.As concerns over privacy and cybersecurity increase, an increasing number of governments have banned this app from devices provided to employees.

(NYSE:UAA) institutional owners must be relieved by the recent gain",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/losing-8-8-past-under-142259500.html,1689171779,STORY,['UAA'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Under Armour's stock price is sensitive to their trading actionsThe top 19 shareholders own 51% of the company Insider ownership in Under Armour is 12%A look at the shareholders of Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UAA) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 67% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Last week's US$267m market cap gain would probably be appreciated by institutional investors, especially after a year of 8.8% losses.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Under Armour, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Under Armour ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Under Armour?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Under Armour. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Under Armour's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Under Armour. From our data, we infer that the largest shareholder is Kevin Plank (who also holds the title of Top Key Executive) with 12% of shares outstanding. Its usually considered a good sign when insiders own a significant number of shares in the company, and in this case, we're glad to see a company insider play the role of a key stakeholder. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.6% and 7.3%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 19 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Under ArmourWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own a reasonable proportion of Under Armour, Inc.. It has a market capitalization of just US$3.4b, and insiders have US$410m worth of shares in their own names. That's quite significant. Most would say this shows a good degree of alignment with shareholders, especially in a company of this size. You can  click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 21% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Under Armour. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Under Armour   you should know about.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

That’s good news for savers, but bad news for lenders as they prepare to release their second-quarter results.US banks spent the last several months competing with each other to keep or bring back depositors following the turmoil that took down three sizable regional institutions and triggered outflows across the banking system.That scramble pushed rates on savings accounts to 5.05% at the end of the second quarter, according to Bankrate, their steepest level since February 2008.Read more: The best high-yield savings account rates for July 2023The challenge for banks across the US is that these higher funding costs are eating into a key measure of profitability known as net interest margin, which measures the difference between what lenders make from their loans and what they pay for their deposits.That will likely act as a drag on results for some banks in the quarter, especially the mid-sized regional institutions that ran into trouble last spring, while reducing estimates of what they can earn for the rest of the year.“The surprises this quarter will be for the banks that do not lower expectations,” Wells Fargo bank analyst Mike Mayo told Yahoo Finance.Banks, added Argus Research's Stephen Biggar, ""have a deposit conundrum.""'Green shoots'?These pressures will be at the front of mind for investors starting Friday as they digest the first set of second quarter earnings from JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), and State Street (STT).Bank of America (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS) report next Tuesday and Goldman Sachs (GS) next Wednesday. A slew of other regional banks will also report in the coming weeks.Some of the biggest US banks are expected to once again demonstrate their resilience and diversity, showing they can continue to charge more for their loans while leaning on their sprawling franchises to generate additional revenue.Story continuesJPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America are all expected to show jumps in net income when compared to the year-earlier period, according to analyst estimates, while Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley are expected to report profit declines.JPMorgan's headquarters in New York City. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Those that are more dependent on investment banking, such as Goldman, are expected to be particularly challenged by a recent drought in deal making.Global investment banking revenues for the second quarter fell by 8% from the first quarter and 52% from a year ago, according to Dealogic. However, the business improved through the second half of the quarter, prompting some observers to predict “green shoots” ahead.“I’m turning to believing investment banking will not have great earnings but they’re going to be surprising, and I think better than expected,” said Dick Bove, a bank analyst with Odeon Capital.Investors will also be watching to see whether many of these big banks increase the amounts they set aside for future loan losses, a sign that they expect the US economy and credit conditions to worsen.“We're starting to see some increased delinquencies, particularly in the credit card and auto lending market,” said Biggar, Argus Research's director of financial services.'A huge amount of problems'Smaller regional banks are clearly not under the same amount of pressure as they were in March, when the fall of Silicon Valley Bank triggered panic across the country.But they still “face a huge amount of problems,” Bove said.The core issue is an aggressive campaign by the Federal Reserve to bring down inflation with higher interest rates. That campaign is lowering the value of the assets banks hold, such as bonds, while deposit costs creep higher and loan demand slows.Read more: Why now is a good time to open a savings account“We view accelerating deposit costs, not accelerating deposit outflows, as the most significant headwind to earnings for the next several quarters,“ Manan Gosalia, a regional bank analyst for Morgan Stanley, said in a research note.Higher rates have traditionally worked to the advantage of banks since it allows them to charge more for their loans than their deposits.But the panic of the spring “has changed the calculus a bit” for some banks, the Fed’s vice chair of supervision Michael Barr said Monday. Some lenders “are now paying up more for deposits,” and the Fed is “paying careful attention to that.”Silicon Valley Bank was seized on March 10. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)The Fed has made it clear that more hikes are coming this year. Regulators are also preparing new capital requirements for banks with more than $100 billion in assets that will force some to hold greater buffers against losses. That will increase the stability of those lenders but will also make it even more difficult to earn robust profits in the near term.Many banks have already warned at a conference in June that their net interest margins are going to drop by more than they expected for the quarter or the year, including executives for US Bancorp (USB), Citizens Financial Group (CFG), Comerica (CMA), Huntington (HBAN), KeyCorp (KEY), and Zions (ZION).“I’ve only been a banker for 10 years, so I haven’t seen a time when we’ve needed deposits as an industry as much as we do now,” Darrin Williams, the CEO of the 58-branch Southern Bancorp, told Yahoo Finance.The amount Southern Bancorp is paying customers has risen 600% since the Fed’s interest rate hiking cycle began, Williams added.“Our cost of funds continues to rise just because our customers demand that.”The larger banks aren’t immune to some of these same challenges.“Deposits will continue the trend of being slightly down from here,” Jennifer Piepszak, co-CEO of JPMorgan Chase's massive consumer and community bank, said at a conference in June.The bank has predicted it will earn net interest income of $84 billion in 2023, but if the deposit pressure keeps up, that figure could experience a “mild reprice,” she said.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

(Photo: Norwegian Cruise Lines)FreightWaves Classics is sponsored by Old Dominion Freight Line — Helping the World Keep Promises. Learn more here.Every week, FreightWaves explores the archives of American Shipper’s nearly 70-year-old collection of shipping and maritime publications to showcase interesting freight stories of long ago.This article comes from the September 1975 issue of American Shipper and shows how Norwegian Cruise Line, at the time named Norwegian Caribbean Lines, moved from the ice and coal business to the cruise world.When M/S Sunward arrived at Miami in 1966, she set a new standard for entire cruise industry in CaribbeanIce and coal would appear to have little in common with Caribbean cruising. But, with three generations of enterprising Norwegian Seafarers in between, they represent the beginnings and the present for a company which has become one of the most important factors in the American cruise industry.That company is Klosters-Rederi A/S of Oslo, and it has come a long way since 1906, when Lauritz Kloster purchased the 830-ton steamer “Sjogutten” to haul ice and coal between Norway and Great Britain.In 1975, doing business in the U.S. as Norwegian Caribbean Lines and sailing in far warmer waters, the firm’s fleet of three modern vessels will carry more than 80,000 passengers between the New Port of Miami and a host of destinations in the Caribbean and South America. These statistics place NCL among the top cruise ship companies operating in the U.S., impressive since it was little more than eight years ago that Klosters-Rederi first sought passenger trade with the introduction of M/S Sunward in 1966.The decision to establish NCL at that time was dramatic and daring. A year earlier, the S/S Yarmouth Castle had burned at sea off the Florida coast, and in the wake of that tragedy, the Port of Miami — in those days a minor point of embarkation at best — had become almost dormant. To enter the cruise market under such circumstances — especially with a new, luxurious and therefore expensive vessel — was considered by many a reckless gamble. Instead, it turned out to be just the step forward the industry, and the area, sorely needed.Story continuesA new trendThe debut of M/S Sunward launched not only a company, but the entire concept of contemporary cruising. NCL had hit upon a new kind of passenger ship, her operations based on modern hotel considerations, and freed from some of the ultra-deluxe amenities that had priced her predecessors out of the mass market. She was a ship on which a reasonable passenger load — attracted at tariffs within the means of the average traveler — promised at least a modest profit after expenses. NCL also had developed a new kind of cruise experience … one which allowed that average traveler to feel comfortable and at ease while still retaining the aura of luxury he heretofore had considered beyond his reach.Inspired othersAcceptance of M/S Sunward’s style of cruising was such that she served as inspiration not only for her three sister ships, but for new equipment launched by several other companies and new port development by an entire community. The emergence of the New Port of Miami, and its position today as the number one passenger embarkation point in the U.S., are largely attributable to the positive influence and progressive activity of Norwegian Caribbean Lines.With construction of each new vessel, NCL manifested a confident commitment to further development of the contemporary cruise market. M/S Sunward had carved her niche in the three and four-day Bahamas trade. M/S Starward, commissioned in 1968, was the first Caribbean cruise ship to offer a year-round schedule of seven-day voyages with Jamaica as a primary destination; today, sailing every Saturday to Port-Au-Prince, Port Antonio, Montego Bay, and Nassau, she still is the only vessel combining Haiti, Jamaica, and the Bahamas into a single week-long itinerary.Ever in search of new destinations, NCL became the first cruise company to call regularly at Cap Haitien, Haiti — home of the world-famous Citadel Laferriere — when it introduced M/S Skyward in January 1970. The picturesque village on Hispanola’s north coast continues to be the first call of weekly cruises which also visit San Juan, St. Thomas, and Puerto Plata.14-day tripsWhen a demand for fourteen-day cruising dominated the market in early 1972, NCL was ready with its newest vessel, M/S Southward, offering the first regularly scheduled fortnightly departures from South Florida. And as current trends indicate growing public interest in a broader choice of destinations within a seven-day time span, the company is at the fore again. In June 1975, M/S Southward will begin a weekly schedule to Freeport, Montego Bay, Grand Cayman Island, and Cozumel … and Norwegian Caribbean Lines will become the only cruise company offering three separate, distinctive week-long itineraries, each with a unique passenger appeal.Just as contemporary cruising is capturing the imagination of the American public, so is another relatively new travel concept — that of the all-inclusive package vacation. In the highly competitive, often confusing marketplace of the Fly/Cruise, NCL is the pacesetter once again. Its program of “Cloud 9 Cruises” is the most comprehensive in the industry — guaranteed weekly departures via scheduled air carrier from twenty-five major markets … combining airfare at economical group rates, cruise passage, transfers and taxes at a single price … offering excursion privileges such as open return and en route stopovers … and the convenience of NCL’s own optional ground packages at Miami’s Doral Beach Hotel or Walt Disney World in Orlando. Availability of “Cloud 9 Cruises” extends even to Europe, where, in cooperation with British Airways, the company’s London office — first overseas headquarters ever established by a Miami-based cruise operator — markets extensively throughout the United Kingdom and the Continent.Sunward retiredToday, those first ambitious Bahamian cruises of M/S Sunward seem almost as long ago as the ice and coal carriage of the “Sjogutten.” Having become a little old lady by the standards she herself helped set, Sunward has passed from the Caribbean scene. Retired to the French Riviera and renamed Ile De Beaute, she sails between Marseilles and Corsica for Compagnie Generale Mediterranee, a subsidiary of the French Line.NCL has in the design stage a new vessel which when completed will be the world’s first semi-catamaran cruise liner. Projected to be between 20,000-22,000 gross tons in size and carry nearly 1,000 passengers, she is described by NCL Board Chairman, Knut Kloster, as possessing a broad beam that will allow for “the greatest flexibility of facilities, and freedom of passenger movement, of any cruise vessel afloat.”So it would appear that, despite its brilliant past, the brightest days for Klosters-Rederi A/S, as Norwegian Caribbean Lines, still lie ahead.FreightWaves Classics articles look at various aspects of the transportation industry’s history. Click here to subscribe to our newsletter!The post How ice and coal hauling led to burgeoning cruise business appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Intel Corp. INTC, Microchip Technology MCHP, ON Semiconductor Corp. ON and NXP Semiconductors NXPI.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:5 Solid Semiconductor Stocks to Buy on Rebound in Chip SalesThe semiconductor industry, which has been suffering over the past year, seems to be making a steady rebound. Sales increased for the third consecutive month in May, per the latest report from the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA).The rebound seems to have matched economists' predictions that global semiconductor sales would bottom by the end of the first quarter before making a recovery. Although there are multiple challenges, the semiconductor industry is poised to grow in the coming days.Semiconductor Sales Steadily IncreasingAccording to the latest report from SIA, global semiconductor sales totaled $40.7 billion in May, increasing 1.7% from April's total of $40 billion. Although May's figures are still down 21.1% year over year, semiconductor sales have now grown for the third consecutive month.John Neuffer, SIA president and CEO said, ""Despite continuing market sluggishness compared to 2022, month-to-month global semiconductor sales inched upward in May for the third consecutive month, sparking optimism for a possible market rebound during the second half of the year.""Regionally, sales increased across all regions. Sales in China and Europe rose 3.9% and 2%, respectively. In Asia Pacific/Others, Americas and Japan, sales climbed 1.3%, 0.1% and 0.4%, respectively.Surging demand for electronic goods and the remote working and learning culture, which boosted demand for PCs and other communication devices during the peak of the pandemic, saw semiconductor sales skyrocketing.Story continuesHowever, higher demand and subsequent supply-chain issues owing to the lockdowns soon resulted in a shortage of semiconductors globally and created a turmoil in multiple end-user industries like automobiles, power, lighting and electronics.The supply-chain crisis, however, got resolved in 2022 and demand fell. The industry has since been suffering. Despite that, 2022 emerged as the best year for the semiconductor industry, with sales climbing 3.2% to $573.5 billion from $555.9 billion in 2021.Besides several interrelated factors like rising prices, geopolitical tensions and pandemic aftereffects have contributed to the current short-term decline in the semiconductor industry. However, demand is still strong.The widespread adoption and increased use of consumer electronics worldwide, the growing presence of artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning (ML) technologies is driving demand for semiconductors, which is likely to further boost demand for semiconductors in the near term.Our PicksGiven the bright prospects of the industry, it would be wise to invest in semiconductor stocks.

Sales increased for the third consecutive month in May, per the latest report from the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA).The rebound seems to have matched economists’ predictions that global semiconductor sales would bottom by the end of the first quarter before making a recovery. Although there are multiple challenges, the semiconductor industry is poised to grow in the coming days.Semiconductor Sales Steadily IncreasingAccording to the latest report from SIA, global semiconductor sales totaled $40.7 billion in May, increasing 1.7% from April’s total of $40 billion. Although May’s figures are still down 21.1% year over year, semiconductor sales have now grown for the third consecutive month.John Neuffer, SIA president and CEO said, “Despite continuing market sluggishness compared to 2022, month-to-month global semiconductor sales inched upward in May for the third consecutive month, sparking optimism for a possible market rebound during the second half of the year.”Regionally, sales increased across all regions. Sales in China and Europe rose 3.9% and 2%, respectively. In Asia Pacific/Others, Americas and Japan, sales climbed 1.3%, 0.1% and 0.4%, respectively.Surging demand for electronic goods and the remote working and learning culture, which boosted demand for PCs and other communication devices during the peak of the pandemic, saw semiconductor sales skyrocketing.However, higher demand and subsequent supply-chain issues owing to the lockdowns soon resulted in a shortage of semiconductors globally and created a turmoil in multiple end-user industries like automobiles, power, lighting and electronics.The supply-chain crisis, however, got resolved in 2022 and demand fell. The industry has since been suffering. Despite that, 2022 emerged as the best year for the semiconductor industry, with sales climbing 3.2% to $573.5 billion from $555.9 billion in 2021.Story continuesBesides several interrelated factors like rising prices, geopolitical tensions and pandemic aftereffects have contributed to the current short-term decline in the semiconductor industry. However, demand is still strong.The widespread adoption and increased use of consumer electronics worldwide, the growing presence of artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning (ML) technologies is driving demand for semiconductors, which is likely to further boost demand for semiconductors in the near term.Our PicksGiven the bright prospects of the industry, it would be wise to invest in semiconductor stocks. Below are five chip stocks that investors can gain from in the near term.NVIDIA Corporation NVDA is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, GPU.

40,311caf1b-9903-31f8-bb5e-5138028c6fd6,MCHP,2023-07-13,"ON Semiconductor Corporation (ON) Hit a 52 Week High, Can the Run Continue?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/semiconductor-corporation-hit-52-week-131508475.html,1689167708,STORY,"['ON', 'MCHP']","[Have you been paying attention to shares of ON Semiconductor Corp. (ON)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 4.3% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $97.52 in the previous session. ON Semiconductor Corp. has gained 55% since the start of the year compared to the 36.6% move for the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the 29.1% return for the Zacks Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on May 1, 2023, ON Semiconductor Corp. reported EPS of $1.19 versus consensus estimate of $1.09 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2%.For the current fiscal year, ON Semiconductor Corp. is expected to post earnings of $4.86 per share on $8.12 billion in revenues. This represents a -8.82% change in EPS on a -2.5% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $5.40 per share on $8.69 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 11.08% and 7%, respectively.Valuation MetricsON Semiconductor Corp. may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.ON Semiconductor Corp. has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and C, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.Story continuesIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 19.9X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 19.9X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 12.6X versus its peer group's average of 13X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 3.34. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Zacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, ON Semiconductor Corp. currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if ON Semiconductor Corp. fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though ON Semiconductor Corp. shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.How Does ON Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of ON have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is Microchip Technology Incorporated (MCHP). MCHP has a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of B, a Growth Score of B, and a Momentum Score of A.Earnings were strong last quarter. Microchip Technology Incorporated beat our consensus estimate by 1.23%, and for the current fiscal year, MCHP is expected to post earnings of $6.25 per share on revenue of $8.81 billion.Shares of Microchip Technology Incorporated have gained 3.1% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 14.14X and a P/CF of 11.53X.The Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry is in the top 17% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for ON and MCHP, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.The fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Microchip Technology (MCHP) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to MCHP for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Microchip Technology's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Microchip Technology's main business drivers.Microchip Technology Inc. develops and manufactures microcontrollers, memory and analog and interface products for embedded control systems, which are small, low-power computers designed to perform specific tasks.Chandler, AZ-based, Microchip reported total revenues of $8.44 billion in fiscal 2023.Beginning from calendar year 2021, the company reports FPGA revenues combined with its licensing, memory and other or LMO segment revenues under a new revenue category referred to as “other.” The company has now three major product lines:Mixed-signal Microcontrollers (56.3% of fiscal 2023 revenues): This product portfolio comprises 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit PIC microcontrollers and 16-bit dsPIC digital signal controllers. Microchip's expanding product portfolio driven by new microcontrollers’ roll outs aids it in expanding customer base and sustain its leading position in the market.Analog (28.2%): These products consist of several families with approximately 800 power management, linear, mixed-signal, thermal management, RF Linear drivers, safety and security, and interface products. The line of mixed-signal products primarily includes data converters that convert data from analog to digital or vice versa.Other (15.5%): The product line now comprises revenues from FPGA and LMO segments. LMO segment constitutes a combination of license fees and royalties related to SuperFlash technology, and fees for engineering services. Microchip licenses its SuperFlash technology to foundries, integrated device manufacturers and design partners across the world.FPGA product line was primarily acquired as part of Microsemi acquisition.In fiscal 2023, Americas, Europe and Asia contributed 25.7%, 21% and 53.3%, respectively to net sales. Distributors accounted for approximately 47% of net sales in fiscal 2023.Story continuesBottom LineWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in Microchip Technology ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in July 2013 would be worth $4,674.73, or a 367.47% gain, as of July 11, 2023, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 gained 166.82% and the price of gold went up 48.07% over the same time frame.Analysts are anticipating more upside for MCHP.Microchip is riding on consistent strength in its analog and microcontroller businesses. The company’s dominance in 8,16 and 32-bit microcontrollers is driving top-line growth. Strategic acquisitions like Microsemi and Atmel have expanded the product portfolio. It is gaining from strong demand across industrial, automotive, aerospace and defense, data center, and communications infrastructure end markets. Collaboration with the likes of AWS is positive. Nevertheless, supply-chain constraints related to semiconductors has been a headwind. Microchip expects wafer fab, as well as assembly and test constraints, will persist through 2023 and beyond. Weakness in consumer end-market is a headwind. Leveraged balance sheet is a concern for investors. Microchip shares have underperformed the industry year to date.Shares have gained 7.20% over the past four weeks and there have been 1 higher earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2023 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

(Photo: Shutterstock)With tasks such as picking, sorting, loading and unloading packages being automated more and more with the help of intelligent robots, the future of warehouse logistics could bring a lot more automation and a lot fewer humans.Experts say the key to the supply chain warehouses and fulfillment centers of tomorrow could be an emerging technology known as multi-agent orchestration.“When you look at multi-agent orchestration, what it does is it gives freedom for retailers to choose their own set of robotic technologies,” Akash Gupta, co-founder and CEO of robotics fulfillment firm GreyOrange Inc., told FreightWaves.Multi-agent orchestration, also referred to as multi-robot orchestration, is a software that can integrate large and diverse fleets of mobile robots — even robots from different manufacturers — with the aim of creating a seamless warehouse/fulfillment center workflow.GreyOrange’s GreyMatter is the company’s orchestration software platform, which robots can use to communicate with other robots and systems, enabling real-time coordination of warehouse operations.“The whole purpose of multi-agent orchestration is not binding retailers to one particular solution or one particular type of technology because there are different types of fulfillment centers in different sectors,” Gupta said. “Some robotics solutions fit well for dark stores, different ones fit for omnichannel fulfillment centers, and there are places where you want two or three different technologies to kind of come together and get coordinated with each other, and the multi-agent orchestrator basically has all those feature sets.”A recent Gartner report titled “Predicts 2023: Supply Chain Technology” said that over 50% of companies deploying autonomous mobile robots in their warehouses will have a multi-agent orchestration platform by 2026.“There’s two components to the multi-agent orchestration platform — there’s the integration and there’s the orchestration,” Dwight Klappich, one of the report’s authors, told FreightWaves. “The orchestration is how do I coordinate the activities of maybe multiple things, not just sending a message to them.”Story continuesIn the report, current users of workplace robotics were asked if they intended to expand their robot fleets; 86% of respondents said they do. Another 96% of current robotics users said they planned to expand their use of robotics to new tasks in the workplace.Logistics expert Dr. Larry D. Parker Jr. also believes more automation is heading toward commercial transportation and logistics as supply chains shift.The pandemic highlighted logistical strengths and weaknesses and the need for automation in supply chains, said Parker, American Public University System department chair in supply chain and logistics.“As a company, you’ve squeezed every line out of your business, and it’s impacted by what we saw in the pandemic,” Parker said. “It brought everything to light where if you’re a viable business, you found ways to enhance the bottom line, which is logistics. How am I going to ensure I’m getting my products? How am I going to get the most out of the supply chain? The answer is automation, which has been impacting the supply chain for 10 years already, but the velocity is increasing and the consumer is now ready to embrace it.”A recent Gartner report titled “Predicts 2023: Supply Chain Technology” said that over 50% of companies deploying autonomous mobile robots in their warehouses will have a multi-agent orchestration platform by 2026. (Photo: Shutterstock)Multi-agent orchestration software revolutionizing roboticsSome of the first robots used in the workplace arrived at General Motors in 1962, when the automaker installed an industrial robot arm on a vehicle assembly production line.The first warehouse robots also emerged in the early 1960s, with the introduction of automated storage and retrieval systems to the warehousing industry, according to GreyOrange.According to the 2020 world robotics report by the International Federation of Robotics, there are around 2.7 million industrial robots in use worldwide, a number that is quickly growing.While there are no exact figures for the total number of warehouse robots worldwide, e-commerce giant Amazon alone has more than 520,000 robotic units currently in use across its fulfillment and sortation centers.Jonathan Morav, head of product and strategy at Fabric, said its customers are looking to automate their fulfillment strategies for a variety of reasons, including labor shortages or the need to meet customers’ rapid delivery expectations.“We have customers come to Fabric for a variety of reasons, but no matter what prompts them to seek a robotics solution, the benefits they reap in turn are immense in terms of mitigating labor shortage struggles, optimizing efficient operations in smaller spaces and lessening delivery operations’ environmental footprint,” Morav said.New York-based Fabric is a retail technology company that provides intelligent robotic fulfillment systems. The company’s clients include traditional legacy grocers, as well as other retailers in the health and beauty space.“We saw a massive uptick in e-commerce during the pandemic and as the world pivots back to in-person operations, brick-and-mortar retail stores are certainly competing with e-commerce brands,” Morav said.Warehouse robotics has evolved with autonomous mobile robots (AMRs), machines that can assist warehouse associates with picking, moving loads and more. In the past couple of years, advanced sensors and artificial intelligence have been added to AMRs.Klappich said warehouse robots in this context have a two-part system — the robot itself, which is for a specialized task, and the software that controls it.The rise of e-commerce and customers’ expectations of faster shipments fueled more demand for warehouse automation. About five years ago, Gartner began seeing more customers ask about warehouse robots and the different jobs they can do throughout the logistics industry, Klappich said.“Some of [Gartner’s] leading-edge customers saw what Amazon had done — so we started covering robots,” Klappich said. “What we started to see pretty quickly is once customers did one robot, they started looking around going, ‘Hey, what else can we do? We were successful over there, what about over here? What about over there?’ We started to see companies looking to apply robots in lots of different places.”Many warehouses are now using robots from multiple providers, which has given rise to the need for multi-agent orchestration software.At this year’s annual ProMat, several companies — including GreyOrange, Locus Robotics and CoEvolution — launched or released information about their orchestration solutions. ProMat, which took place in Chicago in March, is a trade show for the manufacturing and supply chain industries.Long Wong, the U.S. director for CoEvolution, said the multi-agent orchestration field is still relatively new. The company recently launched its multi-agent orchestration solution in the U.S. after entering the Asian market several years ago. CoEvolution was founded in China in 2019.“A lot of companies are definitely trying to solve these problems that companies are faced with. There’s a great big demand in the market for these types of solutions,” Wong said. “You need to have software solutions that can integrate with different robots to produce a total solution that’s customized to the need.”CoEvolution is a provider of intelligent logistics solutions, including multi-agent orchestration software for fleets of robots. The company does not supply its own robots, but allows warehouses to deploy bots from any number of different vendors using different control systems.“We can put multiple robots together using multi-robot orchestration software to have a solution that can fit into most of the cases that we see both in warehouses, even festival e-commerce warehouses and also manufacturing sites,” Wong said.Many warehouses are now using robots from multiple providers, which has given rise to the need for multi-agent orchestration software. (Photo: Shutterstock)Several years ago, GreyOrange began working with Gartner’s Klappich to research the multi-agent orchestration market. Klappich and GreyOrange actually coined the term “multi-robot orchestration” to describe the new software niche, officials said.GreyOrange, founded in 2012, is based in Atlanta, with offices across the Americas, Europe and Asia. The company is a global provider of robotics hardware, software, robotics and omnichannel retail management solutions.In January, GreyOrange launched its open application programming interface, which enables any vendor that’s part of the company’s certified ranger network of robots to connect to its fulfillment orchestration platform.“Gartner started talking to retailers in terms of if they see the need for something like orchestration, and that’s where we established multi-agent orchestration,” Gupta said. “As the automation evolves, and as the robotics automation gets accelerated, multi-agent orchestration is going to be an important part of it.”Morav said automated warehouse and fulfillment solutions should be considered on a case-by-case basis.“There’s no blanket solution in terms of how many robots work best for every company, but generally speaking, brands and company leaders should look for solutions that are flexible,” Morav said. “One of Fabric’s grocery sites actually operates in an underground parking garage below a skyscraper in the heart of Tel Aviv. The space is triangular with low 12-foot ceilings, an unassuming location for such modern technology. But this type of adaptability coupled with results gives retailers more flexibility around how and where to invest in warehouse space and automation.”Warehouses nationwide see rising labor costs, staffing needsOne of the recurring economic themes in the U.S. over the last several years has been the rising cost of labor. It comes at a time when many companies across various industries are having trouble attracting workers.The transportation sector, along with food service, hospitality, health care and social assistance, have had the highest numbers of job openings, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, one of the nation’s largest business trade organizations.“We hear every day from our member companies — of every size and industry, across nearly every state — they’re facing unprecedented challenges trying to find enough workers to fill open jobs,” a recent report from the Chamber of Commerce said. “Right now, the latest data shows that we have 9.9 million job openings in the U.S., but only 5.8 million unemployed workers.”Warehouse workers primarily operate in the manufacturing, transportation and logistics industries. The average hourly wage for a nonsupervisory warehouse worker in the U.S. was $22.66 in April, compared to $21.54 last year and $19.19 in April 2020, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data.Warehousing employment across the country hit a peak of 1.96 million jobs in June 2022, according to the BLS, but has fallen to 1.91 million as of May, shedding almost 50,000 workers.Some of the worker reductions in the warehouse sector are tied to layoffs caused by decreasing consumer demand for goods. Amazon has laid off almost 30,000 employees since January, including thousands of fulfillment center workers around the country. Since April, Walmart has laid off more than 3,000 warehouse fulfillment workers, including at facilities in California, Texas, Pennsylvania, Florida and New Jersey.Warehousing employment across the country hit a peak of 1.96 million jobs in June 2022, but has shed almost 50,000 workers over the past year. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)At about the same time Walmart was laying off warehouse workers around the country, the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer announced it will be investing heavily in automation to speed up order processing at its e-commerce fulfillment facilities. Walmart said it expected that at least 65% of its stores will be serviced by automation by 2026.“As the changes are implemented across the business, one of the outcomes is roles that require less physical labor but have a higher rate of pay,” Walmart said in a meeting with shareholders in April.Some of the advantages cited for using more automation in warehouses and fulfillment centers include productivity and safety. Robots don’t get tired and don’t get distracted, experts said.“When you’re looking at the longer view, there will be more automation, there’ll be more robots, there will be smarter technology to help us do everything in our life, basically, and warehouse and manufacturing is no exception,” Wong said.Parker said autonomous technology will have the biggest impact on warehousing, while artificial intelligence will change how freight is routed through the supply chain.“The first big impact will be in warehouse management and then we will see artificial intelligence that is highly involved in the planning and forecasting of logistics, with the ability to use a lot of the blockchain or cloud data that’s available,” Parker said.Parker believes that full industrial automation of the supply chain, including trucking, warehouses, maritime shipping and other critical sectors, is about 10 to 20 years away.“I would say the main prohibitions or challenges to full autonomy would be twofold: safety and politics,” Parker said. “Safety, because with automation, you’re still going to have to operate around people, people will still be involved in the operation. It’s also politics, simply because the amount of individuals that are employed by the supply chain is enormous — just truck drivers alone is over 3.5 million people. If we were to fully automate to the extent that we could, a politician stands the risk of putting half their constituents out of work. It’s not a question of whether or not we can, it’s whether we should or not.”Click for more FreightWaves articles by Noi Mahoney.More articles by Noi MahoneyBorderlands: New Mexico lands first major auto parts manufacturing plantMexico-based mega carrier acquires US logistics firmFlorida tomato growers wants US to terminate Mexico trade dealThe post Will multi-robot orchestration platforms transform warehouse logistics? appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Gartner (NYSE:IT), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. View our latest analysis for Gartner Gartner's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingIf a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. To the delight of shareholders, Gartner has achieved impressive annual EPS growth of 54%, compound, over the last three years. Growth that fast may well be fleeting, but it should be more than enough to pique the interest of the wary stock pickers.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. Gartner maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 15% to US$5.6b. That's progress.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyFortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of Gartner's future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.Story continuesAre Gartner Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Gartner, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$886m. This suggests that leadership will be very mindful of shareholders' interests when making decisions!Does Gartner Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?Gartner's earnings per share growth have been climbing higher at an appreciable rate. That EPS growth certainly is attention grabbing, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke our interest. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. Based on the sum of its parts, we definitely think its worth watching Gartner very closely. We should say that we've discovered 3 warning signs for Gartner (1 makes us a bit uncomfortable!) that you should be aware of before investing here.Although Gartner certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

Per the preliminary data released by the market research firm, PC shipments in the April-June 2023 quarter plunged 16.6% year over year to 59.7 million units.However, the second-quarter PC shipment data shows a strong improvement from the first quarter when PC vendors had shipped 55.2 million units. The research firm sees the sequential improvement in PC shipments as an initial sign of stabilization in the PC market.Mikako Kitagawa, Director Analyst at Gartner, stated that “The rate of decline in the PC market has slowed, indicating that shipment volumes may have reached their lowest point.” She further added, “There has been progress in reducing PC inventory after more than a year of issues, supported by a gradual increase in business PC demand. Gartner expects that PC inventory will normalize by the end of 2023, and PC demand will return to growth starting in 2024.”Industry 5YR % Return Industry 5YR % ReturnIndustry 5YR % ReturnIn 2020 and 2021, PC manufacturers had benefited from the increased demand amid the pandemic-induced remote-working and online-learning wave. The pandemic necessitated using PC systems for remote work, web-based learning, video conferencing, video gaming, social media, consumer entertainment and streaming or online shopping.However, the back-to-back seven quarters of declining PC shipments depict an end to the industry’s demand boom. We believe that consumers have become more cautious about their spending due to inflationary pressure, rising interest rates and fears of a possible recession. Furthermore, enterprises are delaying their large IT spending amid macroeconomic challenges.Per the data compiled by Gartner, all top vendors registered a decline in their PC shipments in the second quarter. Dell Technologies DELL registered the highest fall of 21.8% to 10.4 million units, followed by Acer 21.1% to 4 million PCs.Story continuesPC volumes of Lenovo LNVGY fell 20.8% to 14.3 million units, while ASUS registered a decrease of 17.3% to 3.9 million units. HP Inc. HPQ and Apple AAPL both registered a modest decline in their PC shipments. While HP’s PC shipments fell 0.9% to 13.5 million units, Apple’s shipments dropped 0.3% to 5.3 million PCs.Per Gartner, Lenovo continues to hold the top spot on the vendor list, followed by HP and Dell with a market share of 24%, 22.5% and 17.4%, respectively. Apple, Acer and ASUS ended the April-June quarter with a market share of 8.9%, 6.7% and 6.5%, respectively.Among the leading vendors, Dell carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The wax — along with algae-derived butter, oil and hydro (an extract with moisturizing properties) — could help revolutionize an industry whose consumers and companies have been seeking such alternatives for years.Alexandra Dowling Lari, left, and Danielle Zakon photographed in Woods Hole overlooking Oyster Pond Wednesday.“When Dani reached out to me, I immediately understood how impactful a development like this could be for the industry,” Dowling Lari said in phone interview. ""Johnson and Johnson, L’Oréal, Estée Lauder, Unilever and Beiersdorf have come together to create guidelines around sustainability and shrink their carbon footprint."" But the origin of Upwell Cosmetics was a long one, founded on research, entrepreneurship, experience in the cosmetic industry, a simple online search and a chance conversation in a Woods Hole coffee shop.Lipsticks, shampoos, skin care, sunscreen, soaps and morePetroleum-based ingredients can be found in everything from lipsticks, shampoos, skin care and anti-aging products to sunscreen, soaps and conditioners.Petroleum products are made from crude oil and the hydrocarbons contained in natural gas, and also from coal, natural gas, and biomass, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. After crude oil, for example, is removed from the ground, it is sent to a refinery where different parts are separated into useable petroleum products. Refineries and blending facilities add other oils and liquids during processing to produce the finished products that are sold to consumers.Story continuesThe ingredients in cosmetics include paraffin wax, petrolatum, polyethylene glycols (known as PEGs), and more. The ingredients are waxes, butters, oils and agents used as thickeners, softeners and moisturizers.  They help smooth, stabilize and condition products for skin, lips and hair.And many people want to be “beautiful.”According to a survey of 2,300 people by the Environmental Working Group, respondents used an average of nine personal care products daily, with 25% of women claiming to use 15 or more products daily. And while most men may not use makeup, they do use shampoos, toothpaste, soaps and lotions.A growing demand for cosmetics with environmentally-friendly ingredientsThere's a growing demand for sustainable, environmentally-friendly ingredients in cosmetics, and cosmetic companies are responding. Maybelline offers vegan cosmetics. Half Magic offers vegan items and compostable compacts. L’Oreal for the Future lists the conglomerate’s steps toward sustainability by 2030. Managing natural resources, being environmentally responsible, and recapturing carbon dioxide are some of those steps. But moving away from petroleum-based ingredients has been difficult.Enter Christopher Reddy, a marine chemist, and Scott Lindell, a research specialist, with Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. In 2005 they began to study algal liquids from the microalgae Iysochrysis, a well-known and long-studied algae used in fish food. Reddy has spent decades studying oil spills and petrochemicals. The scientists initially thought they could produce fuel from the wax they produced.That hypothesis didn’t work.Reddy joined forces with Gregory O'Neil, a chemist at Western Washington University, trying to come up with uses for the ingredients. They landed on lipstick. The properties of the wax from Isochrysis is similar to the properties in petroleum-based ingredients used in lipstick. The scientists searched online for “cosmetic chemist,” and the first name that popped up was Gabriella Baki at the University of Toledo. The director of the Cosmetic Science and Formulation Design Program responded quickly to an email asking if she was interested in trying to formulate a lipstick from the wax, Reddy said. Alexandra Dowling Lari, left, and Danielle Zakon photographed in Woods Hole overlooking Oyster Pond Wedneday.Baki made lipstick and conducted a challenge of sorts, asking people to try a variety of lipsticks and choose their favorite. The lipstick made with algae won. The scientists published their research and got patents to protect their intellectual property. The work was published in December of 2019 in the International Journal of Cosmetics. Reddy gave a lecture on the research at Woods Hole.“It's pretty cool for a guy who studies oil spills to give a presentation and show lipstick,” Reddy said in a phone conversation. A happenstance connection at a coffee shop in Woods HoleZakon learned about the discovery by accident. She returned to Woods Hole in 2019 after building her own sustainable businesses overseas. She was looking for another sustainable business venture and a scientist overheard her conversation at a coffee shop in Woods Hole. He told her about Reddy’s work.“I realized the potential went beyond lipstick and could be used across the industry,” Zakon said in a phone interview. “It was exactly what I wanted to do.”Reddy was won over by Zakon’s marine science and business background, and her enthusiasm and energy. “It's difficult not to embrace her passion,” he said. “She decided that she was going to make this happen.” Zakon found a partner in Dowling Lari, another Woods Hole native with experience in the cosmetics industry. She’d worked for several firms, the latest an ocean-based beauty brand.Zakon and Lari both grew up in Woods Hole, and knew each other in school.Cosmetic companies want the samples, according to Alexandra Dowling LariThe two women have reached out to a long list of cosmetic companies and have spoken to six of the eight largest conglomerates that own 182 of the brands, according to Dowling Lari. Companies have lined up for samples, she said. An independent formulator is finalizing the ingredient profiles for the wax, oil, butter and hydro. By the end of the summer, the women hope to produce enough ingredients for small independent companies. It will take time to ramp up production to supply larger conglomerates, Zakon said. Is the production of microalgae ecologically friendly?The production of microalgae in bioreactors promises to be ecologically friendly and sustainable.Bioreactors, a closed system of clear tubes with water running through them, would take up less space, use less water, cause less deforestation and absorb more carbon dioxide than that required for growing plant-based derivatives used in cosmetics, according to Zakon. And the controlled production makes for consistent products, which is what petroleum-based products deliver.“The operation is highly sustainable and controlled,” Zakon said.Reddy has worked on a lot of projects trying to find sustainable replacements. Many of them fail. He thinks Zakon and Upwell Cosmetics is going to do great.""Dani has a product that has been tested and evaluated by one of the top cosmetic chemists in the country,"" he said. ""I think she has the timing, brain power, initiative and a product that’s been shown to work.""Denise Coffey writes about business and tourism. Contact her at dcoffey@capecodonline.com.

That’s good news for savers, but bad news for lenders as they prepare to release their second-quarter results.US banks spent the last several months competing with each other to keep or bring back depositors following the turmoil that took down three sizable regional institutions and triggered outflows across the banking system.That scramble pushed rates on savings accounts to 5.05% at the end of the second quarter, according to Bankrate, their steepest level since February 2008.Read more: The best high-yield savings account rates for July 2023The challenge for banks across the US is that these higher funding costs are eating into a key measure of profitability known as net interest margin, which measures the difference between what lenders make from their loans and what they pay for their deposits.That will likely act as a drag on results for some banks in the quarter, especially the mid-sized regional institutions that ran into trouble last spring, while reducing estimates of what they can earn for the rest of the year.“The surprises this quarter will be for the banks that do not lower expectations,” Wells Fargo bank analyst Mike Mayo told Yahoo Finance.Banks, added Argus Research's Stephen Biggar, ""have a deposit conundrum.""'Green shoots'?These pressures will be at the front of mind for investors starting Friday as they digest the first set of second quarter earnings from JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), and State Street (STT).Bank of America (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS) report next Tuesday and Goldman Sachs (GS) next Wednesday. A slew of other regional banks will also report in the coming weeks.Some of the biggest US banks are expected to once again demonstrate their resilience and diversity, showing they can continue to charge more for their loans while leaning on their sprawling franchises to generate additional revenue.Story continuesJPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America are all expected to show jumps in net income when compared to the year-earlier period, according to analyst estimates, while Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley are expected to report profit declines.JPMorgan's headquarters in New York City. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Those that are more dependent on investment banking, such as Goldman, are expected to be particularly challenged by a recent drought in deal making.Global investment banking revenues for the second quarter fell by 8% from the first quarter and 52% from a year ago, according to Dealogic. However, the business improved through the second half of the quarter, prompting some observers to predict “green shoots” ahead.“I’m turning to believing investment banking will not have great earnings but they’re going to be surprising, and I think better than expected,” said Dick Bove, a bank analyst with Odeon Capital.Investors will also be watching to see whether many of these big banks increase the amounts they set aside for future loan losses, a sign that they expect the US economy and credit conditions to worsen.“We're starting to see some increased delinquencies, particularly in the credit card and auto lending market,” said Biggar, Argus Research's director of financial services.'A huge amount of problems'Smaller regional banks are clearly not under the same amount of pressure as they were in March, when the fall of Silicon Valley Bank triggered panic across the country.But they still “face a huge amount of problems,” Bove said.The core issue is an aggressive campaign by the Federal Reserve to bring down inflation with higher interest rates. That campaign is lowering the value of the assets banks hold, such as bonds, while deposit costs creep higher and loan demand slows.Read more: Why now is a good time to open a savings account“We view accelerating deposit costs, not accelerating deposit outflows, as the most significant headwind to earnings for the next several quarters,“ Manan Gosalia, a regional bank analyst for Morgan Stanley, said in a research note.Higher rates have traditionally worked to the advantage of banks since it allows them to charge more for their loans than their deposits.But the panic of the spring “has changed the calculus a bit” for some banks, the Fed’s vice chair of supervision Michael Barr said Monday. Some lenders “are now paying up more for deposits,” and the Fed is “paying careful attention to that.”Silicon Valley Bank was seized on March 10. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)The Fed has made it clear that more hikes are coming this year. Regulators are also preparing new capital requirements for banks with more than $100 billion in assets that will force some to hold greater buffers against losses. That will increase the stability of those lenders but will also make it even more difficult to earn robust profits in the near term.Many banks have already warned at a conference in June that their net interest margins are going to drop by more than they expected for the quarter or the year, including executives for US Bancorp (USB), Citizens Financial Group (CFG), Comerica (CMA), Huntington (HBAN), KeyCorp (KEY), and Zions (ZION).“I’ve only been a banker for 10 years, so I haven’t seen a time when we’ve needed deposits as an industry as much as we do now,” Darrin Williams, the CEO of the 58-branch Southern Bancorp, told Yahoo Finance.The amount Southern Bancorp is paying customers has risen 600% since the Fed’s interest rate hiking cycle began, Williams added.“Our cost of funds continues to rise just because our customers demand that.”The larger banks aren’t immune to some of these same challenges.“Deposits will continue the trend of being slightly down from here,” Jennifer Piepszak, co-CEO of JPMorgan Chase's massive consumer and community bank, said at a conference in June.The bank has predicted it will earn net interest income of $84 billion in 2023, but if the deposit pressure keeps up, that figure could experience a “mild reprice,” she said.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

Such a relationship with Morgan Stanley would have given Frasers access to the full suite of financial tools used by institutions and hedge funds to play the markets.In an email to subordinates in March 2021 Mr Smith, then head of Europe, wrote: “Guys it’s coming to me that we are talking to Mike Ashley’s team and it’s getting more real. I honestly don’t like it… It will take an awful lot to convince me.”Documents disclosed to the court by Morgan Stanley describe Mr Smith’s reaction as “visceral”. There is no suggestion that his view was unlawful.When Morgan Stanley discovered Frasers was using its share trading services “through the back door” two months later, it sparked a series of concerned phone calls between bankers about the “franchise risk” of doing business with Mr Ashley, the documents show.They referred to him as an “activist” investor whose campaigns to influence his targets might threaten the bank’s relationships with other corporate clients. The documents cite a “very clear edict from our CEO [James Gorman] around this type of business and our inability to support it”.In one transcript, Dominic Freemantle, a senior equities banker, told colleague Chris Cheverall: “[The investment banking division] have had interactions with [Mr Ashley] in the past where they think that… he did not behave in a way that was trustworthy. These are the words that they’re throwing around.”Mr Cheverall subsequently told another colleague: “We just don’t like the ultimate beneficial owner behind it. We just don’t like him.”A spokesman for Morgan Stanley said: “Frasers has never been a client of Morgan Stanley. This claim is contrived and without merit and we will defend it vigorously.”Story continuesFrasers, a frequent High Court claimant, is pursuing a damages claim against Morgan Stanley that it believes will expose what it regards as the machinations of the investment banking establishment.At a hearing last month Morgan Stanley agreed to add Mr Smith to the list of individuals whose communications will be searched for evidence before a trial next year.The bank denies any wrongdoing in what it labels a “contrived” claim from a company with which it has never had a direct contractual relationship. It told the court it has absolute discretion over whether to accept a client.“In circumstances where one division of Morgan Stanley had rejected Frasers as a client, it is entirely unsurprising that another division declined to adopt an inconsistent stance,” Morgan Stanley told the High Court.The case hinges on Frasers’ claims that the margin call was unlawful because it was “arbitrary, irrational, capricious, and/or in breach of good faith and/or market practice”. At £1bn it was “out of all proportion to any risk to which Morgan Stanley was exposed”, Fraser alleges.After the retailer was refused a brokerage account, it turned to the much smaller Danish institution Saxo Bank to help it build a stake in the German fashion house Hugo Boss.One of Mr Ashley’s frequent stock market punts on what he viewed as an undervalued target, the investment in Boss was also intended to improve Frasers’ relationship with an important supplier to its House of Fraser and Flannels chains.The margin call – a demand for cash within hours to cover the risk of adverse share price movements – was calculated and imposed on Saxo and passed onto Frasers after Morgan Stanley applied a stress test that assumed a 400pc move in Boss stock.The Wall Street giant maintains that it did not know Mr Ashley was Saxo’s client when it imposed the margin call, which came against a backdrop of increased concern over risk in the market.However, Frasers alleges that Mr Smith’s view of Mr Ashley played a significant role in Morgan Stanley’s “irrational” refusal to accept attempts to pledge shares or other collateral.Frasers had used options to build its stake and offered to pledge its actual shares in Boss. When that was turned down Mr Ashley offered up his entire £1.9bn stake in Frasers, as well as £100m cash as collateral, which was also rejected.It threatened to force Mr Ashley into a chaotic retreat that he claims would have destabilised the entire Frasers empire through speculation about its finances.The retailer told the High Court this represented “an inappropriate attempt to coerce Frasers into closing out its positions and/or transferring the options away from Morgan Stanley”.Through the disclosure process it is seeking to explore whether Morgan Stanley might have somehow benefitted from such trades. It denies it was acting as an activist against Boss.The bank told the court its decisions on collateral were rational and partly driven by Frasers’ insistence it gave unacceptable undertakings.Documents show that while negotiations with Frasers and Saxo remained open, Morgan Stanley had decided it would not accept any form of collateral and wanted the Boss position off its books.The sensitivities of its apparently shifted position – described in one internal call as “moving the goalposts” – meant it would seek a “very quiet off the record conversation” with Saxo to explain.Mr Freemantle told Mr Cheverall: “I don’t want to have a f---ing call with five people mate… if we’re going to have this conversation with them about this issue it has to be a quiet conversation.”Later that day Mr Cheverall told a colleague he had been warned not to say anything negative about Frasers. “These people don’t hesitate to get litigious,” he said.The case has taken on new significance as Frasers steps up its investing in other companies in the retail industry.In just the last few weeks it has emerged on the shareholder registers at Boohoo, AO World, Currys and Next, and increased its stake in Asos. After parting company with Saxo and Morgan Stanley, Mr Ashley was able to agree a prime brokerage account with HSBC which he is now using to confound retail analysts as to his aims.Mr Ashley was able to transfer the Boss options with “significant commercial and reputational damage” risked by the margin call. Nevertheless, Frasers has claimed more than £45m in damages from the restrictions the crisis imposed on its share dealing.The case continues.Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

To give us his take on what stocks we should be buying right now and the ones to avoid, let's bring in Brian Mulberry, Client Portfolio Manager at Zacks Investment Management.We're going to start with your picks, what you like right now. Vail Resort, specifically, you're looking at the travel space right now. That stock not at the highs-- you know, still below the high of the year. But we have seen consumers, despite some headwinds and concerns about higher prices, shelling out on travel.BRIAN MULBERRY: Yeah, absolutely. It's a way to access the consumer in a slightly different way, where we're seeing the revenge travel trade is still occurring. What we're noticing about Vail in particular is that season pass sales are up about 6%. And they're having a really good recapture rate when it comes to renewing pass holders from last year. And on top of that, they've actually been able to increase prices. So actual sales in dollars are up 11% on that 6% higher season pass sale.So we're looking at a way to take advantage of the consumer spending that has been really durable over the last year. And it's one of the reasons we like Vail. Vail has also done a great job of providing a different menu of passes available and also different destinations. Now, international, we're seeing very strong demand for their resorts in Australia. And there's been some great cross-selling opportunities for consumers internationally to access the US mountains and markets, and then obviously, for US consumers to travel abroad.Story continuesAnd so we're definitely still seeing consumers spend money at a very high rate. And it's one of those ways that we can access this type of a stock at a good price that's still set to continue to grow.SEANA SMITH: But Brian, how should investors be looking at a name like this given the fact that we are still at a risk of recession. There is some signs that the consumer is cracking just a little bit, pulling back on some of their spending. Is a name like Vail, is that going to be able to withstand some of that volatility?BRIAN MULBERRY: We think it is, because there's definitely a big dividing line in the consumer right now. And it's simply this, if you owned your home during the pandemic, you had a once-in-a-generation opportunity to refinance your biggest debt, which is usually your mortgage, on your biggest asset, your home, that appreciated probably 30% to 40% in value. You're able to pay off your cars, your student loans, all these other debts and credit cards. And you now have a much cleaner personal balance sheet.Your personal net income is probably in much better shape than it ever was before. And that lends a little bit more consistency to this consumer spending picture that we're seeing. Unfortunately, if you didn't own your home, those are definitely the consumers that are feeling the pinch of high inflation as well as high interest rates at this point in time.And so we're definitely keeping a close eye on it. We're aware of it. But there is a way to still bet on the consumer. And we think this is one of the ways to do that.AKIKO FUJITA: Another stock you're really hot on, CSX. This is in the rail space. What do you like there?BRIAN MULBERRY: What we're seeing is just a really consistent level of volume, in terms of the rail traffic that they have. They've actually been able to grow by almost 40% in terms of their coal transportation. A lot of that coal is going to produce electricity in other places. And so they've been able to keep up with a really high level of demand. And the execution in the transportation space is one of those things that leads to better margins overall.So again, not a huge valuation. It's one of those ways to invest in something that doesn't have a gigantic PE forward multiple but also has really good, durable earnings. They're also rewarding shareholders by raising their dividend. They actually increase their dividend by 10% earlier this year. And so it's a way to be a little bit more defensive in your allocation.But we also believe that energy overall might be a better place in the second half of the year. And this is just a different way to access those types of returns. Looking at what we've seen in terms of the price of coal and now demand for it coming up, it's going to be a better back half of the year for these types of names in our opinion.SEANA SMITH: Brian, one of the names that you're advising investors to stay away from is CVS. We know the stock has been under pressure now for some time, off pretty significantly since the start of the year. What do you see as pressuring the company here going forward?BRIAN MULBERRY: Well, there's a couple of different reasons that we see, I think, a material decline in both profitability and overall earnings. And obviously, it's one being that they're not getting reimbursed for COVID testing and COVID vaccines at nearly the rate that they were a year or two years ago.But also, in addition to that, you know, there's a lot of regulatory pressure on prices at pharmacies for drugs. And that's good for consumers, but it's net bad for the balance sheet for somebody like CVS when we're seeing more generic drugs available but less reimbursement coming from distributing those generic drugs. It's kind of a double whammy on a company like CVS, where they're not getting the reimbursement from COVID protocols. And now, there's pressure on prices at the pharmacy, which is normally, you know, their top breadwinner, if you will, in terms of generating that revenue.So we think it's going to be a bit of a tough slog for CVS for the next couple of quarters until they can kind of get things figured out where their margins might be headed.AKIKO FUJITA: And finally, Brian, you were talking about some opportunities in the energy spaces. Next name-- next name not necessarily one that you would encourage investors to stay on top of. What are the concerns you have with FirstEnergy?BRIAN MULBERRY: FirstEnergy kind of has an aging grid, if you will. This is a power utility. And while there is a lot of demand for electricity, the way that it's been generated has not been profitable for them. And unfortunately, it's a publicly traded utility that has price caps, if you will. They have to get permission in order to raise their rates to be more profitable in most of the markets that they serve.They've been having a difficult time accessing equipment, maintaining equipment. And like I said, their aging grid is really just been a drag on their overall profitability. So this is one of those energy type names that we would avoid, because it just seems like their execution is a little bit behind the curve. And this is one of those things where certainly the supply chain has affected their ability to get the parts that they need to upgrade their grid and their distribution facilities for sure.But it's definitely weighing on their overall earnings and profitability picture. So this is a name that we would be cautious of in the next couple of quarters.SEANA SMITH: All right. Brian Mulberry of Zacks Investment Management, thanks.]"

We will also cover an interesting analysis of why students work part-time while studying, while exploring the emerging trends in the jobs that college students pursue and the highest paying jobs out of college. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to 5 Highest-Paying Part-Time Jobs for College Students. How Common Are Part-Time Jobs for College Students?Working while attending college has become increasingly common, particularly due to the rising cost of tuition and the weight students bear for their college loans. Recent statistics reveal that 43% of full-time students and 81% of part-time students hold jobs while pursuing their education. In the state of Tennessee, a study found that working while in college is particularly prevalent among community college students, first-generation students, and individuals who have decided to return to college later in life.According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, in July 2022, 55.3% of young individuals aged 16 to 24 had jobs, showing a slight increase from 54.4% in July 2021. However, this figure remained lower than the pre-pandemic level of 56.2% in July 2019. The unemployment rate for youth in July 2022 was 8%, down from 10.0 percent in July 2021, but relatively similar to July 2019's rate of 9.1%.During the months of April to July 2022, there was a substantial growth in the employment of this age group, which includes those actively seeking employment or already working, with a rise of 2.6 million or 12.9%.Trends Observed in Jobs for the College Students in 2023One prominent emerging trend in the part-time job market for college students is the rise of remote work which is here to stay. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of remote work which has created tremendous opportunities for students to engage in virtual internships, freelance work, and online tutoring. This flexibility allows students to earn income from the comfort of their own homes, eliminating the constraints of geographical location and providing valuable work experience that aligns with their academic interests. Platforms like GitLab Inc (NASDAQ:GTLB) and Upwork Inc (NYSE:UPWK) have emerged as global facilitators of remote work with competitive salaries for individuals irrespective of age and gender.Story continuesAnother trend is the growth of the sharing economy, which includes sectors like food delivery, home services, and short-term rentals. Companies such as DoorDash Inc (NYSE:DASH) and Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB) have disrupted traditional industries that have presented students with part-time job opportunities that offer higher-than-average wages and the freedom to choose their working hours. This trend also reflects the evolving preferences of consumers and the increasing reliance on technology-based services.Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB) also facilitates remote work by enabling individuals to book accommodations for longer stays. The platform has revamped its search function that allows users to explore listings by specific categories, and introduced a ""split stays"" feature, making it easier for remote workers to divide their time between two properties. Airbnb Inc (NASDAQ:ABNB) has recognized the growing trend of remote work and has made significant upgrades, including over 150 features aimed at work-from-anywhere employees.Furthermore, as younger generations join the workforce, there is a growing emphasis on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) as an essential component of companies' recruitment and retention policies. Consequently, DEI is shifting from being a “good-to-have” quality to a mandatory requirement for attracting and retaining young talent. This trend underscores the need for organizations to offer standard DEI initiatives, including employee resource groups, mentoring programs, and equitable representation in leadership positions.One specific initiative by Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) to ensure diversity and inclusion is the establishment of the Racial Equality and Justice Task Force. This task force consists of employees from various backgrounds, including leaders of the Black employee resource group, who collaborate to drive systemic change within the workplace and community.Moreover, Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) has also demonstrated incredible commitment to increasing the leadership representation of Black employees. They have set new goals to double the U.S. representation of Black employees in leadership positions (VP+) by the end of 2023.By addressing the underrepresentation of Black individuals in higher-level roles, Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) strives to create a more diverse and inclusive leadership team. They have pledged to spend $100 million with Black-owned businesses over the next three years to promote the growth and sustainability of these enterprises.What Jobs Make A Lot of Out of College?After completing their college education, graduates in certain majors can expect to secure high-paying jobs right away.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of popular hedge funds and their performance, head directly to 5 Most Owned Stocks by Hedge Funds. In 2022, the hedge fund industry experienced a decline of 2.4%, showing some improvement from a challenging first half of the year when the industry was down 4.6%. The losses were primarily influenced by the difficult market circumstances for high-risk assets, particularly impacting hedge funds with a long-biased approach and/or higher volatility. This marked the weakest performance for the hedge fund industry since 2018 when it also posted a 2.4% loss. Looking at the five-year performance, hedge funds have achieved a compounded annual return of +4.2%, demonstrating a more favorable performance compared to bonds, which experienced a decline of 2.0%. Aurum, a hedge fund investment specialist, noted that there were clear winners and losers in the hedge fund industry in 2022. The best-performing strategies were multi-strategy (+9.5%), quant (+8.5%), and macro (+6.7%). Strategies that typically have a higher correlation to equities and fixed income, which experienced poor performance, struggled the most. Patrick Ghali, managing partner of hedge fund advisory firm Sussex Partners, told Reuters on January 10, 2023: ""Investors need to look under the surface to understand the industry performance last year. Long-short hedge funds are the biggest asset-weighted part of the industry. Overall, I believe it was a good year for hedge funds.""Don't Miss: 15 Most Profitable Hedge Funds in the WorldAccording to Hedge Fund Research (HFR), the total global capital invested in hedge funds reached $3.83 trillion by the end of 2022, reflecting a quarterly increase of $44 billion. Hedge funds managed by The Citco Group Limited experienced a weighted-average return of -7.02% for the entire year. Smaller funds generally outperformed larger ones, as indicated by the median return of -2.86%. HFR also highlighted that macro strategies, including fundamental commodity, discretionary, and quantitative trend-following CTA sub-strategies, were the leading hedge fund strategies globally. Story continuesDespite the dull performance of hedge funds, Citadel, led by Ken Griffin, achieved an exceptional feat by generating an unprecedented $16 billion in profits for its clients in 2022. This performance not only surpassed other players in the industry but also stands as one of the most prominent financial successes in history. Chairman Rick Sopher of LCH Investments commented: “The largest gains were once again made by the large multi-strategy hedge funds like Citadel, DE Shaw and Millennium. The strong gains they have generated in recent years reflect their increasing dominance in strategies which do not depend on rising asset prices, and their substantial size.”Individual investors often look up to elite hedge funds and try to imitate their performance. Some of the most owned stocks by hedge funds include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).

(NYSE:WMT) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“The pandemic has created challenges for businesses large and small; one major challenge for large essential retailers such as ClearBridge holdings Home Depot, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Costco have been ensuring adequate staffing to meet demand under trying conditions. All three instituted enhanced pay practices during the pandemic, with raises, unplanned bonuses and other benefits helping compensate employees for their efforts in a difficult environment. In September 2020 Walmart raised wages for 165,000 employees, including a number of entry positions to $15 an hour. It followed this in February with a raise for 425,000 workers that moved its average pay above $15 an hour.”24.

JPMorgan Chase comes to mind especially here, but so does Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) despite its weakness in March, as well as U.S. Bancorp, to which we added opportunistically in the quarter.”23. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 95On June 27, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) stock saw a slight increase in pre-market trading after Bank of America expressed confidence in the company's strategic direction. Despite concerns regarding the box office, streaming business, and other challenges, analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich maintained a Buy rating and set a price target of $135 on the shares. The analyst acknowledged that some recent content, including the Pixar film Elemental, did not meet audience expectations, but attributed this to production circumstances during the pandemic and past leadership. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is one of the most owned stocks by hedge funds. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) was part of 95 hedge fund portfolios, with Nelson Peltz’s Trian Partners holding the largest stake, consisting of 5.9 million shares worth $592.4 million. VGI Partners made the following comment about The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) in its 2022 annual investor letter:“The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is a diversified media conglomerate operating media networks, theme parks, film and TV studios and direct-to-consumer streaming services. It is the global leader in theme parks with hotels and cruise lines aimed at families. Key assets within Disney are the instantly recognisable entertainment franchises that have multiple avenues of monetisation such as Mickey Mouse, Star Wars, ABC and Marvel’s Avengers.Disney’s share price declined due to a number of factors in 2022, presenting us the chance to purchase a long-admired business and its unique collection of valuable intellectual property assets at what we consider to be a very attractive valuation. Summarily, the EPS of Disney has declined from US$7 in 2018 to ~US$2.60 in 2022 but we believe that the earnings power of the assets has not diminished to anywhere near this extent.Disney is currently undergoing a business transition within the Media and Entertainment Distribution division (DMED) from traditional media property distribution via third parties (i.e. cinemas and broadcast networks) to a Direct-To-Consumer (DTC) model via the Disney+ streaming service. A key element of our thesis is that the earnings power of the company is currently being masked by the marketing and content investments within Disney+ and that this will normalize over the next several years. To put this in perspective, Disney+ (DTC sub-segment) currently generates operating losses of over US$3.3bn (a negative 14% operating margin) compared to operating margins at its nearest streaming competitor, Netflix, of +15.5%…” (Click here to read the full text)22.

ServiceNow’s renewal rates are noteworthy as not only are they best-in-class but they are also remarkably consistent, typically in the range of 97% to 99%. They speak to the mission critical nature of the platform and are a key driver of long term annuity value.

We took an initial position recently and are now raising it to an average weight within the Portfolio. During the most recent quarter, the company grew revenue 11% in constant currency. Core organic growth, excluding COVID-19 testing revenue which fell 16%, grew a very strong 13%. This company plays an important role within the Portfolio as a “safety” within our growth spectrum approach and over the next five years we expect EBITDA and EPS to grow at roughly low double digits and low teens, respectively.”20.

(NASDAQ:PYPL) in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom. PayPal will still carry out customer-facing operations, including underwriting and servicing associated with its European BNPL products.

If you own an iPhone, then you have an Apple Pay preloaded digital wallet. If you have a Samsung phone, you have Samsung Pay available for use. Those two, along with Google Pay and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), are the four most popular digital wallets today. According to the Payments Journal, PayPal has been used (over the last 12 months) by 62% of American consumers, followed by Apple Pay at 41% and Google Pay at 32%.Over the last several years, P2P payments have made tremendous strides in adoption and usage. Whenever something becomes a verb, like just Venmo me $10, you know that it has been widely embraced by society. The concept of allowing individuals to pay each other, via our smartphones, has clearly taken off.However, the biggest flaw or issue (that we’ve identified) is interoperability. Digital wallets allow users to pick their favorite card to make payments with. P2P acts as a bit of a “walled garden” and its funding source is still siloed. This is a critical aspect for future P2P growth, as Venmo users can’t pay Cash App users who can’t pay Zelle users. Visa is launching Visa+ next year and it has already signed up PayPal and Venmo as its initial customers. The global card networks seem like the perfect piece to solve this interoperability puzzle. Of course, this will only work if banks allow an independent network to serve as the gateway between disparate user bases…” (Click here to read the full text)17. Netflix, Inc.

(NYSE:JPM) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“It will be interesting to see what kind of policy decisions are made around regulation for institutions that are between $100 billion of assets and $700 billion of assets. As JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM)’s purchase of First Republic shows, scale is a competitive advantage. It now has 13% of total US deposits and it manages 21% of America’s credit card spending. With additional regulatory burdens coming, banks are facing a profitability headwind and 100 to 300 basis points of possible ROE erosion.The banking sector is facing a slow-moving crisis, but we aren’t sure it is enough to sink the overall health of the US consumer or economy. Credit will contract and lending standards will continue to rise. However, we do not see this problem escalating to the size and scale of previous banking crises.Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JP Morgan Chase clearly sees the risks these FINTECH companies present. In his annual letter to shareholders, he stated that all incumbent banks should be “scared shitless” of these FINTECH rivals. Not only is his bank being attacked from multiple angles, but Apple just launched a cash management program with Goldman Sachs. On the first day of Apple’s savings program, it raised $400 million and eclipsed $1 billion in its first four days. Dimon specifically labeled Apple a bank the other day in an interview when he said, “It may not have insured deposits, but it’s a bank. If you move money, hold money, manage money, lend money — that’s a bank.”14.

We did take advantage of improving sentiment to higher growth technology companies and the share price of more defensive companies drifting down to divest our investment in Adobe and increase the Fund’s investment in UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH). United Health’s share price was also under moderate pressure due to regulatory announcements being very slightly adverse. We believe the market over-reacted to these announcements and the share price has recovered strongly over recent weeks.”13.

Alibaba operates shopping platforms Taobao and Tmall and owns 33% of Ant Group, which operates Alipay, China’s largest third-party online payment provider. Shares of Alibaba were up this quarter, given meaningful margin expansion, guidance to stabilize core commerce market share in China, and an announced plan to split the company into six units which could further unlock value. We retain conviction that Alibaba is well positioned to benefit from China’s reopening and the ongoing growth in online commerce and cloud in China.”12. Activision Blizzard, Inc.

In January 2022, Microsoft (MSFT) agreed to acquire the company for $95/share, but regulators are determined to block the transaction, and appear increasingly activist, in our opinion.”11. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 131At the end of June 2023, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s valuation surpassed $3 trillion, solidifying its position as the world's most valuable company.

Technology rebounded from a challenging 2022 and many large tech companies are performing quite well this year. Through mid-May 2023, year-to-date performance of some of the most popular and largest tech names is impressive. For tech companies with market capitalizations over $1 trillion, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is up +35%, Microsoft +33%, Amazon +39%, and Google is +40%. In terms of contribution to the S&amp;P 500’s year-to-date return, Apple and Microsoft represent roughly half of its 2023 performance. Apple, and Microsoft now account for 13.9% of the entire S&amp;P 500 or 80% more concentrated than 2008. For additional perspective, Apple’s market cap is at $2.8 trillion and that is larger than the market cap of the entire Russell 2000. To conclude, it’s distinctly getting more concentrated at the top.For our purposes, we are just going to focus on software digital wallets, as they are much more common and accessible. If you own an iPhone, then you have an Apple Pay preloaded digital wallet. If you have a Samsung phone, you have Samsung Pay available for use. Those two, along with Google Pay and PayPal, are the four most popular digital wallets today. According to the Payments Journal, PayPal has been used (over the last 12 months) by 62% of American consumers, followed by Apple Pay at 41% and Google Pay at 32%.Digital wallets have tons of advantages that we are embracing. When we attend Tampa Bay Lightning games, we love having our season tickets easily accessible on our phones (via the Apple Pay wallet), as well as our timed parking pass. When we travel, loading the airline ticket into our Apple Pay wallet is much more convenient than printing out a paper boarding pass. Others are using digital wallets to track their expenses, budget properly, and even help them easily pay their bills. Digital wallets are still in their infancy and have decades of future growth; we believe the smartphone is simply the best interface and platform for digital wallets…” (Click here to read the full text)10. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 132NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), an American semiconductor giant, is one of the most owned stocks among smart investors.

Nvidia is a good example of a select growth stock bought opportunistically where our long-term thesis has bloomed. We initiated the position in the fourth quarter of 2018 knowing that inference and training in the data center was an interesting although still early-stage growth driver. We knew that GPUs could be used to solve complex computing problems, but we didn’t know how quickly the training and learning efforts by Nvidia’s mega cap customers would hit an inflection point. Volatility in the gaming business created the entry point into the stock and we have built the position accordingly over time. Since the end of 2021, the stock’s portfolio weight grew from 4.5% to a high of 7.2% earlier in the second quarter before we trimmed it to manage our overall position sizing.We will continue to monitor and adjust Nvidia’s position sizing to manage risk. Despite the sharp run up, we believe the company’s long-term runway remains compelling due to its advantaged positioning in a very large addressable market for GPUs. The current valuation looks expensive, yet Nvidia has real earnings and cash flow and the longer-term multiple looks more reasonable because of GPU pricing power.”9. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 136Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is an American tech company specializing in customer relationship management. On June 29, Salesforce, Inc.

(NYSE:CRM) is the largest pure-play cloud software company, holding a leading market share in customer relationship management applications and a top-five market share position in the company’s other clouds (Marketing, Service, Platform, Analytics, Integration, and Commerce). The company’s software subscription term-license model differs from the traditional perpetual-license software model in two respects: (1) the software is hosted on centralized servers and delivered over the internet, as opposed to traditional enterprise software that is loaded directly onto customers’ hard drives or servers; and (2) the revenue model is subscription-based, typically charging monthly fees per user as opposed to charging one-time licensing fees. The stock’s strong relative performance followed a strong F4Q23 earnings release that easily beat Street expectations on the top- and bottom-lines. In addition to the beat, management announced a number of initiatives that activist investors have been clamoring for, specifically a halt to large M&amp;A transactions and a focus on operating profitability.”8.

We are FINTECH investors, and we define Fintech as “anything utilizing technology to improve an established process.” We realize that half of Fintech is financial, but we don’t invest in traditional, credit sensitive banks. Having managed money during the Financial Crisis, we learned firsthand how certain opaque and balance sheet intensive financials could go bankrupt or insolvent.We prefer transaction-based businesses, generating recurring revenue, with sustainable margins, and significant cash flow. From our perspective, the perfect example of a FINTECH business is the secularly growing payments industry. Names like Visa or Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), that generate revenue and profit per swipe or transaction, without the underlying credit sensitivity or risk associated with that underlying line of credit.”7. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 144Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is an American mobility technology firm. On May 24, Uber Technologies, Inc.

Gross Bookings grew 19% year over year to $31 billion, driven by 31% Mobility Gross Bookings growth and 6% Delivery Growth Bookings growth. 4Q Adjusted EBITDA of $665 million, up $579 million year over year, significantly beating management’s $600-$630 million guidance. Management guided to continuing growth in 1Q for Gross Bookings (20%- 24% growth) and Adjusted EBITDA (of $660-$700 million).UBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing, with a greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates. The company is also a leader in food delivery, where it is number one or two in the more than 25 countries in which it operates. Moreover, after a history of losses, the company is now solidly profitable with the potential for substantial margin expansion and free cash flow generation to come. We view UBER as more than just ride sharing and food delivery, but also as a global mobility platform with the ability to sell to its 131 million users (by comparison, Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and penetrate new markets of on-demand services, such as package and grocery delivery, travel, truck brokerage (the company had $1.5 billion in Freight revenue for 4Q22), and worker staffing for shift work. Given its $4 billion of unrestricted cash and $5 billion of investments, the company today has an enterprise value of $70 billion, indicating that UBER trades at 1.6x next year’s estimated revenue.”6.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (U.S.) was the top contributor to the Fund’s performance for the quarter. Alphabet’s first-quarter search revenue growth accelerated slightly sequentially, which was notable given that advertising spending has decreased across the board. Management cited the company’s travel and retail segments for their strong performance in contrast to the declines experienced in the finance and in the media and entertainment businesses. Advertising spending has also stabilized at YouTube, and the focus on “shorts” has driven strong viewership growth. In the near term, YouTube’s investment in shorts may not generate significant revenue, but we believe its profitability will accelerate over time. Alphabet’s cloud business reached GAAP profitability this quarter, moving from a -12% margin this quarter last year to a 3% margin this quarter. On the AI front, Alphabet upgraded Bard to run on its more powerful PaLM language model, and Bard can now assist with coding and software development. CEO Sundar Pichai compared AI’s evolution to the transition from desktop to mobile computing a decade ago and said there is “a lot more to come” in terms of its consumer AI applications. CFO Ruth Porat revised 2023 capital expenditures guidance due to higher spending on data center construction and servers that will support AI developments in consumer products, advertiser tools and the cloud business. Porat reiterated that the company plans to continue to hold expense growth below revenue growth and that Alphabet’s cost-reduction initiatives should bear fruit later this year and into 2024. At Alphabet’s annual developer conference in May, the company showcased an impressive array of new AI-powered consumer tools, which will be rolled out over the course of the year. Investors reacted positively to these presentations, which highlighted the extent of AI innovation occurring at Alphabet.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Most Owned Stocks by Hedge Funds. Suggested articles:10 Best Economic Recovery Stocks to Buy11 Best Breakout Stocks to Buy Now12 Best Mining Stocks Hedge Funds Are Buying Disclosure: None. 25 Most Owned Stocks by Hedge Funds is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

At $222, the stock is eyeing its 52-week high of $223.38 hit on May 31.The advance has brought shares just beyond a 66% gain year to date.Salesforce co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff has seen his net worth rise $2.5 billion in 2023 as a result, propelling it to $8.4 billion, according to Bloomberg data.What ignited the July run in Salesforce's stock was initial speculation the company would raise product prices, which the Street had wanted to see for a while. That maneuver by Benioff came to fruition this week.The company said it would increase its list prices by an average of 9% across its sales cloud, service cloud, marketing cloud, industries, and Tableau businesses in August. The new pricing will go into effect globally for new and existing customers buying cloud services in August and for existing contracts as they are renewed.CEO of Salesforce Marc Benioff arrives at the Sun Valley Lodge for the Allen &amp; Company Sun Valley Conference on July 11, 2023, in Sun Valley, Idaho. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) (Kevin Dietsch via Getty Images)Deutsche Bank analyst Brad Zelnick thinks the price hikes will drive a ""meaningful lift"" to Salesforce's cash flow in 2024. The team at JPMorgan said in a client note that the announcement marks a ""material positive development"" for Salesforce's efforts to improve sales and profit margins.And then there are hot takes by the likes of Wedbush's Dan Ives.""The price increase was the Hulk Hogan-like power move we like from Salesforce,"" the Salesforce bull told Yahoo Finance.Salesforce's move on prices could be a sign of more to come as it releases new AI tools for clients, and looks to get rewarded that innovation.The company introduced ""AI Cloud"" in mid-June at a NYC event that also included Salesforce board members in the room.Story continuesSalesforce says its AI Cloud product will allow marketers to auto-generate personalized content for customers and developers to auto-generate code, among other use cases.Salesforce employees also showed off coming AI functions in the workplace collaboration platform Slack. Most of Salesforce's new AI suite will begin rolling out in the coming months, execs told Yahoo Finance at the event (see video above).This is all in addition to analysts praising Salesforce for better expense control after a bruising activist battle led by Elliott Management. The vibe on the Street is that Salesforce's profit margins have hit bottom and could ramp noticeably higher into next year.But there is a wildcard, analysts told Yahoo Finance: the uncertain economic backdrop and what it means for getting large tech deals done.""We maintain our view that Salesforce operates a business model that is bending, but not breaking, even within a challenging macroeconomy that is affecting all software companies,"" JPMorgan analysts noted, ""and we continue to see eventual upside from current levels as the company pivots to a recession playbook and balances growth with profitability and free cash flow generation while infusing generative AI capabilities into its clouds.""Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Caterpillar Inc. CAT, salesforce.com inc. CRM, McDonald's Corp. MCD, Visa Inc.'s V and Honeywell International Inc. HON.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Will the Dow Regain Momentum in 2H23?U.S. stock markets rallied in the first half of 2023, after wrapping up 2022 as the worst year since 2008 and terminating a three-year winning streak. Large cap-centric indexes like the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite rallied 15.9% and 31.7%, respectively. The small cap -centric Russell 2000 and the mid cap-centric S&amp;P 400 advanced more than 5% and 7%, respectively. However, the blue-chip Dow gained only 3.8%.Importantly, the first-half rally was primarily driven by growth stocks like technology, communication services and consumer discretionary. These stocks have a relatively low weight in Dow rather than the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. The cyclical stocks, which have more weight in Dow, did not participate in the rally.However, the situation is likely to change in the second half. At present, cyclical stocks are undervalued. Technically, at its current level of 33,944.40, the Dow is well above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages of 33,662.29 and 32,992.06, respectively.The 50-day moving average line is generally recognized as a short-term trendsetter in financial literature, while the 200-day moving average is considered a long-term trend setter. Historically it has been noticed in the technical analysis space that whenever the 50-day moving average line surges ahead of the 200-day moving average line, a long-term uptrend for the index becomes a strong possibility.Our Top PicksDefying a tepid Dow, we have narrowed our search to five blue-chip (components of Dow) stocks with strong potential for 2023. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Story continuesCaterpillar Inc. has seen year-over-year revenue and earnings growth for nine straight quarters thanks to its cost-saving actions, strong end-market demand and pricing actions that offset the impact of supply-chain snarls and cost pressures. We expect the company's adjusted earnings per share for 2023 to grow 19% and revenues to rise 7%.Zacks Rank #2 Caterpillar has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 10.2% and 28.5%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.8% over the last 30 days.salesforce.com inc. is benefiting from a robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation.

MCD's increased focus on menu innovation and loyalty program expansion is commendable. MCD is also undertaking every effort to drive growth in international markets. Robust digitalization is likely to help McDonald's in driving long-term growth and capture market share. MCD plans to open more than 1,900 restaurants globally in 2023.Zacks Rank #2 McDonald's has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 7.7% and 9.5%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days.Visa Inc.'s numerous buyouts and alliances paved the way for long-term growth and consistently drove its revenues. Constant investments in technology are solidifying V's position in the payments market. A shift in payments to the digital mode is a boon.

71,d84ed359-b6b8-3460-a823-0f26e5f327f4,CRM,2023-07-13,Salesforce (CRM) Gains 4% on Product Price Hike Announcement,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-crm-gains-4-product-130200655.html,1689166920,STORY,['CRM'],"[Salesforce CRM shares rallied 3.9% on Tuesday after the cloud-based enterprise software maker announced that it would raise the prices of some of its products. The company plans to hike prices across its core products — Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud, Industries and Tableau — by an average 9%, effective from August 2023.The hike will mark Salesforce’s first product price increase in the last seven years. The company stated that it invested more than $20 billion in the last seven years in research and development to deliver 22 new releases and add thousands of new features, including the recent generative artificial intelligence (AI) to its software.With the year-to-date (YTD) gain of 66.8%, CRM stock has outperformed the broader equity indexes, Nasdaq Composite, The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P 500, which have increased 31.5%, 3.4% and 15.6%, respectively. The company has been benefiting from the strong adoption of its cloud-based products and solutions as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation amid the ongoing hybrid work environment. Its ability to provide an integrated solution for customers’ business problems is the key driver.Salesforce Inc. Price and ConsensusSalesforce Inc. price-consensus-chart | Salesforce Inc. QuoteProduct Enhancement Aids Price HikeWe believe that Salesforce’s sustained focus on enhancing customer experience by launching new products and adding innovative features to the existing ones has given it the liberty to raise product prices.Salesforce’s price hike announcement came at a time when the company is primarily focusing on incorporating generative AI tools across its products as it looks to keep its business ahead of rivals. Generative AI is a type of AI technology that can produce various types of content, including text, imagery, audio and synthetic data. It is driven by a large language model, which means it uses a lot of data to understand and generate conversations.Story continuesCRM forayed into the generative AI space with the launch of Einstein GPT in March 2023. Einstein GPT is the world’s first generative AI Customer Relationship Management technology, which delivers AI-created content across every sales, service, marketing, commerce and IT interaction at hyperscale. With Einstein GPT, the company will transform customer experience with generative AI.Upping its ante in the space, last month, Salesforce launched its AI Cloud service, which the company claims is a one-stop AI-powered solution for enterprises looking to enhance productivity. Salesforce stated that its AI Cloud is a suite of services that delivers enterprise-ready real-time, open and secure generative experiences across all applications and workflows. The suite will power new capabilities across CRM’s products, including Einstein service, data analysis software Tableau and workplace-messaging app, Slack.Price Hike to Boost Revenues and ProfitWe believe that the recent hike will help Salesforce counter the slowdown in revenue growth in the post-pandemic environment. The company’s year-over-year revenue growth, which was in the mid-20s percentage range during fiscal 2020, 2021 and 2022, reduced to the high-teens percentage range in fiscal 2023.The enterprise software maker had witnessed a tremendous rise in the demand for its cloud-based solutions during the pandemic-led accelerated digital transformation. However, the demand has slowed down as enterprises are postponing their large IT spending plans due to ongoing macroeconomic headwinds, including higher inflation and increased interest rates.Additionally, the recent increase in product prices is likely to boost the company’s profitability. Several shareholders have criticized Salesforce for not taking advantage of its position as a market leader, which has caused a lag in profitability compared with its peers.To cut costs and improve profitability, Salesforce announced a broader restructuring plan in early January 2022. Under the plan, it intends to lay off approximately 10% of its total global workforce, exit real estate and shut down office spaces in certain markets.Zacks Rank and Other Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Salesforce sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Some other top-ranked stocks from the broader technology sector are Adobe ADBE, Meta Platforms META and Blackbaud BLKB, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Adobe's third-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings has been revised upward by 12 cents to $3.97 per share for the past 30 days.

72,99c85e65-97d0-37e6-aa53-6255e3aab189,CRM,2023-07-13,Here's How Much You'd Have If You Invested $1000 in Salesforce.com a Decade Ago,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-much-youd-invested-1000-123006485.html,1689165006,STORY,['CRM'],"[How much a stock's price changes over time is important for most investors, since price performance can both impact your investment portfolio and help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.Another factor that can influence investors is FOMO, or the fear of missing out, especially with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Salesforce.com (CRM) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to CRM for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Salesforce.com's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Salesforce.com's main business drivers.Headquartered in San Francisco, Salesforce, Inc., founded in 1999, is the leading provider of on-demand Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software, which enables organizations to better manage critical operations, such as sales force automation, customer service and support, marketing automation, document management, analytics and custom application development.Salesforce is currently the largest CRM vendor in the world with a market share of nearly 20% according to reports of Gartner, a global research and advisory firm. Its nearest rival, SAP is way behind at a market share of around 8%.  About 90% of the Fortune 100 companies uses at least one Salesforce software.The company has leveraged its expertise in on-demand software to increase the scale of operations. It also offers a technology platform for customers and developers to build and run business applications.Salesforce helps companies of every size and industry to connect with their customers in new ways through existing and emerging technologies including cloud, mobile, social, IoT and artificial intelligence (AI).Rapid digital transformation and the company’s sustained focus on introducing more aligned products as per customer needs is driving its revenues higher. Over the last eight years, Salesforce’s annual revenues have sextuple from $5.4 billion in fiscal 2015 to $31.4 billion in fiscal 2023.Story continuesThere are two main revenue streams — Subscription and Support and Professional Services &amp; Other.Subscription revenues comprise subscription fees from customers, accessing the company’s enterprise cloud computing services (Cloud Services), software licenses and subscription fees recognized from customers for additional support beyond the standard support lent by the company. This segment accounted for more than 93% of Salesforce’s fiscal 2023 revenues.Professional Services &amp; Other revenues consist of fees that the company derives from consulting and implementation services and training. This segment accounted for the remaining 7% of Salesforce’s fiscal 2023 revenues.Bottom LineAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of a few things: research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Salesforce.com a decade ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in July 2013 would be worth $5,326.83, or a 432.68% gain, as of July 12, 2023. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.Compare this to the S&amp;P 500's rally of 165.03% and gold's return of 44.57% over the same time frame.Looking ahead, analysts are expecting more upside for CRM.Salesforce is benefiting from a robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. The rapid adoption of its cloud-based solutions is driving demand for its products. Its sustained focus on introducing more aligned products as per customer needs is driving its top-line. Continued deal wins in the international market is another growth driver. The acquisition of Slack would position the company to be a leader in enterprise team collaboration solution space and better compete with Microsoft’s Teams product. Our estimates suggest that Salesforce revenues to grow at a CAGR of 10.5% through fiscal 2024-2026. However, stiff competition and unfavorable currency fluctuations are concerns. Besides, challenging macroeconomic environment might hurt its growth prospects in the near-term.The stock has jumped 5.83% over the past four weeks. Additionally, no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 19 higher, for fiscal 2023; the consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Some have been excluded from the rally and have retreated during the year, although that doesn’t mean they are headed for the permanent bargain bin.In fact, the analysts at banking giant Goldman Sachs have been performing one of their favorite pastimes – tagging the stocks that they see as primed for gains in the latter half of the year. Specifically, firm analyst Adam Samuelson has pinpointed an opportunity in two beaten-down names he sees pushing higher over the coming months – by the order of 40% or more.We ran these tickers through the TipRanks database to see what other Street experts make of their chances. Here are the details.The Mosaic Company (MOS)Let’s begin in the agricultural sector and zoom in on The Mosaic Company. This heavyweight in the crop nutrient industry has earned its reputation as a leading global producer and marketer of concentrated phosphate and potash fertilizers. The Tampa, Florida-based firm focuses on mining and processing phosphate rock, which is then used to produce agricultural fertilizers, and potash, a vital nutrient for crops. The company’s products are essential in promoting crop productivity and improving soil fertility, thereby supporting the global agricultural industry.Early last year, fertilizer prices increased dramatically in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and subsequent Western sanctions on Russia and Belarus led to supply issues. However, as supply from Belarus started again – it is the third biggest exporter of potash – fertilizer prices also came down and that affected Mosaic’s latest quarterly results.Story continuesIn Q1, adj. EPS fell from $2.41 in the same period a year ago to $1.14, while missing the Street’s call by $0.11. Revenue also dropped, by 8.2% year-over-year to $3.6 billion, although that figure actually beat Wall Street expectations, by $340 million. More recently, the company said it expects Q2 potash sales volumes will come in at the high end of the 2-2.2 million metric tons guide and phosphates at the low end of the 1.8-2 million tons guide.Year-to-date, MOS shares peaked back in March but have since retreated by 36%. While Goldman analyst Adam Samuelson is cognizant of the present issues, he highlights Mosaic’s appeal for investors.“While we recognize the current turbulent environment in the fertilizer market (and broader commodities) blurs the short-term outlook, management remains prudent on capital allocation and MOS’ portfolio of production assets appear sharply discounted relative to peers, let alone potential replacement cost,” the analyst noted.Accordingly, Samuelson rates MOS as a Buy along with a $62 price target, suggesting the stock will climb ~73% higher over the coming months. (To watch Samuelson’s track record, click here)That said, Samuelson’s take is the Street’s most exuberant one. Elsewhere, the stock garners an additional 3 Buys, 9 Holds and 1 Sell, for a Hold consensus rating. Nevertheless, most feel the shares are undervalued; going by the $45.61 average target, a year from now, they will be changing hands for a 27% premium. (See MOS stock forecast)Sealed Air Corporation (SEE)Let’s take a turn now from the fertilizer industry to packaging and the aptly named Sealed Air. Fun fact, the company is responsible for the invention of the iconic Bubble Wrap, the cushioning material widely used for protecting fragile items during shipping, and Sealed Air was founded based on that invention.Today, Sealed Air is a global packaging company that provides a range of innovative packaging solutions for various industries and is a leader in protective packaging and food safety solutions. Its offerings include protective packaging materials, such as foam and air cushions, as well as automated equipment and systems for packaging optimization.The global economic woes have not spared the packaging industry. Companies using such products have been impacted by the recessionary environment and that in turn has affected SEE’s business.In Q1, volumes dropped by 9.3% on the back of a 10.4% decline in Q4, both historically sharp drops not witnessed by the firm since 2008-09. As such, revenue came in at $1.3 billion, amounting to a 7.1% decline and falling short of the consensus estimate by $60 million. Adj. EPS of $0.74 also missed expectations, by $0.03. For the full year, SEE reiterated its outlook for adj. EPS in the range between $3.50 to $3.80, just shy of consensus at $3.66 at the mid-point.This is the kind of stuff that does not help a stock’s performance, and indeed, the shares are down by 23% since this year’s February peak. However, according to Goldman’s Adam Samuelson, this could be an opportunity for investors.“While we recognize near-term cyclical pressures and do see risk that the upper half of full-year guidance and implied Protective volume recovery appear ambitious, SEE’s underlying franchise strength and long-term growth from automation and digital solutions remain sharply discounted at 9.1x /8.3x 2023/24 EV/EBITDA. We see current weakness offering a compelling entry point for longer-term investors,” Samuelson opined.Samuelson, then, recommends that investors buy SEE shares, as his $64 price target indicates the potential for ~47% returns over the next 12 months.Elsewhere on the Street, 4 other analysts join Samuelson in the bull-camp and with an additional 7 Holds, the analyst consensus views this stock a Moderate Buy. The average target currently stands at $50.27, implying shares will deliver 15% gains in the months ahead.

75,d0d11868-ca7c-3c9a-b399-2f1fecb57ee4,RL,2023-07-13,Ralph Lauren (RL) Shares Gain on Robust Pricing Strategy,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ralph-lauren-rl-shares-gain-153300156.html,1689175980,STORY,['RL'],"[Ralph Lauren Corporation RL has exhibited a decent run on the bourses in the past six months. Banking on its operational initiatives, brand strength, solid demand and expansion across all channels, the stock has outpaced the Zacks Textile-Apparel industry.Ralph Lauren’s premium pricing strategy has been a key contributor to the company’s growth story. The renowned lifestyle apparel company has always managed to maintain higher prices for its clothing. Its share price also reflects gains from premium prices for its assortments.In the past six months, shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have rallied 10.5% against the industry’s decline of 3.9%. Also, the stock has outpaced the Consumer Discretionary sector’s growth of 3.1%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research The upward trend in the Zacks Consensus Estimate echoes a positive sentiment. The consensus estimate for RL’s earnings for fiscal 2024 has increased by a penny to $9.43 in the past 30 days. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current and next financial years implies year-over-year increases of 13.1% and 13.7%, respectively.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales for fiscal 2024 and 2025 is pegged at $6.63 billion and $7 billion, indicating year-over-year increases of 2.8% and 5.7%, respectively. The impressive long-term earnings growth rate of 13.8% emphasizes the intrinsic strength of the company.Let's Take a Closer LookWhat sets Ralph Lauren apart from its peers is its remarkable proficiency in successfully transferring higher price points to its customers. The brand has cultivated a sense of prestige and exclusivity, which allows it to command higher prices. This strategic approach has facilitated the company's exceptional standing within the industry. In the quarter ended Apr 1, 2023, the company reported an impressive 12% increase in average selling prices from the prior-year quarter. This substantial growth builds upon an already remarkable 77% increase in average selling prices over the past five years. The company's success in maintaining its pricing power has not only demonstrated its inherent strength but has also played a significant role in driving its shares.Ralph Lauren has been actively expanding its digital and omnichannel capabilities, making strategic investments in mobile technology, omnichannel integration and fulfillment. The company's focus on a positive mix of products, investments in AI-powered targeting and consumer acquisition, and online search growth has yielded favorable results. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the digital business continued to be a significant growth driver, with accelerated digital sales observed across all regions.RL saw successful brand activations, including sports sponsorship at the Australian Open and Lunar New Year campaigns, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. These activations re-engaged customers and attracted 1 million in the fiscal fourth quarter and more than 5 million in the fiscal year. Social media followers reached 52 million, with growth on platforms like Instagram and TikTok. Ralph Lauren's online search trends surpassed competitors, indicating strong interest in its core categories.The implementation of the ""Next Great Chapter"" plan has been a key driver for RL. This plan involves simplifying the company's global organizational structure and introducing enhanced technological capabilities. As a result, the company has been able to focus on its core brands and execute the Next Great Chapter elevation strategy effectively.Ralph Lauren is dedicated to elevating and energizing its lifestyle brand. The company recognizes its timeless iconic brand as its most valuable asset, aiming to inspire and engage consumers, and foster long-term relationships. This strategic focus has yielded positive results, as the company has experienced growth in market share and a double-digit rise in Average Unit Retail (AUR) globally.RL experienced exceptional growth in AUR for women's products, with an increase of more than 20% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. This impressive performance can be attributed to robust growth in handbag sales and the successful global launch of Women's Polo intimates.For fiscal 2024, management forecast a low-single-digit increase in constant-currency revenues, with foreign currency expected to have a positive impact of 20 basis points on reported revenues. The company predicts growth to be primarily driven by double-digit growth in Asia and low-single-digit growth in Europe. It is also anticipated to witness a low-single-digit decline in North America due to softer spring trends and wholesale timing shifts in the first quarter of fiscal 2024.The company expects the operating margin to expand 30-50 basis points in constant currency, reaching 12.3-12.5%. This expansion is attributed to a gross margin increase of 50-100 basis points. Factors contributing to gross margin growth include lower freight costs, continued growth in AUR, and a favorable product, geographic and channel mix. The company anticipates reduced freight costs to benefit the gross margin by at least 100 basis points.However, these positives may be partially offset by a negative impact of 20 basis points from foreign currency fluctuations and ongoing pressure from product costs, particularly cotton, throughout the majority of fiscal 2024.Story continues3 More Red-Hot Stocks to ConsiderHere we have highlighted three other top-ranked stocks, namely GIII Apparel Group GIII, lululemon athletica LULU and Guess GES.GIII Apparel, which is a manufacturer, designer and distributor of apparel and accessories, sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present.

77,8df42ea6-c3ce-37ce-b7de-08d01c49dbb5,ALGN,2023-07-13,3 Growth Stocks to Sell Before They Do Your Portfolio In,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-growth-stocks-sell-portfolio-014108580.html,1688694068,STORY,"['ALGN', 'CELH']","[Growth stocks have appreciated substantially this year, and most trade at or near their fair value. I don’t believe such stocks should be sold off just yet, especially if they offer dividends. However, many are also trading at excessive valuations after this year’s rally and risk a severe correction once the hype dies down – selling them now is an excellent idea. This had led to the emergence of growth stocks to sell.Of course, the rally could continue; there’s no guarantee. But taking profits and reversing some positions is essential to beating the market. One of the main reasons why investors underperform the market is due to carelessly holding overvalued stocks while much better deals exist in the market.To provide more value to our readers, I will exclude some picks from an article I published last month about two growth stocks to sell. I recommend reading it too.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAlign Technology (ALGN)Portrait of smiling hispanic woman dentist preparing tools at modern dental officeSource: BearFotos / ShutterstockAlign Technology (NASDAQ:ALGN) is the maker of Invisalign, the clear aligner system that has revolutionized the orthodontic industry. The company grew rapidly during the pandemic era, and Invisalign is a household name. However, the magic is wearing off.Align Technology reported declining year-over-year sales growth for the last four quarters, at -3% in Q1. That’s not the worst factor though, the company’s profits are falling sharply. Align Technology had ~$200 million in profits each quarter in 2021, now at just $88 million in Q1. These sluggish figures would suggest that the company is probably trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 20 or lower at best, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. ALGN surged over 62% year-to-date and trades at a hefty premium of 42 times forward earnings. I don’t see that valuation as justified when the estimated sales growth for each of the next two years sits at 11.5%That’s not all. One of the main risks is the increasing competition from other players in the clear aligner market, such as SmileDirectClub, Candid, and Byte. These companies offer lower prices, direct-to-consumer models, and online platforms that appeal to cost-conscious and convenience-seeking customers. While Align does have a patent portfolio and a network of doctors that give it an edge over its rivals, it cannot afford to lose market share or pricing power without wrecking its valuation. This makes it one of those growth stocks to sell.Story continuesVeneers are also becoming a much better (and popular) alternative for people who want a quick fix. Invisalign is a very expensive product; not everyone can afford it, requiring up to a year of wearing. People can get veneers for cheaper and get results much quicker with the added benefit of whiter teeth. Of course, it may seem like comparing apples to oranges, but not everyone has the time, money, and commitment.Accordingly, the stock is already at its consensus analyst price target, while the lowest rating calls for a 35% downside.Celsius Holdings (CELH)A table is spread with breakfast foods like orange juice, berries and croissants. represents food and beverage stocksSource: ShutterstockCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) is a beverage company producing energy drinks that claim to boost metabolism and burn calories. The company has been enjoying strong sales growth in recent years, and the stock has seen explosive growth. It is up a staggering 2,400% from Feb 2020. However, I believe the stock is overvalued at its current level, and it is time to “CELH.”One of the main risks is the intense competition from other players in the energy drink market, such as Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST), Red Bull, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), and Coca-Cola (NYSE:CO). I’d agree that these are more “mature” companies, and Celsius has a niche position in the functional beverage segment. Still, it cannot ignore the threat of losing customers or shelf space to its larger rivals. This puts it firmly in the category of one of those growth stocks to sell.Personally, the idea of burning fat by drinking energy drinks is questionable. Celsius has faced lawsuits and investigations from consumers and authorities in the past over its health claims and ingredients. I believe these legal actions could result in some trouble for the company going forward. If you’ve bought one of these drinks, you may even be eligible for $250 in compensation. Moreover, Celsius plans to expand into new markets and segments, such as CBD-infused drinks and immunity boosters.But I digress; let’s go back to the financials and stock performance. It is hard to ignore that Celsius has been pulling tremendous growth recently. The twelve-month revenue figure is going exponential, and it grew over 95% YOY in Q1. The problem is that this growth won’t last forever. It is expected to end the year with ~70% in sales growth, which will decline to 36% next year and then 30% the year after. I believe even that is a little optimistic, considering the competition and scrutiny the company has to deal with.Simply put, the current forward earnings multiple of 104 times does not reflect reality. Insiders have already dumped $187 million of the stock.WW Grainger (GWW)Tools in a belt representing TBLT stock.Source: mihalec / Shutterstock.comWW Grainger (NYSE:GWW) is a leading distributor of maintenance, repair, and operating products and services. The company has been benefiting from the increased demand for its products and solutions amid the COVID-19 pandemic and the recovery of the industrial sector. It is not as overvalued as some of the other picks on this list, but compared to its historical price and projected earnings, this is another growth stock to sell.While many of the company’s peers have been facing higher costs for raw materials, labor, transportation, and tariffs, squeezing their margins and profitability, Grainger has been passing on some of these costs to its customers through price increases, but it may not be able to do so indefinitely without hurting its sales volume or market share. All in all, it’s one of those growth stocks to sell.It is great for profitability, and Wall Street has blessed it with a 72% appreciation in the past year. As a result, you’re paying $782 a pop; a forward P/E ratio of 22x. It may not seem like much, but the company is sliding out of the growth category. Future sales growth is expected to continue the slide to 7% YOY next year and 6.65% in 2025. The profit wave won’t also last forever. After 21% growth this year, it is expected to moderate to just 3.45% in 2025.Even Gurufocus, a very bullish stock analysis model, points out that the stock is “Modestly Overvalued.”On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The person asked not to be identified discussing information that hasn’t been made public.A Commerce Department spokesperson declined to comment or confirm the breach of Raimondo’s emails, which was reported earlier by the Washington Post. Microsoft also declined to comment late Wednesday night.The Commerce and State Departments as well as agencies in Western Europe were also attacked, according to government officials and Microsoft.Commerce took immediate action after being notified by Microsoft that the department had been breached, the spokesperson said earlier Wednesday.When asked on Thursday about the claims that US officials were hacked, China’s Foreign Ministry said that “the US should account for its cyberattacks as soon as possible rather than spread false information and divert attention.”When a Huawei Bid Turned Into a Hunt for a Corporate MoleLast month, the US State Department identified anomalous activity and alerted Microsoft to the attack, according to a spokesperson, who said the agency had no reason to doubt that the hackers, who breached Microsoft Outlook accounts, were based in China.“A subsequent investigation by the company determined that the hackers accessed and exfiltrated unclassified Exchange Online Outlook data from a small number of accounts,” according to a statement from the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, known as CISA.Story continuesIt wasn’t known what other US agencies were affected, but a senior official said the number was in the single digits.Hacking Campaign Raises Fears China is Prepping for Conflict (1)US officials described the attacks as targeted and focused on a small number of accounts at the agencies that were breached, as opposed to hack seeking to steal large amounts of data. CISA and the FBI issued a joint advisory urging organizations to harden their Microsoft 365 cloud environments.The hacking campaign got underway in the weeks before Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Beijing to meet with top officials, including Chinese President Xi Jinping, according to the officials.In a blog post published Tuesday night, Microsoft described the group behind the attack as China-based, calling it Storm-0558. The hackers were able to remain undetected for a month after gaining access to email data from around 25 organizations in mid-May.“We assess this adversary is focused on espionage, such as gaining access to email systems for intelligence collection,” Charlie Bell, an executive vice president at Microsoft, wrote in another post.It also wasn’t clear which European governments were affected. Italian cybersecurity officials said they were in contact with Microsoft “in order to identify potential Italian subjects involved in the latest attacks.”Asked about the findings, China’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin, at a regular briefing on Wednesday, accused the US of being the world’s largest cyberattacker.The hackers used “forged authentication tokens to access user email using an acquired Microsoft account (MSA) consumer signing key,” Microsoft’s Bell said in his post. The hackers were then able to access Outlook email hosted on systems run and operated by Microsoft.But how hackers obtained the signing key that gave them access to these emails remains unknown.“The big question here really is where did they get the MSA-key to sign tokens,” said Sami Laiho, a computer security expert who specializes in Microsoft products. One possible explanation, Laiho said, is if Microsoft itself was breached.Microsoft didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about how hackers obtained the signing key.The senior official used the news of the breach to highlight a source of tension between Microsoft and the US government: logging. Logs allow cybersecurity investigators to dig through digital clues left behind on their own systems to figure out if they’ve been hacked and who may be responsible.More advanced logging can capture and record granular actions made by a user, like if a certain email was accessed. At issue is whether Microsoft should sell logging as a premium add-on for government customers or include it in its product for free.A lack of logging complicated the investigation into the so-called SolarWinds attack, which was disclosed in 2020. In that episode, Russian state-sponsored hackers installed a malicious update in software made by SolarWinds Corp., which installed a digital backdoor which they could then use to further infiltrate SolarWinds customers. Ultimately, nine US agencies about 100 companies were breached via the SolarWinds update and other methods.Microsoft offered its premium logging feature for free for about a year in the wake of the SolarWinds hack. CISA and others have said that logs should be free, maintaining that they are crucial for detecting and investigating security incidents.On Wednesday, the senior officials said some of the affected US agencies paid for a premium logging feature and were able to detect the breach on their own. Microsoft, which retains the logs, was able to identify others who were hacked but don’t pay for logging.Requiring organizations to pay for better logging is a recipe for inadequate visibility into what has occurred in networks, the official said, adding that the issue requires urgent attention.--With assistance from James Mayger, Justin Sink, Iain Marlow, Flavia Rotondi, Katrina Manson, Eric Martin and Colum Murphy.(Updates with response from China’s Foreign Ministry.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekNo Testing, No Inspections: Contaminated Eyedrops Blinded and Killed AmericansWeightWatchers Is Gambling Everything on Obesity DrugsWhat If the Next Big Social Media App Is ...

The highest-priced pharmacy wanted $330.Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi , which dominate the insulin market, announced in March that they would slash their insulin prices by at least 70% later in the year.That came after U.S. President Joe Biden’s push to extend to most Americans a $35 cap on out-of-pocket insulin costs available to recipients of the government's Medicare health program. Americans with insurance typically pay a fraction of the list prices for prescription drugs, but uninsured people sometimes have to pay the full prices, forcing some to ration or skip taking their medicine.Lilly said at the time it would drop the price of its Lispro insulin injection, a generic version of its own branded Humalog, to $25 a vial. The Indianapolis-based drugmaker said it charges $25 per vial to wholesalers and retailers, but pharmacies can charge more.A spokesperson for the National Community Pharmacists Association said contracts with pharmacy benefit managers, the middlemen that negotiate discounts with drugmakers and reimburse pharmacies for patients' prescriptions, contributed to the distorted prices.Warren, a Democrat, has long campaigned for consumer protection reform, including within the U.S. healthcare system that forces Americans to pay more for medicines than any other country.The senator’s office found chain stores charged uninsured customers an average of $123 per vial for the generic insulin, compared to $63 at independent pharmacies.Story continuesWalgreens Boots Alliance, Walmart, Rite Aid and CVS Health asked for an average of $166, $161, $89 and $39, respectively for Insulin Lispro at their surveyed stores.Warren’s staff also said that less than a quarter of CVS pharmacies stocked the generic insulin, whereas 74% of Walgreens pharmacies did, along with 82% of Rite Aid and Walmart drug stores. Almost half - 43% - of all stores surveyed said they did not carry the drug.“This is a deeply troubling finding, revealing that the pharmacies offering the most affordable Insulin Lispro were the least likely to have it in stock,” the report said.CVS in a statement said since May 4th its cash price per vial has been $28.99. ""If an individual pharmacy doesn’t have a medication in stock, they typically can order it for arrival in about 1-2 business days.""Walgreens, Walmart and Rite Aid did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Around 8.4 million of the 37 million people in the United States with diabetes use insulin, according to the American Diabetes Association.(Reporting by Patrick Wingrove in New York Editing by Caroline Humer and Bill Berkrot)]"

WBA is leading the way in accountability and sustainability, and that positive impact is being felt in communities around the world.Ornella Barra, WBA chief operating officer, international, and ESG committee chair, delivered opening remarks that featured the company's successes in giving back to our communities, with a cumulative fiscal year 2022 total of $100 million donated, a 21.2% reduction in global carbon emissions, and a 204 metric ton savings of plastic.Barra noted WBA's ESG approach is designed around the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) framework of the United Nations, with WBA among the first to embrace those goals after their publication in 2015. Among the 17 SDG's, she emphasized ""Partnership for the goals,"" which aligns with one of WBA's key values of partnership. ""When it comes to our global ESG efforts, collaboration with our partners and stakeholders is key,"" she says.2. An embedded ESG strategy in an organization's business strategy is critical to success.WBA CEO Roz Brewer, in conversation with Jackson and Kent, emphasized the importance of integrating a company's ESG strategy with its business strategy. For WBA, this is especially important in its transformation to a healthcare company, especially for customers, patients and team members, all of whom demand transparency.Story continuesBrewer says having an ESG strategy that is integrated and in lock step with business strategy provides something to stand behind that is important to defining who WBA is as a company. She pointed to work during the COVID pandemic that continues to inform our work with health equity, and current initiatives like streamlining HIV antiviral distribution that have provided deeper insights into what underserved communities need, while underscoring the importance of the relationships our pharmacists have with patients and customers.3. Building partnerships and developing relationships are key to making progress toward health equity.The first ESG pillar, Healthy Communities, begins locally, so it must be nurtured in communities and regions by building partnerships and developing relationships, says Georgia Lehoczky, Walgreens regional healthcare director for South Florida and Puerto Rico, and Shauna Markes-Wilson, director of pharmacy and retail operations for Walgreens region 28 in Georgia and Florida.The combination of Walgreens scale with strong local partners has proven an incredible formula to addressing health inequality, vaccine hesitancy, and chronic conditions, according to Lehoczky. Working with community-based organizations-outside the walls of our retail pharmacies-to interact with patients where they live has been a successful strategy to reach the people who need health services the most.According to Markes-Wilson, this strategy works because of the trust pharmacists and technicians have built within their communities. ""We know trust is a critical component of health equity, so it matters where the data comes from and who's delivering it,"" she says. ""Because many of our pharmacists and technicians live and work in the communities they serve, and look like the communities we're trying to reach, they are seen as highly trustworthy sources of health information among their community members. That combination is a catalyst for success, and puts communities that need our services within reach,"" she says.4. Key stakeholders expect sustainability to a core element of an organization's strategy.For people to be healthy, we need a Healthy Planet, so sustainability needs to be a core element of an organization's strategy, says Amy Brachio, global deputy vice chair, sustainability at EY, in conversation with Walgreens director of ESG Lauren Stone. Global initiatives to reduce environmental impact and lessen the effects of day-to-day business are not only better for the planet, they are also good for business and generate significant value.Brachio listed three key groups that sustainability resonates with: investors, employees and customers. The investor community is increasingly looking for reassurance on sustainability and brand protection. For employees, people want to work for companies that have strong sustainability strategies, particularly since those companies have 55% better employee morale and 38% better employee loyalty. And customers also have ambitious sustainability expectations, with 86% of them more likely to trust a company that reports its sustainability results, and 80% wanting to purchase goods that reflect strong corporate social responsibility over those that don't.Ultimately, Brachio says, there is a strong connection between a healthier planet and driving sustainability that helps people live healthier lives. ""It's hard to imagine how you live a joyful life if you don't have access to clean air and water, and access to food,"" she says.5. Misconceptions surrounding the topic of disability are often an incomplete picture drawn from people's own experiences.Holly May, WBA EVP and global chief human resources officer, and Joe Riddle, director of Neurodiversity in the Workplace, discussed the importance of WBA's third ESG pillar, Healthy and Inclusive Workplace, emphasizing the creation of a workplace that is welcoming, inclusive and representative of the global communities we serve, which is illustrated by the company's commitment to disability hiring and inclusion.Riddle countered a series of myths and misconceptions about hiring people with disabilities, pointing out that one-in-four U.S. adults have a disability, and that companies that focus on disability inclusion with supporting initiatives perform better, with 28% higher revenue and 30% higher profits than companies that don't. Additionally, most accommodations that help people with disabilities to succeed have little to no cost. If we can give people access to those tools, Riddle says, we can enable them to do their best, while creating a larger talent pool.6. Transparency is critical to bringing products and services to market in a way that's honest, safe, and sustainable.From sourcing to packaging, we strive for transparency in our supply chains and in those of our partners to deliver brands that our customers can truly trust, says John Kallend, WBA's SVP of global partnerships, who spoke with Kris Licht, president of health and global chief customer officer at Reckitt, a WBA global supplier, about WBA's fourth ESG pillar, Sustainable Marketplace.Much of the impact we can have lays not just within the four walls of our plants and warehouses, but also out in the world helping consumers use products smarter, better and in a more sustainable way. ""We have to ask ourselves questions,"" says Licht. ""What is the footprint we have as businesses and as employers? What is the environmental footprint of our brands, and what happens after the sale of a product?"" Asking these questions allows for the optimization of product formulations and designing products and packaging to improve the sustainability footprint of the product portfolio.Watch the full event replay or segment clips, or download the full 2022 ESG Report.Walgreens Boots Alliance, Wednesday, July 12, 2023, Press release pictureRoz Brewer, Alethia Jackson and Una Kent at WBA's ESG Report virtual launch event.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Walgreens Boots Alliance on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Walgreens Boots AllianceWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/walgreens-boots-allianceEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Walgreens Boots AllianceView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/767332/6-Things-To-Know-From-WBAs-ESG-Report-Launch-Event]"

96,4814257b-ca75-3268-853e-fcdc2c665ed8,SBUX,2023-07-13,Too many CEOs don’t know what their workers need. Employee ‘engagement’ surveys can make the problem even worse,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/too-many-ceos-don-t-172712700.html,1689182832,STORY,['SBUX'],"[When Starbucks’ founder and three-time CEO Howard Schultz spoke before the U.S. Senate in March to address allegations that his company was engaging in egregious union-busting, he seemed almost hurt by the behavior of his employees. How could these workers be unhappy and organizing when the coffee-store chain had long lavished them with perks like college tuition assistance and comparatively generous health care coverage? “Is there a union that you’re aware of that has those benefits, sir?” Schultz pointedly asked one senator.It turns out that for many Starbucks “partners,” as the company calls its employees, tuition help at an online university wasn’t that crucial. They’ve proven to be far more interested in prosaic matters such as flexible scheduling, work conditions, and more predictable hours—the kinds of issues that have a much greater short-term impact on their income and quality of life.Starbucks is hardly alone among companies that seem to be misreading or not taking sufficient heed of what employees are saying, nor is it the only place where worker dissatisfaction is on display. Indeed, an annual Gallup survey of 15,000 U.S. workers published in January found that employee engagement in the U.S. had fallen to its lowest levels since 2015. Among the worrisome findings was that the drop was most acute among people under 35. “Employees are feeling more disconnected from their employers,” wrote Gallup’s chief scientist for its workplace practice, Jim Harter.At Starbucks, new CEO Laxman Narasimhan has struck a noticeably more conciliatory tone at Starbucks, and he has begun working one shift a month in a cafe to better understand what baristas face. A spokesman pointed Fortune to a 2022 corporate blog in which the company said it was tweaking policies around issues such as scheduling, in response to employee feedback. But employee discontent still simmers: To date, some 300 of Starbucks’ 9,300 U.S. stores have voted to unionize.Story continuesComing out of the pandemic and emboldened by a very tight labor market, workers are more vocal about getting what they want from employers and pushing back. While that phenomenon itself may feel like old news in the post-COVID era, it is taking increasingly widespread and concrete form. New unionization efforts are racing through restaurants and retailers, ranging from REI, Chipotle Mexican Grill, and Trader Joe’s to Apple stores, Amazon, and, of course, Starbucks. And the phenomenon is not limited to the services sector. Some workers at Tesla, for one, have tried to unionize, while many white-collar workers at the big Wall Street firms initially resisted return-to-the-office diktats last year.What’s particularly striking is that so many of these companies are famed for—and loudly proud of—their better-than-average wages and perks. Their leaders frequently tout these benefits and offerings as both a cause and result of strong “employee engagement”—engagement often measured by wide-ranging employee surveys. That in turn leads to moments of Schultz-like surprise when employees turn against bosses who think they’re giving the employees exactly what they want.Some of this surprise is strategic, of course. But some of it is genuine, and it raises important questions at a tense time for labor relations. Do C-suites know what employees are really thinking? And are they asking the wrong questions when they try to find out?An epic shift in employee attitudesExperts say such an estrangement points to a potential danger for companies. You don’t want to be clueless about what employees really want at a time when many can easily find new employment, nor do you want to be ill-equipped to adapt to how those wants are shifting. “There’s a blind spot in many organizations where they think they’re doing well but they’re not,” Gallup’s Harter tells Fortune.But getting an accurate read on worker mood has become ever more challenging since the pandemic, which reset many employees’ expectations. What’s more, many employers are struggling in the remote-work environment to stay on top of what workers are feeling or thinking and to maintain the person-to-person contact needed for strong work relationships.As Martine Ferland, CEO of Mercer, the human resources consulting giant, describes it, we have moved through multiple shifts in attitudes about work in the last two decades. Through the 2000s, relationships between employers and workers were largely based on a contract of mutual loyalty. Then came an era anchored in the view that a less tightly bound but mutually beneficial relationship was good enough. In the wake of the pandemic, the dominant focus is on work-lifestyle balance, in which workers are much more in control and more comfortable questioning bosses. What’s more, that outlook—generally associated with Gens Y and Z—is infectious and now changing older workers’ attitudes. “Sentiments shift and change now a lot, and I’m not sure employers are used to that velocity,” says Ferland.In the service sector, it’s even more pronounced. For months on end, frontline workers like store employees or flight attendants dealt with abuse from the public and worked long hours because of the labor shortages; now their priorities have shifted, especially among younger workers. “This Gen Z group wants to know why you’re doing what you’re doing, and if you don’t share that with them, they’re going to complain loudly,” says Craig Rowley, a senior client partner at Korn Ferry.The allure and the danger of employee surveysCorporate America’s attempts to measure employee attitudes and motivation go back decades. Over the years, one method—the employee engagement survey—emerged as a durable tool. It originated during World War I when the U.S. military sought to measure troop morale and willingness to engage in battle, according to Peter Cappelli, the director of Wharton School’s Center for Human Resources. By the 1930s, such surveys had evolved and been adopted by companies: Sears, for one, used it in efforts to ward off unionization attempts. By the end of the 1950s, the surveys had gone mainstream, and companies used them to take the pulse of worker sentiment on things like benefits and job satisfaction.By now, tens of millions of U.S. workers get multiple emails every year from employers pleading with them to fill out a survey. As anyone who does so knows, the questions can be pretty general. That’s by design, to ensure comparability over time and with other organizations. But it’s also a recipe for overly generic and frankly unclear questions—and, for managers, misleading results.For instance, a poorly worded question might ask: “Do you feel management supports your professional development?” That addresses an important topic but doesn’t specify whether it refers to one’s immediate manager, one’s department leader, or top management—let alone the fact that “professional development” is a broad category. A better-phrased version of the question could be: “Do you feel your immediate manager provides you with access to classes or training that you need to learn the new skills you want?”Multiply this kind of mushiness across a 50-question survey, and you’ve got a major source of leader-staff disconnect. “You could think there was no discontent among your employees because you didn’t see it and didn’t ask the questions that were going to tell you whether they were really happy,” says Cappelli.Even when the questions are relevant, companies often don’t drill down far enough into the ample data they are sitting on to make the results useful, making surveys seem like a pro forma exercise more than a good faith effort to take the pulse.Mercer’s Ferland gives a theoretical example of a company analyzing responses to a classic employee engagement question: “Do you feel secure speaking up?” A typical, and good, result would be 75% of people saying yes. But employers can often look at that data from too high a level for it to be useful, she says. “If you slice it and dice it, you see that women are much lower than that average, and Latin American [people], for instance, even lower,” she says. “You’re missing the whole picture.”Another practice that seems anodyne but can lead to bad results: the aggregation of responses as companies crunch the data. Gallup’s Harter says that often, to simplify report production and analysis, he will see companies combining the percentages of people answering a question with a 4 out of 5 and 5 out of 5 (lumping them together as, say, “better or much better than average”). That kind of blurring often makes the survey results look much better than they really are.Even when data is well collected and analyzed, companies often fail to make full use of it, making annual surveys seem like something HR does just for HR’s needs. To remedy that, Ferland says, companies should complement their big annual questionnaires by adding surveys throughout the year on specific topics and for specific sub-groups, with more messaging on social media to get the pulse. And above all, employers need to put to use the knowledge gleaned. “They need to communicate what they’ll do with the findings. If they are trying to boil the ocean, it’s not useful,” she says. Instead, she recommends that companies “select three priorities, say, and work on them so people understand you’re doing something.”Of course, there’s always the old-fashioned tool of asking people directly about their needs and concerns. “You could have supervisors actually go talk to people. Employees are usually not shy about telling their direct boss what’s going on,” Wharton’s Cappelli says.And that is key. If respondents feel that they are asked year after year for detailed feedback but nothing changes, they will stop taking part in “engagement surveys,” in part because they won’t truly be engaged. Indeed, Cappelli says that not taking heed of what employees are communicating increases their alienation. “Benefits can attract people, but it’s not going to keep them,” he says. And unless companies are in the mood for more employee rebellion, it’s in their leaders’ best interest to figure what will.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Monster Beverage's current trading price of US$56.21 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Monster Beverage’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for Monster Beverage What's The Opportunity In Monster Beverage?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 7.74% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Monster Beverage today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $52.17, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. In addition to this, Monster Beverage has a low beta, which suggests its share price is less volatile than the wider market.What does the future of Monster Beverage look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Monster Beverage's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 70%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in MNST’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on MNST, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. Having said that, from a first glance at Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Southwest Airlines, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.04 = US$965m ÷ (US$36b - US$11b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Therefore, Southwest Airlines has an ROCE of 4.0%. Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Airlines industry average of 7.4%. Check out our latest analysis for Southwest Airlines roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Southwest Airlines compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Southwest Airlines.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsIn terms of Southwest Airlines' historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. Around five years ago the returns on capital were 18%, but since then they've fallen to 4.0%. Although, given both revenue and the amount of assets employed in the business have increased, it could suggest the company is investing in growth, and the extra capital has led to a short-term reduction in ROCE. And if the increased capital generates additional returns, the business, and thus shareholders, will benefit in the long run.Story continuesOur Take On Southwest Airlines' ROCEWhile returns have fallen for Southwest Airlines in recent times, we're encouraged to see that sales are growing and that the business is reinvesting in its operations. And there could be an opportunity here if other metrics look good too, because the stock has declined 25% in the last five years. So we think it'd be worthwhile to look further into this stock given the trends look encouraging.On a final note, we found  2 warning signs for Southwest Airlines (1 is a bit concerning)  you should be aware of.While Southwest Airlines may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

It could lead to a strike if an agreement is not met.If left unresolved, a stalemate in negotiations between Southwest pilots and the airline could lead to a rare strike.

You'll get all the latest news first by subscribing, but we will publish many (but not all) of the forecasts a few days afterward online. Here’s the latest...Southwest Airlines is bracing for a possible strike by its pilots after years of contract negotiations failed to produce an agreement. The pilots’ union, the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association, has asked to be released from mediation, over Southwest’s objections, and is now awaiting an official ruling on its request from the National Mediation Board. Union members voted almost unanimously in May to authorize a possible strike, with roughly 98% of pilots participating.The main point of contention is the airline’s pilot scheduling system, which has been blamed for causing pilot fatigue and flight delays. For example, Southwest’s antiquated tech was implicated in the carrier’s disastrous meltdown in December of last year, when 16,000 flights were canceled over a period of 11 days.But a strike is still several steps away. Even if the mediation board grants the union’s request, it may first offer both sides the opportunity to arbitrate the dispute. If either side declines the arbitration, both sides will enter a 30-day “cooling-off” period, after which the pilots can legally strike.Pilot strikes are historically rare. The last one occurred in 2010 at Spirit Airlines. Agencies like the National Mediation Board take pains to prevent work stoppages from disrupting the flow of interstate commerce via the airline and railway industries, with Congress also sometimes stepping in.Southwest is still hoping for a breakthrough in the negotiations, similar to the deal it struck last month with the union representing its mechanics.This forecast first appeared in The Kiplinger Letter, which has been running since 1923 and is a collection of concise weekly forecasts on business and economic trends, as well as what to expect from Washington, to help you understand what’s coming up to make the most of your investments and your money.

The company’s current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products. Since 2008, PMI has invested more than USD 10.5 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as post-market studies. In November 2022, PMI acquired Swedish Match – a leader in oral nicotine delivery – creating a global smoke-free champion led by the companies’ IQOS and ZYN brands. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized versions of PMI’s IQOS Platform 1 devices and consumables and Swedish Match’s General snus as Modified Risk Tobacco Products (MRTPs). As of March 31, 2023, PMI's smoke-free products were available for sale in 78 markets, and PMI estimates that approximately 18.5 million adults around the world had already switched to IQOS and stopped smoking. Smoke-free products accounted for approximately 35% of PMI’s total 2023 first-quarter net revenues. With a strong foundation and significant expertise in life sciences, PMI announced in February 2021 its ambition to expand into wellness and healthcare areas and, through its Vectura Fertin Pharma business, aims to enhance life through the delivery of seamless health experiences.

But you can make better returns by buying undervalued shares. To wit, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) shares are up 33% in three years, besting the market return. More recently the stock has gained 5.1% in a year, which isn't too bad.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. Check out our latest analysis for Philip Morris International While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Philip Morris International was able to grow its EPS at 4.5% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. This EPS growth is lower than the 10% average annual increase in the share price. This indicates that the market is feeling more optimistic on the stock, after the last few years of progress. It's not unusual to see the market 're-rate' a stock, after a few years of growth.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into Philip Morris International's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Philip Morris International's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Philip Morris International, it has a TSR of 56% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectivePhilip Morris International provided a TSR of 11% over the last twelve months. But that was short of the market average. On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it's actually better than the average return of 10% over half a decade This could indicate that the company is winning over new investors, as it pursues its strategy. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Philip Morris International better, we need to consider many other factors.

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Philip Morris (PM) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.49 a share, just eight days from its upcoming earnings release on July 20, 2023.Philip Morris' Earnings ESP sits at 1.02%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.49 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.47.PM is just one of a large group of Consumer Staples stocks with a positive ESP figure.

It is worth considering PPG Industries (PPG), which belongs to the Zacks Chemical - Specialty industry.This paint and coatings maker has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 12.22%.For the last reported quarter, PPG Industries came out with earnings of $1.82 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.55 per share, representing a surprise of 17.42%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.14 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.22 per share, delivering a surprise of 7.02%.With this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for PPG Industries. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.PPG Industries currently has an Earnings ESP of +2.57%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on July 20, 2023.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

IPI has achieved a significant milestone with the successful completion of the Well 45 and Well 46 drilling projects at its solar solution potash mine in Moab, UT. These projects mark the second update on IPI’s major capital ventures outlined in its 2023 capital program.The completion of the Well 45 and Well 46 drilling projects in time for the 2023 evaporation season is a crucial step toward maximizing brine availability and improving underground brine residence time. This strategic approach is expected to enhance the brine grade and facilitate higher and more consistent production for Intrepid Potash.Well 45 is a newly designed single-well cavern system featuring three interlocking laterals. Its purpose is to target new ore in Potash Bed 9, utilizing around 18,000 feet of horizontal drilling. The initial phase of cavern development has commenced, demonstrating good availability of high-grade ore. Following cavern development, selective solution mining will begin using salt-saturated brine. The benefits of Well 45 are expected to be realized in the 2024 evaporation season. This well's total capital cost was roughly $11.5 million, representing a 40% reduction compared to the previous two-well cavern systems.Well 46, on the other hand, is a horizontal drilling project aimed at accessing a high-grade brine pool in Potash Bed 5. Well 46 serves multiple purposes — contributing to the 2023 potash production during the third quarter, providing access to drill additional laterals in Potash Bed 5 or other stranded brine pools and serving as a backup for other injection/extraction wells. The capital cost for Well 46 was around $5 million.The successful completion of the Well 45 and Well 46 drilling projects builds upon the achievements of Intrepid's Phase One HB Injection Pipeline Project, which was announced last month.With its 2023 capital program expected in the range of $60-75 million, Intrepid Potash remains committed to successful project execution across its operations. The completion of these drilling projects represents a significant stride forward, driving increased production and reinforcing Intrepid Potash's position as a leading player in the potash mining sector.IPI shares have lost 35.7% in the past year against the 20.9% decline of its industry. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s current-year earnings has been stable in the past 60 days. The consensus estimate for current-year earnings is currently pegged at $1.06, suggesting a year-over-year decline of 82.3%.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research The company’s profitability in the first quarter of 2023 was hurt by lower prices for major products. Nevertheless, it is gaining from a healthy demand environment. A recovery in economic activities is driving demand for its specialty fertilizer, Trio. Higher demand for key products is expected to drive IPI’s volumes.The company also remains focused on executing its capital projects, which are expected to improve its production. The primary objectives for its 2023 capital expenditures are investment in potash and Trio assets and its sand project at Intrepid South. Intrepid Potash, Inc Price and Consensus Intrepid Potash, Inc Price and ConsensusIntrepid Potash, Inc price-consensus-chart | Intrepid Potash, Inc Quote Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksIntrepid Potash currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks worth a look in the basic materials space include PPG Industries, Inc.

You should consider the Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Small Cap Equity ETF (GSSC), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 06/28/2017.The fund is sponsored by Goldman Sachs Funds. It has amassed assets over $476.36 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Small Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.Why Small Cap BlendSmall cap companies have market capitalization below $2 billion. They usually have higher potential than large and mid cap companies with stocks but higher risk.Typically holding a combination of both growth and value stocks, blend ETFs also demonstrate qualities seen in value and growth investments.CostsCost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts if all other fundamentals are the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.20%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.36%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Industrials sector--about 19.50% of the portfolio. Financials and Information Technology round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Jun 23 Cme Eminirus2k (RTYM3) accounts for about 1.16% of total assets, followed by Atkore Inc (ATKR) and Emcor Group Inc (EME).The top 10 holdings account for about 4.28% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskGSSC seeks to match the performance of the Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Small Cap Equity Index before fees and expenses. The Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Small Cap Equity Index is designed to deliver exposure to equity securities of small capitalization U.S. issuers.Story continuesThe ETF has gained about 8.67% so far this year and it's up approximately 13.15% in the last one year (as of 07/13/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $50.18 and $61.36.The ETF has a beta of 0.99 and standard deviation of 22.37% for the trailing three-year period. With about 1249 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesGoldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Small Cap Equity ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, GSSC is a sufficient option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Small Cap Blend area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.The iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) and the iShares Core S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF (IJR) track a similar index. While iShares Russell 2000 ETF has $55.88 billion in assets, iShares Core S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF has $70.52 billion. IWM has an expense ratio of 0.19% and IJR charges 0.06%.Bottom-LineAn increasingly popular option among retail and institutional investors, passively managed ETFs offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; they are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company is likely to have witnessed a year-over-year decline in quarterly earnings, whereas its revenues are expected to have increased.In the last reported quarter, Goldman’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company’s results were adversely impacted by a slump in the investment banking (IB) business. Yet, provision benefits and strength in the consumer banking business acted as tailwinds.Over the trailing four quarters, the company’s earnings surpassed the consensus estimate on three of the four occasions and missed once, the negative surprise being 1.94%, on average.The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. price-eps-surprise | The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. QuoteMajor Factors at PlayTrading Revenues: At an industry conference,Goldman Sachs’president and chief operating officer, John Waldron, revealed that the firm expected trading revenues to decline 25% year over year in second-quarter 2023. ""The macro backdrop is extraordinarily challenging,” he added. This led to sluggish capital market activity, and muted equities and fixed-income activity levels than that witnessed a year ago.Tougher comps from the prior year are also expected to have weighed on the company’s year-over-year performance in second-quarter 2023. Rising interest rates and a rise in the commodities business due to volatile energy markets, owing to the war in Ukraine, drove higher market activity levels in second-quarter 2022. This propelled revenues in market-oriented businesses.IB Fees: Global deal-making continued to shrink on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter, whereas green shoots were visible toward the end of the quarter. A host of factors like geopolitical tensions, stand-off over the U.S. debt ceiling, inflation, rising interest rates and fears of a global recession acted as major headwinds.Story continuesThus, the deal volume and total value numbers crashed in the second quarter. Therefore, Goldman’s advisory fees are expected to have been hurt in the June-ended quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2023 IB fees of $1.57 billion indicates an 11.8% decline from the prior-year quarter. Our estimate for IB fees is pinned at $1.75 billion.Net Interest Income (NII): Banks’ lending activities declined in the second quarter, with the Federal Reserve’s latest data indicating that the demand for commercial and industrial loans was soft in April and May, whereas real estate loans and consumer loans (specifically credit cards) witnessed decent demand.Continuing with its efforts to curb persistent inflation, the Fed raised the interest rates by another 25 basis points in May before pausing the hike in the June FOMC meeting. The policy rate is now at a 15-year-high of 5-5.25%. This is likely to have had a favorable impact on GS’ NII. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total net-interest income is pegged at $1.92 billion, indicating a year-over-year rise of 11%. Our estimate for the same is pinned at $1.95 billion.However, the inversion of the yield curve in the June-ended quarter and higher deposit costs are likely to have weighed on the total net-interest income to some extent.Also, the company has been making efforts to narrow its consumer businesses and cease unsecured loan offerings to consumers through Marcus. In the first quarter of 2023, the firm sold $1 billion of Marcus loans and transferred the remaining $2.88-billion loans to be held for sale. As a result, the firm incurred a loss of $470 million in net revenues. This trend is expected to have continued in second-quarter 2023 and reduce NII from Platform Solutions.In April 2023, the company announced that it was initiating a process to explore the sale of GreenSky. GS expects to book a $500-million goodwill impairment in the second quarter related to the sale.Expenses: Goldman’s investments in technology are anticipated to have led to a rise in costs in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, an increase in transaction-based expenses due to higher client activity and inflationary pressure across most expense lines is expected to have affected earnings.Moreover, the company’s European unit — Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE — was fined an administrative penalty of €6.63 million in the second quarter by the European Central Bank for credit risk reporting errors and miscalculating its risk weighted assets. This is expected to have increased litigation expenses for the company.What Our Model PredictsOur proven model does not show that Goldman has the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: The Earnings ESP for Goldman is 0.00%.Zacks Rank: The company currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings has been revised 40.8% lower to $4.53 per share  over the past month. The consensus estimate suggests a 62.6% year-over-year fall.Also, the consensus estimate of $11.96 billion for quarterly revenues indicates a 0.8% sequential rise. Our estimate for revenues is pinned at $12.8 billion.Stocks That Warrant a LookFirst Citizens BancShares, Inc. FCNCA and Byline Bancorp, Inc. BY are a couple of stocks, which have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around.The Earnings ESP for FCNCA is +3.21% and the company currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3.

118,0de1fc2f-8f6d-3174-b218-ad8f11750636,GS,2023-07-13,Analysts Estimate Goldman Sachs (GS) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-goldman-sachs-gs-140042657.html,1689170442,STORY,"['GS', 'GSBD', 'IBKR']","[The market expects Goldman Sachs (GS) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 19. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis investment bank is expected to post quarterly earnings of $4.53 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -41.4%.Revenues are expected to be $11.63 billion, down 2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 8.12% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Goldman?For Goldman, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -36.18%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Goldman will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Goldman would post earnings of $8.14 per share when it actually produced earnings of $8.79, delivering a surprise of +7.99%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Goldman doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (IBKR), is soon expected to post earnings of $1.40 per share for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +66.7%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $1.04 billion, up 58.5% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0.89%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), this Earnings ESP indicates that Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

At what cost?,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/banks-are-fighting-to-keep-deposits-at-what-cost-110301502.html,1689159781,STORY,"['BAC', 'USB', 'PPC', 'WFC', 'CMA', 'STT', 'STT-PD', 'STT-PG', 'FBAKX', 'MS', 'CFG', 'CFG-PD', 'CFG-PE', 'JPM', 'HBAN', 'HBANL', 'HBANM', 'HBANP', 'C', 'ZION', 'KEY', 'MIMTF', 'GS']","[Bank deposit rates are the highest in a decade and a half. That’s good news for savers, but bad news for lenders as they prepare to release their second-quarter results.US banks spent the last several months competing with each other to keep or bring back depositors following the turmoil that took down three sizable regional institutions and triggered outflows across the banking system.That scramble pushed rates on savings accounts to 5.05% at the end of the second quarter, according to Bankrate, their steepest level since February 2008.Read more: The best high-yield savings account rates for July 2023The challenge for banks across the US is that these higher funding costs are eating into a key measure of profitability known as net interest margin, which measures the difference between what lenders make from their loans and what they pay for their deposits.That will likely act as a drag on results for some banks in the quarter, especially the mid-sized regional institutions that ran into trouble last spring, while reducing estimates of what they can earn for the rest of the year.“The surprises this quarter will be for the banks that do not lower expectations,” Wells Fargo bank analyst Mike Mayo told Yahoo Finance.Banks, added Argus Research's Stephen Biggar, ""have a deposit conundrum.""'Green shoots'?These pressures will be at the front of mind for investors starting Friday as they digest the first set of second quarter earnings from JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), and State Street (STT).Bank of America (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS) report next Tuesday and Goldman Sachs (GS) next Wednesday. A slew of other regional banks will also report in the coming weeks.Some of the biggest US banks are expected to once again demonstrate their resilience and diversity, showing they can continue to charge more for their loans while leaning on their sprawling franchises to generate additional revenue.Story continuesJPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America are all expected to show jumps in net income when compared to the year-earlier period, according to analyst estimates, while Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley are expected to report profit declines.JPMorgan's headquarters in New York City. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Those that are more dependent on investment banking, such as Goldman, are expected to be particularly challenged by a recent drought in deal making.Global investment banking revenues for the second quarter fell by 8% from the first quarter and 52% from a year ago, according to Dealogic. However, the business improved through the second half of the quarter, prompting some observers to predict “green shoots” ahead.“I’m turning to believing investment banking will not have great earnings but they’re going to be surprising, and I think better than expected,” said Dick Bove, a bank analyst with Odeon Capital.Investors will also be watching to see whether many of these big banks increase the amounts they set aside for future loan losses, a sign that they expect the US economy and credit conditions to worsen.“We're starting to see some increased delinquencies, particularly in the credit card and auto lending market,” said Biggar, Argus Research's director of financial services.'A huge amount of problems'Smaller regional banks are clearly not under the same amount of pressure as they were in March, when the fall of Silicon Valley Bank triggered panic across the country.But they still “face a huge amount of problems,” Bove said.The core issue is an aggressive campaign by the Federal Reserve to bring down inflation with higher interest rates. That campaign is lowering the value of the assets banks hold, such as bonds, while deposit costs creep higher and loan demand slows.Read more: Why now is a good time to open a savings account“We view accelerating deposit costs, not accelerating deposit outflows, as the most significant headwind to earnings for the next several quarters,“ Manan Gosalia, a regional bank analyst for Morgan Stanley, said in a research note.Higher rates have traditionally worked to the advantage of banks since it allows them to charge more for their loans than their deposits.But the panic of the spring “has changed the calculus a bit” for some banks, the Fed’s vice chair of supervision Michael Barr said Monday. Some lenders “are now paying up more for deposits,” and the Fed is “paying careful attention to that.”Silicon Valley Bank was seized on March 10. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)The Fed has made it clear that more hikes are coming this year. Regulators are also preparing new capital requirements for banks with more than $100 billion in assets that will force some to hold greater buffers against losses. That will increase the stability of those lenders but will also make it even more difficult to earn robust profits in the near term.Many banks have already warned at a conference in June that their net interest margins are going to drop by more than they expected for the quarter or the year, including executives for US Bancorp (USB), Citizens Financial Group (CFG), Comerica (CMA), Huntington (HBAN), KeyCorp (KEY), and Zions (ZION).“I’ve only been a banker for 10 years, so I haven’t seen a time when we’ve needed deposits as an industry as much as we do now,” Darrin Williams, the CEO of the 58-branch Southern Bancorp, told Yahoo Finance.The amount Southern Bancorp is paying customers has risen 600% since the Fed’s interest rate hiking cycle began, Williams added.“Our cost of funds continues to rise just because our customers demand that.”The larger banks aren’t immune to some of these same challenges.“Deposits will continue the trend of being slightly down from here,” Jennifer Piepszak, co-CEO of JPMorgan Chase's massive consumer and community bank, said at a conference in June.The bank has predicted it will earn net interest income of $84 billion in 2023, but if the deposit pressure keeps up, that figure could experience a “mild reprice,” she said.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.The fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Global Payments (GPN) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to GPN for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Global Payments' Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Global Payments' main business drivers.Global Payments is headquartered in Atlanta, GA. The company was incorporated in Georgia as Global Payments Inc. in 2000 and spun-off from its former parent company in 2001. Including its time as part of its former parent company, it has been in the payment technology services business since 1967. Since its spin-off, the company has expanded in existing markets and into new markets internationally by pursuing further acquisitions and joint ventures.The company operates via three reportable segments: Merchant Solutions (68.8% of 2022 adjusted segmental revenues); Issuer Solutions (23.7%); and Consumer Solutions (7.5%).Merchant Solutions offers payments technology and software solutions to customers globally. The payment technology solutions enable its customers to accept card, check and digital-based payments. Its software solutions streamline business operations for customers in numerous vertical markets. Via this business, the company provides a variety of value-added services including specialty point-of-sale solutions, analytic and customer engagement tools, payroll and human capital management services and reporting that assists its customers with driving demand and operating their businesses more efficiently.Issuer Solutions provides services that empower financial institutions and other financial service providers to manage their card portfolios, minimize technical complexity and overhead and extend a seamless experience for cardholders on a single platform.Consumer Solutions provides general-purpose reloadable prepaid debit and payroll cards, demand deposit accounts and other financial service solutions to the underbanked and other consumers along with businesses in the United States through its Netspend and other brands. It has closed the divestiture of Netspend’s consumer assets in late April.Story continuesBottom LineAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio requires research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Global Payments ten years ago, you're likely feeling pretty good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in July 2013 would be worth $4,506.24, or a gain of 350.62%, as of July 12, 2023, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.The S&amp;P 500 rose 165.03% and the price of gold increased 44.57% over the same time frame in comparison.Analysts are forecasting more upside for GPN too.The growing demand for digital payment methods is expected to support Global Payments' transaction volume growth. The acquisition of Mineral Tree is expected to give it a wide footprint in the cloud-based business-to-business payment market. Solid contributions from GPN's merchant business are aiding its bottom line. Even though its shares have underperformed the industry in a year, things are likely to improve in the future. A favorable 2023 outlook buoys investors’ confidence. Adjusted EPS is forecasted within $10.32-$10.44, suggesting year-over-year growth. Its solid operating cash flow enable business investments. However, despite implementing cost control measures, its operating costs are on the rise, which can strain margins. Also, its ROE is much lower than the industry average. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.The stock is up 7.67% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 2 higher, for fiscal 2023. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Meanwhile, EVs already account for 86% of new car sales in Norway and 72% in Iceland, according to statistics cited by Canary Media.Even Chinese consumers are more enthusiastic about this transition than their American counterparts, those numbers show 16% of all cars sold in China in 2021 were electric, whereas the figure in the U.S. is just 5%, ranking it number 19 out of the 20 countries charted.The Biden Administration can’t be happy with those findings.The transition to clean energy is a key part of the government’s agenda and subsidies in the Inflation Reduction Act were supposed to make EVs more appealing. The legislation earmarked up to $7,500 in tax credits for each American motorist who ditched their gas guzzler. The administration’s strict new pollution limits are intended to push EV sales to 67% of the market by 2032.Unfortunately, the carrot-and-stick approach hasn’t worked.

There are only 53,000 electric charging stations in the U.S. compared to 145,000 gas stations, according to the World Economic Forum. Charging an EV is substantially more time consuming, which explains why charging stations need to exceed gas stations for comparable availability.Reliability ranks as another key issue. Drivers seldom have to worry about their local gas station being out of service – but one-fourth of charging stations tested by climate advocacy group Cool the Earth didn’t function.Resolving these issues could take years, which means the Biden Administration’s target of 67% EV adoption is likely unrealistic. It also means gas-powered vehicles and fossil fuels are here to stay for the foreseeable future. The petroleum sector is under appreciated by many investors, which could create bargain opportunities.Here are three top oil and gas stocks to put on your radar.Occidental Petroleum Corp.Warren Buffett’s favorite energy stock (NYSE:OXY) is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio just below 7. Berkshire Hathaway recently purchased 4.66 million shares of the Houston-based oil producer for about $275 million. Buffett’s company has been steadily increasing its stake in Occidental Petroleum, having received regulatory approval to up its stake of the company to 50%. If it’s good enough for the Oracle of Omaha, it has to be fit for your fossil fuel watch list.Hess Corp.This New York-based oil and gas giant (NYSE:HES) is special because of its exposure to Guyana. The tiny South American nation discovered oil off its coast a few years ago and could be a major producer, churning out 1 million barrels a day, by 2027. Hess Corp. has a 30% stake in a massive bloc in this region, which means its production is more insulated from government regulation and environmental action than its domestic peers. The stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 20.8.Schlumberger NVDrilling and exporting oil isn’t the only way to make money in this sector.

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.64 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -11.8%.Revenues are expected to be $1.76 billion, down 0.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.29% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Northern Trust Corporation?For Northern Trust Corporation, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.40%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Northern Trust Corporation will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Northern Trust Corporation would post earnings of $1.51 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.51, delivering no surprise.The company has not been able to beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Northern Trust Corporation doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, Bank of America (BAC) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.84 per share for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +15.1%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $25.03 billion, up 10.3% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Bank of America has been revised 0.7% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.59%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Bank of America will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

QGEN is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, backed by the broad-based organic sales growth from its non-COVID product groups. The company’s next-generation sequencing (NGS) portfolio has been witnessing double-digit revenue growth over the past few quarters. QIAGEN is also progressing well with its testing menu expansion strategy. Meanwhile, COVID’s headwinds in China impacted the company’s international revenues. Escalating expenses are an added concern.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has declined 2.5% compared with a 12% decline of the industry. The S&amp;P 500 composite has witnessed a 15.8% rise in the said time frame.The renowned global provider of sample and assay technologies has a market capitalization of $10.27 billion. QIAGEN has an earnings yield of 4.70% compared with the industry’s -31.47%. QGEN’s earnings surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters, delivering an average surprise of 13.1%.Let’s delve deeper.UpsidesSolid NGS Platform Prospects: In the last reported quarter, Genomics/NGS portfolio reported solid CER growth in the universal NGS kits for use in any sequencer and in the QIAGEN Digital Insights bioinformatics business. QIAGEN recently expanded its QIAseq Targeted DNA product portfolio with the addition of cell-free DNA NGS kits.In addition, the company launched the QIAseq Platform Partnership program in March 2023. The first partnership with SOPHiA GENETICS will bring together QIAGEN’s QIAseq reagent technology with SOPHiA DDM digital analytics platform to expand compatibility with data-driven medicine. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Huge Potential in Molecular Diagnostics: Within the group, the QuantiFERON latent TB test continued its double-digit CER growth with strength across all the regions.QIAGEN’s PCR clinical testing systems — QIAstat Diagnostics and NeuMoDx — made good progress in transitioning to non-COVID use during the first quarter. QIAstat Diagnostics experienced strong sales growth in GI (gastrointestinal) and Meningitis panels in Europe. The QIAcuity portfolio of digital PCR system and application kit witnessed solid instruments placement and an increasing uptake of consumables across the region.Story continuesProgress With Test Menu Expansion: In April 2023, QIAGEN announced that QIAstat-Dx SARS-CoV-2 Respiratory Panel is expected to be available in mid-2023 for use in Japan. This follows the recent granting of IVD (in-vitro diagnostic) approval for the test, and is subject to decisions on reimbursement levels.Further, the company’s QIAxcel Connect marks the fourth QIAGEN instrument to have received the prestigious Red Dot award. QIAGEN expanded its high-quality enzymes offering as individual products, allowing researchers worldwide to customize their assays and workflows.In January 2023, QIAGEN launched EZ2 Connect MDx for use in diagnostic laboratories. The company’s bioinformatics business introduced an enhanced QIAGEN CLC Genomics Workbench Premium, incorporating Lightspeed’s ground-breaking technology.DownsidesMounting Expenses Put Pressure: The company’s year-over-year decline in the top and bottom lines raises apprehension. QIAGEN’s first-quarter adjusted operating income reflected a significant decline in COVID-19-related sales and higher R&amp;D investments compared with the prior-year period. Stiff competition from firms offering pre-analytical solutions and other products used by QIAGEN’s customers continues to persist.International Sales Discouraging: QIAGEN currently markets products in more than 100 countries. In the first quarter of 2023, the Asia-Pacific / Japan region non-COVID sales were largely unchanged compared with the prior-year quarter’s figure. This indicated a significant decline of more than 30% CER in China due to COVID headwinds from the first quarter of 2022.Estimate TrendIn the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for QIAGEN’s 2023 earnings per share has remained constant at $2.12.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $2.04 billion. This suggests a decrease of 4.7% from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Haemonetics HAE, Zimmer Biomet ZBH and Hologic, Inc.

ILMN recently announced the launch of the latest version of DRAGEN software, DRAGEN 4.2, for analysis of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. DRAGEN 4.2 is expected to expand accuracy combined with its flexibility and scalability to enable efficient workflows and extract meaningful insights from genomic data.The latest launch is expected to significantly solidify Illumina’s foothold in the global genomics analysis space and boost its sequencing business.Significance of the LaunchPer an expert familiar with the use of DRAGEN software, the latest offering of DRAGEN 4.2 is likely to be a significant step for genomics analysis as it combines the detection of multiple variant types in addition to a single nucleotide variant or SNV. This will likely foster a comprehensive analysis of genomic samples. The expert also feels that DRAGEN 4.2’s new features, which include new approaches for cardiovascular diseases such as callers for Lipoprotein(a) or LP(a), will likely provide a deeper insight into the gene.Per Illumina, LP(a) is currently emerging as a clinically significant potential risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Targeted calling of the genetic variant associated with high levels of LP(a) can further help clinical research and aid in the development of testing and therapies.Per Illumina’s management, DRAGEN’s ability to perform high-quality, fast, accurate and comprehensive NGS analysis workflows is expected to be ideally suited to support the healthcare and research industry in secondary analysis.Industry ProspectsPer a report by MarketsandMarkets, the global genomics market was estimated to be $46.2 billion in 2023 and is anticipated to reach $83.1 billion by 2028 at a CAGR of 12.4%. Factors like the growing demand for gene therapy, increasing cancer incidence and significant decrease in sequencing costs are likely to drive the market.Given the market potential, the launch seems to have been timed well.Story continuesNotable DevelopmentsLast month, Illumina announced the new PrimateAI-3D, an artificial intelligence algorithm that predicts disease-causing genetic mutations in patients.In April, Illumina announced its first-quarter 2023 results, wherein it registered an improvement in its top line on a sequential basis.

ALC scaled a new 52-week high of $83.89 on Jul 11, before closing the session slightly lower at $83.78.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has gained 19% compared with the 15.4% rise of the industry. The S&amp;P 500 has witnessed a 18.5% growth in the said time frame.The company’s long-term expected growth rate of 14.9%. DaVita’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and break-even in one, the average surprise being 8.9%.Alcon is witnessing an upward trend in its stock price, prompted by solid demand, strong commercial execution and pricing improvements across the Surgical and Vision Care franchises. The upbeat guidance for 2023 is encouraging. However, escalated costs and a tough competitive space do not bode well for Alcon.Let’s delve deeper.Key Growth DriversSurgical Business Grows: In the first quarter, Total Surgical (consisting of implantables, consumables and equipment/other) recorded sales growth of 8% at CER. Within Implantables, excluding the impact from Korea, sales were up nearly 5% on a reported basis and approximately 9% on a constant-currency basis. The company continued with its ATIOL market leadership for another quarter with approximately half of the global market and two thirds of the U.S. market, despite increasing competitive activity. In consumables, first-quarter sales were up 13%, driven by favorable market conditions and pricing. In equipment, sales were up 14% year over year on continued strong demand for cataract and Vit-Ret devices, particularly in international markets as the company upgraded and expanded its installed base.Vision Care Returns to Growth: Total Vision Care (comprising contact lenses and ocular health) reported sales grew 16% year over year at CER. The upside includes approximately 5 points contribution from the ophthalmic pharmaceutical products the company acquired in 2022.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesNet sales of contact lenses increased 10% at CER. Sales were led by continued growth in silicone hydrogel contact lenses, including the Precision1 and Total product families and price increases.Upbeat Guidance: The company maintained its net sales projection in the range of $9.2-$9.4 billion, indicating growth of 6-8% at CER from 2022. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ALC’s revenues is pegged at $9.24 billion.Alcon raised its projection of core earnings per share in the range of $2.55-$2.65, suggesting growth of 20-24% at CER over 2022. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ALC’s earnings is currently pegged at $2.59 per share.DownsidesCost Pressure Remains: The cost of net sales in the quarter was up 6.5% year over year. The core operating margin was 14.2% in the quarter, contracting 14 bps year over year at CER. The company’s operating margin in the quarter was impacted by an unfavorable product mix from lower PCIOL sales in South Korea, higher R&amp;D investment following the acquisition of Aerie and a negative 1.3% impact from currency.Tough Competitive Landscape: The ophthalmology industry is highly competitive. In both surgical and vision care businesses, Alcon faces intense competition. In the surgical business, Alcon faces a mixture of competitors, ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small manufacturers that offer a limited selection of specialized products.Other Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

On that day, Netflix is projected to report earnings of $2.81 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 12.19%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $8.26 billion, up 3.61% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $11.26 per share and revenue of $33.91 billion, which would represent changes of +13.17% and +7.27%, respectively, from the prior year.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Netflix. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of popular hedge funds and their performance, head directly to 5 Most Owned Stocks by Hedge Funds. In 2022, the hedge fund industry experienced a decline of 2.4%, showing some improvement from a challenging first half of the year when the industry was down 4.6%. The losses were primarily influenced by the difficult market circumstances for high-risk assets, particularly impacting hedge funds with a long-biased approach and/or higher volatility. This marked the weakest performance for the hedge fund industry since 2018 when it also posted a 2.4% loss. Looking at the five-year performance, hedge funds have achieved a compounded annual return of +4.2%, demonstrating a more favorable performance compared to bonds, which experienced a decline of 2.0%. Aurum, a hedge fund investment specialist, noted that there were clear winners and losers in the hedge fund industry in 2022. The best-performing strategies were multi-strategy (+9.5%), quant (+8.5%), and macro (+6.7%). Strategies that typically have a higher correlation to equities and fixed income, which experienced poor performance, struggled the most. Patrick Ghali, managing partner of hedge fund advisory firm Sussex Partners, told Reuters on January 10, 2023: ""Investors need to look under the surface to understand the industry performance last year. Long-short hedge funds are the biggest asset-weighted part of the industry. Overall, I believe it was a good year for hedge funds.""Don't Miss: 15 Most Profitable Hedge Funds in the WorldAccording to Hedge Fund Research (HFR), the total global capital invested in hedge funds reached $3.83 trillion by the end of 2022, reflecting a quarterly increase of $44 billion.

Smaller funds generally outperformed larger ones, as indicated by the median return of -2.86%. HFR also highlighted that macro strategies, including fundamental commodity, discretionary, and quantitative trend-following CTA sub-strategies, were the leading hedge fund strategies globally. Story continuesDespite the dull performance of hedge funds, Citadel, led by Ken Griffin, achieved an exceptional feat by generating an unprecedented $16 billion in profits for its clients in 2022. This performance not only surpassed other players in the industry but also stands as one of the most prominent financial successes in history. Chairman Rick Sopher of LCH Investments commented: “The largest gains were once again made by the large multi-strategy hedge funds like Citadel, DE Shaw and Millennium. The strong gains they have generated in recent years reflect their increasing dominance in strategies which do not depend on rising asset prices, and their substantial size.”Individual investors often look up to elite hedge funds and try to imitate their performance.

(NYSE:WMT) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“The pandemic has created challenges for businesses large and small; one major challenge for large essential retailers such as ClearBridge holdings Home Depot, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Costco have been ensuring adequate staffing to meet demand under trying conditions. All three instituted enhanced pay practices during the pandemic, with raises, unplanned bonuses and other benefits helping compensate employees for their efforts in a difficult environment. In September 2020 Walmart raised wages for 165,000 employees, including a number of entry positions to $15 an hour.

JPMorgan Chase comes to mind especially here, but so does Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) despite its weakness in March, as well as U.S. Bancorp, to which we added opportunistically in the quarter.”23. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 95On June 27, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) stock saw a slight increase in pre-market trading after Bank of America expressed confidence in the company's strategic direction. Despite concerns regarding the box office, streaming business, and other challenges, analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich maintained a Buy rating and set a price target of $135 on the shares. The analyst acknowledged that some recent content, including the Pixar film Elemental, did not meet audience expectations, but attributed this to production circumstances during the pandemic and past leadership. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is one of the most owned stocks by hedge funds.

It is the global leader in theme parks with hotels and cruise lines aimed at families. Key assets within Disney are the instantly recognisable entertainment franchises that have multiple avenues of monetisation such as Mickey Mouse, Star Wars, ABC and Marvel’s Avengers.Disney’s share price declined due to a number of factors in 2022, presenting us the chance to purchase a long-admired business and its unique collection of valuable intellectual property assets at what we consider to be a very attractive valuation. Summarily, the EPS of Disney has declined from US$7 in 2018 to ~US$2.60 in 2022 but we believe that the earnings power of the assets has not diminished to anywhere near this extent.Disney is currently undergoing a business transition within the Media and Entertainment Distribution division (DMED) from traditional media property distribution via third parties (i.e. cinemas and broadcast networks) to a Direct-To-Consumer (DTC) model via the Disney+ streaming service. A key element of our thesis is that the earnings power of the company is currently being masked by the marketing and content investments within Disney+ and that this will normalize over the next several years. To put this in perspective, Disney+ (DTC sub-segment) currently generates operating losses of over US$3.3bn (a negative 14% operating margin) compared to operating margins at its nearest streaming competitor, Netflix, of +15.5%…” (Click here to read the full text)22.

The company’s core operating metrics were equally strong with remaining performance obligations growing 24% year-on-year and renewal rates holding firm at 98%. ServiceNow’s renewal rates are noteworthy as not only are they best-in-class but they are also remarkably consistent, typically in the range of 97% to 99%. They speak to the mission critical nature of the platform and are a key driver of long term annuity value. Overall, we continue to believe that ServiceNow is one of the highest quality software businesses around as the combination of consistent growth at scale, robust free cash flow generation and a large addressable market make it an attractive opportunity.”21.

We took an initial position recently and are now raising it to an average weight within the Portfolio. During the most recent quarter, the company grew revenue 11% in constant currency. Core organic growth, excluding COVID-19 testing revenue which fell 16%, grew a very strong 13%. This company plays an important role within the Portfolio as a “safety” within our growth spectrum approach and over the next five years we expect EBITDA and EPS to grow at roughly low double digits and low teens, respectively.”20.

This arrangement alleviates some risk off PayPal Holdings, Inc.

(NASDAQ:PYPL), compared to 115 funds in the prior quarter.

(NASDAQ:PYPL) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“For our purposes, we are just going to focus on software digital wallets, as they are much more common and accessible. If you own an iPhone, then you have an Apple Pay preloaded digital wallet. If you have a Samsung phone, you have Samsung Pay available for use. Those two, along with Google Pay and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), are the four most popular digital wallets today. According to the Payments Journal, PayPal has been used (over the last 12 months) by 62% of American consumers, followed by Apple Pay at 41% and Google Pay at 32%.Over the last several years, P2P payments have made tremendous strides in adoption and usage. Whenever something becomes a verb, like just Venmo me $10, you know that it has been widely embraced by society. The concept of allowing individuals to pay each other, via our smartphones, has clearly taken off.However, the biggest flaw or issue (that we’ve identified) is interoperability. Digital wallets allow users to pick their favorite card to make payments with. P2P acts as a bit of a “walled garden” and its funding source is still siloed. This is a critical aspect for future P2P growth, as Venmo users can’t pay Cash App users who can’t pay Zelle users. Visa is launching Visa+ next year and it has already signed up PayPal and Venmo as its initial customers. The global card networks seem like the perfect piece to solve this interoperability puzzle. Of course, this will only work if banks allow an independent network to serve as the gateway between disparate user bases…” (Click here to read the full text)17. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 108Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is a favorite stock among elite hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:NFLX) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Top contributors to performance for the quarter included global streaming giant Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX).

(NYSE:JPM), compared to 100 funds in the earlier quarter. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is the biggest stakeholder of the company. Manole Capital Management made the following comment about JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“It will be interesting to see what kind of policy decisions are made around regulation for institutions that are between $100 billion of assets and $700 billion of assets. As JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM)’s purchase of First Republic shows, scale is a competitive advantage. It now has 13% of total US deposits and it manages 21% of America’s credit card spending. With additional regulatory burdens coming, banks are facing a profitability headwind and 100 to 300 basis points of possible ROE erosion.The banking sector is facing a slow-moving crisis, but we aren’t sure it is enough to sink the overall health of the US consumer or economy. Credit will contract and lending standards will continue to rise. However, we do not see this problem escalating to the size and scale of previous banking crises.Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JP Morgan Chase clearly sees the risks these FINTECH companies present. In his annual letter to shareholders, he stated that all incumbent banks should be “scared shitless” of these FINTECH rivals. Not only is his bank being attacked from multiple angles, but Apple just launched a cash management program with Goldman Sachs. On the first day of Apple’s savings program, it raised $400 million and eclipsed $1 billion in its first four days. Dimon specifically labeled Apple a bank the other day in an interview when he said, “It may not have insured deposits, but it’s a bank. If you move money, hold money, manage money, lend money — that’s a bank.”14.

Insider Monkey’s first quarter database indicated that 116 hedge funds were bullish on the stock, up from 110 in the prior quarter. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is the largest stakeholder of the company. L1 Capital International Fund made the following comment about UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“During the March 2023 quarter, while share prices changed, the change was largely in one direction, up, for companies in our Portfolio and on our Bench. We did take advantage of improving sentiment to higher growth technology companies and the share price of more defensive companies drifting down to divest our investment in Adobe and increase the Fund’s investment in UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH). United Health’s share price was also under moderate pressure due to regulatory announcements being very slightly adverse. We believe the market over-reacted to these announcements and the share price has recovered strongly over recent weeks.”13. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 128Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) is one of the most owned stocks by smart investors.

Alibaba operates shopping platforms Taobao and Tmall and owns 33% of Ant Group, which operates Alipay, China’s largest third-party online payment provider. Shares of Alibaba were up this quarter, given meaningful margin expansion, guidance to stabilize core commerce market share in China, and an announced plan to split the company into six units which could further unlock value. We retain conviction that Alibaba is well positioned to benefit from China’s reopening and the ongoing growth in online commerce and cloud in China.”12. Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 128Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) develops and publishes interactive entertainment content. It is one of the favorite stocks of elite hedge funds. On July 11, Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) stock climbed 5% after a federal court granted Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) permission to proceed with its acquisition of the video game company for $69 billion.

We initiated the position in November 2021 and, despite crystalizing a gain on the investment, we are admittedly a little frustrated with how this has played out. In January 2022, Microsoft (MSFT) agreed to acquire the company for $95/share, but regulators are determined to block the transaction, and appear increasingly activist, in our opinion.”11. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 131At the end of June 2023, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s valuation surpassed $3 trillion, solidifying its position as the world's most valuable company.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) with a Buy rating and a price target of $240, noted that investors are underestimating the potential for gross margin expansion by the tech giant.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) remains a popular choice in the stock portfolios of elite hedge funds. Manole Capital Management made the following comment about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Despite this, the S&amp;P 500 is up 7% this year and the Nasdaq is up +11%. Technology rebounded from a challenging 2022 and many large tech companies are performing quite well this year. Through mid-May 2023, year-to-date performance of some of the most popular and largest tech names is impressive. For tech companies with market capitalizations over $1 trillion, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is up +35%, Microsoft +33%, Amazon +39%, and Google is +40%. In terms of contribution to the S&amp;P 500’s year-to-date return, Apple and Microsoft represent roughly half of its 2023 performance. Apple, and Microsoft now account for 13.9% of the entire S&amp;P 500 or 80% more concentrated than 2008. For additional perspective, Apple’s market cap is at $2.8 trillion and that is larger than the market cap of the entire Russell 2000. To conclude, it’s distinctly getting more concentrated at the top.For our purposes, we are just going to focus on software digital wallets, as they are much more common and accessible. If you own an iPhone, then you have an Apple Pay preloaded digital wallet. If you have a Samsung phone, you have Samsung Pay available for use. Those two, along with Google Pay and PayPal, are the four most popular digital wallets today. According to the Payments Journal, PayPal has been used (over the last 12 months) by 62% of American consumers, followed by Apple Pay at 41% and Google Pay at 32%.Digital wallets have tons of advantages that we are embracing. When we attend Tampa Bay Lightning games, we love having our season tickets easily accessible on our phones (via the Apple Pay wallet), as well as our timed parking pass. When we travel, loading the airline ticket into our Apple Pay wallet is much more convenient than printing out a paper boarding pass.

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 132NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), an American semiconductor giant, is one of the most owned stocks among smart investors. On July 10, Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari reaffirmed a Buy rating on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and expressed confidence in the company's advancement in the field of general artificial intelligence. The analyst also raised the firm's price target for Nvidia shares from $440 to $495, citing the notable growth in data center revenue, which implies a significant advancement for the company in this new phase.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 132 hedge funds were bullish on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), compared to 106 funds in the prior quarter. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is a significant stakeholder of the company, with 8.2 million shares worth $2.3 billion. ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“The Strategy’s IT holdings also drove performance in the second quarter, led by the continued rerating of graphics chipmaker NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as a key beneficiary of the generative AI boom. Nvidia is a good example of a select growth stock bought opportunistically where our long-term thesis has bloomed. We initiated the position in the fourth quarter of 2018 knowing that inference and training in the data center was an interesting although still early-stage growth driver. We knew that GPUs could be used to solve complex computing problems, but we didn’t know how quickly the training and learning efforts by Nvidia’s mega cap customers would hit an inflection point. Volatility in the gaming business created the entry point into the stock and we have built the position accordingly over time. Since the end of 2021, the stock’s portfolio weight grew from 4.5% to a high of 7.2% earlier in the second quarter before we trimmed it to manage our overall position sizing.We will continue to monitor and adjust Nvidia’s position sizing to manage risk. Despite the sharp run up, we believe the company’s long-term runway remains compelling due to its advantaged positioning in a very large addressable market for GPUs. The current valuation looks expensive, yet Nvidia has real earnings and cash flow and the longer-term multiple looks more reasonable because of GPU pricing power.”9. Salesforce, Inc.

The company’s software subscription term-license model differs from the traditional perpetual-license software model in two respects: (1) the software is hosted on centralized servers and delivered over the internet, as opposed to traditional enterprise software that is loaded directly onto customers’ hard drives or servers; and (2) the revenue model is subscription-based, typically charging monthly fees per user as opposed to charging one-time licensing fees. The stock’s strong relative performance followed a strong F4Q23 earnings release that easily beat Street expectations on the top- and bottom-lines. In addition to the beat, management announced a number of initiatives that activist investors have been clamoring for, specifically a halt to large M&amp;A transactions and a focus on operating profitability.”8.

We are FINTECH investors, and we define Fintech as “anything utilizing technology to improve an established process.” We realize that half of Fintech is financial, but we don’t invest in traditional, credit sensitive banks. Having managed money during the Financial Crisis, we learned firsthand how certain opaque and balance sheet intensive financials could go bankrupt or insolvent.We prefer transaction-based businesses, generating recurring revenue, with sustainable margins, and significant cash flow. From our perspective, the perfect example of a FINTECH business is the secularly growing payments industry. Names like Visa or Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), that generate revenue and profit per swipe or transaction, without the underlying credit sensitivity or risk associated with that underlying line of credit.”7.

Gross Bookings grew 19% year over year to $31 billion, driven by 31% Mobility Gross Bookings growth and 6% Delivery Growth Bookings growth. 4Q Adjusted EBITDA of $665 million, up $579 million year over year, significantly beating management’s $600-$630 million guidance. Management guided to continuing growth in 1Q for Gross Bookings (20%- 24% growth) and Adjusted EBITDA (of $660-$700 million).UBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing, with a greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates. The company is also a leader in food delivery, where it is number one or two in the more than 25 countries in which it operates. Moreover, after a history of losses, the company is now solidly profitable with the potential for substantial margin expansion and free cash flow generation to come. We view UBER as more than just ride sharing and food delivery, but also as a global mobility platform with the ability to sell to its 131 million users (by comparison, Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and penetrate new markets of on-demand services, such as package and grocery delivery, travel, truck brokerage (the company had $1.5 billion in Freight revenue for 4Q22), and worker staffing for shift work. Given its $4 billion of unrestricted cash and $5 billion of investments, the company today has an enterprise value of $70 billion, indicating that UBER trades at 1.6x next year’s estimated revenue.”6.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) stakeholder, with 36.90 million shares worth $3.8 billion. Like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the most owned stocks by hedge funds.Oakmark Global Select Fund made the following comment about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (U.S.) was the top contributor to the Fund’s performance for the quarter. Alphabet’s first-quarter search revenue growth accelerated slightly sequentially, which was notable given that advertising spending has decreased across the board. Management cited the company’s travel and retail segments for their strong performance in contrast to the declines experienced in the finance and in the media and entertainment businesses. Advertising spending has also stabilized at YouTube, and the focus on “shorts” has driven strong viewership growth. In the near term, YouTube’s investment in shorts may not generate significant revenue, but we believe its profitability will accelerate over time. Alphabet’s cloud business reached GAAP profitability this quarter, moving from a -12% margin this quarter last year to a 3% margin this quarter. On the AI front, Alphabet upgraded Bard to run on its more powerful PaLM language model, and Bard can now assist with coding and software development. CEO Sundar Pichai compared AI’s evolution to the transition from desktop to mobile computing a decade ago and said there is “a lot more to come” in terms of its consumer AI applications. CFO Ruth Porat revised 2023 capital expenditures guidance due to higher spending on data center construction and servers that will support AI developments in consumer products, advertiser tools and the cloud business. Porat reiterated that the company plans to continue to hold expense growth below revenue growth and that Alphabet’s cost-reduction initiatives should bear fruit later this year and into 2024. At Alphabet’s annual developer conference in May, the company showcased an impressive array of new AI-powered consumer tools, which will be rolled out over the course of the year. Investors reacted positively to these presentations, which highlighted the extent of AI innovation occurring at Alphabet.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Most Owned Stocks by Hedge Funds. Suggested articles:10 Best Economic Recovery Stocks to Buy11 Best Breakout Stocks to Buy Now12 Best Mining Stocks Hedge Funds Are Buying Disclosure: None. 25 Most Owned Stocks by Hedge Funds is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

(AMGN): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-amgen-inc-130007160.html,1689166807,STORY,['AMGN'],"[Amgen (AMGN) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this world's largest biotech drugmaker have returned +0.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.3% change. The Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, to which Amgen belongs, has lost 2.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Amgen is expected to post earnings of $4.46 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -4.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.4%.The consensus earnings estimate of $18 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +1.8%. This estimate has changed -0.6% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $19.14 indicates a change of +6.3% from what Amgen is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.6%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Amgen is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Amgen, the consensus sales estimate of $6.67 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.2%. The $27.46 billion and $30.59 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +4.3% and +11.4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryAmgen reported revenues of $6.11 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -2.1%. EPS of $3.98 for the same period compares with $4.25 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.15 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.66%. The EPS surprise was +3.65%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Amgen is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amgen. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Wynn Resorts The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$181.7m-US$150.5mUS$956.0mUS$1.56bUS$2.05bUS$2.51bUS$2.93bUS$3.29bUS$3.59bUS$3.84bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 31.49%Est @ 22.68%Est @ 16.51%Est @ 12.19%Est @ 9.17%Est @ 7.05% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 12% US$162-US$120US$680US$989US$1.2kUS$1.3kUS$1.3kUS$1.3kUS$1.3kUS$1.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$9.3bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 12%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.8b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (12%– 2.1%) = US$39bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$39b÷ ( 1 + 12%)10= US$13bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$22b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$108, the company appears quite good value at a 44% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Wynn Resorts as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 12%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.672. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Wynn ResortsStrengthNo major strengths identified for WYNN.WeaknessInterest payments on debt are not well covered.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Hospitality market.OpportunityExpected to breakeven next year.Has sufficient cash runway for more than 3 years based on current free cash flows.Good value based on P/S ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Total liabilities exceed total assets, which raises the risk of financial distress.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value? For Wynn Resorts, there are three fundamental aspects you should explore:Risks: Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Wynn Resorts   (of which 1 is significant!) you should know about.Management:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for WYNN's future outlook?

For instance, new companies have innovated ways for people to earn passive income in the real estate market. Here's how to invest in rental properties with as little as $100 while staying completely hands-off.Check out:Investing in real estate just got a whole lot simpler.

Here’s how to invest in the city’s growth before he floods it with new tech workers.Given Lagarde's emphasis on climate change's impact on inflation, you might also want to look into companies that can address challenges on the climate front. Here are three green stocks that are actively tackling the issue.Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 28% of America's greenhouse gas emissions in 2021 came from the transportation sector — and particularly from burning fossil fuels for cars, trucks, ships, trains and planes.Story continuesThe EPA estimates that a typical passenger vehicle emits approximately 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year.Tesla is helping resolve the issue by producing electric vehicles (EVs), which have no tailpipe emissions.The company is making quite an impact. In the second quarter of 2023, it delivered 466,140 vehicles, representing an 83% increase year over year.Tesla has been one of the more volatile names in the stock market. Shares fell a staggering 65% in 2022 but are up 147% in 2023.First Solar Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR)Solar energy can play a significant role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. One reason is that it produces no emissions during the power generation process. And according to the United Nations, life-cycle assessments of solar power ""clearly demonstrate that it has a smaller carbon footprint from ‘cradle-to-grave' than fossil fuels.""First Solar's solutions help humans harness the power of the sun. The company produces solar panels, including those used in utility-scale solar power plants.The business brought in $548 million in net sales in the first quarter of 2023. For the full year, net sales are projected to be between $3.4 billion and $3.6 billion.The stock market had a choppy ride over the past year, but First Solar investors probably aren't complaining. Over the past 12 months, shares have surged more than 170%.NextEra Energy Partners LP (NYSE:NEP)NextEra Energy Partners was created by energy company NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) to own, manage and acquire clean energy projects that generate steady cash flows.Today, NextEra Energy Partners' portfolio holds interests in wind, solar and energy storage projects in the U.S., along with natural gas infrastructure assets in Texas and Pennsylvania.Because natural gas is not considered a renewable energy source, NextEra Energy Partners is not a renewables pure-play. But it recently announced plans to become one.""To lead this transition, we are launching a process to sell our natural gas pipeline assets, and we are suspending incentive distribution rights fees to NextEra Energy through 2026,"" John Ketchum, chairman and CEO of NextEra Energy Partners, said in a press release.The partnership also stands out for its cash payout to investors.NextEra Energy Partners currently pays quarterly distributions of 84.25 cents per share, giving the stock an annual yield of 5.9%. Management expects to grow the distribution per unit by 12% to 15% per year through at least 2026, although they mentioned that given the current capital market environment, the growth rate will probably be ""at or near the bottom end of this range.""Read next:Bezos-Backed Startup Lets You Become A Landlord With $100Blackstone Bet $13 Billion On The Impending Student Housing Price Surge.

The company’s revenues and earnings in the to-be-reported quarter are expected to have witnessed increases on a year-over-year basis.In the last reported quarter, BK’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were aided by a rise in net interest revenues and marginally higher fee revenues. However, asset balances witnessed a decline and higher expenses hurt results to some extent.BNY Mellon has an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with a surprise of 5.7%, on average.The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation Price and EPS Surprise The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseThe Bank of New York Mellon Corporation price-eps-surprise | The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation QuoteThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s second-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.22, which has been revised almost 1% higher over the past seven days. The consensus estimate indicates a rise of 6.1% from the year-ago quarter’s reported number. Our estimate for second-quarter earnings is pinned at $1.21 per share.The consensus estimate for sales is pegged at $4.37 billion, implying a 2.8% rise from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. Our estimate for the same is pinned at $4.36 billion.Key Factors &amp; Estimates for Q2Fee Revenues: Supported by overall asset inflows, BNY Mellon is expected to have recorded an improvement in total assets under management (AUM) balance. Thus, the related fee is likely to have been positively impacted.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total investment services fee (comprising more than 50% of the company’s total revenues) is pegged at $2.20 billion, reflecting minimal change from the prior-year quarter’s reported number. Our estimate for the same is $2.24 billion, indicating a year-over-year rise of 1.6%.The consensus mark for financing-related fees is pegged at $45.25 million, which suggests a 2.8% year-over-year rise. Our estimate for financing-related fees is $46.8 million, indicating a rise of 6.3%.The consensus estimate for distribution and servicing fees is pegged at $33.34 million, indicating a 1.9% decline from the previous-year quarter’s reported figure. Our estimate for the same is $34.2 million.The consensus estimate for foreign exchange revenues is pegged at $178 million, suggesting a decline of 19.8% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. Our estimate for the same is pinned at $211 million, indicating a 5% decline. The consensus mark for investment and other income of $79 million suggests a year-over-year decline of 13.2%.Thus, the consensus estimate for total fees and other revenues is pegged at $3.30 billion, suggesting a decline of 3.9% from the prior-year quarter’s reported number. We also project the metric to be $3.30 billion.Net Interest Revenues (NIR): Lending activities gradually waned in the quarter amid a challenging macroeconomic backdrop.Nevertheless, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by another 25 basis points during the June-ended quarter (it did not hike interest rates in the June FOMC meeting though). The policy rate now stands at 5-5.25%. While the inversion of the yield curve and rising funding costs are expected to have weighed on margins to some extent, BK’s interest income is likely to have improved in the quarter, supported by higher rates.The consensus mark for NIR for the second quarter is pegged at $1.08 billion, indicating 30.5% year-over-year growth. Our estimate for NIR is $1.07 billion, suggesting a year-over-year rise of 29.5%.Expenses: Because of higher restructuring charges, BNY Mellon’s expenses have been elevated over the past few years. Nevertheless, overall costs are expected to have been manageable in the quarter under review, given the elimination of unnecessary management layers.Our estimate for second-quarter non-interest expenses is $3.08 billion, suggesting a year-over-year decline of 1.1%.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsAccording to our quantitative model, the chances of BNY Mellon beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time are low.

The analysis is the latest in an ongoing series that utilizes a new comprehensive model that provides unprecedented granularity to understand variations in GHG intensity from one asset to the next.S&amp;P Global Inc. logoThe average GHG intensity of production in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico was found to be 7 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent per barrel of oil equivalent (kgCO2e/boe) in 2022. However, about 78% of the total production was found to be beneath that average. Conversely, assets on the upper bound of carbon intensity—responsible for just 10 percent of total production—generated 35% of the basin's total GHG emissions. Overall, individual assets across the basin displayed a wide variability, ranging in GHG intensity from less than 2 kgCO2e/boe to nearly 50 kgCO2e/boe for most production. *""A relative minority of less-productive assets were found to be responsible for a disproportionate amount of emissions,"" said Christopher Kennett, Technical Research Associate Director, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights. ""This trend—along with the tendency for there to be a wide variability in the GHG intensity from any one asset to the next—underscores the limits of placing too much significance on overall averages when considering the GHG intensity of any given asset.""The considerable variation in intensity levels is consistent with findings for other basins. A previous S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights analysis of North Sea production found that basin to have an average intensity of 12 kgCO2e/boe in 2021 with individual assets ranging from less than 1 kgCO2e/boe to nearly 150 kgCO2e/boe.Story continuesThe analyses are derived from a new S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights capability that provides a novel and comprehensive approach to estimating upstream oil and gas production emissions. The new capability, built upon existing proprietary upstream databases and emerging sources such as reported emissions and satellite flaring data from the Earth Observation Group, makes it possible to estimate the totality of an upstream oil and gas play's emissions and emissions intensity—from across the play, down to individual assets and the sources of emissions, such as the fuels, that underpin each operation.Several factors ultimately influence the GHG intensity of an asset. These include productivity, where younger and more productive fields tend to be less GHG intensive than older, more geologically challenging fields. The latter also may require energy-intensive enhanced recovery techniques, increased drilling to maintain productivity, and older technology can also put upward pressure on emissions intensity. Other factors include the degree to which operations can be electrified and the amount of venting and flaring that occurs.In the case of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, key disparities were observed between production coming from the deepwater compared to more shallow shelf terrains. Shelf production was found to have a GHG intensity that was more than twice as high, on average, as deepwater on account of shelf production tending to come from more mature, and thus less productive, wells as well as processes that utilize more venting. Deepwater production—which constituted 86% of all production in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in 2022—tends to come from newer wells that utilize more technologically advanced techniques.""The share of production in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico coming from deepwater has increased by approximately 14% over the past decade,"" said Tomos Phillips, Senior Technical Research Analyst, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights. ""That expansion of newer, and thus more productive operations that leverage the latest technology has decreased the region's emissions intensity by 25% from 2012 to 2022 and we expect the basin's emissions profile to remain steady in the near term as more production shifts from the shelf to deepwater.""A heightened focus on decarbonization may contribute to additional declines in GHG intensity for the basin in the coming decades. Additional declines could occur from deployment of carbon capture utilization and storage technology as well as expanded use of renewable power—such as offshore wind turbines—to provide less carbon-intensive fuel sources for production in the region, the analysis says.* The 2 kgCO2e/boe to nearly 50 kgCO2e/boe range includes 99% total 2022 production covered by the US Gulf of Mexico analysis. The full range, including outliers, extends up to c. 900 kgCO2e/boe. For comparison, the GHG intensity range for 99% total 2021 production across the North Sea study area extends to c. 70 kgCO2e/boe.Media Contacts: S&amp;P Global: Jeff Marn +1-202-463-8213, jeff.marn@spglobal.comS&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, Global/EMEA: Paul Sandell + 44 (0)7816 180039, paul.sandell@spglobal.com Americas: Kathleen Tanzy + 1 917-331-4607, kathleen.tanzy@spglobal.comAsia: Melissa Tan + 65-6597-6241, melissa.tan@spglobal.comAbout S&amp;P Global Commodity InsightsAt S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, our complete view of global energy and commodity markets enables our customers to make decisions with conviction and create long-term, sustainable value.We're a trusted connector that brings together thought leaders, market participants, governments, and regulators and we create solutions that lead to progress.

150,9a5a7e19-d5f6-3b5f-8dab-fb761c56dd74,SPGI,2023-07-13,Is SPDR S&P Global Dividend ETF (WDIV) a Strong ETF Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/spdr-p-global-dividend-etf-102007799.html,1689243607,STORY,['SPGI'],"[The SPDR S&amp;P Global Dividend ETF (WDIV) was launched on 05/29/2013, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund designed to offer broad exposure to the World ETFs category of the market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?The ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on market capitalization weighted indexes that are designed to represent the market or a particular segment of the market.Market cap weighted indexes offer a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns, and are a good option for investors who believe in market efficiency.But, there are some investors who would rather invest in smart beta funds; these funds track non-cap weighted strategies, and are a strong option for those who prefer choosing great stocks in order to beat the market.This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.The smart beta space gives investors many different choices, from equal-weighting, one of the simplest strategies, to more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting. However, not all of these methodologies have been able to deliver remarkable returns.Fund Sponsor &amp; IndexThe fund is managed by State Street Global Advisors, and has been able to amass over $229.53 million, which makes it one of the average sized ETFs in the World ETFs. WDIV, before fees and expenses, seeks to match the performance of the S&amp;P Global Dividend Aristocrats Index.The S&amp;P Global Dividend Aristocrats Index measures the performance of high dividend-yield companies included in the S&amp;P Global BMI that have followed a managed-dividends policy of increasing or stable dividends for at least ten consecutive years.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesCost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins if all other fundamentals are the same.Story continuesWith on par with most peer products in the space, this ETF has annual operating expenses of 0.40%.The fund has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 4.92%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.Taking into account individual holdings, A2a S.p.a. (A2A-IT) accounts for about 1.58% of the fund's total assets, followed by New World Development Co. Ltd. (17-HK) and Lenovo Group Limited (992-HK).The top 10 holdings account for about 10.11% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskYear-to-date, the SPDR S&amp;P Global Dividend ETF return is roughly 1.49% so far, and was up about 0.50% over the last 12 months (as of 07/13/2023). WDIV has traded between $51.92 and $63.06 in this past 52-week period.WDIV has a beta of 0.80 and standard deviation of 14.12% for the trailing three-year period, which makes the fund a low risk choice in the space. With about 122 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSPDR S&amp;P Global Dividend ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the World ETFs segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.IShares MSCI ACWI ETF (ACWI) tracks MSCI All Country World Index and the Vanguard Total World Stock ETF (VT) tracks FTSE Global All Cap Index. IShares MSCI ACWI ETF has $17.97 billion in assets, Vanguard Total World Stock ETF has $28.85 billion. ACWI has an expense ratio of 0.32% and VT charges 0.07%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the World ETFs.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of popular hedge funds and their performance, head directly to 5 Most Owned Stocks by Hedge Funds. In 2022, the hedge fund industry experienced a decline of 2.4%, showing some improvement from a challenging first half of the year when the industry was down 4.6%. The losses were primarily influenced by the difficult market circumstances for high-risk assets, particularly impacting hedge funds with a long-biased approach and/or higher volatility. This marked the weakest performance for the hedge fund industry since 2018 when it also posted a 2.4% loss. Looking at the five-year performance, hedge funds have achieved a compounded annual return of +4.2%, demonstrating a more favorable performance compared to bonds, which experienced a decline of 2.0%. Aurum, a hedge fund investment specialist, noted that there were clear winners and losers in the hedge fund industry in 2022. The best-performing strategies were multi-strategy (+9.5%), quant (+8.5%), and macro (+6.7%). Strategies that typically have a higher correlation to equities and fixed income, which experienced poor performance, struggled the most. Patrick Ghali, managing partner of hedge fund advisory firm Sussex Partners, told Reuters on January 10, 2023: ""Investors need to look under the surface to understand the industry performance last year. Long-short hedge funds are the biggest asset-weighted part of the industry. Overall, I believe it was a good year for hedge funds.""Don't Miss: 15 Most Profitable Hedge Funds in the WorldAccording to Hedge Fund Research (HFR), the total global capital invested in hedge funds reached $3.83 trillion by the end of 2022, reflecting a quarterly increase of $44 billion. Hedge funds managed by The Citco Group Limited experienced a weighted-average return of -7.02% for the entire year. Smaller funds generally outperformed larger ones, as indicated by the median return of -2.86%. HFR also highlighted that macro strategies, including fundamental commodity, discretionary, and quantitative trend-following CTA sub-strategies, were the leading hedge fund strategies globally. Story continuesDespite the dull performance of hedge funds, Citadel, led by Ken Griffin, achieved an exceptional feat by generating an unprecedented $16 billion in profits for its clients in 2022. This performance not only surpassed other players in the industry but also stands as one of the most prominent financial successes in history. Chairman Rick Sopher of LCH Investments commented: “The largest gains were once again made by the large multi-strategy hedge funds like Citadel, DE Shaw and Millennium. The strong gains they have generated in recent years reflect their increasing dominance in strategies which do not depend on rising asset prices, and their substantial size.”Individual investors often look up to elite hedge funds and try to imitate their performance.

(NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 91Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) operates supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs, cash and carry stores, and discount stores. On February 21, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) declared a $0.57 per share quarterly dividend, a 1.8% increase from its prior dividend of $0.56. The next dividend payment is to be made on September 5, to shareholders of record as of August 11. 2023 marks the 50th consecutive year of dividend increases for the retail giant. In the first quarter of 2023, D E Shaw held the largest stake in the company, comprising 4.8 million shares worth approximately $710 million. In addition to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is one of the most owned stocks by hedge funds. In its Q2 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“The pandemic has created challenges for businesses large and small; one major challenge for large essential retailers such as ClearBridge holdings Home Depot, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Costco have been ensuring adequate staffing to meet demand under trying conditions. All three instituted enhanced pay practices during the pandemic, with raises, unplanned bonuses and other benefits helping compensate employees for their efforts in a difficult environment. In September 2020 Walmart raised wages for 165,000 employees, including a number of entry positions to $15 an hour. It followed this in February with a raise for 425,000 workers that moved its average pay above $15 an hour.”24. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 91Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) provides banking and financial products and services. The company’s operations are divided into Consumer Banking, Global Wealth &amp; Investment Management, Global Banking, and Global Markets segments. It is one of the top most owned stocks by hedge funds. On July 5, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) announced that it will increase its quarterly dividend from $0.22 per share to $0.24 per share, beginning in the third quarter. This decision comes after successfully completing the Federal Reserve's annual stress test and is subject to approval from the board of directors. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 91 hedge funds were long Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), compared to 100 funds in the earlier quarter. ClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy made the following comment about Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“Our quality bias has always led us to gravitate toward banks with strong and diverse deposit bases; those we own tend to be the larger players, which we also expect to be the biggest beneficiaries from a flight to safety in terms of deposits. JPMorgan Chase comes to mind especially here, but so does Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) despite its weakness in March, as well as U.S. Bancorp, to which we added opportunistically in the quarter.”23. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 95On June 27, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) stock saw a slight increase in pre-market trading after Bank of America expressed confidence in the company's strategic direction.

It is the global leader in theme parks with hotels and cruise lines aimed at families. Key assets within Disney are the instantly recognisable entertainment franchises that have multiple avenues of monetisation such as Mickey Mouse, Star Wars, ABC and Marvel’s Avengers.Disney’s share price declined due to a number of factors in 2022, presenting us the chance to purchase a long-admired business and its unique collection of valuable intellectual property assets at what we consider to be a very attractive valuation. Summarily, the EPS of Disney has declined from US$7 in 2018 to ~US$2.60 in 2022 but we believe that the earnings power of the assets has not diminished to anywhere near this extent.Disney is currently undergoing a business transition within the Media and Entertainment Distribution division (DMED) from traditional media property distribution via third parties (i.e. cinemas and broadcast networks) to a Direct-To-Consumer (DTC) model via the Disney+ streaming service. A key element of our thesis is that the earnings power of the company is currently being masked by the marketing and content investments within Disney+ and that this will normalize over the next several years. To put this in perspective, Disney+ (DTC sub-segment) currently generates operating losses of over US$3.3bn (a negative 14% operating margin) compared to operating margins at its nearest streaming competitor, Netflix, of +15.5%…” (Click here to read the full text)22.

According to the Payments Journal, PayPal has been used (over the last 12 months) by 62% of American consumers, followed by Apple Pay at 41% and Google Pay at 32%.Over the last several years, P2P payments have made tremendous strides in adoption and usage. Whenever something becomes a verb, like just Venmo me $10, you know that it has been widely embraced by society. The concept of allowing individuals to pay each other, via our smartphones, has clearly taken off.However, the biggest flaw or issue (that we’ve identified) is interoperability. Digital wallets allow users to pick their favorite card to make payments with. P2P acts as a bit of a “walled garden” and its funding source is still siloed. This is a critical aspect for future P2P growth, as Venmo users can’t pay Cash App users who can’t pay Zelle users. Visa is launching Visa+ next year and it has already signed up PayPal and Venmo as its initial customers. The global card networks seem like the perfect piece to solve this interoperability puzzle. Of course, this will only work if banks allow an independent network to serve as the gateway between disparate user bases…” (Click here to read the full text)17. Netflix, Inc.

(NYSE:JPM) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“It will be interesting to see what kind of policy decisions are made around regulation for institutions that are between $100 billion of assets and $700 billion of assets. As JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM)’s purchase of First Republic shows, scale is a competitive advantage. It now has 13% of total US deposits and it manages 21% of America’s credit card spending. With additional regulatory burdens coming, banks are facing a profitability headwind and 100 to 300 basis points of possible ROE erosion.The banking sector is facing a slow-moving crisis, but we aren’t sure it is enough to sink the overall health of the US consumer or economy. Credit will contract and lending standards will continue to rise. However, we do not see this problem escalating to the size and scale of previous banking crises.Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JP Morgan Chase clearly sees the risks these FINTECH companies present. In his annual letter to shareholders, he stated that all incumbent banks should be “scared shitless” of these FINTECH rivals. Not only is his bank being attacked from multiple angles, but Apple just launched a cash management program with Goldman Sachs. On the first day of Apple’s savings program, it raised $400 million and eclipsed $1 billion in its first four days. Dimon specifically labeled Apple a bank the other day in an interview when he said, “It may not have insured deposits, but it’s a bank.

We did take advantage of improving sentiment to higher growth technology companies and the share price of more defensive companies drifting down to divest our investment in Adobe and increase the Fund’s investment in UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH). United Health’s share price was also under moderate pressure due to regulatory announcements being very slightly adverse.

We retain conviction that Alibaba is well positioned to benefit from China’s reopening and the ongoing growth in online commerce and cloud in China.”12. Activision Blizzard, Inc.

Technology rebounded from a challenging 2022 and many large tech companies are performing quite well this year. Through mid-May 2023, year-to-date performance of some of the most popular and largest tech names is impressive. For tech companies with market capitalizations over $1 trillion, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is up +35%, Microsoft +33%, Amazon +39%, and Google is +40%. In terms of contribution to the S&amp;P 500’s year-to-date return, Apple and Microsoft represent roughly half of its 2023 performance. Apple, and Microsoft now account for 13.9% of the entire S&amp;P 500 or 80% more concentrated than 2008. For additional perspective, Apple’s market cap is at $2.8 trillion and that is larger than the market cap of the entire Russell 2000. To conclude, it’s distinctly getting more concentrated at the top.For our purposes, we are just going to focus on software digital wallets, as they are much more common and accessible. If you own an iPhone, then you have an Apple Pay preloaded digital wallet. If you have a Samsung phone, you have Samsung Pay available for use.

According to the Payments Journal, PayPal has been used (over the last 12 months) by 62% of American consumers, followed by Apple Pay at 41% and Google Pay at 32%.Digital wallets have tons of advantages that we are embracing. When we attend Tampa Bay Lightning games, we love having our season tickets easily accessible on our phones (via the Apple Pay wallet), as well as our timed parking pass. When we travel, loading the airline ticket into our Apple Pay wallet is much more convenient than printing out a paper boarding pass. Others are using digital wallets to track their expenses, budget properly, and even help them easily pay their bills. Digital wallets are still in their infancy and have decades of future growth; we believe the smartphone is simply the best interface and platform for digital wallets…” (Click here to read the full text)10.

Nvidia is a good example of a select growth stock bought opportunistically where our long-term thesis has bloomed. We initiated the position in the fourth quarter of 2018 knowing that inference and training in the data center was an interesting although still early-stage growth driver. We knew that GPUs could be used to solve complex computing problems, but we didn’t know how quickly the training and learning efforts by Nvidia’s mega cap customers would hit an inflection point. Volatility in the gaming business created the entry point into the stock and we have built the position accordingly over time. Since the end of 2021, the stock’s portfolio weight grew from 4.5% to a high of 7.2% earlier in the second quarter before we trimmed it to manage our overall position sizing.We will continue to monitor and adjust Nvidia’s position sizing to manage risk. Despite the sharp run up, we believe the company’s long-term runway remains compelling due to its advantaged positioning in a very large addressable market for GPUs. The current valuation looks expensive, yet Nvidia has real earnings and cash flow and the longer-term multiple looks more reasonable because of GPU pricing power.”9. Salesforce, Inc.

(NYSE:CRM) is the largest pure-play cloud software company, holding a leading market share in customer relationship management applications and a top-five market share position in the company’s other clouds (Marketing, Service, Platform, Analytics, Integration, and Commerce). The company’s software subscription term-license model differs from the traditional perpetual-license software model in two respects: (1) the software is hosted on centralized servers and delivered over the internet, as opposed to traditional enterprise software that is loaded directly onto customers’ hard drives or servers; and (2) the revenue model is subscription-based, typically charging monthly fees per user as opposed to charging one-time licensing fees. The stock’s strong relative performance followed a strong F4Q23 earnings release that easily beat Street expectations on the top- and bottom-lines. In addition to the beat, management announced a number of initiatives that activist investors have been clamoring for, specifically a halt to large M&amp;A transactions and a focus on operating profitability.”8.

We are FINTECH investors, and we define Fintech as “anything utilizing technology to improve an established process.” We realize that half of Fintech is financial, but we don’t invest in traditional, credit sensitive banks. Having managed money during the Financial Crisis, we learned firsthand how certain opaque and balance sheet intensive financials could go bankrupt or insolvent.We prefer transaction-based businesses, generating recurring revenue, with sustainable margins, and significant cash flow. From our perspective, the perfect example of a FINTECH business is the secularly growing payments industry. Names like Visa or Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), that generate revenue and profit per swipe or transaction, without the underlying credit sensitivity or risk associated with that underlying line of credit.”7. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 144Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is an American mobility technology firm. On May 24, Uber Technologies, Inc.

Gross Bookings grew 19% year over year to $31 billion, driven by 31% Mobility Gross Bookings growth and 6% Delivery Growth Bookings growth. 4Q Adjusted EBITDA of $665 million, up $579 million year over year, significantly beating management’s $600-$630 million guidance. Management guided to continuing growth in 1Q for Gross Bookings (20%- 24% growth) and Adjusted EBITDA (of $660-$700 million).UBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing, with a greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates. The company is also a leader in food delivery, where it is number one or two in the more than 25 countries in which it operates. Moreover, after a history of losses, the company is now solidly profitable with the potential for substantial margin expansion and free cash flow generation to come. We view UBER as more than just ride sharing and food delivery, but also as a global mobility platform with the ability to sell to its 131 million users (by comparison, Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and penetrate new markets of on-demand services, such as package and grocery delivery, travel, truck brokerage (the company had $1.5 billion in Freight revenue for 4Q22), and worker staffing for shift work. Given its $4 billion of unrestricted cash and $5 billion of investments, the company today has an enterprise value of $70 billion, indicating that UBER trades at 1.6x next year’s estimated revenue.”6.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (U.S.) was the top contributor to the Fund’s performance for the quarter. Alphabet’s first-quarter search revenue growth accelerated slightly sequentially, which was notable given that advertising spending has decreased across the board. Management cited the company’s travel and retail segments for their strong performance in contrast to the declines experienced in the finance and in the media and entertainment businesses. Advertising spending has also stabilized at YouTube, and the focus on “shorts” has driven strong viewership growth. In the near term, YouTube’s investment in shorts may not generate significant revenue, but we believe its profitability will accelerate over time. Alphabet’s cloud business reached GAAP profitability this quarter, moving from a -12% margin this quarter last year to a 3% margin this quarter. On the AI front, Alphabet upgraded Bard to run on its more powerful PaLM language model, and Bard can now assist with coding and software development. CEO Sundar Pichai compared AI’s evolution to the transition from desktop to mobile computing a decade ago and said there is “a lot more to come” in terms of its consumer AI applications. CFO Ruth Porat revised 2023 capital expenditures guidance due to higher spending on data center construction and servers that will support AI developments in consumer products, advertiser tools and the cloud business. Porat reiterated that the company plans to continue to hold expense growth below revenue growth and that Alphabet’s cost-reduction initiatives should bear fruit later this year and into 2024. At Alphabet’s annual developer conference in May, the company showcased an impressive array of new AI-powered consumer tools, which will be rolled out over the course of the year. Investors reacted positively to these presentations, which highlighted the extent of AI innovation occurring at Alphabet.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Most Owned Stocks by Hedge Funds. Suggested articles:10 Best Economic Recovery Stocks to Buy11 Best Breakout Stocks to Buy Now12 Best Mining Stocks Hedge Funds Are Buying Disclosure: None. 25 Most Owned Stocks by Hedge Funds is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

If you want to see the top 10 nations in terms of highest quality of life, check out 10 Countries with the Best Quality of Life.According to an article for Europe's Journal of Psychology, quality of life encompasses life satisfaction, which is subjective and may vary. However, health, independence, family, wealth, education, a sense of optimism, religious beliefs, local transportation and services, job satisfaction, social connections, housing, and the environment are common measures of the quality of life.Some nations are recognized for the high quality of life they provide. In addition to enhancing the lives of their residents, this serves as an example to other nations on what they must offer their citizens in order to rank among the top nations in the world.Quality of Life in the USThe third-most populous country in the world, the United States, is known for its exceptional way of life, modern culture, and many opportunities for both individuals and businesses. The nation is among the most desired locations to relocate, with a GDP per capita of $78,420 in 2023. In comparison to other nations, the US performs very well in terms of quality of life. Consequently, it draws a lot of people.According to the annual “Mood of the Nation” survey by Gallup, nearly 65% of Americans reported being satisfied with overall quality of life in 2023. This number, though, is a significant drop from the 84% in 2020, demonstrating that the pandemic has likely played a role in Americans’ feelings.Moreover, the country beats the average in terms of income, jobs, education, environmental quality, social ties, and life happiness, according to the OECD's Better Life Index, which measures quality of life according to 11 factors.The average household net-adjusted disposable income per capita in the United States is $51,147 per year, significantly higher than the OECD average of $30,490 per year. Approximately 67% of people aged 15 to 64 in the country are employed. Moreover, compared to the OECD average of 79%, 92% of adults aged 25-64 have completed upper secondary education. In general, compared to the rest of the world, Americans are more satisfied with their quality of life.Story continuesCommon Traits of Countries with the Best Quality of LifeA high quality of life is fundamentally dependent on health. Consequently, a key characteristic of most nations with excellent quality of life is that they offer their citizens world-class healthcare systems.For instance, Sweden’s decentralized universal health care system, which is managed by the central government, county councils and municipalities, provides accessible and quality care.  With an average life expectancy of 82.4 years and 5.4 physicians per 1,000 people, the country spent 11% of its GDP on healthcare in 2020. Additionally, eHealth is a crucial component of Sweden’s healthcare system, with county councils investing around $1.22 billion annually in healthcare IT. All of these figures demonstrate how well its healthcare system works. Don’t Miss: 15 Countries with the Best Healthcare in the World.Another trait shared by some countries with the best quality of life is that their overall environmental quality is good. As you'll see, several of such countries are from Europe and are featured in the article below.For example, the 2022 Environmental Performance Index (EPI) lists Denmark as one of the most sustainable countries. The Scandinavian country passed a legally binding Climate Act in 2020 with the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 70% in 2030 compared to 1990 levels and achieving net zero emissions by 2050. Moreover, the city of Copenhagen has major climate ambitions. It aims to become the first carbon-neutral capital in the world by 2025.Technology has Improved Our Quality of Life Every element of our daily lives has been significantly impacted by developments in technology and software infrastructure. There is no denying that technology has improved everyone's quality of life in general, from communication and transport to healthcare and connectivity.Technology has had numerous positive effects on the healthcare industry. The Internet of medical things, virtual care, machine learning, and artificial intelligence (AI) are just a few examples of technologies enhancing medical facilities.For instance, with quick, remotely accessible, and real-time solutions for illness diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, AI is replacing conventional, labor-intensive, and time-consuming healthcare operations. In the recent past, DeepMind, a division of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) responsible for developing general-purpose artificial intelligence (AGI) technology, collaborated with Moorfields Eye Hospital to treat patients with diabetic retinopathy, an eye condition that can result in vision loss. It was found that DeepMind's AI system could make patient referral recommendations for more than 50 different types of eye problems just as accurately as doctors.Much like the healthcare industry, the travel and tourism industry has reaped tremendous benefits from technology and raised our quality of life. Today, high-speed internet and technological advancements have made it simpler for people to organize their trip because they save time.In addition, online travel technology companies like Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) assist travelers in conveniently planning and booking trips from the largest selection of holiday packages, flights, hotels, rental cars, rail, cruises, activities, attractions, and services  through its travel suppliers in a more affordable manner.With operations in more than 70 countries and across more than 200 travel websites, Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) is able to serve a range of travelers under various brands including Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Vrbo, Orbitz, Travelocity, Trivago, ebookers, CheapTickets, Hotwire, CarRentals .com, Traveldoo, Expedia Partner Solutions, and Wotif Group. Moreover, bookings for more than 3 million lodging properties and more than 500 airlines are available on the company's websites.With that said, let's take a closer look at the countries with the best quality of life.25 Countries with the Best Quality of LifeCopyright: scanrail / 123RF Stock PhotoOur MethodologyFor the purpose of this article, we used three reliable sources. These included Numbeo’s Quality of Life Index by Country, Best Countries' Quality of Life subranking from U.S. News, and CEOWORLD magazine 2021 report for The World’s Best Countries For Quality of Life. These sources are all imperfect, but that's to be expected when trying to rank countries on such a subjective measure as quality of life. By combining the opinions of these independently generated rankings, we aim to create a more robust list of the countries with the best quality of life.We assigned a score to each country based on its rankings in each report. For instance, there are a total of 165 countries in CEOWORLD magazine's 2021 report. The #1 city in that list will get a score of 165/165=1, #2 city will get a score of 164/165=0.9939 and so on. We repeated the same scoring methodology for the other two reports.The overall score for each country was calculated by adding up their individual scores across the three reports. Finally, we sorted the countries by their total scores and identified the countries with the best quality of life. We have to note that our previously published list of the 30 Best Countries in the World According to Immigrants has completely different rankings than this list and the United States ranks higher in the former.25 Countries with the Best Quality of Life25.

Pictured is Hopper CEO and co-founder Frederic Lalonde (left) at Skift Global Forum in New York City in September 2022. Source: Skift SkiftExpedia Group, which has supplied rival Hopper with hotel and vacation rental inventory for several years, terminated the relationship Wednesday over a variety of practices that Expedia believes are anti-consumer, Skift learned exclusively.“Expedia Group terminated its supply relationship with Hopper today,” an Expedia Group spokesperson told Skift. “The reasons for termination are simple: As Hopper’s product has evolved, we have determined that its features exploit consumer anxiety and confuse customers, leading them to purchase services they neither need nor fully understand. As leaders in powering the B2B travel market, we have a commitment to travelers and to our supply partners that we take very seriously and, as such, we are ceasing placing our trusted supplier content on the Hopper platform.”A Hopper spokesperson said Wednesday that “although it seems that Expedia planned and delivered its notice in an anti-competitive attempt to cause disruption to Hopper’s business, there will be no impact at all. Hopper has always had a multi-sourced strategy when it comes to our inventory. Expedia was one participant among many within Hopper’s marketplace.“As Hopper has grown its market share, we’ve moved substantially to direct inventory to ensure we always offer the best price and selection for our customers. Expedia’s decision to withdraw from Hopper channels will not affect the selection or prices available to Hopper consumers. Hopper will continue to be the best place to book travel.” (See Hopper’s full statement below.)   Expedia Group has supplied hotels to Hopper for around five years, and more recently provided Hopper with vacation rentals, as well, although Hopper has other suppliers, too.“Lodging supply that we provide via our Rapid API will no longer be available on the Hopper platform today,” the Expedia Group spokesperson said. “We will, of course, continue to support travelers with current bookings after the termination date.”Story continuesSources familiar with the partnership termed Hopper a “significant partner” for Expedia Group — and that characterization would seemingly hold true for Hopper, as well.It’s unclear what the impact on Hopper — and its distribution partners such as Capital One — might be. Hopper certainly has other hotel suppliers — although Expedia is likely a major one — and vacation rental partners. Hopper offers some 2 million hotels, and around 4 million private rental properties. At the end of 2022, Expedia reported having “3 million lodging properties available, including over 2 million online bookable alternative accommodations listings through Vrbo, approximately 900,000 hotels and alternative accommodations through our other brands.”So Expedia might be supplying close to half of Hopper’s hotels. However, Expedia would appear to be providing vacation rental inventory to Hopper in the low single digit percentage range.The sources also said that Expedia’s areas of concern about Hopper were focused on customer trust and the use of junk fees, allegedly misleading marketing claims, high-pressure sales tactics and anxiety, and questionable insurance practices where some guarantees aren’t backed by licensed insurance companies.When asked by this reporter at Skift Global Forum last September whether he is a fan of airline cancellations as a way to boost Hopper’s assortment of so-called fintech products, CEO Fred LaLonde said: “I love anxiety.  I want people to be worried that the logistics around the trip might not be great. And I want to provide a complete, delightful antidote to anything going wrong …” (See the video embedded below.)“Much of Hopper’s growth can be attributed to its expansion of fintech products (rolled out early 2019), as well as the launch of its B2B business Hopper Cloud (launched in 2021) — each making up close to 40% of Hopper’s total revenue today,” according to a Skift Research report, Hopper’s Rise in Travel (subscription), published  in May.Pranavi Agarwal, who wrote the Skift Research report on Hopper, said Wednesday that “Expedia’s termination of its relationship with Hopper clearly suggests some bad blood but it also goes to show how competitive online travel is becoming with new entrants proving to be very much capable of disrupting a market that for so long has been dominated by the duopoly [Expedia and Booking] of the legacy players.”In its U.S. home base of Massachusetts — Hopper is headquartered in Canada — Hopper has an “F” rating and accreditation from the Better Business Bureau.Hopper said Wednesday that it has focused on resolving customer issues directly rather than on the Better Business Bureau platform.Hopper’s Alleged Junk Fees for Flights and HotelsHopper is constantly testing and changing its products, but we’ve seen examples of where after showing an airfare in the booking path, Hopper then presents a flight with no price above the fold. But then when the app prompts users to swipe to book the flight, they automatically get added to a bundle that includes a charge of $40 or so for a VIP Service. At times, a ticking clock pressured users to book before time ran out, presumably dissuading travelers from further checking the airfares.A similar scenario occurred for hotels with consumers being automatically added to a VIP Service for $25 or so.Hopper Touted Airfares as Refundable When That Wasn’t Always the CaseWe’ve seen Hopper market an airfare as a Best Refundable fare but in reality the customer gets a travel credit instead. At times the price for a “refundable by Hopper” fare can be hundreds of dollars higher than the initial airfare that Hopper quoted. The customer loses the credit if he or she cancels the flight.Some of Hopper’s Price Freeze Products Are MisleadingHopper sometimes promotes its price freeze product, where you can freeze an airfare for a certain time period for a fee, as the default or recommended choice. It pushes a 24-hour price freeze on airfares for a fee when the U.S. the Department of Transportation allows airline bookings to be voided without penalty within the first 24 hours.Hopper also markets its price freeze product on flights that are already fully refundable.With its hotel rate price freeze product on fully refundable hotel bookings, guests wouldn’t save anything. If the customers paid a $45 fee to Hopper to freeze their refundable hotel bookings, then they wouldn’t recoup the fee if they cancel the bookings.Some of Hopper’s ‘Guarantees’ Aren’t Backed by Insurance CompaniesHopper offers a variety of legitimate travel insurance products backed by Cover Genius, but critics have long charged that some of its “guarantees,” such as for flight disruptions, missed connections, and overbooking seem to be insurance-like products, although they aren’t backed by licensed insurance companies.In an interview with this reporter in May, Expedia Group CEO Peter Kern talked about some of the problems he has with Hopper’s so-called “insure-tech” products.“I think they [Hopper] have a lot of products around insuring against every little thing. It’s going to rain, it’s going to this, it’s going to that. The customer’s not winning in that trade. It doesn’t mean customers won’t pay for it. It doesn’t mean some won’t be happy with it, but there’s just a lot of stuff in there that reminds me of the days when there was the box you put the envelope in for air insurance. So just when you’re afraid to get on the plane, you put a $20 in the box, and just in case the plane goes down, your family gets a million dollars.“They have some good product, don’t get me wrong. I’m just saying there are a lot of things they do that we elect, we choose not to do. We don’t think it’s a good consumer experience.”Hopper has been a disruptive online travel agency. It was the most downloaded app in the U.S. in 2021, and is considered the third largest online travel agency in North America behind Expedia and Booking. So it’s easy to believe that beyond looking out for consumer benefit that Expedia has at least some competition motive in its decision to terminate its relationship with Hopper.Still, Expedia has gone after Booking’s Agoda in recent months for allegedly offering unsanctioned wholesale hotel rates, and had discussions with Google over bait and switch tactics by some of the online travel companies that Google features in Google Hotels.Portions of a Hopper spokesperson’s statement not cited above: “Expedia notified us today that they will no longer distribute their inventory via Hopper channels. Given Hopper’s rapid growth in direct-to-consumer market share, the success of Hopper’s fintech products, and Hopper’s growing B2B business, Expedia clearly views Hopper as a significant competitive threat.“Hopper has over 100 million app downloads and is the #3 largest online travel agency in North America. The company’s market share of third-party air travel increased to 13.3% (source: MIDT). Hopper sells $6 billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year; 2022 sales were up 3X over 2021.“With Hopper’s growing B2B business, the company is currently powering some of the world’s largest brands. Hopper Cloud currently reaches over 150M consumers via our white-label solutions and distributed fintech ancillaries for banks, airlines, hotels, and OTAS. Similar to the Hopper app, there will be no impact on inventory for our Hopper Cloud partners. “Per Skift’s own research, “Hopper with its data driven strategy and technology capability also allows it to be differentiated from the older, more traditional OTAs. This coupled with Hopper’s fintech offering layered across all of its products provides partners and suppliers an alternate avenue to diversify their source traffic and revenue streams, allowing Hopper to be a very real competitor to the giants of Booking and Expedia.”Hopper CEO Fred LaLonde at Skift Global Forum in New York City in September 2022Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

However, a strengthening dollar amid rising jet fuel price remains a threat to the industry players. Nevertheless, the outlook remains bright for the defense side of the aerospace-defense industry, buoyed by a solid budget proposal. This should keep investors interested in the industry. The frontrunners in the aerospace-defense industry are Lockheed Martin LMT, Northrop Grumman NOC and Leidos Holdings LDOS.About the IndustryThe Zacks Aerospace-Defense industry comprises companies that primarily design and manufacture heavy-built products like commercial as well as military jets and helicopters, tankers and other combat vehicles, missiles, combatant ships as well as auxiliary ships, submarines, bombs, guns, space transportation vehicles, military satellites and a few more. The industry also includes cyber security players who offer information technology services and C4ISR (command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) solutions. A portion of its revenues comes from defense contractors offering spare parts, aircraft modification, ship repair and overhaul services and supply chain management services.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Aerospace-Defense IndustryImproved Air Traffic Outlook Boosts Prospects: Recovering global air traffic data in recent times has boosted the near-term growth prospects of the industry. As stated in the latest report published by the IATA, industry-wide global RPK increased 39.1% year over year in May 2023. IATA projects industry-wide RPKs to reach 87.8% of the 2019 level in 2023, with air traffic rising as the year progresses. Such impressive projections bode well for commercial aerospace manufacturers that have long borne the brunt of poor air travel in the form of delayed jet deliveries and, in some cases, cancellation of their orders by airlines.Expanding Defense Budget Remains a Growth Catalyst: While the commercial aerospace market has been recovering steadily over the past couple of quarters, the defense side of the industry stood its ground amid the COVID-19 crisis, cushioned by steady government support. To this end, it is imperative to mention that the U.S. fiscal 2024 defense budget request of $842 billion for the Pentagon indicates a 3.2% improvement from the previous year’s enacted amount. Such improved budgetary provisions set the stage for industry players focused on the defense business to win more contracts, which is likely to boost their top line.Supply-Chain Issues May Hurt: Significant supply-chain disruption impacted the Aerospace and Defense industry, thanks to pandemic-induced lower aircraft demand and restrictions on the movement of people and goods. This primarily affected small suppliers like aircraft part manufacturers, especially those with heavy exposure to commercial aerospace and the aftermarket business. Although the global economy has started to improve, lingering market disequilibria will likely continue to keep prices high, including that of labor, as estimated by IATA. This, in turn, might constrict the growth trajectory of the U.S. Aerospace and Defense industry, to some extent, in the near term.Strengthening Dollar Adds to Industry Woes: The recently appreciating U.S. dollar is adding another layer of cost to airlines, which are already burdened with high inflation and rising jet fuel prices. The Federal Reserve’s policy rate now stands at 5.25% as of May 2023, having started 2022 at 0.25%. All U.S. dollar-denominated costs are rising for airlines, which earn revenues in non-U.S. currency. Similarly, the debt burden has increased for all non-dollar-based entities that have borrowed in dollars. Such a burden on airlines might lead to lower aircraft delivery, thereby hurting aerospace-defense industry players that particularly operate in the commercial aerospace.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks Aerospace-Defense industry is housed within the broader Zacks Aerospace sector. It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #182, which places it in the bottom 27% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates weak near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is due to a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts have lost confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential over the past few months. The industry’s earnings estimate for the current fiscal year has gone down 6.3% to $3.70 per share since Mar 31.Before we present a few aerospace-defense stocks that you may want to add to your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.Industry Lags S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Aerospace-Defense industry has underperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite as well as its own sector over the past year. The stocks in this industry have collectively lost 0.4% against the Aerospace sector’s growth of 3.8%. The Zacks S&amp;P 500 Composite has gone up 15.1% in the said time frame.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the trailing 12-month EV/Sales ratio, which is used for evaluating capital-intensive stocks like aerospace-defense, the industry is currently trading at 1.78 compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 3.56 and the sector’s 2.17.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 1.99X, as low as 1.64X, and at the median of 1.88X, as the charts show below.EV-Sales Ratio TTM3 Aerospace-Defense Stocks to Keep in Your WatchlistLockheed Martin: Based in Bethesda, MD, Lockheed Martin is the largest defense contractor in the world, with its main areas of focus being defense, space, intelligence, homeland security and information technology, including cyber security. On Jul 10, 2023, the company revealed that its Patriot Advanced Capability – 3 (PAC-3) Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) interceptor has successfully communicated with the AN/SPY-1 Radar, a key component in the Aegis Weapon System. This takes LMT closer to the integration of PAC-3 MSE with Aegis weapon system, thereby strengthening demand potential for its missile defense system.  Lockheed Martin currently boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.2%.

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Lockheed MartinOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Chief Operating Officer, Frank St. John, for US$3.2m worth of shares, at about US$474 per share. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$466. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.All up, insiders sold more shares in Lockheed Martin than they bought, over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Lockheed Martin Insiders Are Selling The StockOver the last three months, we've seen notably more insider selling, than insider buying, at Lockheed Martin. In that time, insider Stephanie Hill dumped US$1.2m worth of shares. On the other hand we note insider John Donovan bought US$251k worth of shares. Since the selling really does outweigh the buying, we'd say that these transactions may suggest that some insiders feel the shares are not cheap.Story continuesInsider OwnershipLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Lockheed Martin insiders own about US$97m worth of shares. That equates to 0.08% of the company. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.So What Do The Lockheed Martin Insider Transactions Indicate?Unfortunately, there has been more insider selling of Lockheed Martin stock, than buying, in the last three months. Despite some insider buying, the longer term picture doesn't make us feel much more positive. While insiders do own shares, they don't own a heap, and they have been selling. We're in no rush to buy! While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. To assist with this, we've discovered 2 warning signs that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of Lockheed Martin.But note: Lockheed Martin may not be the best stock to buy.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on new aging and best places to retire, you may go to 10 Best Places to Retire for Active Adults. New AgingThe baby boomer population, characterized by its significant size and influence, has faced numerous challenges over the years. Rising inflation levels, the aftermath of the 2008 recession, and the devastating impacts of the pandemic have created a daunting landscape for them, eroding their savings and profoundly altering their retirement plans. The University of Chicago estimates that the United States will have 16 million middle-income seniors by 2033. Jennifer Molinsky of Harvard’s Joint Center on Housing Studies states that the number of affordable units needed for future seniors is quite ""daunting.""Even though the need for housing is a significant challenge, the U.S. Census Bureau is convinced that this population will also bring significant opportunities in terms of infrastructure, institutions, and the economy. With a booming baby boomer population and U.S active adult (55+) community market size estimated to reach $805 billion by 2030, there is a promising opportunity for real estate developers and senior living community operators such as Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN), Del Webb Corporation by PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE:PHM), and Brookdale Senior Living Inc. (NYSE:BKD).As such, a shortage of senior housing options, an overwhelming aging population, and a new vision for retirement is driving many real-estate developers to shift their focus from isolated urban retirement communities to an urban village model of housing. Also called ""New Aging,"" such a model allows the recruitment of an age-diverse community, serving both younger and older renters in the process. Instead of providing the many services communities do in-house, this housing model tends to focus on local resources that nearby public programs offer, such as parks, malls, and hospitals. Not only will this give seniors a chance to ""age in place,"" but it will also significantly drive down rent in the process.Story continuesBest Places to RetireProspective retirees are always searching for the best places to spend retirement years. As such, some of the best places for seniors to live in the United States include cities in Florida, Texas, South Carolina, and also the East Coast. Retirees love these places because of the ideal weather most of them boast, along with an affordable cost of living. Add in a tax-friendly environment; these places are clear winners in all aspects.

(NYSE:PHM), and Brookdale Senior Living Inc. (NYSE:BKD) offer some of the best retirement communities in these places, along with others throughout the United States.

It may not have been easy to hold on to PHM for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?PulteGroup's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at PulteGroup's main business drivers.Based in Atlanta, GA, PulteGroup Inc. engages in homebuilding and financial services businesses, primarily in the United States. The company conducts operations through two primary business segments – Homebuilding (which accounted for 98.1% as of 2022 total revenues) and Financial Services (1.9%).The Homebuilding segment offers a wide variety of home designs including single family detached, townhouses, condominiums and duplexes at different prices, with a variety of options and amenities to all major customer segments: first-time, move-up and active adult. Pulte’s brand portfolio includes Centex, Pulte Homes,Del Webb, DiVosta Homes, John Wieland Homes and Neighborhoods, and American West.The company operates in 810 active communities in 42 markets in 24 states across the United States in 2022. The homebuilding division is broken down into six reportable segments; Northeast, Southeast, Florida, Texas, Midwest and West.Pulte’s direct subsidiaries under the homebuilding segment include Pulte Diversified Companies Inc., Del Webb Corporation and Centex Corporation.Pulte’s Financial Services business includes mortgage banking and title operations through Pulte Mortgage and other subsidiaries. Pulte Mortgage arranges financing by originating mortgage loans for homebuyers.In first-quarter 2023, the company’s orders were 8,898 units, up from 8,767 homes in the prior- year quarter. Quarter-end backlog totaled 13,129 homes versus 19,935 units in the year ago quarter. Potential housing revenues from quarter-end backlog decreased 30.8% from the prior-year to $8 billion.Story continuesBottom LinePutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For PulteGroup, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in July 2013 would be worth $3,835.21, or a 283.52% gain, as of July 12, 2023. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 gained 165.03% and the price of gold went up 44.57% over the same time frame.Analysts are forecasting more upside for PHM too.Shares of PulteGroup have outperformed its industry in the year-to-date period. The company has been benefiting from robust land acquisition and operational strategic initiatives. PHM expects the land acquisition and development investment in 2023 to range within $3.5-$4 billion, up from the previously considered value of $3.3 billion. This is attributed to strong buyer demand and increase in its construction activities. Earnings estimates for 2023 have increased to $2.43 per share from $2.41 in the past 30 days, reflecting analysts optimism over the company's prospect. Although a challenging sales environment, higher cancellation rates, supply-chain issues, and significant inflation are dampening the performance, the improving interest rate environment is raising hope.Over the past four weeks, shares have rallied 5.83%, and there have been 1 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2023 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

If you are not interested in reading the details, head straight to the 5 Most Hated Brands in the World.Starting a business in the US is the first step in building a global brand since it is a land of opportunities, where anyone with a great idea, the drive to succeed, and a willingness to work hard can prosper. Some well-known brands that originated in the United States and have now gone global include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), The Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT). Brands offer the innovations, concepts, and solutions that customers demand. In addition, they also contribute to the economy by generating wealth and income, paying taxes, supporting services, and making jobs available to the active population of a country.Although businesses and brands make our lives easier, there are a number of negative aspects to them, which is why some people have such a strong disdain or even hatred for them. Don’t Miss: 15 Most Hated Companies in America last year.Americans believe businesses are performing below expectations in various areas, according to a Bentley-Gallup Force for Good survey. 53% of Americans, who participated in the study, said that businesses generally have a negative impact on the environment. For large businesses, this number increased to 65%. Americans also believe that businesses are failing in the area of pay disparity. 82% of respondents said that it is crucial to treat all workers fairly and 72% agreed that they would be ready to pay more for a product from a company that treats its employees well. Moreover, the study also found that 55% of American workers, including 71% of those aged 18 to 29, would switch jobs to work for a company that had a greater beneficial impact on the globe.In a similar vein, Millennials' tolerance for large companies declined in 2019. According to a Deloitte Millennial Survey, fewer Millennials (from 76% in 2017 to 55% in 2019) agreed that business had a beneficial impact on society. Additionally, 26% of Millennials expressed no faith in corporate executives.Story continuesMost Loved and Successful Brands Have the Most HatersMany experts believe that if you want to be great, you must be prepared to face hatred. So, it should come as no surprise that some of the most admired brands in the world are also some of the most despised. Moreover, this hatred toward a brand isn't always detrimental to its financial standing. For instance, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has faced significant backlash following the announcement of 27,000 layoffs since November 2022. Nevertheless, the e-commerce behemoth, which has a large product range, a user-friendly website, is simple to use, and offers quick and dependable shipping, is still one of the most loved and trusted brands by customers. 89% of consumers think that they are more inclined to purchase things from Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) than from any other e-commerce websites.Similarly, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) appears to be loved and despised by people everywhere. Many hate it due to privacy concerns, but more than 77% of Internet users are active on at least one of its platforms. This clearly shows how successful the brand is.Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), one of the largest retailers in the world, is yet another example of a brand that people claim to dislike, but it continues to be profitable every year. It is accused of treating its employees unfairly. Furthermore, critics argue that the big-box giant has swooped in many places and destroyed local small businesses, leaving customers no other options. We believe that success of its business model is much to blame for that.It's easy to understand why brands people dislike persist. If there are significant benefits, customers will stick with a brand they don't like. Many customer decisions are heavily influenced by elements like price, convenience, and easy availability. For example, if a better airline cannot provide equal availability and affordability, consumers will continue to fly with the airline they dislike.Therefore, it is crucial to keep in mind that just because a brand is listed in this article as one of the most despised brands in the world, it doesn't automatically mean that it is no longer significant. This brand had to be on the list even though more people love it than hate it because we were focusing on the latter criteria.With these considerations in mind, let's look at the most hated brands in the world.20 Most Hated Brands in the WorldMilles Studio/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyWe used reputable sources for our rankings of the most hated brands in the world, including the 2023 Axios Harris Poll, 24/7 Wall Street, Business Insider, and USA Today. In addition, we took into account a number of online reviews and customer survey platforms. We assigned scores to each brand based on the number of mentions, so each time a brand was mentioned, it received a score of 1. Consequently, the more mentions and references, the higher the score and rank in our article. Basically, this list of the most hated brands in the world doesn't reflect our opinion but the consensus opinion of various sources.So, without further ado, let's examine the most hated brands in the world that must work very hard to regain the faith of their customers.Most Hated Brands in the World20. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), as reported in one of articles earlier, is one of the top drug companies in the world by revenue. It headquartered in New Brunswick, New Jersey.The company came under intense criticism following many lawsuits that claim its baby powder causes ovarian cancer. However, the pharmaceutical giant agreed to pay $8.9 billion in April 2023 to settle all cancer lawsuits related to its talc-based powders.19. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), with around 232.5 million subscribers, is a streaming service that offers a wide variety of award-winning TV shows, movies, anime, documentaries, and more on thousands of internet-connected devices.Although the streaming service continues to be a favorite among many, it recently attracted public criticism for only allowing members of the same household to share passwords, with outside users having to pay an extra $7.99 per month. However, we don't think that Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)’s inclusion on our list of the most hated brands in the world will have a negative impact on its reputation.18. Navient Corporation (NASDAQ:NAVI)Navient Corporation (NASDAQ:NAVI), one of the most hated brands in the world on our list, is an American student loan servicer based in Wilmington, Delaware.People despise the company because it takes advantage of borrowers by disregarding concerns, providing false information, processing payments improperly, and directing borrowers to more expensive repayment plans. Between November 2016 and January 2017, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau claims receiving over 1,500 consumer complaints about the company.A $1.85 billion settlement was reached between 39 states and Navient Corporation (NASDAQ:NAVI) last year on claims that the company used unfair and deceptive loan practices.17. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), with 32,800 employees as of 2022, primarily offers taxi services, allowing customers to hail a taxi through a mobile app.The company is disliked for its surge pricing as well as the negative effects of gig work replacing secure employment. Moreover, it is also disliked for causing disruption to the taxi industry and aggravating traffic congestion.However, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) offers several benefits, such as door-to-door convenience, safety, and dependable quality, thus we don't believe it deserves to be one of the most hated brands in the world.16. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), as reported in one our articles earlier, is one of the largest banks in the US by asset size.The bank earned the ire of general public when common people lost their homes, their jobs and their savings during the 2008 recession. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) agreed to pay $5.06 billion in 2016 to resolve charges that it mislead mortgage bond investors during the financial crisis.Furthermore, it has also received criticism from its employees. A 2021 poll of 13 first-year analysts at Goldman Sachs found that they were subjected to extremely long work hours, deadline pressure, and harsh behavior from superiors, which deteriorates their personal lives.15. The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI)The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI), with 71,300 employees as of 2022, engages in the provision of global health services. Forbes claims that state regulators get more consumer complaints about the company's health insurance than the national average. Based on ratings from the National Committee for Quality Assurance, it receives an average of 3.3 out of 5 stars.Moreover, the Guardian reported in 2021 that the company's call center employees complained about unfavorable working conditions. High demands for output, the risk of losing one's job, lack of training, and lengthy processing timeframes for consumers seeking reimbursement for Covid-19 testing expenses were the driving forces behind this.14. Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC)Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC), engaged in the provision of banking, insurance, investments, mortgage, and consumer and commercial finance, is headquartered in San Francisco, California. The bank received a lot of criticism in 2016 when it became known that its staff had been engaging in illicit practices for years. These included activities like overcharging clients, creating fake accounts, and unlawfully repossessing cars and homes.13. Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD)Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD), headquartered in Menlo Park, California, is an online discount brokerage that offers a commission-free investing and trading platform.The company was at the center of the short squeeze saga between retail investors and hedge funds in early 2021, resulting in losses worth billions to hedge funds. Despite the benefits enjoyed by retail traders on the platform, like no-fee trading, users on internet platform Reddit, many of whom are retail traders, accused the company of bias towards big finance. The platform halted trading in volatile stocks like GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AMC), favored by retail traders, at the height of the short squeeze drama. In July 2021, the firm was fined $70 million by authorities in the US for operational and regulatory lapses.12. United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL)United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL), founded in 1926, is an American international airline serving North America, Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean, and Europe.The airline, one of the most disliked brands on our list, has previously dealt with widely reported instances of poor customer service, including events in which staff members injured clients, threatened them, and mistreated their pets.United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL) faced a turbulent public reaction over its treatment of a passenger who was forcibly hauled out of his seat and off the plane, with blood streaming down his face, after the airline stated it needed ""volunteers"" to give up their seats for employees.11. Equifax Inc. (NYSE:EFX)Equifax Inc. (NYSE:EFX), headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, is a credit bureau that collects information about an individual's credit history to create a credit report.Given that it failed to secure the enormous amount of personal information stored on its network, which resulted in a data breach in 2017 that exposed millions of names and dates of birth, Social Security numbers, physical addresses, and other personal information that could result in identity theft and fraud, the general public is less forgiving of Equifax Inc. (NYSE:EFX).10. BitcoinBitcoin, introduced to the public in 2009, is a decentralized digital currency that you can buy, sell and exchange directly, without an intermediary like a bank.Bitcoin has drawn criticism for its high volatility and lack of regulation. In addition, it is also harmful to the environment. The University of Cambridge estimates that since its launch, Bitcoin has released 200 million tons of carbon dioxide.However, it is viewed by some, especially in the developing world, as a safe haven amid economic storms, despite being disliked for its volatility. In September 2021, El Salvador became the first nation to recognize Bitcoin as a legal tender, followed by the Central African Republic last year.9. FTXFTX, formerly one of the leading crypto exchanges in the world, filed for bankruptcy on November 11, 2022. US crypto investors sued the company in November last year, alleging that its top executives stole their digital assets and purposely blocked them from making withdrawals.

168,b1fc2e16-bb19-3f4b-b02f-fc8b5eb5e42b,CCI,2023-07-13,Wall Street Analysts Predict a 27.29% Upside in Crown Castle (CCI): Here's  What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-analysts-predict-27-135509856.html,1689170109,STORY,"['CCI', 'TGT']","[Crown Castle (CCI) closed the last trading session at $115.94, gaining 0.3% over the past four weeks, but there could be plenty of upside left in the stock if short-term price targets set by Wall Street analysts are any guide. The mean price target of $147.58 indicates a 27.3% upside potential.The average comprises 12 short-term price targets ranging from a low of $130 to a high of $165, with a standard deviation of $10.33. While the lowest estimate indicates an increase of 12.1% from the current price level, the most optimistic estimate points to a 42.3% upside. More than the range, one should note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.While the consensus price target is highly sought after by investors, the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable. And investors making investment decisions solely based on this tool would arguably do themselves a disservice.However, an impressive consensus price target is not the only factor that indicates a potential upside in CCI. This view is strengthened by the agreement among analysts that the company will report better earnings than what they estimated earlier. Though a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't give any idea as to how much the stock could surge, it has proven effective in predicting an upside.Here's What You Should Know About Analysts' Price TargetsAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?Story continuesThey usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.Here's Why There Could be Plenty of Upside Left in CCIAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. That's because empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0% over the past month, as one estimate has gone higher compared to no negative revision.Moreover, CCI currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much CCI could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Some have been excluded from the rally and have retreated during the year, although that doesn’t mean they are headed for the permanent bargain bin.In fact, the analysts at banking giant Goldman Sachs have been performing one of their favorite pastimes – tagging the stocks that they see as primed for gains in the latter half of the year. Specifically, firm analyst Adam Samuelson has pinpointed an opportunity in two beaten-down names he sees pushing higher over the coming months – by the order of 40% or more.We ran these tickers through the TipRanks database to see what other Street experts make of their chances. Here are the details.The Mosaic Company (MOS)Let’s begin in the agricultural sector and zoom in on The Mosaic Company. This heavyweight in the crop nutrient industry has earned its reputation as a leading global producer and marketer of concentrated phosphate and potash fertilizers. The Tampa, Florida-based firm focuses on mining and processing phosphate rock, which is then used to produce agricultural fertilizers, and potash, a vital nutrient for crops. The company’s products are essential in promoting crop productivity and improving soil fertility, thereby supporting the global agricultural industry.Early last year, fertilizer prices increased dramatically in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and subsequent Western sanctions on Russia and Belarus led to supply issues. However, as supply from Belarus started again – it is the third biggest exporter of potash – fertilizer prices also came down and that affected Mosaic’s latest quarterly results.Story continuesIn Q1, adj. EPS fell from $2.41 in the same period a year ago to $1.14, while missing the Street’s call by $0.11. Revenue also dropped, by 8.2% year-over-year to $3.6 billion, although that figure actually beat Wall Street expectations, by $340 million. More recently, the company said it expects Q2 potash sales volumes will come in at the high end of the 2-2.2 million metric tons guide and phosphates at the low end of the 1.8-2 million tons guide.Year-to-date, MOS shares peaked back in March but have since retreated by 36%. While Goldman analyst Adam Samuelson is cognizant of the present issues, he highlights Mosaic’s appeal for investors.“While we recognize the current turbulent environment in the fertilizer market (and broader commodities) blurs the short-term outlook, management remains prudent on capital allocation and MOS’ portfolio of production assets appear sharply discounted relative to peers, let alone potential replacement cost,” the analyst noted.Accordingly, Samuelson rates MOS as a Buy along with a $62 price target, suggesting the stock will climb ~73% higher over the coming months. (To watch Samuelson’s track record, click here)That said, Samuelson’s take is the Street’s most exuberant one. Elsewhere, the stock garners an additional 3 Buys, 9 Holds and 1 Sell, for a Hold consensus rating. Nevertheless, most feel the shares are undervalued; going by the $45.61 average target, a year from now, they will be changing hands for a 27% premium. (See MOS stock forecast)Sealed Air Corporation (SEE)Let’s take a turn now from the fertilizer industry to packaging and the aptly named Sealed Air. Fun fact, the company is responsible for the invention of the iconic Bubble Wrap, the cushioning material widely used for protecting fragile items during shipping, and Sealed Air was founded based on that invention.Today, Sealed Air is a global packaging company that provides a range of innovative packaging solutions for various industries and is a leader in protective packaging and food safety solutions. Its offerings include protective packaging materials, such as foam and air cushions, as well as automated equipment and systems for packaging optimization.The global economic woes have not spared the packaging industry. Companies using such products have been impacted by the recessionary environment and that in turn has affected SEE’s business.In Q1, volumes dropped by 9.3% on the back of a 10.4% decline in Q4, both historically sharp drops not witnessed by the firm since 2008-09. As such, revenue came in at $1.3 billion, amounting to a 7.1% decline and falling short of the consensus estimate by $60 million. Adj. EPS of $0.74 also missed expectations, by $0.03. For the full year, SEE reiterated its outlook for adj. EPS in the range between $3.50 to $3.80, just shy of consensus at $3.66 at the mid-point.This is the kind of stuff that does not help a stock’s performance, and indeed, the shares are down by 23% since this year’s February peak. However, according to Goldman’s Adam Samuelson, this could be an opportunity for investors.“While we recognize near-term cyclical pressures and do see risk that the upper half of full-year guidance and implied Protective volume recovery appear ambitious, SEE’s underlying franchise strength and long-term growth from automation and digital solutions remain sharply discounted at 9.1x /8.3x 2023/24 EV/EBITDA. We see current weakness offering a compelling entry point for longer-term investors,” Samuelson opined.Samuelson, then, recommends that investors buy SEE shares, as his $64 price target indicates the potential for ~47% returns over the next 12 months.Elsewhere on the Street, 4 other analysts join Samuelson in the bull-camp and with an additional 7 Holds, the analyst consensus views this stock a Moderate Buy. The average target currently stands at $50.27, implying shares will deliver 15% gains in the months ahead.

To skip our analysis of the recent trends, and market activity, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Potash Stocks to Buy.Potash refers to a group of different minerals and chemical compositions that bear the potassium element in substantial quantities. The potassium chloride compound, known commonly as the muriate of potash accounts for the majority of the global potash market with other compounds such as sulphate of potash accounting for the rest.More than 95% of the global potash production is utilized for agricultural purposes with the remaining amount employed for manufacturing commercial and industrial products such as detergents. According to the US Geological Survey, Russia and Belarus combined have accounted for a third of the global potash supply over the years.The Russia-Ukraine conflict and resulting sanctions led to pressures on the global potash supply chain. The list of other leading potash producing countries includes Canada, China, and Germany, among others. You can read more about the leading potash producing countries in our article, 15 Largest Potash Producing Countries in the World.In addition to Phosphorus and Nitrogen, Potash is among the three most important nutrients for optimal crop health and production. These elements, together known as ‘NPK’, are the only macronutrients required by plants for healthy growth. Even though these resources are naturally available in soil, excessive and repetitive farming reduces their quantities in the soil at a pace much faster than the time required for their natural replenishment. This necessitates the need for synthetically produced fertilizers.In the aftermath of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the prices for potash increased manifold all across the world. Potassium Chloride prices hit their peak in April 2022 as they exceeded $1200 per metric ton. The prices have since dropped significantly and were recorded at $328 per metric ton which is still higher than the Covid-era prices, according to data from the World Bank.Story continuesSeveral countries including the United States have taken measures to reduce their reliance on Russia and Belarus for their fertilizer imports. For instance, Brazil chose Canada as an alternate source for its potash requirements while Morocco opted for Egypt and Saudi Arabia as alternatives for its ammonia requirements. United States announced grants focused on increasing local production of fertilizers.

ILMN recently announced the launch of the latest version of DRAGEN software, DRAGEN 4.2, for analysis of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. DRAGEN 4.2 is expected to expand accuracy combined with its flexibility and scalability to enable efficient workflows and extract meaningful insights from genomic data.The latest launch is expected to significantly solidify Illumina’s foothold in the global genomics analysis space and boost its sequencing business.Significance of the LaunchPer an expert familiar with the use of DRAGEN software, the latest offering of DRAGEN 4.2 is likely to be a significant step for genomics analysis as it combines the detection of multiple variant types in addition to a single nucleotide variant or SNV. This will likely foster a comprehensive analysis of genomic samples. The expert also feels that DRAGEN 4.2’s new features, which include new approaches for cardiovascular diseases such as callers for Lipoprotein(a) or LP(a), will likely provide a deeper insight into the gene.Per Illumina, LP(a) is currently emerging as a clinically significant potential risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Targeted calling of the genetic variant associated with high levels of LP(a) can further help clinical research and aid in the development of testing and therapies.Per Illumina’s management, DRAGEN’s ability to perform high-quality, fast, accurate and comprehensive NGS analysis workflows is expected to be ideally suited to support the healthcare and research industry in secondary analysis.Industry ProspectsPer a report by MarketsandMarkets, the global genomics market was estimated to be $46.2 billion in 2023 and is anticipated to reach $83.1 billion by 2028 at a CAGR of 12.4%.

If you are not interested in reading the details, head straight to the 5 Most Hated Brands in the World.Starting a business in the US is the first step in building a global brand since it is a land of opportunities, where anyone with a great idea, the drive to succeed, and a willingness to work hard can prosper. Some well-known brands that originated in the United States and have now gone global include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), The Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT). Brands offer the innovations, concepts, and solutions that customers demand. In addition, they also contribute to the economy by generating wealth and income, paying taxes, supporting services, and making jobs available to the active population of a country.Although businesses and brands make our lives easier, there are a number of negative aspects to them, which is why some people have such a strong disdain or even hatred for them. Don’t Miss: 15 Most Hated Companies in America last year.Americans believe businesses are performing below expectations in various areas, according to a Bentley-Gallup Force for Good survey. 53% of Americans, who participated in the study, said that businesses generally have a negative impact on the environment. For large businesses, this number increased to 65%. Americans also believe that businesses are failing in the area of pay disparity. 82% of respondents said that it is crucial to treat all workers fairly and 72% agreed that they would be ready to pay more for a product from a company that treats its employees well. Moreover, the study also found that 55% of American workers, including 71% of those aged 18 to 29, would switch jobs to work for a company that had a greater beneficial impact on the globe.In a similar vein, Millennials' tolerance for large companies declined in 2019. According to a Deloitte Millennial Survey, fewer Millennials (from 76% in 2017 to 55% in 2019) agreed that business had a beneficial impact on society. Additionally, 26% of Millennials expressed no faith in corporate executives.Story continuesMost Loved and Successful Brands Have the Most HatersMany experts believe that if you want to be great, you must be prepared to face hatred. So, it should come as no surprise that some of the most admired brands in the world are also some of the most despised. Moreover, this hatred toward a brand isn't always detrimental to its financial standing. For instance, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has faced significant backlash following the announcement of 27,000 layoffs since November 2022. Nevertheless, the e-commerce behemoth, which has a large product range, a user-friendly website, is simple to use, and offers quick and dependable shipping, is still one of the most loved and trusted brands by customers. 89% of consumers think that they are more inclined to purchase things from Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) than from any other e-commerce websites.Similarly, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) appears to be loved and despised by people everywhere. Many hate it due to privacy concerns, but more than 77% of Internet users are active on at least one of its platforms. This clearly shows how successful the brand is.Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), one of the largest retailers in the world, is yet another example of a brand that people claim to dislike, but it continues to be profitable every year. It is accused of treating its employees unfairly. Furthermore, critics argue that the big-box giant has swooped in many places and destroyed local small businesses, leaving customers no other options. We believe that success of its business model is much to blame for that.It's easy to understand why brands people dislike persist. If there are significant benefits, customers will stick with a brand they don't like. Many customer decisions are heavily influenced by elements like price, convenience, and easy availability. For example, if a better airline cannot provide equal availability and affordability, consumers will continue to fly with the airline they dislike.Therefore, it is crucial to keep in mind that just because a brand is listed in this article as one of the most despised brands in the world, it doesn't automatically mean that it is no longer significant. This brand had to be on the list even though more people love it than hate it because we were focusing on the latter criteria.With these considerations in mind, let's look at the most hated brands in the world.20 Most Hated Brands in the WorldMilles Studio/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyWe used reputable sources for our rankings of the most hated brands in the world, including the 2023 Axios Harris Poll, 24/7 Wall Street, Business Insider, and USA Today. In addition, we took into account a number of online reviews and customer survey platforms. We assigned scores to each brand based on the number of mentions, so each time a brand was mentioned, it received a score of 1. Consequently, the more mentions and references, the higher the score and rank in our article. Basically, this list of the most hated brands in the world doesn't reflect our opinion but the consensus opinion of various sources.So, without further ado, let's examine the most hated brands in the world that must work very hard to regain the faith of their customers.Most Hated Brands in the World20. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), as reported in one of articles earlier, is one of the top drug companies in the world by revenue. It headquartered in New Brunswick, New Jersey.The company came under intense criticism following many lawsuits that claim its baby powder causes ovarian cancer. However, the pharmaceutical giant agreed to pay $8.9 billion in April 2023 to settle all cancer lawsuits related to its talc-based powders.19. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), with around 232.5 million subscribers, is a streaming service that offers a wide variety of award-winning TV shows, movies, anime, documentaries, and more on thousands of internet-connected devices.Although the streaming service continues to be a favorite among many, it recently attracted public criticism for only allowing members of the same household to share passwords, with outside users having to pay an extra $7.99 per month. However, we don't think that Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)’s inclusion on our list of the most hated brands in the world will have a negative impact on its reputation.18. Navient Corporation (NASDAQ:NAVI)Navient Corporation (NASDAQ:NAVI), one of the most hated brands in the world on our list, is an American student loan servicer based in Wilmington, Delaware.People despise the company because it takes advantage of borrowers by disregarding concerns, providing false information, processing payments improperly, and directing borrowers to more expensive repayment plans. Between November 2016 and January 2017, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau claims receiving over 1,500 consumer complaints about the company.A $1.85 billion settlement was reached between 39 states and Navient Corporation (NASDAQ:NAVI) last year on claims that the company used unfair and deceptive loan practices.17. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), with 32,800 employees as of 2022, primarily offers taxi services, allowing customers to hail a taxi through a mobile app.The company is disliked for its surge pricing as well as the negative effects of gig work replacing secure employment. Moreover, it is also disliked for causing disruption to the taxi industry and aggravating traffic congestion.However, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) offers several benefits, such as door-to-door convenience, safety, and dependable quality, thus we don't believe it deserves to be one of the most hated brands in the world.16. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), as reported in one our articles earlier, is one of the largest banks in the US by asset size.The bank earned the ire of general public when common people lost their homes, their jobs and their savings during the 2008 recession. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) agreed to pay $5.06 billion in 2016 to resolve charges that it mislead mortgage bond investors during the financial crisis.Furthermore, it has also received criticism from its employees. A 2021 poll of 13 first-year analysts at Goldman Sachs found that they were subjected to extremely long work hours, deadline pressure, and harsh behavior from superiors, which deteriorates their personal lives.15. The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI)The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI), with 71,300 employees as of 2022, engages in the provision of global health services. Forbes claims that state regulators get more consumer complaints about the company's health insurance than the national average. Based on ratings from the National Committee for Quality Assurance, it receives an average of 3.3 out of 5 stars.Moreover, the Guardian reported in 2021 that the company's call center employees complained about unfavorable working conditions. High demands for output, the risk of losing one's job, lack of training, and lengthy processing timeframes for consumers seeking reimbursement for Covid-19 testing expenses were the driving forces behind this.14. Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC)Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC), engaged in the provision of banking, insurance, investments, mortgage, and consumer and commercial finance, is headquartered in San Francisco, California. The bank received a lot of criticism in 2016 when it became known that its staff had been engaging in illicit practices for years. These included activities like overcharging clients, creating fake accounts, and unlawfully repossessing cars and homes.13. Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD)Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD), headquartered in Menlo Park, California, is an online discount brokerage that offers a commission-free investing and trading platform.The company was at the center of the short squeeze saga between retail investors and hedge funds in early 2021, resulting in losses worth billions to hedge funds. Despite the benefits enjoyed by retail traders on the platform, like no-fee trading, users on internet platform Reddit, many of whom are retail traders, accused the company of bias towards big finance. The platform halted trading in volatile stocks like GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AMC), favored by retail traders, at the height of the short squeeze drama. In July 2021, the firm was fined $70 million by authorities in the US for operational and regulatory lapses.12. United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL)United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL), founded in 1926, is an American international airline serving North America, Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean, and Europe.The airline, one of the most disliked brands on our list, has previously dealt with widely reported instances of poor customer service, including events in which staff members injured clients, threatened them, and mistreated their pets.United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL) faced a turbulent public reaction over its treatment of a passenger who was forcibly hauled out of his seat and off the plane, with blood streaming down his face, after the airline stated it needed ""volunteers"" to give up their seats for employees.11. Equifax Inc. (NYSE:EFX)Equifax Inc. (NYSE:EFX), headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, is a credit bureau that collects information about an individual's credit history to create a credit report.Given that it failed to secure the enormous amount of personal information stored on its network, which resulted in a data breach in 2017 that exposed millions of names and dates of birth, Social Security numbers, physical addresses, and other personal information that could result in identity theft and fraud, the general public is less forgiving of Equifax Inc. (NYSE:EFX).10. BitcoinBitcoin, introduced to the public in 2009, is a decentralized digital currency that you can buy, sell and exchange directly, without an intermediary like a bank.Bitcoin has drawn criticism for its high volatility and lack of regulation. In addition, it is also harmful to the environment. The University of Cambridge estimates that since its launch, Bitcoin has released 200 million tons of carbon dioxide.However, it is viewed by some, especially in the developing world, as a safe haven amid economic storms, despite being disliked for its volatility. In September 2021, El Salvador became the first nation to recognize Bitcoin as a legal tender, followed by the Central African Republic last year.9. FTXFTX, formerly one of the leading crypto exchanges in the world, filed for bankruptcy on November 11, 2022. US crypto investors sued the company in November last year, alleging that its top executives stole their digital assets and purposely blocked them from making withdrawals. Users of the platform also claim they received scam messages asking for their account details on FTX. In some instances, the founder of the firm, Sam Bankman-Fried, was featured in a deep fake video claiming to double customer crypto compensation.8. BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP)BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP), headquartered in London, is a British multinational oil and gas company. The firm has faced criticism for lowering its climate targets and increasing its investments in oil and gas. The energy giant has lowered its initial objective of a 35%-40% reduction in carbon emissions to a target of 20%-30%.Furthermore, BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP) is also remembered for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill disaster.7. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA)Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is one of the largest telecommunications companies in the world, as we previously reported in an article. Federal officials fined the company $2.3 million in 2016 for billing customers with unnecessary services and hidden fees. According to the Consumer Reports National Research Center’s 2013 annual telecom survey, the company ranked 15th out of 17 television service providers. Consumers gave it extremely low ratings for customer service and value for the money.6. TikTokTikTok, owned by Chinese technology company ByteDance, is a video-sharing app that allows users to create and share short-form videos on any topic.As concerns over privacy and cybersecurity increase, an increasing number of governments have banned this app from devices provided to employees. Users of social media platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Reddit, and Instagram often complain about the popularity of the TikTok brand among young children. These users claim that TikTok management does not moderate content diligently to protect children from harmful material.Click to continue reading and see 5 Most Hated Brands in the World.Suggested Articles:20 Countries with the Highest Gold Consumption20 Biggest Franchises In The World20 Most Unfriendly Countries in the WorldDisclosure: None. 20 Most Hated Brands in the World is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

The new plan goes into effect in January 2024, giving ample time for plan sponsors and employers to opt in.CVS Caremark is a part of the CVS Health company but is separate from the retail pharmacy chain.GoodRx co-founder Doug Hirsch told Yahoo Finance the new relationship gives the company access to 70% of those commercially insured, adding to last year's similar partnership with Cigna's (CI) ExpressScripts.GoodRx currently receives about 200 billion price points per day with its wide variety of PBM and pharmacy relationships.""Everyone likes to think we're like [only serving] low-income people who are just cash pay.

189,9eec5c34-07e2-32b7-ad51-c60dd561c9a6,NOC,2023-07-13,3 Aerospace-Defense Stocks to Watch Amid Rising Fed Policy Rate,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-aerospace-defense-stocks-watch-133100463.html,1689168660,STORY,"['LMT', 'LDOS', '^GSPC', 'NOC']","[Solid industry-wide revenue per kilometer (RPK) projections for 2023, as stated by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), are expected to bode well for aerospace-defense stocks that are engaged in commercial aerospace-related operations. However, a strengthening dollar amid rising jet fuel price remains a threat to the industry players. Nevertheless, the outlook remains bright for the defense side of the aerospace-defense industry, buoyed by a solid budget proposal. This should keep investors interested in the industry. The frontrunners in the aerospace-defense industry are Lockheed Martin LMT, Northrop Grumman NOC and Leidos Holdings LDOS.About the IndustryThe Zacks Aerospace-Defense industry comprises companies that primarily design and manufacture heavy-built products like commercial as well as military jets and helicopters, tankers and other combat vehicles, missiles, combatant ships as well as auxiliary ships, submarines, bombs, guns, space transportation vehicles, military satellites and a few more. The industry also includes cyber security players who offer information technology services and C4ISR (command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) solutions. A portion of its revenues comes from defense contractors offering spare parts, aircraft modification, ship repair and overhaul services and supply chain management services.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Aerospace-Defense IndustryImproved Air Traffic Outlook Boosts Prospects: Recovering global air traffic data in recent times has boosted the near-term growth prospects of the industry. As stated in the latest report published by the IATA, industry-wide global RPK increased 39.1% year over year in May 2023. IATA projects industry-wide RPKs to reach 87.8% of the 2019 level in 2023, with air traffic rising as the year progresses. Such impressive projections bode well for commercial aerospace manufacturers that have long borne the brunt of poor air travel in the form of delayed jet deliveries and, in some cases, cancellation of their orders by airlines.Expanding Defense Budget Remains a Growth Catalyst: While the commercial aerospace market has been recovering steadily over the past couple of quarters, the defense side of the industry stood its ground amid the COVID-19 crisis, cushioned by steady government support. To this end, it is imperative to mention that the U.S. fiscal 2024 defense budget request of $842 billion for the Pentagon indicates a 3.2% improvement from the previous year’s enacted amount. Such improved budgetary provisions set the stage for industry players focused on the defense business to win more contracts, which is likely to boost their top line.Supply-Chain Issues May Hurt: Significant supply-chain disruption impacted the Aerospace and Defense industry, thanks to pandemic-induced lower aircraft demand and restrictions on the movement of people and goods. This primarily affected small suppliers like aircraft part manufacturers, especially those with heavy exposure to commercial aerospace and the aftermarket business. Although the global economy has started to improve, lingering market disequilibria will likely continue to keep prices high, including that of labor, as estimated by IATA. This, in turn, might constrict the growth trajectory of the U.S. Aerospace and Defense industry, to some extent, in the near term.Strengthening Dollar Adds to Industry Woes: The recently appreciating U.S. dollar is adding another layer of cost to airlines, which are already burdened with high inflation and rising jet fuel prices. The Federal Reserve’s policy rate now stands at 5.25% as of May 2023, having started 2022 at 0.25%. All U.S. dollar-denominated costs are rising for airlines, which earn revenues in non-U.S. currency. Similarly, the debt burden has increased for all non-dollar-based entities that have borrowed in dollars. Such a burden on airlines might lead to lower aircraft delivery, thereby hurting aerospace-defense industry players that particularly operate in the commercial aerospace.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks Aerospace-Defense industry is housed within the broader Zacks Aerospace sector. It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #182, which places it in the bottom 27% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates weak near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is due to a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts have lost confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential over the past few months. The industry’s earnings estimate for the current fiscal year has gone down 6.3% to $3.70 per share since Mar 31.Before we present a few aerospace-defense stocks that you may want to add to your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.Industry Lags S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Aerospace-Defense industry has underperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite as well as its own sector over the past year. The stocks in this industry have collectively lost 0.4% against the Aerospace sector’s growth of 3.8%.

That’s good news for savers, but bad news for lenders as they prepare to release their second-quarter results.US banks spent the last several months competing with each other to keep or bring back depositors following the turmoil that took down three sizable regional institutions and triggered outflows across the banking system.That scramble pushed rates on savings accounts to 5.05% at the end of the second quarter, according to Bankrate, their steepest level since February 2008.Read more: The best high-yield savings account rates for July 2023The challenge for banks across the US is that these higher funding costs are eating into a key measure of profitability known as net interest margin, which measures the difference between what lenders make from their loans and what they pay for their deposits.That will likely act as a drag on results for some banks in the quarter, especially the mid-sized regional institutions that ran into trouble last spring, while reducing estimates of what they can earn for the rest of the year.“The surprises this quarter will be for the banks that do not lower expectations,” Wells Fargo bank analyst Mike Mayo told Yahoo Finance.Banks, added Argus Research's Stephen Biggar, ""have a deposit conundrum.""'Green shoots'?These pressures will be at the front of mind for investors starting Friday as they digest the first set of second quarter earnings from JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), and State Street (STT).Bank of America (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS) report next Tuesday and Goldman Sachs (GS) next Wednesday. A slew of other regional banks will also report in the coming weeks.Some of the biggest US banks are expected to once again demonstrate their resilience and diversity, showing they can continue to charge more for their loans while leaning on their sprawling franchises to generate additional revenue.Story continuesJPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America are all expected to show jumps in net income when compared to the year-earlier period, according to analyst estimates, while Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley are expected to report profit declines.JPMorgan's headquarters in New York City. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Those that are more dependent on investment banking, such as Goldman, are expected to be particularly challenged by a recent drought in deal making.Global investment banking revenues for the second quarter fell by 8% from the first quarter and 52% from a year ago, according to Dealogic. However, the business improved through the second half of the quarter, prompting some observers to predict “green shoots” ahead.“I’m turning to believing investment banking will not have great earnings but they’re going to be surprising, and I think better than expected,” said Dick Bove, a bank analyst with Odeon Capital.Investors will also be watching to see whether many of these big banks increase the amounts they set aside for future loan losses, a sign that they expect the US economy and credit conditions to worsen.“We're starting to see some increased delinquencies, particularly in the credit card and auto lending market,” said Biggar, Argus Research's director of financial services.'A huge amount of problems'Smaller regional banks are clearly not under the same amount of pressure as they were in March, when the fall of Silicon Valley Bank triggered panic across the country.But they still “face a huge amount of problems,” Bove said.The core issue is an aggressive campaign by the Federal Reserve to bring down inflation with higher interest rates. That campaign is lowering the value of the assets banks hold, such as bonds, while deposit costs creep higher and loan demand slows.Read more: Why now is a good time to open a savings account“We view accelerating deposit costs, not accelerating deposit outflows, as the most significant headwind to earnings for the next several quarters,“ Manan Gosalia, a regional bank analyst for Morgan Stanley, said in a research note.Higher rates have traditionally worked to the advantage of banks since it allows them to charge more for their loans than their deposits.But the panic of the spring “has changed the calculus a bit” for some banks, the Fed’s vice chair of supervision Michael Barr said Monday. Some lenders “are now paying up more for deposits,” and the Fed is “paying careful attention to that.”Silicon Valley Bank was seized on March 10. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)The Fed has made it clear that more hikes are coming this year. Regulators are also preparing new capital requirements for banks with more than $100 billion in assets that will force some to hold greater buffers against losses. That will increase the stability of those lenders but will also make it even more difficult to earn robust profits in the near term.Many banks have already warned at a conference in June that their net interest margins are going to drop by more than they expected for the quarter or the year, including executives for US Bancorp (USB), Citizens Financial Group (CFG), Comerica (CMA), Huntington (HBAN), KeyCorp (KEY), and Zions (ZION).“I’ve only been a banker for 10 years, so I haven’t seen a time when we’ve needed deposits as an industry as much as we do now,” Darrin Williams, the CEO of the 58-branch Southern Bancorp, told Yahoo Finance.The amount Southern Bancorp is paying customers has risen 600% since the Fed’s interest rate hiking cycle began, Williams added.“Our cost of funds continues to rise just because our customers demand that.”The larger banks aren’t immune to some of these same challenges.“Deposits will continue the trend of being slightly down from here,” Jennifer Piepszak, co-CEO of JPMorgan Chase's massive consumer and community bank, said at a conference in June.The bank has predicted it will earn net interest income of $84 billion in 2023, but if the deposit pressure keeps up, that figure could experience a “mild reprice,” she said.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

In addition to revenue and profit trends, as well as net interest margins and EPS, analysts will focus on credit quality and load loss provisions, non-performing loans and guidance about future business conditions.Overall, it is anticipated that higher interest rates and persistent inflation may have impacted credit activity and potentially hindered overall consumption and spending. The key questions for this earnings season are whether there will be weaker-than-expected growth and lower corporate profits.JP Morgan Chase &amp; CoAfter recording record revenues last quarter, with earnings of $12.6 billion, or $4.10 per share, the New York based JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co will be looking for a strong Q2 when its report is dropped this week.As the largest bank in the world by market capitalisation, JP Morgan’s operations are deeply intertwined with both the domestic US and international economies, which could have been problematic given the global economic situation. However, although inflationary pressures persist and further erode customer purchasing power, particularly in the US, consumer savings buffers are still generally robust and supported by decent wage growth.With interest rates continuing upward over the course of the second quarter, it has produced a visible slowdown in numerous sections of the US economy. Despite this, JP Morgan has been showing a solid mix of profits growth, income, and value to its shareholders.According to Zacks Investment Research, the consensus EPS expectation for the quarter is $3.66, based on 11 experts’ predictions. During the same period previous year, the reported EPS was $2.76.Wells Fargo &amp; CompanyIn the first quarter of 2023, Wells Fargo reported strong profits despite setting aside money for potential loan losses. The bank’s net income increased by over 30% to nearly $5 billion, mainly due to higher interest rates. Revenue also rose by 17%. However, Wells Fargo allocated $1.2 billion for credit losses, including provisions for possible losses in commercial real estate, credit card, and auto loans. Noninterest income, which includes income from ventures and mortgage banking, decreased by 13% during this period.Story continuesWells Fargo &amp; Co is planning to reduce its workforce in Orlando, as the bank recently announced that they will be closing a facility and letting go of just over 100 employees from their consumer and small business banking division. This move is part of the bank’s efforts to adjust their staffing levels according to their business needs, after Wells Fargo &amp; Co had already laid off more than 100 employees in September.According to Zacks Investment Research, the consensus EPS expectation for the quarter is $1.16 and $4.69 for the year. The prior year reported EPS was $3.14.Citigroup Inc.Citigroup’s stock performance has been weaker compared to other US banks in 2023. However, the bank reported positive financial results for the first quarter of the year. They recorded a net income of $4.6 billion and generated $21.45 billion in revenue, surpassing expectations.The increase in revenue was driven by a significant 18% year-over-year growth in personal banking revenue, which was influenced by higher interest rates. Although fixed income markets revenue experienced a 4% increase, investment banking and equity market revenue declined. Despite the strong first quarter, Citigroup maintained its full-year guidance, as the CFO, Mark Mason, cited economic uncertainty and the unpredictable path of interest rates as reasons for their cautious approach.According to Zacks Investment Research, the consensus EPS expectation for the quarter is $1.33 and $5.91 for the year. The prior year reported EPS was $7.11.Trading During the Earnings SeasonThe earnings season (which happens at the end of each fiscal quarter when publicly-traded companies publish essential metrics regarding their quarterly performance) provides a window of opportunity to leverage financial reports’ release to take advantage of short-term trading opportunities and/or to optimize long-term investment positions.If you follow risk-averse trading styles, like scalping and day trading, you can either open trading positions either before or after the release of earnings, depending on your directional bias.If you have a strong directional bias and believe you have a clear understanding about where the stock is heading and about the potential impact of the earnings release, you may choose to open positions before the announcement.But if you prefer a more cautious approach and want to avoid the uncertainty and potential volatility associated with earnings announcements, you may decide to wait until after the release to assess the market’s reaction. This allows you to have more information and potentially make more informed trading decisions.The earnings season also allows you to analyse your portfolio and how to best allocate your funds. You can trim positions that no longer meet your criteria, take profits from successful investments, or reallocate funds to capitalize on new opportunities. Additionally, the earnings season provides an opportunity to reassess the overall balance and diversification of your portfolio to be sure it still aligns with your risk tolerance and long-term investment strategy.DisclaimerCFDs are complex instruments and come with a high risk of losing money rapidly due to leverage. 85% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with this provider.

In addition, they also contribute to the economy by generating wealth and income, paying taxes, supporting services, and making jobs available to the active population of a country.Although businesses and brands make our lives easier, there are a number of negative aspects to them, which is why some people have such a strong disdain or even hatred for them. Don’t Miss: 15 Most Hated Companies in America last year.Americans believe businesses are performing below expectations in various areas, according to a Bentley-Gallup Force for Good survey. 53% of Americans, who participated in the study, said that businesses generally have a negative impact on the environment. For large businesses, this number increased to 65%. Americans also believe that businesses are failing in the area of pay disparity. 82% of respondents said that it is crucial to treat all workers fairly and 72% agreed that they would be ready to pay more for a product from a company that treats its employees well. Moreover, the study also found that 55% of American workers, including 71% of those aged 18 to 29, would switch jobs to work for a company that had a greater beneficial impact on the globe.In a similar vein, Millennials' tolerance for large companies declined in 2019. According to a Deloitte Millennial Survey, fewer Millennials (from 76% in 2017 to 55% in 2019) agreed that business had a beneficial impact on society. Additionally, 26% of Millennials expressed no faith in corporate executives.Story continuesMost Loved and Successful Brands Have the Most HatersMany experts believe that if you want to be great, you must be prepared to face hatred. So, it should come as no surprise that some of the most admired brands in the world are also some of the most despised. Moreover, this hatred toward a brand isn't always detrimental to its financial standing. For instance, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has faced significant backlash following the announcement of 27,000 layoffs since November 2022. Nevertheless, the e-commerce behemoth, which has a large product range, a user-friendly website, is simple to use, and offers quick and dependable shipping, is still one of the most loved and trusted brands by customers. 89% of consumers think that they are more inclined to purchase things from Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) than from any other e-commerce websites.Similarly, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) appears to be loved and despised by people everywhere. Many hate it due to privacy concerns, but more than 77% of Internet users are active on at least one of its platforms. This clearly shows how successful the brand is.Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), one of the largest retailers in the world, is yet another example of a brand that people claim to dislike, but it continues to be profitable every year. It is accused of treating its employees unfairly. Furthermore, critics argue that the big-box giant has swooped in many places and destroyed local small businesses, leaving customers no other options. We believe that success of its business model is much to blame for that.It's easy to understand why brands people dislike persist. If there are significant benefits, customers will stick with a brand they don't like. Many customer decisions are heavily influenced by elements like price, convenience, and easy availability. For example, if a better airline cannot provide equal availability and affordability, consumers will continue to fly with the airline they dislike.Therefore, it is crucial to keep in mind that just because a brand is listed in this article as one of the most despised brands in the world, it doesn't automatically mean that it is no longer significant. This brand had to be on the list even though more people love it than hate it because we were focusing on the latter criteria.With these considerations in mind, let's look at the most hated brands in the world.20 Most Hated Brands in the WorldMilles Studio/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyWe used reputable sources for our rankings of the most hated brands in the world, including the 2023 Axios Harris Poll, 24/7 Wall Street, Business Insider, and USA Today. In addition, we took into account a number of online reviews and customer survey platforms. We assigned scores to each brand based on the number of mentions, so each time a brand was mentioned, it received a score of 1. Consequently, the more mentions and references, the higher the score and rank in our article. Basically, this list of the most hated brands in the world doesn't reflect our opinion but the consensus opinion of various sources.So, without further ado, let's examine the most hated brands in the world that must work very hard to regain the faith of their customers.Most Hated Brands in the World20. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), as reported in one of articles earlier, is one of the top drug companies in the world by revenue. It headquartered in New Brunswick, New Jersey.The company came under intense criticism following many lawsuits that claim its baby powder causes ovarian cancer. However, the pharmaceutical giant agreed to pay $8.9 billion in April 2023 to settle all cancer lawsuits related to its talc-based powders.19. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), with around 232.5 million subscribers, is a streaming service that offers a wide variety of award-winning TV shows, movies, anime, documentaries, and more on thousands of internet-connected devices.Although the streaming service continues to be a favorite among many, it recently attracted public criticism for only allowing members of the same household to share passwords, with outside users having to pay an extra $7.99 per month. However, we don't think that Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)’s inclusion on our list of the most hated brands in the world will have a negative impact on its reputation.18. Navient Corporation (NASDAQ:NAVI)Navient Corporation (NASDAQ:NAVI), one of the most hated brands in the world on our list, is an American student loan servicer based in Wilmington, Delaware.People despise the company because it takes advantage of borrowers by disregarding concerns, providing false information, processing payments improperly, and directing borrowers to more expensive repayment plans. Between November 2016 and January 2017, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau claims receiving over 1,500 consumer complaints about the company.A $1.85 billion settlement was reached between 39 states and Navient Corporation (NASDAQ:NAVI) last year on claims that the company used unfair and deceptive loan practices.17. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), with 32,800 employees as of 2022, primarily offers taxi services, allowing customers to hail a taxi through a mobile app.The company is disliked for its surge pricing as well as the negative effects of gig work replacing secure employment. Moreover, it is also disliked for causing disruption to the taxi industry and aggravating traffic congestion.However, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) offers several benefits, such as door-to-door convenience, safety, and dependable quality, thus we don't believe it deserves to be one of the most hated brands in the world.16. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), as reported in one our articles earlier, is one of the largest banks in the US by asset size.The bank earned the ire of general public when common people lost their homes, their jobs and their savings during the 2008 recession. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) agreed to pay $5.06 billion in 2016 to resolve charges that it mislead mortgage bond investors during the financial crisis.Furthermore, it has also received criticism from its employees. A 2021 poll of 13 first-year analysts at Goldman Sachs found that they were subjected to extremely long work hours, deadline pressure, and harsh behavior from superiors, which deteriorates their personal lives.15. The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI)The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI), with 71,300 employees as of 2022, engages in the provision of global health services. Forbes claims that state regulators get more consumer complaints about the company's health insurance than the national average. Based on ratings from the National Committee for Quality Assurance, it receives an average of 3.3 out of 5 stars.Moreover, the Guardian reported in 2021 that the company's call center employees complained about unfavorable working conditions. High demands for output, the risk of losing one's job, lack of training, and lengthy processing timeframes for consumers seeking reimbursement for Covid-19 testing expenses were the driving forces behind this.14. Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC)Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC), engaged in the provision of banking, insurance, investments, mortgage, and consumer and commercial finance, is headquartered in San Francisco, California. The bank received a lot of criticism in 2016 when it became known that its staff had been engaging in illicit practices for years. These included activities like overcharging clients, creating fake accounts, and unlawfully repossessing cars and homes.13. Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD)Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD), headquartered in Menlo Park, California, is an online discount brokerage that offers a commission-free investing and trading platform.The company was at the center of the short squeeze saga between retail investors and hedge funds in early 2021, resulting in losses worth billions to hedge funds. Despite the benefits enjoyed by retail traders on the platform, like no-fee trading, users on internet platform Reddit, many of whom are retail traders, accused the company of bias towards big finance. The platform halted trading in volatile stocks like GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AMC), favored by retail traders, at the height of the short squeeze drama. In July 2021, the firm was fined $70 million by authorities in the US for operational and regulatory lapses.12. United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL)United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL), founded in 1926, is an American international airline serving North America, Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean, and Europe.The airline, one of the most disliked brands on our list, has previously dealt with widely reported instances of poor customer service, including events in which staff members injured clients, threatened them, and mistreated their pets.United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL) faced a turbulent public reaction over its treatment of a passenger who was forcibly hauled out of his seat and off the plane, with blood streaming down his face, after the airline stated it needed ""volunteers"" to give up their seats for employees.11. Equifax Inc. (NYSE:EFX)Equifax Inc. (NYSE:EFX), headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, is a credit bureau that collects information about an individual's credit history to create a credit report.Given that it failed to secure the enormous amount of personal information stored on its network, which resulted in a data breach in 2017 that exposed millions of names and dates of birth, Social Security numbers, physical addresses, and other personal information that could result in identity theft and fraud, the general public is less forgiving of Equifax Inc. (NYSE:EFX).10. BitcoinBitcoin, introduced to the public in 2009, is a decentralized digital currency that you can buy, sell and exchange directly, without an intermediary like a bank.Bitcoin has drawn criticism for its high volatility and lack of regulation. In addition, it is also harmful to the environment. The University of Cambridge estimates that since its launch, Bitcoin has released 200 million tons of carbon dioxide.However, it is viewed by some, especially in the developing world, as a safe haven amid economic storms, despite being disliked for its volatility. In September 2021, El Salvador became the first nation to recognize Bitcoin as a legal tender, followed by the Central African Republic last year.9. FTXFTX, formerly one of the leading crypto exchanges in the world, filed for bankruptcy on November 11, 2022. US crypto investors sued the company in November last year, alleging that its top executives stole their digital assets and purposely blocked them from making withdrawals.

That’s good news for savers, but bad news for lenders as they prepare to release their second-quarter results.US banks spent the last several months competing with each other to keep or bring back depositors following the turmoil that took down three sizable regional institutions and triggered outflows across the banking system.That scramble pushed rates on savings accounts to 5.05% at the end of the second quarter, according to Bankrate, their steepest level since February 2008.Read more: The best high-yield savings account rates for July 2023The challenge for banks across the US is that these higher funding costs are eating into a key measure of profitability known as net interest margin, which measures the difference between what lenders make from their loans and what they pay for their deposits.That will likely act as a drag on results for some banks in the quarter, especially the mid-sized regional institutions that ran into trouble last spring, while reducing estimates of what they can earn for the rest of the year.“The surprises this quarter will be for the banks that do not lower expectations,” Wells Fargo bank analyst Mike Mayo told Yahoo Finance.Banks, added Argus Research's Stephen Biggar, ""have a deposit conundrum.""'Green shoots'?These pressures will be at the front of mind for investors starting Friday as they digest the first set of second quarter earnings from JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), and State Street (STT).Bank of America (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS) report next Tuesday and Goldman Sachs (GS) next Wednesday. A slew of other regional banks will also report in the coming weeks.Some of the biggest US banks are expected to once again demonstrate their resilience and diversity, showing they can continue to charge more for their loans while leaning on their sprawling franchises to generate additional revenue.Story continuesJPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America are all expected to show jumps in net income when compared to the year-earlier period, according to analyst estimates, while Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley are expected to report profit declines.JPMorgan's headquarters in New York City. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Those that are more dependent on investment banking, such as Goldman, are expected to be particularly challenged by a recent drought in deal making.Global investment banking revenues for the second quarter fell by 8% from the first quarter and 52% from a year ago, according to Dealogic. However, the business improved through the second half of the quarter, prompting some observers to predict “green shoots” ahead.“I’m turning to believing investment banking will not have great earnings but they’re going to be surprising, and I think better than expected,” said Dick Bove, a bank analyst with Odeon Capital.Investors will also be watching to see whether many of these big banks increase the amounts they set aside for future loan losses, a sign that they expect the US economy and credit conditions to worsen.“We're starting to see some increased delinquencies, particularly in the credit card and auto lending market,” said Biggar, Argus Research's director of financial services.'A huge amount of problems'Smaller regional banks are clearly not under the same amount of pressure as they were in March, when the fall of Silicon Valley Bank triggered panic across the country.But they still “face a huge amount of problems,” Bove said.The core issue is an aggressive campaign by the Federal Reserve to bring down inflation with higher interest rates. That campaign is lowering the value of the assets banks hold, such as bonds, while deposit costs creep higher and loan demand slows.Read more: Why now is a good time to open a savings account“We view accelerating deposit costs, not accelerating deposit outflows, as the most significant headwind to earnings for the next several quarters,“ Manan Gosalia, a regional bank analyst for Morgan Stanley, said in a research note.Higher rates have traditionally worked to the advantage of banks since it allows them to charge more for their loans than their deposits.But the panic of the spring “has changed the calculus a bit” for some banks, the Fed’s vice chair of supervision Michael Barr said Monday. Some lenders “are now paying up more for deposits,” and the Fed is “paying careful attention to that.”Silicon Valley Bank was seized on March 10. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)The Fed has made it clear that more hikes are coming this year. Regulators are also preparing new capital requirements for banks with more than $100 billion in assets that will force some to hold greater buffers against losses. That will increase the stability of those lenders but will also make it even more difficult to earn robust profits in the near term.Many banks have already warned at a conference in June that their net interest margins are going to drop by more than they expected for the quarter or the year, including executives for US Bancorp (USB), Citizens Financial Group (CFG), Comerica (CMA), Huntington (HBAN), KeyCorp (KEY), and Zions (ZION).“I’ve only been a banker for 10 years, so I haven’t seen a time when we’ve needed deposits as an industry as much as we do now,” Darrin Williams, the CEO of the 58-branch Southern Bancorp, told Yahoo Finance.The amount Southern Bancorp is paying customers has risen 600% since the Fed’s interest rate hiking cycle began, Williams added.“Our cost of funds continues to rise just because our customers demand that.”The larger banks aren’t immune to some of these same challenges.“Deposits will continue the trend of being slightly down from here,” Jennifer Piepszak, co-CEO of JPMorgan Chase's massive consumer and community bank, said at a conference in June.The bank has predicted it will earn net interest income of $84 billion in 2023, but if the deposit pressure keeps up, that figure could experience a “mild reprice,” she said.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"
197,424ae171-222b-3a82-91d9-c49c82b2aa92,PFE,2023-07-13,Novo Nordisk (NVO) Falls on EMA Safety Review of Obesity Drugs,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/novo-nordisk-nvo-falls-ema-115700793.html,1689163020,STORY,"['NOVO-B.CO', 'NVO', 'PFE', 'ABBV', 'LLY']","[Nono Nordisk’s NVO GLP-1 receptor agonists, indicated for weight loss and treating type II diabetes, are under scrutiny by the European Medicine Agency (""EMA""). The EMA stated that its safety committee is conducting a review of obesity and diabetes care drugs, which include Ozempic (semaglutide), Saxenda (liraglutide) and Wegovy (semaglutide). Data on these drugs are being reviewed for the risk of suicidal thoughts and self-harm associated with their use.Per the EMA, this review of the GLP-1 drugs was commenced by the Icelandic medicines agency, after receiving reports of suicidal thoughts and self-inflicted injuries in patients using liraglutide and semaglutide medicines. Authorities have reportedly identified about 150 reports of possible cases of self-injury and suicidal thoughts and are currently analyzing them.The stock of the company was down 3% on Tuesday, following the dismal news. Year to date, shares of Novo Nordisk have gained 12.5% against the industry’s 1.6% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCurrently, NVO is a key player in the diabetes and obesity space. Its semaglutide was initially approved to treat type II diabetes, under the trade name Ozempic. Later, the company received label expansion in the United States for once-weekly semaglutide injections to treat obesity or overweight in adults, under the brand name Wegovy.The company is also currently evaluating a once-daily oral formulation of semaglutide for obesity indication in late-stage studies, with potential regulatory filings in the United States and EU, which is expected later this year.Liraglutide was initially approved as a chronic weight management treatment option for adults in addition to a reduced-calorie diet and physical activity. Subsequently, in 2020, liraglutide’s label was expanded to include the treatment of obesity in adolescents (12-17 years).The EMA has reported that the review of these drugs is being carried out in the context of a signal procedure. A signal here refers to safety information regarding a new adverse event or manifestation of a known adverse event that is potentially caused by the usage of a medicine. However, the EMA has clarified that if the presence of a signal is detected, it may not be necessarily caused by the usage of a particular medicine.Story continuesNotably, suicidal behavior is not currently listed as a side effect in the EU product information for any GLP-1 receptor agonists. The review of Ozempic, Saxenda and Wegovy started in July 2023 and has now been extended to include other GLP-1 receptor agonists. A final statement from the EMA is expected in November 2023.Other key players in the GLP-1 market include pharma bigwigs like Eli Lilly LLY and Pfizer PFE.In June 2023, Lilly completed the regulatory submission seeking label expansion for its dual GIP/GLP-1-RA drug, tirzepatide, to treat obesity or overweight in adults. A final decision is expected by the end of 2023. Data from one late-stage study (SURMOUNT-1), released last year, showed that treatment with tirzepatide led to mean weight reduction of up to 22.5% in patients without diabetes. Also, data from a second late-stage study (SURMOUNT-2) showed that tirzepatide treatment achieved mean reduction up to 15.7% in patients with type II diabetes.Like Eli Lilly, Pfizer is also evaluating pipeline candidates for obesity. In May 2023, Pfizer reported positive data from the phase II study of its oral type II diabetes candidate, danuglipron. Per the data readout, danuglipron helped patients lose weight faster than Novo Nordisk’s popular diabetes weekly injection, Ozempic. If danuglipron is successful in further studies and eventually approved, it can enjoy strong demand trends as the demand for weight loss drugs is huge and rising. Also, danuglipron is an oral pill compared with weekly injections with Ozempic/Wegovy, which is an easier-to-use formulation.Subject to the approval of their respective drugs, both Lilly and Pfizer have the potential to provide serious competition to Novo Nordisk and challenge its superiority in the diabetes and obesity care market.In a separate press release, Reuters claimed that only about one-third of patients receiving Wegovy therapy continued treatment with the drug a year later, amidst growing healthcare costs for the group of patients on which the observation was made. Reuters reported this anomaly after receiving an analysis of U.S. pharmacy claims. Per Reuters, after starting the medication, treatment costs with Wegovy or a similar drug increase by almost 59% over the course of a year, which is rising a serious affordability issue, especially when any improvement in health and subsequent reduction in medical costs is not likely to occur quickly.Novo Nordisk A/S Price and ConsensusNovo Nordisk A/S Price and ConsensusNovo Nordisk A/S price-consensus-chart | Novo Nordisk A/S QuoteZacks Rank and Stock to ConsiderNovo Nordisk currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the same industry is AbbVie ABBV, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

Carlson told viewers in January 2022 that Epps was a ""central figure"" in the attack and ""helped stage-manage the insurrection,"" according to the lawsuit.Story continuesFox fired Carlson in April.Epps is suing the network for defamation and false light, alleging that the statements about him on Fox ""would lead the public to believe that Epps was a federal agent working to provoke or otherwise incite others to attack the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021.""(Reporting by Helen Coster and Jack Queen in New York, and Tom Hals in Wilmington, Delaware; Editing by Jamie Freed)]"

Smartmatic's case has played out alongside a similar defamation lawsuit against Fox News and Fox Corp by Dominion Voting Systems, which settled on the eve of trial in April for $787 million.Bannon and Flynn representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment, nor did Smartmatic and Newsmax.A trial date has not yet been set in the Smartmatic case. Representatives of both companies previously have declined to say whether they are in talks over a possible settlement.Bannon, an influential figure on the American right, worked on Trump's 2016 campaign and later in the White House. He now hosts a podcast. Bannon last year was convicted of contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena from the committee that investigated the 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters.Story continuesBannon separately was charged in 2020 with defrauding donors to a private fund-raising effort to boost Trump's project to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border. Trump pardoned Bannon before that federal case went to trial. Bannon now is set to go on trial next year on state criminal charges related to the wall scheme.Flynn is a retired U.S. Army lieutenant general who served as Trump's first White House national security advisor until he stepped down after only a few weeks on the job amid revelations that he misled then-Vice President Mike Pence about his communications with the Russian ambassador to the United States.Trump also pardoned Flynn, who had twice pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI during the federal investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.(Reporting by Jack Queen; Editing by Will Dunham)]"

This marked the weakest performance for the hedge fund industry since 2018 when it also posted a 2.4% loss. Looking at the five-year performance, hedge funds have achieved a compounded annual return of +4.2%, demonstrating a more favorable performance compared to bonds, which experienced a decline of 2.0%. Aurum, a hedge fund investment specialist, noted that there were clear winners and losers in the hedge fund industry in 2022. The best-performing strategies were multi-strategy (+9.5%), quant (+8.5%), and macro (+6.7%). Strategies that typically have a higher correlation to equities and fixed income, which experienced poor performance, struggled the most. Patrick Ghali, managing partner of hedge fund advisory firm Sussex Partners, told Reuters on January 10, 2023: ""Investors need to look under the surface to understand the industry performance last year. Long-short hedge funds are the biggest asset-weighted part of the industry.

Chairman Rick Sopher of LCH Investments commented: “The largest gains were once again made by the large multi-strategy hedge funds like Citadel, DE Shaw and Millennium.

JPMorgan Chase comes to mind especially here, but so does Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) despite its weakness in March, as well as U.S. Bancorp, to which we added opportunistically in the quarter.”23.

It is the global leader in theme parks with hotels and cruise lines aimed at families. Key assets within Disney are the instantly recognisable entertainment franchises that have multiple avenues of monetisation such as Mickey Mouse, Star Wars, ABC and Marvel’s Avengers.Disney’s share price declined due to a number of factors in 2022, presenting us the chance to purchase a long-admired business and its unique collection of valuable intellectual property assets at what we consider to be a very attractive valuation. Summarily, the EPS of Disney has declined from US$7 in 2018 to ~US$2.60 in 2022 but we believe that the earnings power of the assets has not diminished to anywhere near this extent.Disney is currently undergoing a business transition within the Media and Entertainment Distribution division (DMED) from traditional media property distribution via third parties (i.e. cinemas and broadcast networks) to a Direct-To-Consumer (DTC) model via the Disney+ streaming service. A key element of our thesis is that the earnings power of the company is currently being masked by the marketing and content investments within Disney+ and that this will normalize over the next several years. To put this in perspective, Disney+ (DTC sub-segment) currently generates operating losses of over US$3.3bn (a negative 14% operating margin) compared to operating margins at its nearest streaming competitor, Netflix, of +15.5%…” (Click here to read the full text)22.

Core organic growth, excluding COVID-19 testing revenue which fell 16%, grew a very strong 13%.

Those two, along with Google Pay and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), are the four most popular digital wallets today. According to the Payments Journal, PayPal has been used (over the last 12 months) by 62% of American consumers, followed by Apple Pay at 41% and Google Pay at 32%.Over the last several years, P2P payments have made tremendous strides in adoption and usage. Whenever something becomes a verb, like just Venmo me $10, you know that it has been widely embraced by society. The concept of allowing individuals to pay each other, via our smartphones, has clearly taken off.However, the biggest flaw or issue (that we’ve identified) is interoperability. Digital wallets allow users to pick their favorite card to make payments with. P2P acts as a bit of a “walled garden” and its funding source is still siloed. This is a critical aspect for future P2P growth, as Venmo users can’t pay Cash App users who can’t pay Zelle users. Visa is launching Visa+ next year and it has already signed up PayPal and Venmo as its initial customers. The global card networks seem like the perfect piece to solve this interoperability puzzle. Of course, this will only work if banks allow an independent network to serve as the gateway between disparate user bases…” (Click here to read the full text)17. Netflix, Inc.

(NYSE:JPM) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“It will be interesting to see what kind of policy decisions are made around regulation for institutions that are between $100 billion of assets and $700 billion of assets. As JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM)’s purchase of First Republic shows, scale is a competitive advantage. It now has 13% of total US deposits and it manages 21% of America’s credit card spending. With additional regulatory burdens coming, banks are facing a profitability headwind and 100 to 300 basis points of possible ROE erosion.The banking sector is facing a slow-moving crisis, but we aren’t sure it is enough to sink the overall health of the US consumer or economy. Credit will contract and lending standards will continue to rise. However, we do not see this problem escalating to the size and scale of previous banking crises.Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JP Morgan Chase clearly sees the risks these FINTECH companies present. In his annual letter to shareholders, he stated that all incumbent banks should be “scared shitless” of these FINTECH rivals. Not only is his bank being attacked from multiple angles, but Apple just launched a cash management program with Goldman Sachs. On the first day of Apple’s savings program, it raised $400 million and eclipsed $1 billion in its first four days. Dimon specifically labeled Apple a bank the other day in an interview when he said, “It may not have insured deposits, but it’s a bank.

We did take advantage of improving sentiment to higher growth technology companies and the share price of more defensive companies drifting down to divest our investment in Adobe and increase the Fund’s investment in UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH). United Health’s share price was also under moderate pressure due to regulatory announcements being very slightly adverse. We believe the market over-reacted to these announcements and the share price has recovered strongly over recent weeks.”13.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 131At the end of June 2023, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s valuation surpassed $3 trillion, solidifying its position as the world's most valuable company.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Despite this, the S&amp;P 500 is up 7% this year and the Nasdaq is up +11%. Technology rebounded from a challenging 2022 and many large tech companies are performing quite well this year. Through mid-May 2023, year-to-date performance of some of the most popular and largest tech names is impressive. For tech companies with market capitalizations over $1 trillion, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is up +35%, Microsoft +33%, Amazon +39%, and Google is +40%. In terms of contribution to the S&amp;P 500’s year-to-date return, Apple and Microsoft represent roughly half of its 2023 performance. Apple, and Microsoft now account for 13.9% of the entire S&amp;P 500 or 80% more concentrated than 2008. For additional perspective, Apple’s market cap is at $2.8 trillion and that is larger than the market cap of the entire Russell 2000. To conclude, it’s distinctly getting more concentrated at the top.For our purposes, we are just going to focus on software digital wallets, as they are much more common and accessible. If you own an iPhone, then you have an Apple Pay preloaded digital wallet. If you have a Samsung phone, you have Samsung Pay available for use.

According to the Payments Journal, PayPal has been used (over the last 12 months) by 62% of American consumers, followed by Apple Pay at 41% and Google Pay at 32%.Digital wallets have tons of advantages that we are embracing. When we attend Tampa Bay Lightning games, we love having our season tickets easily accessible on our phones (via the Apple Pay wallet), as well as our timed parking pass. When we travel, loading the airline ticket into our Apple Pay wallet is much more convenient than printing out a paper boarding pass. Others are using digital wallets to track their expenses, budget properly, and even help them easily pay their bills. Digital wallets are still in their infancy and have decades of future growth; we believe the smartphone is simply the best interface and platform for digital wallets…” (Click here to read the full text)10. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 132NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), an American semiconductor giant, is one of the most owned stocks among smart investors.

Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is a significant stakeholder of the company, with 8.2 million shares worth $2.3 billion. ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“The Strategy’s IT holdings also drove performance in the second quarter, led by the continued rerating of graphics chipmaker NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as a key beneficiary of the generative AI boom. Nvidia is a good example of a select growth stock bought opportunistically where our long-term thesis has bloomed. We initiated the position in the fourth quarter of 2018 knowing that inference and training in the data center was an interesting although still early-stage growth driver. We knew that GPUs could be used to solve complex computing problems, but we didn’t know how quickly the training and learning efforts by Nvidia’s mega cap customers would hit an inflection point. Volatility in the gaming business created the entry point into the stock and we have built the position accordingly over time. Since the end of 2021, the stock’s portfolio weight grew from 4.5% to a high of 7.2% earlier in the second quarter before we trimmed it to manage our overall position sizing.We will continue to monitor and adjust Nvidia’s position sizing to manage risk. Despite the sharp run up, we believe the company’s long-term runway remains compelling due to its advantaged positioning in a very large addressable market for GPUs. The current valuation looks expensive, yet Nvidia has real earnings and cash flow and the longer-term multiple looks more reasonable because of GPU pricing power.”9. Salesforce, Inc.

(NYSE:CRM) is the largest pure-play cloud software company, holding a leading market share in customer relationship management applications and a top-five market share position in the company’s other clouds (Marketing, Service, Platform, Analytics, Integration, and Commerce). The company’s software subscription term-license model differs from the traditional perpetual-license software model in two respects: (1) the software is hosted on centralized servers and delivered over the internet, as opposed to traditional enterprise software that is loaded directly onto customers’ hard drives or servers; and (2) the revenue model is subscription-based, typically charging monthly fees per user as opposed to charging one-time licensing fees. The stock’s strong relative performance followed a strong F4Q23 earnings release that easily beat Street expectations on the top- and bottom-lines. In addition to the beat, management announced a number of initiatives that activist investors have been clamoring for, specifically a halt to large M&amp;A transactions and a focus on operating profitability.”8. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 138Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) engages in transaction processing and provides payment-related products and services worldwide. It is one of the most owned stocks by hedge funds. On June 26, Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) declared a $0.57 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on August 9, to shareholders of record on July 7. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 138 hedge funds were bullish on Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), compared to 139 funds in the prior quarter. Charles Akre’s Akre Capital Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 5.8 million shares worth $2.13 billion. Manole Capital Management made the following comment about Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“We like to start out all of our discussions by telling investors who we are. We are FINTECH investors, and we define Fintech as “anything utilizing technology to improve an established process.” We realize that half of Fintech is financial, but we don’t invest in traditional, credit sensitive banks. Having managed money during the Financial Crisis, we learned firsthand how certain opaque and balance sheet intensive financials could go bankrupt or insolvent.We prefer transaction-based businesses, generating recurring revenue, with sustainable margins, and significant cash flow. From our perspective, the perfect example of a FINTECH business is the secularly growing payments industry. Names like Visa or Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), that generate revenue and profit per swipe or transaction, without the underlying credit sensitivity or risk associated with that underlying line of credit.”7. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 144Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is an American mobility technology firm. On May 24, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) outlined its strategy to introduce 25,000 electric vehicles in India as part of its initiative called Uber Green. The company intends to collaborate with local fleet operators and enhance financing options to facilitate this plan. Alongside the addition of 25,000 electric cars to the Uber platform in India, Uber also aims to deploy 10,000 electric two-wheelers in Delhi by 2024 in collaboration with EV startup Zypp Electric.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 144 hedge funds were bullish on Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), compared to 135 funds in the earlier quarter. RiverPark Large Growth Fund made the following comment about Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER): Uber was a top contributor in the quarter following better-than-expected 4Q results and 1Q guidance. Gross Bookings grew 19% year over year to $31 billion, driven by 31% Mobility Gross Bookings growth and 6% Delivery Growth Bookings growth. 4Q Adjusted EBITDA of $665 million, up $579 million year over year, significantly beating management’s $600-$630 million guidance. Management guided to continuing growth in 1Q for Gross Bookings (20%- 24% growth) and Adjusted EBITDA (of $660-$700 million).UBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing, with a greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates. The company is also a leader in food delivery, where it is number one or two in the more than 25 countries in which it operates. Moreover, after a history of losses, the company is now solidly profitable with the potential for substantial margin expansion and free cash flow generation to come. We view UBER as more than just ride sharing and food delivery, but also as a global mobility platform with the ability to sell to its 131 million users (by comparison, Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and penetrate new markets of on-demand services, such as package and grocery delivery, travel, truck brokerage (the company had $1.5 billion in Freight revenue for 4Q22), and worker staffing for shift work. Given its $4 billion of unrestricted cash and $5 billion of investments, the company today has an enterprise value of $70 billion, indicating that UBER trades at 1.6x next year’s estimated revenue.”6. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 155Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the most owned stocks by hedge funds. On July 6, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) disclosed that it has decided to postpone the launch of its first custom processor for Pixel smartphones by at least one year. The company had initially planned to release the chip in 2024, aiming to replace Samsung-made processors. However, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has now revised its strategy and will continue to rely on Samsung for processors until 2025, after which it plans to introduce its fully customized chip.According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter data, Harris Associates is the largest Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stakeholder, with 36.90 million shares worth $3.8 billion. Like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the most owned stocks by hedge funds.Oakmark Global Select Fund made the following comment about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (U.S.) was the top contributor to the Fund’s performance for the quarter. Alphabet’s first-quarter search revenue growth accelerated slightly sequentially, which was notable given that advertising spending has decreased across the board. Management cited the company’s travel and retail segments for their strong performance in contrast to the declines experienced in the finance and in the media and entertainment businesses. Advertising spending has also stabilized at YouTube, and the focus on “shorts” has driven strong viewership growth. In the near term, YouTube’s investment in shorts may not generate significant revenue, but we believe its profitability will accelerate over time. Alphabet’s cloud business reached GAAP profitability this quarter, moving from a -12% margin this quarter last year to a 3% margin this quarter. On the AI front, Alphabet upgraded Bard to run on its more powerful PaLM language model, and Bard can now assist with coding and software development. CEO Sundar Pichai compared AI’s evolution to the transition from desktop to mobile computing a decade ago and said there is “a lot more to come” in terms of its consumer AI applications. CFO Ruth Porat revised 2023 capital expenditures guidance due to higher spending on data center construction and servers that will support AI developments in consumer products, advertiser tools and the cloud business. Porat reiterated that the company plans to continue to hold expense growth below revenue growth and that Alphabet’s cost-reduction initiatives should bear fruit later this year and into 2024. At Alphabet’s annual developer conference in May, the company showcased an impressive array of new AI-powered consumer tools, which will be rolled out over the course of the year. Investors reacted positively to these presentations, which highlighted the extent of AI innovation occurring at Alphabet.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Most Owned Stocks by Hedge Funds. Suggested articles:10 Best Economic Recovery Stocks to Buy11 Best Breakout Stocks to Buy Now12 Best Mining Stocks Hedge Funds Are Buying Disclosure: None. 25 Most Owned Stocks by Hedge Funds is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 57% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of International Business Machines, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for International Business Machines ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About International Business Machines?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that International Business Machines does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of International Business Machines, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in International Business Machines. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 8.9% of shares outstanding. With 7.9% and 5.9% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of International Business MachinesWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of International Business Machines Corporation. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$90m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 43% stake in International Business Machines. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand International Business Machines better, we need to consider many other factors. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   4 warning signs for International Business Machines   (of which 1 is concerning!) you should know about.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do.

Credit: Adobe StockTruist Financial is getting ready for quantum computing through a new partnership with IBM.The Charlotte-based bank announced Wednesday that it will join the IBM Quantum Accelerator program and welcome IBM to the bank's Innovator in Residence program.Truist aims to get quantum-safe ready in the area of cybersecurity, where many worry that hackers will be able to exploit quantum technology before key targets like banks do. The bank would also like to develop and use new applications that can take advantage of the technology.""Offensively, we want to make sure that we're putting together policies, standards and controls, that we're able to proactively put things in place, not only for new workloads with quantum computing capabilities, but existing workloads that are sitting on more traditional infrastructure, or even cloud-based infrastructure,"" said Ken Meyer, divisional chief information and experience officer at Truist, in an interview. ""On the defensive side, it's making sure that we're putting up the type of cyber related controls and encryption standards and other things that'll help us protect from malicious actors.""Truist declined to share how much money or how many people it is dedicating to this effort. It did say it has assembled a team of employees including application developers, infrastructure engineers, line of business leaders, cyber engineers, network engineers and experts in risk and auditing who will work on quantum capabilities.Other banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Ally Bank, are also trying to get ahead of quantum computing technology.""We realize that if a company doesn't do anything about the market right now, and just waits for quantum advantage to become a reality, when quantum advantage becomes real, it might be too late,"" said Marco Pistoia, managing director, distinguished engineer, head of global technology applied research and head of quantum computing at JPMorgan Chase, in an interview last fall. ""We want to be ready when quantum advantage becomes possible on a higher level.""Story continuesThese banks are using cloud-based quantum-computing-as-a-service from companies like D-Wave, IBM, Google, Amazon, Rigetti, Microsoft and QC Ware. They're testing the technology for complex problems like derivatives pricing, portfolio optimization and index tracking.Industry experts agree this effort is worthwhile, especially on the cybersecurity side.""Banks should be educating themselves on the coming quantum computing evolution now, with a specific focus on getting their cybersecurity house in order to be ready to deploy post-quantum encryption in the next few years,"" said Sultan Meghji, a professor at Duke University's Pratt Engineering School, former chief innovation officer at the FDIC and CEO and cofounder of Frontier Foundry.For most banks, except the largest 20 or so, the lowest-risk path forward on quantum resilience is to move to native cloud platforms from the big tech vendors that have already been working on this for a few years, he said, such as Amazon, Google and Microsoft.Not quite ready for prime timeQuantum computing uses quantum mechanics, the laws of physics that govern the smallest particles in the universe, to solve problems at high speeds. Traditional computers only allow bits of information to live in one state (as a 0 or 1) at a time. A quantum computer uses qubits (quantum bits) that enable bits of information to have a value of 1, 0 or both 0 and 1 simultaneously. This means a quantum computer can manipulate and assess many combinations of information.A quantum computer can cycle through 10 to the 154th power potential answers to a problem in microseconds.But the technology still has challenges to overcome. Manufacturers are still trying to scale the number of qubits in a quantum computer while achieving a sufficient level of qubit quality by working on error mitigation and fault tolerance. Some manufacturers have said they plan to have fault-tolerant quantum-computing hardware by 2030.IBM is working on error mitigation to correct for the instabilities of quantum computing. This work was featured in the June cover story of Nature magazine.""There's noise in today's quantum devices and error mitigation is a newer technique that can be used today to correct for some of those errors with the type of devices that we have today,"" said Noelle Ibrahim, associate partner, quantum computing, banking and financial markets at IBM Quantum, in an interview.Error mitigation will help certain use cases come to fruition a bit earlier, she said.""In terms of what that means for banking, we're really at the precipice of a new, exciting era because error mitigation can be used for many use cases that have already been published, for example, on simulators,"" Ibrahim said. ""The next step is to actually try those use cases on real devices with error mitigation and to start working with them. We're working with partners like Truist to bring that cutting edge to commercial fruition. We're not exactly there yet, but we think that the time when some exciting new developments will come in the banking industry is pretty soon.""Once the technology itself is ready, the models meant to run on it will have to be rewritten in a quantum-friendly way.Once all this is done, potential use cases will include options pricing, AI and quantum machine learning applications, according to Ibrahim.But the most important use case for banks is most likely cybersecurity, making sure a bank and its third parties are safe from attackers armed with quantum computers.""There's a weakest link element to it whereby if you have a supplier or a vendor that is not quantum safe, that could disrupt your own efforts to be quantum safe as well,"" Ibrahim said.This makes standards and industry consortia efforts important, she said. Inside the Truist-IBM allianceIn the IBM Accelerator program, Truist's technologists will be able to learn from other IBM clients that have been testing use cases.""We think there's potential in a number of different areas,"" Meyer said. ""When you think about the world of trading, as an example, that's an area that could be really fascinating when you think of the speed in which you have to conduct potential trades. And then to be able to do that over a quantum computing network, that could be something that's really interesting. Payments are also really interesting to us in the future.""Core banking and real-time settlement could potentially run on quantum computers in the future, he hypothesized.""We're going to explore a lot of different areas to determine what makes the most sense,"" he said. ""But this world is changing pretty rapidly. So we're going to continue to keep our finger on the pulse of what's going on from a pure capability perspective.""Quantum computing could also be used for AI applications such as document summarization – JPMorgan Chase technologists recently published a paper on this.Truist's Innovator in Residence program brings in outside subject matter experts to help the bank innovate. IBM is the newest member; Amazon Web Services and Verizon are existing partners.""What we're doing with IBM goes way beyond just quantum,"" Meyer said. ""As part of the Innovator in Residence program, they have distinguished engineers that ultimately take up residence in our facility, working on co-creating on real-life use cases.""Truist is already working with IBM on some generative AI internal use cases right now, some using Watson X, Meyer said. Watson X is a new AI and data platform from IBM that is intended to help companies use generative AI and machine learning.""We're looking at actually getting things to production,"" Meyer said. ""What are the things that we can co-create, build proofs of concept for, and ultimately get into the production environment and into the hands of our teammates or our clients?""Meyer would like to have quantum safe standards, controls, frameworks and architectures in place over the next year or so, then start to deploy them.""As we develop new use cases for potential quantum computing, it'd be great to be able to start actually running real, live workloads,"" Meyer said. ""But we're going to crawl before we walk. Crawling is getting safe and making sure that we're doing it the right way.""]"

In the last reported quarter, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents. It pulled off a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 21.11%, on average.Despite a strong emphasis on innovation and several project wins driven by rapid 5G adoption, the Sweden-based telecom equipment provider is expected to have recorded lower revenues year over year. Macroeconomic headwinds, intense competition in the communication industry and rising operating expenses are likely to weigh on profits.Factors at PlayDuring the quarter, the company achieved a landmark of developing 1 million 5G radios with its manufacturing partner Flex in Poland. The one-millionth unit is set to be installed at leading Sweden-based communications service provider — Telia Company — as Ericsson aims to transform the Nordics and the Baltics region with superfast 5G connectivity.The company teamed up with Proptivity to launch the world's first neutral host-led shared indoor 5G radio access network (RAN), powered by Radio Dot System. It will support visitors and employees and mitigate connectivity challenges in busy public places like shopping malls. These developments are likely to have positively impacted its second-quarter revenues.In the quarter under review, Ericsson joined forces with Intel and Hewlett Packard to boost Cloud RAN advancement and develop cutting-edge, resilient and sustainable solutions for future networks. The company also partnered with Mediatek to demonstrate a record 5G upload speed of 440 Mbps. Ericsson is benefiting from extensive 5G expansion worldwide. It collaborated with Intel to boost 5G infrastructure development in Thailand and ensure a higher proliferation of 5G across Malaysia.In the quarter to be reported, Polska Grupa Energetyczna group has selected Ericsson’s RAN and core network solutions to upgrade mission-critical communication infrastructure in the power sector. Digital Nasional Berhad, a leading telecommunication company based in Malaysia deployed the Ericsson Security Manager solution to enhance cyber defense of the critical network ecosystem. These notable developments are likely to have a positive impact on the company’s top line.However, lower capital expenditure from North American operators, owing to near-term uncertainty and inventory adjustments are headwinds. Ericsson faces fierce competition from other established players in the telecommunications industry. Keeping up with rapid technological advancements and maintaining a strong market position demands a substantial investment in research and development. This is likely to have strained margins and negatively affected its operations.For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $6,125 million, which indicates a decline from $6,356 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted earnings per share are pegged at 5 cents, suggesting a decline from 14 cents recorded in the year-earlier quarter.Story continuesEarnings WhispersOur proven model predicts a likely earnings beat for Ericsson this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. That’s exactly the case here.Earnings ESP: Ericsson has an Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, of +47.37%.

207,8173d91c-7fe7-35a6-90a1-b157e75c20c8,IBM,2023-07-13,IBM (IBM) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ibm-ibm-expected-beat-earnings-140039592.html,1689170439,STORY,['IBM'],"[The market expects IBM (IBM) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 19, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis technology and consulting company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -13.4%.Revenues are expected to be $15.51 billion, down 0.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.88% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for IBM?For IBM, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.58%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that IBM will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that IBM would post earnings of $1.27 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.36, delivering a surprise of +7.09%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.IBM appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company has been witnessing solid business momentum, strong consumer demand and market share gains, which have been boosting its performance. Effective marketing and exceptional commercial execution bode well.Robust sales growth, organic operating margin expansion and productivity savings have been aiding DEO’s results for a while. Price/mix has been gaining from a positive mix due to robust growth in super-premium-plus brands, particularly scotch, tequila and Chinese white spirits.Shares of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 1.3% in the past year compared with the industry’s decline of 1.6%.However, inflation, stemming from higher glass, ocean freight and transportation costs, has been a headwind. Also, currency headwinds are concerning. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research What Keeps Diageo Strong?DEO is anticipated to retain the strength in its business through constant premiumization efforts, recovery across markets, pricing actions and supply productivity savings. The company’s premium plus brands contributed 57% to net sales growth and 65% to organic sales growth in the first half of fiscal 2023. Its super-premium-plus brands aided organic net sales by 12%.Diageo is confident about the long-term growth potential of the beverage alcohol sector. It expects to expand its value share by 50% in the sector to 6% by 2030. DEO is on track to deliver on its medium-term guidance for fiscal 2023-2025 of 5-7% organic sales growth and 6-9% organic operating profit growth. Diageo expects to invest strongly in marketing and innovation, and leverage its revenue growth management capabilities, including strategic pricing actions.DEO is well-poised for growth from effective marketing and extraordinary commercial execution. It is likely to invest strongly in marketing and innovation, and leverage its revenue growth management capabilities, including strategic pricing actions. This is likely to support DEO in the near and long terms.The company’s margin trends were favorable in the first half of fiscal 2023, thanks to its premiumization efforts, ongoing recovery in markets, pricing actions and disciplined cost management. Organic operating profit benefited from leverage in operating costs, driven by disciplined cost management. Growth was driven by supply productivity savings and price increases, which more than offset the higher cost inflation on the gross margin.In fiscal 2023, the company anticipates organic operating margin to benefit from continued premiumization trends, everyday efficiencies and operating expense leverage, offset by strong investments in marketing.For fiscal 2023, DEO anticipates organic net sales growth across North America to normalize through the second half of fiscal 2023, whereas it reported double-digit growth in the year-ago period. In Europe, organic net sales growth is likely to moderate in the second half of fiscal 2023 as the company laps the on-trade channel re-opening and recovery in the prior year. It anticipates continued organic net sales growth for the Asia Pacific, Latin America, and the Caribbean and Africa in the second half of fiscal 2023, although at a moderated pace than strong growth reported in fiscal 2022.Story continuesHurdles to OvercomeDiageo suffers from persistent inflationary pressures from higher commodity costs, particularly agave, energy expenses and supply disruptions. As a substantial portion of the company’s business comes from international operations, exchange rate fluctuations have been hampering its sales for a while.DEO expects to continue its revenue management initiatives, including pricing actions, throughout fiscal 2023, to overcome the challenging inflationary environment.In the second half of fiscal 2023, the company expects cost inflation pressure to persist and is committed to investing in its brands to deliver sustainable growth.

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate.

SAM and The Duckhorn Portfolio NAPA.Industry: Alcoholic BeveragesLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2118980/5-stocks-to-watch-as-the-alcohol-industry-trends-turn-unfavorablePlayers in the Zacks Beverages – Alcohol industry have been witnessing product shortages due to supply delays and other logistic issues. Escalated input, freight and packaging costs, along with higher advertising and marketing expenses, may continue to be headwinds for the industry participants. However, companies in the alcohol space are placed to benefit from the continued recovery across markets and channels, robust demand for premium and high-quality products, and innovative spirits.The diversification of product portfolios of alcohol companies has been helping boost their top lines. Companies are expected to benefit from the momentum in spirits and ready-to-drink (RTD) cocktails.Investments in product innovations, premiumization and technology platforms bode well for players like Constellation Brands Inc., Brown-Forman, Molson Coors, The Boston Beer Co. and The Duckhorn Portfolio.About the IndustryThe Zacks Beverages – Alcohol industry mainly comprises producers, importers, exporters, marketers and sellers of alcoholic beverages like beer, craft beer, ciders, wine, rum, whiskey, liqueurs, vodka, tequila, champagnes, brandy, amaretto, RTD cocktails and malt. Some industry players also produce and sell non-alcoholic beverages like carbonated soft drinks, sparkling waters, bottled water, energy drinks, powdered and natural juices, and RTD teas.The companies sell products through wholesalers and retailers like supermarkets, warehouse clubs, grocery stores, convenience stores, package stores, drug stores and other retail outlets. The industry participants also sell beer directly to consumers in cans and bottles at restaurants, pubs, bars and liquor stores. Some brewers operate brewpubs or taste rooms at breweries, offering consumers the freshest beer.Story continuesWhat's Shaping the Future of Beverages - Alcohol IndustrySupply-Chain Disruptions &amp; Higher Freight Costs: Players in the alcohol industry have been enduring pressures from the ongoing supply-chain constraints, and the impacts of inflationary labor, transportation and commodity costs. The industry players have been experiencing elevated ingredient and other input costs, including shipping and freight, labor, trucking, fuel, co-packing fees, secondary packaging materials, and increased outbound freight costs, leading to increased costs of sales and higher operating costs. These have been resulting in adverse gross and operating margins for beverage companies.Elevated Costs: Apart from elevated input and packaging costs, players in the alcohol industry are anticipated to witness higher advertising and promotional expenses, as well as SG&amp;A costs, further threatening profitability. Rising brand investments, particularly in media, advertising, production and local marketing, and increased freight to distributors due to higher volumes are resulting in elevated advertising, promotional and selling expenses.Growing external costs, increased compensation expenses and higher discretionary spending are expected to drive SG&amp;A deleverage. Most industry players expect the trend to continue in the near term, impacting profitability to some extent.Premiumization &amp; Product Diversification: Premiumization has been a key growth driver for players in the alcohol space due to consumers' continued desires for refreshing and newer tastes. Many beverage companies are diversifying their product offerings to capture more sales. Alcohol companies have also been witnessing robust demand trends for premium and high-end products.As a result, the companies focused on innovation and portfolio premiumization stand to gain from today's market. Players have been exploring opportunities beyond the traditional beer, whiskey, spirits and wine categories. Some popular variations, which have gained traction, include RTD spirits like canned wine and cocktails, hard seltzers, cider, and flavored malt beverages.To capitalize on the priority and consumer trends, companies have been resorting to innovative products. Notably, RTD has emerged as the fastest-growing alcohol segment. Many companies in the industry have collaborated to grow their shares in the fast-growing RTD category.E-Commerce Development &amp; Pricing Gains: Alcohol companies have been benefiting from the rise of e-commerce, and the recovery across markets and channels, boosting volume. Investments in online and e-commerce portals have gained prominence. Companies have been investing in the latest capabilities, and leveraging technology to better connect with customers and consumers. With a recovery in markets and channels, and the expansion of digital capabilities, players in the alcohol space look well-poised for growth.Additionally, companies have been benefiting from price increases and supply productivity savings, offsetting the effects of cost inflation. Effective marketing and exceptional commercial execution have been boosting the sale of alcohol companies.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Beverages – Alcohol industry is an 18-stock group within the broader Zacks Consumer Staples sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #163.

In Q1, Lucid delivered 1,406 cars and produced 2,314, meaning the company didn't match its prior period’s output. In May, the California-based automaker said it was on track to produce 10,000 EVs in 2023.Lucid’s struggle to meet its expectations comes in contrast to rivals like Rivian and legacy automakers like GM and Ford, which have met or exceeded their EV production targets.""The [deliveries] disclosure was extremely disappointing, as LCID posted a sequential drop in volumes from the 2,314 units it produced and 1,406 units it delivered in Q1,"" CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson wrote in a note today. ""We continue to view LCID as a broken growth story and its ramp-up rate has been particularly disappointing considering its newer, state-of-the-art factory in Casa Grande, Arizona.""Part of the issue is that the Lucid Air, its sole EV, has a price tag that starts around $90,000, which may be hurting demand. In Q1 the company began offering its own version of the federal government’s $7,500 tax credit to boost sales, though that deal has been removed from the company’s website.Lucid also said it began “material shipments” of its EVs to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, where the company has a deal to deliver 100,000 EVs to the kingdom for use by the government. Last month, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, which owns over 60% of the company, agreed to buy 265.7 million additional shares of Lucid worth $1.8 billion. Lucid intends to build a factory in the kingdom with a planned annual capacity of 155K EVs a year.NEW YORK, NY- March 17: Lucid preview's it's new electric car, Lucid Air, at CNBC Nasdaq in New York City on March 17, 2021. Credit: RW/MediaPunch /IPX (RW/MediaPunch/MediaPunch/IPx)It was not all negative news for Lucid last quarter, however, as it struck a ""long-term strategic technology partnership” with British luxury automaker Aston Martin (ARGGY) to supply components and systems to power future Aston Martin EVs.Story continuesA potential revenue stream from selling Lucid IP and components was cheered by investors, with Lucid's CEO Peter Rawlinson claiming that licensing Lucid's tech has ""mouthwatering potential"" and other car companies have approached the EV maker.Lucid said it would release its second quarter financial results after the bell on Monday, August 7.Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The company’s Global Operating Effectiveness (“GOE”) Program holds promise. Its brand strength, increased brand marketing and innovation are yielding. Management is focused on capitalizing on long-term consumer trends, higher digital usage, trusted brands, healthy and flavorful cooking and purpose-inclined practices.The factors mentioned above boosted McCormick’s second-quarter fiscal 2023 results, with the top and the bottom line increasing year over year. Solid results, expectations of solid demand and focus on the cost structure encouraged management to raise its adjusted operating income and earnings per share (EPS) view for fiscal 2023.Let’s delve deeper.Impressive Performance &amp; ViewIn the second quarter of fiscal 2023, McCormick’s adjusted earnings of 60 cents per share increased 25%. The year-over-year increase was a result of elevated adjusted operating income. The company generated sales of $1,659.2 million, up 8%. Constant-currency (cc) sales increased 10% on an 11% growth from pricing actions.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company anticipates fiscal 2023 to witness a solid underlying business performance, backed by sales growth. It expects the GOE Program and the lapping of pandemic-led hurdles to have a positive effect on the fiscal 2023 operating income.For fiscal 2023, net sales are expected to increase 5-7% from the fiscal 2022 levels. Management expects sales growth to be fueled by pricing actions, which, along with cost savings, are likely to help it counter inflationary headwinds. The company anticipates seeing solid growth via brand strength, brand marketing, new products, category management and differentiated customer engagement. The adjusted operating income is likely to grow 10-12%, up from the prior guidance of 9-11% growth. Management envisions fiscal adjusted EPS in the band of $2.60-$2.65 compared with the earlier view of $2.56-$2.61. The bottom-line view suggests growth from $2.53 recorded in fiscal 2022.Story continuesAcquisitions: Key DriverMcCormick is on track with prudent buyouts to fuel growth. In December 2020, the company bought a 100% stake in FONA International, LLC and some of its affiliates. FONA’s diverse portfolio helps McCormick bolster its value-add offerings and expand the flavor solutions segment into attractive categories. In November 2020, McCormick also completed the acquisition of the parent company of Cholula Hot Sauce — a premium Mexico-based hot sauce brand. McCormick believes that the buyout of Cholula accelerates its growth potential across the condiment platform and widens the product portfolio in the hot sauce category.Cost-Saving EffortsMcCormick focuses on saving costs and enhancing productivity through its ongoing Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (CCI) program. Started in 2009, McCormick’s CCI program helped the company to reduce costs and enhance productivity. It has used CCI savings to increase investments, thereby leading to higher sales and profits.The GOE program aims at optimizing the company’s supply chain and cost structure. McCormick expects savings from its GOE program to scale up as fiscal 2023 progresses. It expects savings from the GOE program to have an 800-basis point impact on adjusted operating profit growth in fiscal 2023. Savings from the CCI program are likely to be $85 million in fiscal 2023.Such cost savings and the aforementioned upsides are likely to continue enhancing MKC’s profits in the future.The company’s stock has increased 3% in the past three months against the industry’s 3.2% decline.Other Solid BetsHere we have highlighted other three top-ranked stocks, namely TreeHouse Foods, Inc. THS, Lamb Weston Holdings LW and Celsius Holdings CELH.TreeHouse Foods, a manufacturer of packaged foods and beverages, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Driven by the buoyant air-travel demand scenario, passenger revenues are likely to have moved north. This, in turn, is expected to boost Delta’s performance, when it reports second-quarter 2023 results on Jul 13.Passenger Revenues in Q1: A FlashbackAir-travel demand was strong in the first quarter of 2023. Riding on the rosy scenario, passenger revenues, accounting for 81.6% of total revenues, increased 51% year over year to $10,411 million at DAL.Domestic markets contributed 72.9% to total passenger revenues.

Our estimate indicates a 5.6% increase from the second-quarter 2022 actuals.Driven by the uptick, DAL’s management expects operating margin for the second quarter to be 16%. Load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) is also likely to have been impressive in the June quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for load factor is pegged at 86%, higher than 85% reported in second-quarter 2022.Backed by strong passenger revenues, management now estimates adjusted earnings per share to be between $2.25 and $2.50 for the quarter under review. The earlier projection was in the range of $2-$2.25. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $2.42.Overall Top &amp; Bottom-Line ProjectionsMainly owing to buoyant passenger revenues, the consensus mark for quarterly sales is presently pegged at $15.01 billion, implying an 8.57% increase from second-quarter 2022 reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings currently hints at an increase of 68.06% from second-quarter 2022 levels.Story continuesOur TakeHigh passenger revenues coupled with low fuel costs (oil price declined 6.6% in the Apr-Jun period) are likely to aid Delta’s results when it kicks off the second-quarter earnings season for airlines.Apart from Delta, we expect the above tailwinds to have aided performances of fellow airline players like United Airlines UAL and American Airlines AAL. While United Airlines is scheduled to report second-quarter 2023 results on Jul 19, American Airlines will release the same on Jul 20. Each stock is currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

If you are not interested in reading the details, head straight to the 5 Most Hated Brands in the World.Starting a business in the US is the first step in building a global brand since it is a land of opportunities, where anyone with a great idea, the drive to succeed, and a willingness to work hard can prosper. Some well-known brands that originated in the United States and have now gone global include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), The Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT). Brands offer the innovations, concepts, and solutions that customers demand. In addition, they also contribute to the economy by generating wealth and income, paying taxes, supporting services, and making jobs available to the active population of a country.Although businesses and brands make our lives easier, there are a number of negative aspects to them, which is why some people have such a strong disdain or even hatred for them. Don’t Miss: 15 Most Hated Companies in America last year.Americans believe businesses are performing below expectations in various areas, according to a Bentley-Gallup Force for Good survey. 53% of Americans, who participated in the study, said that businesses generally have a negative impact on the environment. For large businesses, this number increased to 65%. Americans also believe that businesses are failing in the area of pay disparity. 82% of respondents said that it is crucial to treat all workers fairly and 72% agreed that they would be ready to pay more for a product from a company that treats its employees well. Moreover, the study also found that 55% of American workers, including 71% of those aged 18 to 29, would switch jobs to work for a company that had a greater beneficial impact on the globe.In a similar vein, Millennials' tolerance for large companies declined in 2019. According to a Deloitte Millennial Survey, fewer Millennials (from 76% in 2017 to 55% in 2019) agreed that business had a beneficial impact on society. Additionally, 26% of Millennials expressed no faith in corporate executives.Story continuesMost Loved and Successful Brands Have the Most HatersMany experts believe that if you want to be great, you must be prepared to face hatred. So, it should come as no surprise that some of the most admired brands in the world are also some of the most despised. Moreover, this hatred toward a brand isn't always detrimental to its financial standing. For instance, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has faced significant backlash following the announcement of 27,000 layoffs since November 2022. Nevertheless, the e-commerce behemoth, which has a large product range, a user-friendly website, is simple to use, and offers quick and dependable shipping, is still one of the most loved and trusted brands by customers. 89% of consumers think that they are more inclined to purchase things from Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) than from any other e-commerce websites.Similarly, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) appears to be loved and despised by people everywhere. Many hate it due to privacy concerns, but more than 77% of Internet users are active on at least one of its platforms. This clearly shows how successful the brand is.Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), one of the largest retailers in the world, is yet another example of a brand that people claim to dislike, but it continues to be profitable every year. It is accused of treating its employees unfairly. Furthermore, critics argue that the big-box giant has swooped in many places and destroyed local small businesses, leaving customers no other options. We believe that success of its business model is much to blame for that.It's easy to understand why brands people dislike persist. If there are significant benefits, customers will stick with a brand they don't like. Many customer decisions are heavily influenced by elements like price, convenience, and easy availability. For example, if a better airline cannot provide equal availability and affordability, consumers will continue to fly with the airline they dislike.Therefore, it is crucial to keep in mind that just because a brand is listed in this article as one of the most despised brands in the world, it doesn't automatically mean that it is no longer significant. This brand had to be on the list even though more people love it than hate it because we were focusing on the latter criteria.With these considerations in mind, let's look at the most hated brands in the world.20 Most Hated Brands in the WorldMilles Studio/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyWe used reputable sources for our rankings of the most hated brands in the world, including the 2023 Axios Harris Poll, 24/7 Wall Street, Business Insider, and USA Today. In addition, we took into account a number of online reviews and customer survey platforms. We assigned scores to each brand based on the number of mentions, so each time a brand was mentioned, it received a score of 1. Consequently, the more mentions and references, the higher the score and rank in our article. Basically, this list of the most hated brands in the world doesn't reflect our opinion but the consensus opinion of various sources.So, without further ado, let's examine the most hated brands in the world that must work very hard to regain the faith of their customers.Most Hated Brands in the World20. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), as reported in one of articles earlier, is one of the top drug companies in the world by revenue. It headquartered in New Brunswick, New Jersey.The company came under intense criticism following many lawsuits that claim its baby powder causes ovarian cancer. However, the pharmaceutical giant agreed to pay $8.9 billion in April 2023 to settle all cancer lawsuits related to its talc-based powders.19. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), with around 232.5 million subscribers, is a streaming service that offers a wide variety of award-winning TV shows, movies, anime, documentaries, and more on thousands of internet-connected devices.Although the streaming service continues to be a favorite among many, it recently attracted public criticism for only allowing members of the same household to share passwords, with outside users having to pay an extra $7.99 per month. However, we don't think that Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)’s inclusion on our list of the most hated brands in the world will have a negative impact on its reputation.18. Navient Corporation (NASDAQ:NAVI)Navient Corporation (NASDAQ:NAVI), one of the most hated brands in the world on our list, is an American student loan servicer based in Wilmington, Delaware.People despise the company because it takes advantage of borrowers by disregarding concerns, providing false information, processing payments improperly, and directing borrowers to more expensive repayment plans. Between November 2016 and January 2017, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau claims receiving over 1,500 consumer complaints about the company.A $1.85 billion settlement was reached between 39 states and Navient Corporation (NASDAQ:NAVI) last year on claims that the company used unfair and deceptive loan practices.17. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), with 32,800 employees as of 2022, primarily offers taxi services, allowing customers to hail a taxi through a mobile app.The company is disliked for its surge pricing as well as the negative effects of gig work replacing secure employment. Moreover, it is also disliked for causing disruption to the taxi industry and aggravating traffic congestion.However, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) offers several benefits, such as door-to-door convenience, safety, and dependable quality, thus we don't believe it deserves to be one of the most hated brands in the world.16. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), as reported in one our articles earlier, is one of the largest banks in the US by asset size.The bank earned the ire of general public when common people lost their homes, their jobs and their savings during the 2008 recession. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) agreed to pay $5.06 billion in 2016 to resolve charges that it mislead mortgage bond investors during the financial crisis.Furthermore, it has also received criticism from its employees. A 2021 poll of 13 first-year analysts at Goldman Sachs found that they were subjected to extremely long work hours, deadline pressure, and harsh behavior from superiors, which deteriorates their personal lives.15. The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI)The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI), with 71,300 employees as of 2022, engages in the provision of global health services. Forbes claims that state regulators get more consumer complaints about the company's health insurance than the national average. Based on ratings from the National Committee for Quality Assurance, it receives an average of 3.3 out of 5 stars.Moreover, the Guardian reported in 2021 that the company's call center employees complained about unfavorable working conditions. High demands for output, the risk of losing one's job, lack of training, and lengthy processing timeframes for consumers seeking reimbursement for Covid-19 testing expenses were the driving forces behind this.14. Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC)Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC), engaged in the provision of banking, insurance, investments, mortgage, and consumer and commercial finance, is headquartered in San Francisco, California. The bank received a lot of criticism in 2016 when it became known that its staff had been engaging in illicit practices for years. These included activities like overcharging clients, creating fake accounts, and unlawfully repossessing cars and homes.13. Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD)Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD), headquartered in Menlo Park, California, is an online discount brokerage that offers a commission-free investing and trading platform.The company was at the center of the short squeeze saga between retail investors and hedge funds in early 2021, resulting in losses worth billions to hedge funds. Despite the benefits enjoyed by retail traders on the platform, like no-fee trading, users on internet platform Reddit, many of whom are retail traders, accused the company of bias towards big finance. The platform halted trading in volatile stocks like GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AMC), favored by retail traders, at the height of the short squeeze drama. In July 2021, the firm was fined $70 million by authorities in the US for operational and regulatory lapses.12. United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL)United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL), founded in 1926, is an American international airline serving North America, Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean, and Europe.The airline, one of the most disliked brands on our list, has previously dealt with widely reported instances of poor customer service, including events in which staff members injured clients, threatened them, and mistreated their pets.United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL) faced a turbulent public reaction over its treatment of a passenger who was forcibly hauled out of his seat and off the plane, with blood streaming down his face, after the airline stated it needed ""volunteers"" to give up their seats for employees.11. Equifax Inc. (NYSE:EFX)Equifax Inc. (NYSE:EFX), headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, is a credit bureau that collects information about an individual's credit history to create a credit report.Given that it failed to secure the enormous amount of personal information stored on its network, which resulted in a data breach in 2017 that exposed millions of names and dates of birth, Social Security numbers, physical addresses, and other personal information that could result in identity theft and fraud, the general public is less forgiving of Equifax Inc. (NYSE:EFX).10. BitcoinBitcoin, introduced to the public in 2009, is a decentralized digital currency that you can buy, sell and exchange directly, without an intermediary like a bank.Bitcoin has drawn criticism for its high volatility and lack of regulation. In addition, it is also harmful to the environment. The University of Cambridge estimates that since its launch, Bitcoin has released 200 million tons of carbon dioxide.However, it is viewed by some, especially in the developing world, as a safe haven amid economic storms, despite being disliked for its volatility. In September 2021, El Salvador became the first nation to recognize Bitcoin as a legal tender, followed by the Central African Republic last year.9. FTXFTX, formerly one of the leading crypto exchanges in the world, filed for bankruptcy on November 11, 2022. US crypto investors sued the company in November last year, alleging that its top executives stole their digital assets and purposely blocked them from making withdrawals. Users of the platform also claim they received scam messages asking for their account details on FTX. In some instances, the founder of the firm, Sam Bankman-Fried, was featured in a deep fake video claiming to double customer crypto compensation.8. BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP)BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP), headquartered in London, is a British multinational oil and gas company. The firm has faced criticism for lowering its climate targets and increasing its investments in oil and gas. The energy giant has lowered its initial objective of a 35%-40% reduction in carbon emissions to a target of 20%-30%.Furthermore, BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP) is also remembered for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill disaster.7. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA)Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is one of the largest telecommunications companies in the world, as we previously reported in an article. Federal officials fined the company $2.3 million in 2016 for billing customers with unnecessary services and hidden fees. According to the Consumer Reports National Research Center’s 2013 annual telecom survey, the company ranked 15th out of 17 television service providers. Consumers gave it extremely low ratings for customer service and value for the money.6. TikTokTikTok, owned by Chinese technology company ByteDance, is a video-sharing app that allows users to create and share short-form videos on any topic.As concerns over privacy and cybersecurity increase, an increasing number of governments have banned this app from devices provided to employees.

The top line is likely to have been aided by a solid recovery of air-travel demand (post the pandemic-led slump). Per our estimates, total passenger revenues are likely to increase 17.3% in second-quarter 2023 from second-quarter 2022 actuals.Driven by solid demand, management expects total revenues to grow 14-16% year over year. Notably, higher capacity in the quarter under review is likely to have contributed to UAL’s top-line performance. As a result, United Airlines expects its capacity to improve by almost 18.5% from the year-ago reported figure.On the flip side, high fuel costs per gallon are likely to have hurt the bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter. The fuel price has come down from the highs witnessed earlier, yet it remains at an elevated level. UAL forecasts the average aircraft fuel price per gallon in the $2.80-$3.00 band. Our estimate is currently pegged at 2.83 per gallon.United Airlines anticipates earnings per share to be between $3.50 and $4.00. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $4.07.United Airlines Holdings Inc Price and EPS SurpriseUnited Airlines Holdings Inc Price and EPS SurpriseUnited Airlines Holdings Inc price-eps-surprise | United Airlines Holdings Inc QuoteWhat Our Model SaysOur proven model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for United Airlines this time around.

222,732f110f-e2c3-3543-817b-b945b87434b8,UAL,2023-07-13,United Airlines (UAL) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-airlines-ual-reports-next-140042997.html,1689170442,STORY,['UAL'],"[United Airlines (UAL) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 19. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis airline is expected to post quarterly earnings of $4.07 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +184.6%.Revenues are expected to be $13.94 billion, up 15.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.03% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for United?For United, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.54%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that United will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that United would post a loss of $0.73 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.63, delivering a surprise of +13.70%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.United appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Its revenues and earnings in the quarter are expected to have declined on a year-over-year basis.In the first quarter of 2023, Schwab’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results benefited from higher rates, which led to a rise in net interest income. Also, the absence of fee waivers and solid brokerage account numbers acted as tailwinds. However, higher expenses created a headwind.The company has an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three and missed in one of the trailing four quarters.The Charles Schwab Corporation Price and EPS Surprise The Charles Schwab Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseThe Charles Schwab Corporation price-eps-surprise | The Charles Schwab Corporation QuoteSchwab’s activities in the to-be-reported quarter did not encourage analysts to revise earnings estimates upward. In the past seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for SCHW’s second-quarter earnings has been revised 2.6% lower to 74 cents per share. The estimate indicates a decline of 23.7% from the year-ago quarter’s reported number. Our estimate for second-quarter earnings is pinned at 87 cents.The consensus estimate for sales is pegged at $4.61 billion, which indicates a fall of 9.6% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. Our estimate for total revenues is $4.59 billion, indicating a year-over-year decline of 10%.SCHW also expects second-quarter revenues to witness a year-over-year decline of 10-11% because of margin compression, a smaller interest-earning asset base and softer trading activity.Before we take a look at what our quantitative model predicts, let’s check the factors that are likely to have impacted Schwab’s second-quarter performance.Key Factors &amp; Estimates for Q2Market volatility and client activity were subdued in the second quarter due to the Congressional debate over the debt ceiling. Also, the risks of an economic downturn/recession, the central banks’ hawkish monetary policy stance to stem out “sticky” inflation and geopolitical concerns led to ambiguity among investors.These factors resulted in lower volatility in equity markets and other asset classes, including commodities, bonds and foreign exchange.While investors did seem somewhat interested in entering the markets (in April and May, SCHW opened 331,000 and 314,000 new brokerage accounts, respectively), Schwab’s trading performance is expected to have been impacted because of lower volatility and subdued client activity.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter trading revenues is pegged at $800 million, which suggests a decline of 9.6% from the prior-year quarter’s reported number. Our estimate for trading revenues is pinned at $733.7 million, indicating a decline of 17.1%.The consensus estimate for asset management and administration fees of $1.15 billion implies a rise of 9.3% from the prior-year quarter’s reported number.Then, the consensus estimate for average interest-earning assets for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $506 billion, which suggests a decline of 18.9% from the prior-year quarter’s reported level.While the Federal Reserve continued to tighten its monetary policy in the second quarter, raising interest rates by another 25 basis points, SCHW’s interest income is not expected to have improved much because of weaker loan demand. Moreover, the inversion of the yield curve and rising funding costs are expected to have weighed on net interest margin (NIM) to some extent.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter net interest revenues is pegged at $2.35 billion, which indicates a year-over-year decline of 7.8%.SCHW’s chief financial officer, Peter Crawford, said that the company’s second-quarter NIM is expected to contract 35 basis points sequentially.Coming to expenses, Schwab’s operating expenses have been elevated in the past few quarters. Due to the persistent regulatory spending and strategic buyouts to drive efficiency, overall expenses are expected to have been high in the to-be-reported quarter. We project total expenses of $2.55 billion.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsAccording to our quantitative model, the chances of Schwab beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings this time are low. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: The Earnings ESP for Schwab is -2.39%.Zacks Rank: The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Stocks Worth a LookA few finance stocks, which you may want to consider, as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases per our model, are Wells Fargo WFC and PNC Financial PNC.The Earnings ESP for Wells Fargo is +0.16% and it carries a Zacks Rank #3 at present.

225,267316e2-c079-31cc-b88f-953ae2fa62d1,PNC,2023-07-13,U.S. Bancorp (USB) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-bancorp-usb-reports-next-140035350.html,1689170435,STORY,"['USB', 'PNC']","[U.S. Bancorp (USB) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 19, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.13 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +3.7%.Revenues are expected to be $7.15 billion, up 19.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 7.73% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for U.S. Bancorp?For U.S. Bancorp, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.39%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that U.S. Bancorp will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that U.S. Bancorp would post earnings of $1.13 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.16, delivering a surprise of +2.65%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.U.S. Bancorp appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc (PNC), is soon expected to post earnings of $3.31 per share for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -3.2%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $5.43 billion, up 6.1% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc has been revised 1.3% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, reflecting an equal Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

226,9299e543-3395-328c-a70a-5e35e77b67e3,PNC,2023-07-13,4 Stocks to Watch on Dividend Hikes Amid Market Uncertainty,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-stocks-watch-dividend-hikes-121900826.html,1689164340,STORY,"['PNC', 'OZK', 'WOR']","[Investors are keenly waiting for the June inflation numbers. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) reading, which is the most accepted gauge for inflation, will be released today. Wall Street expects headline inflation to cool down further, with a forecast of 3.1% year over year.Meanwhile, major indices like the S&amp;P 500, the Nasdaq and the Dow have posted positive returns of 15.6%, 31.5% and 3.4%, respectively, so far this year.Though inflation is gradually moving downward, the Federal Reserve’s ambitious target of 2% long-term inflation looks distant. After a pause in June from the aggressive rate hike cycle, which began in January 2022, the Fed will probably hike the overnight interest rate by a quarter basis point in its upcoming policy meeting this month.Currently, the interest rate is in the range of 5-5.25%, the highest since January 2007. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell hinted at two more quarter-basis-point hikes this year to tame sticky inflation. Possibilities of such a move are validated after last week's jobs data presented a strong labor market with low unemployment and high wage rates. The payroll for the month of June climbed by 209,000 while the unemployment rate fell to 3.6% and average hourly wages rose by 4.4%.Prudent investors looking for regular income and capital preservation in such adverse economic conditions can invest in dividend stocks. Due to their well-established businesses, these companies pay out regular dividends and remain profitable due to their proven business models. Companies that tend to reward investors with a high dividend payout outperform non-dividend-paying stocks during market volatility.On that note, let us look at companies like Lindsay LNN, Bank OZK OZK,The PNC Financial Services Group PNC and Worthington Industries WOR that have lately hiked their dividend payouts.Lindsay is an Irrigation and Infrastructure company.

227,5ea6082e-cc8d-3fa0-a65e-2174d6480ccd,TGT,2023-07-13,25 Top-Selling Beers in America,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/25-top-selling-beers-america-040529506.html,1689221129,STORY,"['BUD', 'TGT', 'SAM']","[In this article, we are going to discuss the 25 top-selling brands in America. You can skip our detailed analysis of the beer industry in the U.S., the largest beer producer in the world, the Bud Light Controversy and the new opportunities in the U.S. beer market, and go directly to 10 Top-Selling Beers in America. Considering the value the ancient Egyptians placed on enjoying life, it comes as no surprise that they are known as the first civilization to have perfected the art of brewing. In fact, the Egyptians were so good at it that their fame eclipsed the actual inventors of the process, the Sumerians of Mesopotamia. In ancient Egypt, beer was so essential that it was principally treated as a staple food, as it provided a source of nutrition and hydration to the population, especially for those working in the fields along the Nile.  Women were the first brewers in ancient Egypt, and the early feminine influence in brewing is perhaps also indicated in the deity who presided over the craft – Tjenenet, believed to have been the Egyptian patron goddess of beer and brewing. Beer Industry in the U.S.With 28.2 gallons per capita, beer was the most consumed alcoholic drink in America in 2022. According to the Beer Institute, the beer industry supported more than 2.4 million local jobs in 2022 and contributed around $409 billion to the national economy – equivalent to 1.6% of GDP. The industry also paid more than $132 billion in wages and contributed $63.8 in taxes to the national exchequer. Largest Beer Producer in the World: Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) is a Belgian multinational brewing company with the largest beer output in the world. The company, through its various brands spread around in every continent, produced 581.7 million hectoliters of beer in 2021, or a 31.3% share of the entire global market. Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) was formed after InBev acquired the American company Anheuser Busch in 2008, in a deal valued at about $52 billion in cash, or $70 per share. Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) had a revenue of $57.7 billion in 2022, with around $6 billion in net profits. Story continuesThe Bud Light Controversy: Bud Light, which held the top spot as the best selling beer in 2022, with a 12.6% market share, has seen sales drop after a backlash from conservatives over a social media campaign involving the transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney. The stock price of the Bud Light maker,  Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD), collapsed from $65.9 on May 4th to $53.4 on May 31st, a decrease of almost 19% in less than a month. Following a boycott from their more conservative consumer segments, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) announced that the two executives behind the promotional campaign were taking a leave, which sparked another backlash, but this time from the LGBTQ+ community. Last year, the Human Rights Campaign Foundation gave Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) a top rating for LGBTQ+ equality, but because of how the company handled the crisis, it’s now off the list. Such boycotts don’t usually last very long, but this one seems to be more permanent than originally anticipated. Sales of Bud Light and Budweiser dropped 28% and 11.7% respectively, as compared to the same period last year. Other Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) brands like Natural Light and Michelob Ultra also took a hit and witnessed a decrease in sales. Several U.S. retailers have recently faced backlash from conservatives over the sale of LGBTQ+ merchandise. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) has sold Pride-themed merchandise in its outlets for years, but the company said last month that it was making certain ‘adjustments’ to its LGBTQ+ themed products, citing increased confrontation between shoppers and employees and incidents of products being thrown on the floor. Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT)’s move to pull some of its Pride merchandise, as a result of the backlash, was labeled ‘wrong’ by the New York Attorney Journal Laetitia James, in a tweet on June 14th. Department store chain Kohl’s Corporation (NYSE:KSS) also faced a similar pushback for carrying Pride-related products. Such controversies entail that the U.S. companies will now have to tread carefully and plan out their PR strategies with utmost caution, in order to keep both their conservative and liberal customer bases happy. New Opportunities in the U.S. Beer Market:The aforementioned controversy seems to have created new opportunities in the American beer market, with former Bud consumers now looking elsewhere to satisfy their taste buds. The import beer industry seems to have benefited from this and Modelo Especial, by Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ), has officially dethroned Bud Light as the top-selling beer in America. Modelo Especial was the top-selling beer brand for the four weeks ended July 1st, with an 8.7% share of the overall beer sales in retail stores in the period, with Bud Light coming in at second with a 7% share. According to the Brewer’s Association, the import beer category had a 22.2% share in the total U.S. beer sales volume in 2022, an increase of 2.8% from the previous year. If you’re also looking to try out imported beers that wouldn’t put too big a dent in your wallet, please refer to 22 Cheap Imported Beer Brands Targeting Budweiser’s Market Share. With that said, here is our List of Top-Selling Beers in the US. 25 Top-Selling Beers in AmericaSyda Productions/Shutterstock.comMethodology:To collect data for this article, we have referred to the Information Resources Inc.

That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is expected to post earnings of $1.32 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.The consensus earnings estimate of $5.47 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +16.9%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.35 indicates a change of +16.2% from what Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Intuitive Surgical, Inc.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Intuitive Surgical, Inc. the consensus sales estimate of $1.73 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +13.8%. The $7.11 billion and $8.06 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +14.3% and +13.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryIntuitive Surgical, Inc. reported revenues of $1.7 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14%. EPS of $1.23 for the same period compares with $1.13 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.59 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.88%. The EPS surprise was +3.36%.Over the last four quarters, Intuitive Surgical, Inc. surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Intuitive Surgical, Inc. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Yahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley breaks down why Nvidia is interested in Arm and what the potential investment could mean for both companies. Howley also discusses a federal judge rejecting the FTC's request for an injunction in the Microsoft-Activision Blizzard acquisition.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]- Welcome back. We're watching shares of NVIDIA today after the Financial Times reported British chip designer Arm is planning to bring the tech giant as an anchor investor ahead of its IPO. NVIDIA declined a Yahoo Finance request for comment.Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley joins us with the details here. All right, so help us flesh this one out a little bit more, Dan.DAN HOWLEY: Yeah, that's right, Brad. You might remember a while back NVIDIA wanted to actually purchase Arm, but there was a whole bunch of pushback from Arm customers as well as an FTC lawsuit. And so they kind of just backed away from that. And so now this is a chance for them to essentially get in on the ground floor of an IPO in New York. And to kind of have a say over where-- not a say, but a position at the table when it comes to Arm.Now just to put this all in perspective in what Arm means. They're basically in every smartphone you can think of. Their designs are used by companies ranging from Apple to Samsung, as far as smartphone makers go. Those companies then kind of reconfigure the designs to be their own.They're also in smartwatches. We're seeing them in more devices. They're going towards more PCs. Increasingly, there's discussion of whether or not this is kind of AI kind of company. It's not going to be an NVIDIA as far as that goes.But why NVIDIA is interested, or was interested, in Arm is because they need CPUs. They do put out a CPU GPU combo product, but NVIDIA is all about GPUs. GPUs drive AI. But to power those GPUs, you also need CPUs. NVIDIA getting a seat at the table when it comes to Arm, as a public company, would be important just because it would allow them to see what's going on as far as CPUs go and then be able to plan accordingly.Story continuesSo this could be a big move for them. But as you said, they declined to comment. So we can't really go much further as far as speculating goes just because they won't tell us what they want.- I mean, it's really interesting, though, too because reportedly, according to that Financial Times report, the valuation at which NVIDIA would invest would be much lower than the valuation that SoftBank wants for Arm, right. That's, I guess, says something about the market appetite as well.DAN HOWLEY: Yeah, and Masayoshi Son cannot be happy about that. That's SoftBank's investment fund had taken a beating as far as the bunch of startups that they had invested in. And so this kind of is seen as a way to win some of those billions back. But yeah, not coming in near where they want.The valuation for Arm is kind of all over the place, at this point, by billions of dollars. So it's not exactly a definitive, we know how much this is going to go out for. But yeah, I do think that it's been an important company for the tech industry for so, so long.Most people don't know what Arm is though. They know what a company like TSMC is, they know what a-- well, maybe they do. They know what Intel is, that's for sure, and they know what NVIDIA is and AMD.But Arm really is an incredibly important company when it comes to the tech industry. It cannot be overstated how important this company is. And so seeing NVIDIA latch on to-- potentially latch on to, according to this report, to the IPO would be really interesting to see.- Yes, it would. Speaking of very important for the tech industry, Microsoft got a big win in court yesterday, of course. With, basically, a judge saying that it's not going to accept the FTC's request to block that acquisition. What's sort of the read through here? We have seen so much commentary here about what this means for the bigger landscape as well.DAN HOWLEY: So just-- it's a confusing kind of issue here. The judge was basically stopping the FTC from trying to block Microsoft from closing the acquisition on July 18th. If they didn't meet that deadline, they would have to pay a $3 billion breakup fee, or renegotiate the deal with Activision Blizzard.It doesn't necessarily mean, though, that the FTC is giving up on its antitrust suit against Microsoft and the deal. So it's not exactly finalized in the US yet. But most experts are saying, look, they lost here. Chances are, they're probably not going to be able to win as far as stopping the deal overall.So that aside, Microsoft and Activision still have to continue negotiating with the UK and their antitrust enforcer, their market's competition agency, and kind of figure out how they can make the deal happen there.If it does, what does this mean for Microsoft and the broader gaming landscape? It's a huge win for Microsoft. They would have one of the largest developers for gaming out there, with one of the largest games, Call of Duty. That's a huge win for them on the console front as well as the PC front.The bigger news and the future news is the mobile gaming side of things. Don't forget, Activision Blizzard also has King, which has Candy Crush and all those other different mobile games that make tons of cash. Microsoft doesn't really have much. Although, if you ask my wife, they certainly do. And the fact that I play the very old Solitaire game on my iPhone, which is from Microsoft. But I digress.They don't have very much as far as mobile gaming goes. Then there's also the cloud gaming side of things. That would also be a huge boon for them. They would be able to put these kind of Activision Blizzard properties on their Game Pass service. And then as the cloud gaming starts to pick up, they could put them on more mobile devices. So it's a mobile play and it'll definitely play out, both ways.- I'm a Minesweeper girl myself. Thanks so much, Dan, appreciate it.]"

Regulators previously barred Nvidia from acquiring Arm.Video Transcript- There's a big discussion now and big implications for what's going to happen with tech dealmaking. There's one deal that got rejected last year. Nvidia was trying to buy Arm. Now, according to the Financial Times, Nvidia is reportedly holding talks with Arm, the British chip designer, to perhaps be an anchor investor on Arm's IPO.Arm now controlled by SoftBank, which has been planning to spin it out in an IPO. And there's now this talk of anchor investors who might take a big stake in the company as part of that initial public offering. And it is interesting given Nvidia's history here of trying to outright buy Arm, and then getting rejected by regulators.- Yeah, and there's a long history of companies who if they don't feel like there's a pathway for them to be able to acquire a company, to have that type of either anchor position or some type of outsized shareholder or stakeholder position in a company that's getting ready to go public, even if they do play in the same space. I think back to when Trivago went public even, Expedia was one of the major shareholders in that company at the time of their IPO.You can look at some of the other examples, especially within the ERP landscape where there have been either early angel investments-- I think back to none other than salesforce.com. When they went public, of course Marc Benioff, given his position that he had had previously at Oracle and the relationship with Larry Ellison, Larry Ellison was a major investor in Salesforce, as well. And so there are all these different examples, and this could perhaps be one of the latest where in the face of regulators pushing back on a deal being able to go through where there would be a stakeholder position that's taken on in the advancement of an IPO as well, and entry into the public market.- I should mention, I reached out to Nvidia for a comment and did not hear back. Just one other quick note about the Financial Times report is that at the amount in which Nvidia would invest, it would value Arm at $35 billion to $40 billion, which $40 billion is originally what it was going to buy the company overall for. SoftBank was hoping for a valuation of about double that. So we'll see what ends up happening.- We will indeed.]"

Several Federal Reserve members are expected to speak today, including Fed presidents Tom Barkin, Raphael Bostic, and Loretta Mester. In tech, the FTC is leaning toward appealing a ruling in Microsoft's Activision Blizzard acquisition, according to a report from Bloomberg. Chip designer Arm is in talks with Nvidia to join a group of investors to anchor its IPO, according to a report from the Financial Times. Yahoo Finance Live takes a look at some of the top stories of the day.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: And here are three things you need to know this morning. First up for sure, inflation is cooling. June CPI report showing price pressure moderating broadly. The annual headline rate slowing to 3% from last month's 4% reading. And that sticky core number also slowing to 4.8%, which is a bigger slowdown than forecast and a key data point for the Federal Reserve.The reading could mark a turning point for policymakers, especially after recent Fed minutes showed an FOMC perhaps more divided than expected. The Central Bank still widely seen raising rates again at the end of the month. But what happens after that is in question. It's a good day for fedspeak and there is lots of it. Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin. Minneapolis' Neel Kashkari, Atlanta's Raphael Bostic, and Cleveland's Loretta Mester, all of them are talking at separate events throughout the day.Bostic has advocated for a wait and see approach on the next move. Mester's tone has been notably more hawkish in recent weeks. She's repeated that more hikes are needed to bring inflation back down to the 2% target. And if all that wasn't enough, 2 PM Eastern sees the release of the Fed's Beige Book, a key survey of economic conditions.And there are lots of tech moves to digest as well. According to Bloomberg, the FTC is leaning toward appealing a ruling against its bid to block Microsoft's $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. Separately, the Financial Times reporting that SoftBank-backed chip designer Arm is in talks with Nvidia for Nvidia to join a group of investors to anchor its IPO. Last year, regulators struck down Nvidia's planned acquisition of the company on competition grounds. It would have been worth over $60 billion.]"

If you are not interested in reading the details, head straight to the 5 Most Hated Brands in the World.Starting a business in the US is the first step in building a global brand since it is a land of opportunities, where anyone with a great idea, the drive to succeed, and a willingness to work hard can prosper. Some well-known brands that originated in the United States and have now gone global include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), The Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT). Brands offer the innovations, concepts, and solutions that customers demand. In addition, they also contribute to the economy by generating wealth and income, paying taxes, supporting services, and making jobs available to the active population of a country.Although businesses and brands make our lives easier, there are a number of negative aspects to them, which is why some people have such a strong disdain or even hatred for them. Don’t Miss: 15 Most Hated Companies in America last year.Americans believe businesses are performing below expectations in various areas, according to a Bentley-Gallup Force for Good survey. 53% of Americans, who participated in the study, said that businesses generally have a negative impact on the environment. For large businesses, this number increased to 65%. Americans also believe that businesses are failing in the area of pay disparity. 82% of respondents said that it is crucial to treat all workers fairly and 72% agreed that they would be ready to pay more for a product from a company that treats its employees well. Moreover, the study also found that 55% of American workers, including 71% of those aged 18 to 29, would switch jobs to work for a company that had a greater beneficial impact on the globe.In a similar vein, Millennials' tolerance for large companies declined in 2019. According to a Deloitte Millennial Survey, fewer Millennials (from 76% in 2017 to 55% in 2019) agreed that business had a beneficial impact on society. Additionally, 26% of Millennials expressed no faith in corporate executives.Story continuesMost Loved and Successful Brands Have the Most HatersMany experts believe that if you want to be great, you must be prepared to face hatred. So, it should come as no surprise that some of the most admired brands in the world are also some of the most despised. Moreover, this hatred toward a brand isn't always detrimental to its financial standing. For instance, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has faced significant backlash following the announcement of 27,000 layoffs since November 2022. Nevertheless, the e-commerce behemoth, which has a large product range, a user-friendly website, is simple to use, and offers quick and dependable shipping, is still one of the most loved and trusted brands by customers. 89% of consumers think that they are more inclined to purchase things from Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) than from any other e-commerce websites.Similarly, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) appears to be loved and despised by people everywhere. Many hate it due to privacy concerns, but more than 77% of Internet users are active on at least one of its platforms. This clearly shows how successful the brand is.Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), one of the largest retailers in the world, is yet another example of a brand that people claim to dislike, but it continues to be profitable every year. It is accused of treating its employees unfairly. Furthermore, critics argue that the big-box giant has swooped in many places and destroyed local small businesses, leaving customers no other options. We believe that success of its business model is much to blame for that.It's easy to understand why brands people dislike persist. If there are significant benefits, customers will stick with a brand they don't like. Many customer decisions are heavily influenced by elements like price, convenience, and easy availability. For example, if a better airline cannot provide equal availability and affordability, consumers will continue to fly with the airline they dislike.Therefore, it is crucial to keep in mind that just because a brand is listed in this article as one of the most despised brands in the world, it doesn't automatically mean that it is no longer significant. This brand had to be on the list even though more people love it than hate it because we were focusing on the latter criteria.With these considerations in mind, let's look at the most hated brands in the world.20 Most Hated Brands in the WorldMilles Studio/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyWe used reputable sources for our rankings of the most hated brands in the world, including the 2023 Axios Harris Poll, 24/7 Wall Street, Business Insider, and USA Today. In addition, we took into account a number of online reviews and customer survey platforms. We assigned scores to each brand based on the number of mentions, so each time a brand was mentioned, it received a score of 1. Consequently, the more mentions and references, the higher the score and rank in our article. Basically, this list of the most hated brands in the world doesn't reflect our opinion but the consensus opinion of various sources.So, without further ado, let's examine the most hated brands in the world that must work very hard to regain the faith of their customers.Most Hated Brands in the World20. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), as reported in one of articles earlier, is one of the top drug companies in the world by revenue. It headquartered in New Brunswick, New Jersey.The company came under intense criticism following many lawsuits that claim its baby powder causes ovarian cancer. However, the pharmaceutical giant agreed to pay $8.9 billion in April 2023 to settle all cancer lawsuits related to its talc-based powders.19. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), with around 232.5 million subscribers, is a streaming service that offers a wide variety of award-winning TV shows, movies, anime, documentaries, and more on thousands of internet-connected devices.Although the streaming service continues to be a favorite among many, it recently attracted public criticism for only allowing members of the same household to share passwords, with outside users having to pay an extra $7.99 per month. However, we don't think that Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)’s inclusion on our list of the most hated brands in the world will have a negative impact on its reputation.18. Navient Corporation (NASDAQ:NAVI)Navient Corporation (NASDAQ:NAVI), one of the most hated brands in the world on our list, is an American student loan servicer based in Wilmington, Delaware.People despise the company because it takes advantage of borrowers by disregarding concerns, providing false information, processing payments improperly, and directing borrowers to more expensive repayment plans. Between November 2016 and January 2017, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau claims receiving over 1,500 consumer complaints about the company.A $1.85 billion settlement was reached between 39 states and Navient Corporation (NASDAQ:NAVI) last year on claims that the company used unfair and deceptive loan practices.17. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), with 32,800 employees as of 2022, primarily offers taxi services, allowing customers to hail a taxi through a mobile app.The company is disliked for its surge pricing as well as the negative effects of gig work replacing secure employment. Moreover, it is also disliked for causing disruption to the taxi industry and aggravating traffic congestion.However, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) offers several benefits, such as door-to-door convenience, safety, and dependable quality, thus we don't believe it deserves to be one of the most hated brands in the world.16. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), as reported in one our articles earlier, is one of the largest banks in the US by asset size.The bank earned the ire of general public when common people lost their homes, their jobs and their savings during the 2008 recession. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) agreed to pay $5.06 billion in 2016 to resolve charges that it mislead mortgage bond investors during the financial crisis.Furthermore, it has also received criticism from its employees. A 2021 poll of 13 first-year analysts at Goldman Sachs found that they were subjected to extremely long work hours, deadline pressure, and harsh behavior from superiors, which deteriorates their personal lives.15. The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI)The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI), with 71,300 employees as of 2022, engages in the provision of global health services. Forbes claims that state regulators get more consumer complaints about the company's health insurance than the national average. Based on ratings from the National Committee for Quality Assurance, it receives an average of 3.3 out of 5 stars.Moreover, the Guardian reported in 2021 that the company's call center employees complained about unfavorable working conditions. High demands for output, the risk of losing one's job, lack of training, and lengthy processing timeframes for consumers seeking reimbursement for Covid-19 testing expenses were the driving forces behind this.14. Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC)Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC), engaged in the provision of banking, insurance, investments, mortgage, and consumer and commercial finance, is headquartered in San Francisco, California. The bank received a lot of criticism in 2016 when it became known that its staff had been engaging in illicit practices for years. These included activities like overcharging clients, creating fake accounts, and unlawfully repossessing cars and homes.13. Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD)Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD), headquartered in Menlo Park, California, is an online discount brokerage that offers a commission-free investing and trading platform.The company was at the center of the short squeeze saga between retail investors and hedge funds in early 2021, resulting in losses worth billions to hedge funds. Despite the benefits enjoyed by retail traders on the platform, like no-fee trading, users on internet platform Reddit, many of whom are retail traders, accused the company of bias towards big finance.

Zacks Investment Management Client Portfolio Manager Brian Mulberry shares some of his top stock trades with Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptAKIKO FUJITA: Well, the CPI data may have the markets moving today. But it's time to take a longer term look at the potential hotspots for investing in the second half of 2023. To give us his take on what stocks we should be buying right now and the ones to avoid, let's bring in Brian Mulberry, Client Portfolio Manager at Zacks Investment Management.We're going to start with your picks, what you like right now. Vail Resort, specifically, you're looking at the travel space right now. That stock not at the highs-- you know, still below the high of the year. But we have seen consumers, despite some headwinds and concerns about higher prices, shelling out on travel.BRIAN MULBERRY: Yeah, absolutely. It's a way to access the consumer in a slightly different way, where we're seeing the revenge travel trade is still occurring. What we're noticing about Vail in particular is that season pass sales are up about 6%. And they're having a really good recapture rate when it comes to renewing pass holders from last year. And on top of that, they've actually been able to increase prices. So actual sales in dollars are up 11% on that 6% higher season pass sale.So we're looking at a way to take advantage of the consumer spending that has been really durable over the last year. And it's one of the reasons we like Vail. Vail has also done a great job of providing a different menu of passes available and also different destinations. Now, international, we're seeing very strong demand for their resorts in Australia. And there's been some great cross-selling opportunities for consumers internationally to access the US mountains and markets, and then obviously, for US consumers to travel abroad.Story continuesAnd so we're definitely still seeing consumers spend money at a very high rate. And it's one of those ways that we can access this type of a stock at a good price that's still set to continue to grow.SEANA SMITH: But Brian, how should investors be looking at a name like this given the fact that we are still at a risk of recession. There is some signs that the consumer is cracking just a little bit, pulling back on some of their spending. Is a name like Vail, is that going to be able to withstand some of that volatility?BRIAN MULBERRY: We think it is, because there's definitely a big dividing line in the consumer right now. And it's simply this, if you owned your home during the pandemic, you had a once-in-a-generation opportunity to refinance your biggest debt, which is usually your mortgage, on your biggest asset, your home, that appreciated probably 30% to 40% in value. You're able to pay off your cars, your student loans, all these other debts and credit cards. And you now have a much cleaner personal balance sheet.Your personal net income is probably in much better shape than it ever was before. And that lends a little bit more consistency to this consumer spending picture that we're seeing. Unfortunately, if you didn't own your home, those are definitely the consumers that are feeling the pinch of high inflation as well as high interest rates at this point in time.And so we're definitely keeping a close eye on it. We're aware of it. But there is a way to still bet on the consumer. And we think this is one of the ways to do that.AKIKO FUJITA: Another stock you're really hot on, CSX. This is in the rail space. What do you like there?BRIAN MULBERRY: What we're seeing is just a really consistent level of volume, in terms of the rail traffic that they have. They've actually been able to grow by almost 40% in terms of their coal transportation. A lot of that coal is going to produce electricity in other places. And so they've been able to keep up with a really high level of demand. And the execution in the transportation space is one of those things that leads to better margins overall.So again, not a huge valuation. It's one of those ways to invest in something that doesn't have a gigantic PE forward multiple but also has really good, durable earnings. They're also rewarding shareholders by raising their dividend. They actually increase their dividend by 10% earlier this year. And so it's a way to be a little bit more defensive in your allocation.But we also believe that energy overall might be a better place in the second half of the year. And this is just a different way to access those types of returns. Looking at what we've seen in terms of the price of coal and now demand for it coming up, it's going to be a better back half of the year for these types of names in our opinion.SEANA SMITH: Brian, one of the names that you're advising investors to stay away from is CVS. We know the stock has been under pressure now for some time, off pretty significantly since the start of the year. What do you see as pressuring the company here going forward?BRIAN MULBERRY: Well, there's a couple of different reasons that we see, I think, a material decline in both profitability and overall earnings. And obviously, it's one being that they're not getting reimbursed for COVID testing and COVID vaccines at nearly the rate that they were a year or two years ago.But also, in addition to that, you know, there's a lot of regulatory pressure on prices at pharmacies for drugs. And that's good for consumers, but it's net bad for the balance sheet for somebody like CVS when we're seeing more generic drugs available but less reimbursement coming from distributing those generic drugs. It's kind of a double whammy on a company like CVS, where they're not getting the reimbursement from COVID protocols. And now, there's pressure on prices at the pharmacy, which is normally, you know, their top breadwinner, if you will, in terms of generating that revenue.So we think it's going to be a bit of a tough slog for CVS for the next couple of quarters until they can kind of get things figured out where their margins might be headed.AKIKO FUJITA: And finally, Brian, you were talking about some opportunities in the energy spaces. Next name-- next name not necessarily one that you would encourage investors to stay on top of. What are the concerns you have with FirstEnergy?BRIAN MULBERRY: FirstEnergy kind of has an aging grid, if you will. This is a power utility. And while there is a lot of demand for electricity, the way that it's been generated has not been profitable for them. And unfortunately, it's a publicly traded utility that has price caps, if you will. They have to get permission in order to raise their rates to be more profitable in most of the markets that they serve.They've been having a difficult time accessing equipment, maintaining equipment. And like I said, their aging grid is really just been a drag on their overall profitability. So this is one of those energy type names that we would avoid, because it just seems like their execution is a little bit behind the curve. And this is one of those things where certainly the supply chain has affected their ability to get the parts that they need to upgrade their grid and their distribution facilities for sure.But it's definitely weighing on their overall earnings and profitability picture. So this is a name that we would be cautious of in the next couple of quarters.SEANA SMITH: All right. Brian Mulberry of Zacks Investment Management, thanks.]"

GIII seems to be on a roll, thanks to its robust business strategies, including digital expansion and brand strength. Management remains optimistic about the company’s diversified portfolio backed by its global power brands, namely DKNY, Donna Karan, Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Karl Lagerfeld Paris.GIII also undertakes several strategies, including acquisitions and licensing of well-known brands, to expand its product portfolio. Such endeavors have enabled the company’s shares to increase 26% in the past three months, outperforming the industry’s 4.9% drop.Let’s Delving DeepRegarding its brand strength, G-III Apparel is on track with the development of the Nautica and Donna Karan brands. For Nautica, the company is working on bringing the Spring 2024 jeans line to life while for Donna Karan, it is leveraging the brand’s classic, contemporary and elevated feel and widening its appeal to a broader consumer base. Furthermore, the company has been maximizing its omnichannel opportunities and leveraging data for a while.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchG-III Apparel has announced a new licensing agreement for the Halston brand. The company has entered into a 25-year agreement with Xcel Brands to design and manufacture all categories with the choice to buy the brand at the end of the licensing term. Halston is an American heritage brand with a legacy of glamorous designs across a range of price points. The first deliveries are likely to be in 2024 fall.We note that G-III Apparel has numerous growth opportunities including the Spring 2024 repositioning, expansion of the Donna Karan label and a new long-term license for the Nautica brand. Nautica is available in nearly 1300 freestanding stores and shops globally and boasts a sturdy digital presence in over 30 countries. The company is on track to produce Nautica products across several categories starting with jeanswear. This includes jeans and a complete range of corresponding lifestyle products. The company will later expand in a phased manner with other categories like sportswear, suit separates and dresses.Overall, the company’s strategic priorities include driving power brands across categories, enhancing its portfolio via ownership of brands and licensing opportunities, expanding its global reach, maximizing omnichannel capabilities and scaling the private label business. G-III Apparel has also been making progress on rightsizing its inventory. As port congestion and lead times have normalized, management has adjusted the warehouse space appropriately. This trend is likely to continue throughout the year, driven by moderate freight costs.Story continuesWhat Else?Markedly, G-III Apparel posted better-than-expected results in first-quarter fiscal 2024, wherein the top and the bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company’s brands, DKNY, Karl Lagerfeld, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger outperformed management’s expectations, led by categories, such as dresses, sportswear and suit separates. Its North American DKNY and Karl Lagerfeld Paris businesses performed well.For fiscal 2024, management projects net sales of about $3.29 billion, up from $3.23 billion recorded in fiscal 2023. Management anticipates gross-margin improvement in fiscal 2024, up nearly 350 basis points year over year, driven by highly moderated freight costs. Adjusted earnings per share is likely to come in the band of $2.80-$2.90 for the current fiscal year versus $2.85 earned in fiscal 2023. Management expects solid cash flows this year as inventory levels normalize.Given all the aforesaid tailwinds, we believe that G-III Apparel will continue to perform well on the bourses.

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. See our latest analysis for Analog Devices How Quickly Is Analog Devices Increasing Earnings Per Share?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Shareholders will be happy to know that Analog Devices' EPS has grown 34% each year, compound, over three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up that sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. Analog Devices shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 29% to 35%, and revenue is growing. That's great to see, on both counts.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyFortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of Analog Devices' future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.Story continuesAre Analog Devices Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Analog Devices, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$338m. This comes in at 0.4% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.Should You Add Analog Devices To Your Watchlist?You can't deny that Analog Devices has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. With EPS growth rates like that, it's hardly surprising to see company higher-ups place confidence in the company through continuing to hold a significant investment. Fast growth and confident insiders should be enough to warrant further research, so it would seem that it's a good stock to follow. Once you've identified a business you like, the next step is to consider what you think it's worth. And right now is your chance to view our exclusive discounted cashflow valuation of Analog Devices.

Initial countries where early experiments are likely to take place include France, the Netherlands and Germany, as well as the UK.COS will explore the motivations and compelling experiences that increase consumer participation in the resale market. Resale is an important part of fashion's shift to circularity and is a growing commercial activity. However, with only 47% of consumers participating in resale activities more than once a year, many brands are still learning the many motivations and novel barriers that affect customer interest.[2]Story continuesThe experiment with the United Repair Centre will leverage their experience offering high-quality repair services to leading European apparel brands. It will explore the barriers that stop consumers from repairing their garments, and how to make clothing repair services more accessible and beneficial for all.The experiments will test the different experiences and motivations with customers in a variety of environments, including online and in store, to provide a better understanding of the precise triggers of changing consumer behaviours, experimenting with factors such as improving visibility, access, community, reward, ease, or affordability.The experiments will be open sourced, with key findings available through downloadable playbooks so that other businesses can use this knowledge to help develop their own circular models and be part of the wider Recommerce community.Katherine Brown, Vice President Sustainability and Inclusive Impact, Visa Europe: ""Over half of Europeans are already regularly engaging in recommerce activities like resale. By uncovering what actually gets shoppers to change their behaviour and by leveraging our data and insights from these experiments with United Repair Centre and COS, we can identify new ways to make sustainable fashion a must-have purchase and accelerate the transition to the circular economy for all.""Thami Schewichler, CEO, United Repair Centre: ""Every brand is looking at how they can be sustainable, and consumers are also looking for sustainable alternatives. Repair is a great way to show consumers the value of clothing again, and as it becomes the new cool in fashion, it also gives them the chance to create real impact.""To ensure the Behavioural Insights Lab provides participating partners with industry-leading expertise, Mindworks, a leading behavioural design expert, Twig, an innovative circular economy fintech, and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation will be joining the Lab as foundational partners. Insights from our Strategic Partner, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, including circular design principles, will be incorporated, and the Foundation is further supporting the project by helping to shape its direction.The meaningful and unique combination of Visa's equitable commerce and design experience, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation's circular design insights, Twig's fintech meets resale space knowhow, and Mindworks' key role in designing behavioural interventions, will supercharge discovery of actionable insights and scalable solutions, that encourage sustainable choices.""As a Strategic Partner in our Network, we have been working with Visa to ensure circular design is incorporated in the Behavioural Insights Lab. This project is absolutely a design-led initiative, and an important step in the journey towards bringing together different actors to collectively imagine and test new ways of engaging people and enabling circular economy choices. The learnings from this iterative project will sit alongside our Adaptive Strategy for Circular Design to help organisations leverage design as they transition from linear to circular, and will support not only the fashion industry, but all actors across different sectors who want to bring their users and customers along on their circular economy journey.""  Anna Queralt, Strategic Design Manager, Ellen MacArthur Foundation.Brad Herholdt, CEO, MindWorks Consulting says: ""We're thrilled to be announced as one of Visa's foundational partners for their Behavioural Insights Lab. At MindWorks we believe in the power of transformation for good which is why we can't wait to help shape a better future for our planet and its people by designing innovative behavioural interventions to help consumers make more sustainable choices.

The foundation of the methodology and lab is based on the M.I.N.D.S.P.A.C.E behavioural framework that decodes the nine effects thought to have the most influence on behaviour.By following this methodology, Visa will be able to evaluate experiment data and merchant feedback, share learnings, and create and share guides and playbooks for businesses to implement the intervention.About Visa Inc.Visa (NYSE: V) is a world leader in digital payments, facilitating transactions between consumers, merchants, financial institutions and government entities across more than 200 countries and territories.

Higher cross-border volumes are boosting the company's results. A shift in payments to the digital mode is a boon for Visa. Steady domestic volumes and transactions rise will aid the firm to boost its top line in the future. A strong cash position enables it to boost shareholder value.However, high operating expenses stress its margins. Ramped-up client incentives will dent the top line.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Caterpillar Inc. CAT, salesforce.com inc. CRM, McDonald's Corp. MCD, Visa Inc.'s V and Honeywell International Inc. HON.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Will the Dow Regain Momentum in 2H23?U.S. stock markets rallied in the first half of 2023, after wrapping up 2022 as the worst year since 2008 and terminating a three-year winning streak. Large cap-centric indexes like the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite rallied 15.9% and 31.7%, respectively. The small cap -centric Russell 2000 and the mid cap-centric S&amp;P 400 advanced more than 5% and 7%, respectively. However, the blue-chip Dow gained only 3.8%.Importantly, the first-half rally was primarily driven by growth stocks like technology, communication services and consumer discretionary. These stocks have a relatively low weight in Dow rather than the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. The cyclical stocks, which have more weight in Dow, did not participate in the rally.However, the situation is likely to change in the second half. At present, cyclical stocks are undervalued. Technically, at its current level of 33,944.40, the Dow is well above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages of 33,662.29 and 32,992.06, respectively.The 50-day moving average line is generally recognized as a short-term trendsetter in financial literature, while the 200-day moving average is considered a long-term trend setter. Historically it has been noticed in the technical analysis space that whenever the 50-day moving average line surges ahead of the 200-day moving average line, a long-term uptrend for the index becomes a strong possibility.Our Top PicksDefying a tepid Dow, we have narrowed our search to five blue-chip (components of Dow) stocks with strong potential for 2023. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Story continuesCaterpillar Inc. has seen year-over-year revenue and earnings growth for nine straight quarters thanks to its cost-saving actions, strong end-market demand and pricing actions that offset the impact of supply-chain snarls and cost pressures. We expect the company's adjusted earnings per share for 2023 to grow 19% and revenues to rise 7%.Zacks Rank #2 Caterpillar has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 10.2% and 28.5%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.8% over the last 30 days.salesforce.com inc. is benefiting from a robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. The rapid adoption of its cloud-based solutions is driving demand for CRM's products. CRM's sustained focus on introducing more aligned products as per customer needs is driving its top-line.Zacks Rank #1 salesforce.com has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 10.5% and 42%, respectively, for the current year (January 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.3% over the last 30 days.McDonald's Corp. continues to impress investors with robust comps growth. MCD's increased focus on menu innovation and loyalty program expansion is commendable. MCD is also undertaking every effort to drive growth in international markets. Robust digitalization is likely to help McDonald's in driving long-term growth and capture market share. MCD plans to open more than 1,900 restaurants globally in 2023.Zacks Rank #2 McDonald's has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 7.7% and 9.5%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days.Visa Inc.'s numerous buyouts and alliances paved the way for long-term growth and consistently drove its revenues. Constant investments in technology are solidifying V's position in the payments market. A shift in payments to the digital mode is a boon. Backed by a strong cash position, Visa remains committed to boosting its shareholder value through share buybacks and dividend payments.Zacks Rank #2 Visa has an expected earnings growth rate of 11% and 14.5%, respectively, for the current year (September 2023).

249,c93d5953-a8d8-3013-9b4a-9266646affd2,MAR,2023-07-13,What Makes Marriott International (MAR) a Strong Momentum Stock: Buy Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/makes-marriott-international-mar-strong-160004739.html,1689177604,STORY,['MAR'],"[Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Marriott International (MAR), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Marriott International currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?In order to see if MAR is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this hotel company holds up.Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor MAR, shares are up 1.07% over the past week while the Zacks Hotels and Motels industry is up 0.26% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 5.43% compares favorably with the industry's 2.43% performance as well.While any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Marriott International have risen 10.14%, and are up 37.48% in the last year. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 8.46% and 16.91%, respectively.Investors should also take note of MAR's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, MAR is averaging 1,698,444 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with MAR.Over the past two months, 2 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost MAR's consensus estimate, increasing from $8.33 to $8.41 in the past 60 days.

253,546695bf-8470-3790-b3c6-8e268667348d,VZ,2023-07-13,Can Verizon Communications Inc.'s (NYSE:VZ) ROE Continue To Surpass The Industry Average?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verizon-communications-inc-nyse-vz-120019390.html,1689249619,STORY,['VZ'],"[While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ).Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for Verizon Communications How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Verizon Communications is:23% = US$22b ÷ US$94b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.23 in profit.Does Verizon Communications Have A Good ROE?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, Verizon Communications has a superior ROE than the average (10%) in the Telecom industry.roeThat's what we like to see. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk.  Our risks dashboardshould have the 2 risks we have identified for Verizon Communications.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Story continuesCombining Verizon Communications' Debt And Its 23% Return On EquityIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Verizon Communications, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.71. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive, but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.SummaryReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.If you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.Have feedback on this article?

Reduced refinery production is expected to have weighed on alumina shipments.An anticipated weakness in shipments due to lower trading activities and weak volumes from the Canadian smelters is likely to have hurt Aluminum segment’s third-party sales. Higher prices of aluminum and lower raw material and production costs might have partly offset the adversity.While alumina shipments are likely to reflect softness, higher average realized prices and strong volumes are expected to have driven the segment’s third-party sales. Lower raw material and energy costs are also expected to have aided the unit’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.What Does the Zacks Model Say?Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Alcoa this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of beating estimates, which is not the case here, as elaborated below.Earnings ESP: Alcoa has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 50 cents.

268,01af9201-e34c-3cfc-a7fb-8f545a7a6427,APD,2023-07-13,Helium Reserves By Country and Biggest Helium Manufacturers,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/helium-reserves-country-biggest-helium-031157836.html,1689217917,STORY,"['NG=F', 'HG=F', 'XOM', 'LIN', 'APD']","[In this comprehensive article, we will discuss countries with the biggest helium reserves and their current production capacity, as some nations aren't capable of exploiting their reserves as of now. We will also understand the usage of helium gas in crucial industries like medicine, space, technology, and telecommunication, among others. If you want to know the key names in the global helium industry, read Helium Reserves By Country And 5 Biggest Helium Manufacturers.  Helium reserves by country and biggest helium manufacturers represent a micro-niche in mining, mainly owned by the United States, Qatar, and Algeria. Such diversity in helium reserves by country stems from helium's production and refining process. Despite being the second most abundant element in the Universe, helium remains a rare element in the mining industry due to its pressure requirements. Helium is separated from natural gas by liquefying its components at low temperatures and high pressure because otherwise, it escapes the Earth's crust and gets released into space. Studies say that until now, the discovery of helium deposits has never been intentional, as it is mostly located during oil and natural gas extraction. It is also a by-product of uranium and thorium decay and co-exists with other gases in the crust. Owing to its rarity, there are a few pure-play helium gas mining companies working at a grand scale. One of these biggest helium manufacturers is Pennsylvania-based Air Products and Chemicals Inc (NYSE:APD), which offers liquid and compressed helium of various purity levels. Since Air Products and Chemicals Inc (NYSE:APD) has a broad network of storage and transfer facilities, the company is able to work across the world. Air Products and Chemicals Inc (NYSE:APD) 's main product line includes atmospheric gases, helium being one of them, and their related equipment, i.e., liquefying cabinets. It is one of the largest helium producing companies and has a current market cap of $64.116 billion.Story continuesAnother noteworthy name amongst helium gas mining companies is Ireland-based Linde Plc (NYSE:LIN), a natural gas and engineering company with a current market cap of $179.604 billion. Linde Plc (NYSE:LIN) provides high-grade helium of up to 99% purity through its proven extraction technology. Linde Plc (NYSE:LIN) operates one of the largest helium plants in Ulysses (Ireland), Kansas, and Qatar. Likewise, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) mines natural gas, a source of helium. Being one of the largest helium companies, it operates the LaBarge facility in Wyoming. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is responsible for providing 20% share in global helium production and has over 80 years of helium supply remaining. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is also the largest liquid helium producer and boasts a current market cap of $433.674 billion at the time of writing this article. If you want to include Earth's valuable resources in your investment portfolio, we have already covered the 10 Best Natural Gas Stocks to Buy Now; give them a read to make smart decisions. Which Country Produces the Most Helium In The World?The United States was at the forefront of helium production by country in 2022. As of 2022, the country's annual helium production totaled 75 million cubic meters, equating to approximately 46% of the global helium output. The total worldwide production of helium in 2022, standing at around 160 million cubic meters, indicated a substantial contribution by the United States.The vast reserves of natural gas in Texas and Oklahoma are abundant with helium, and their extraction processes have made the United States the largest helium producing country in the world. Also, strategic helium storage and distribution facilities, such as the Federal Helium Reserve in Amarillo, Texas, enhance the country's capacity to maintain its position as the largest helium producing country in the world. However, after continuous helium exploitation in the U.S. since the early 1910s, its status amongst helium reserves by country has switched places with Qatar. Which Sector is the Largest Consumer Of Helium?The global helium market is set to reach $5.03 billion this year because of its broad spectrum usage. While most think helium is used mainly in party balloons, NASA is the single biggest buyer of helium. Annually, NASA consumes approximately 75 million cubic feet of helium, primarily used in rocket propulsion. Helium's low boiling point, low density, and the fact that it doesn't become radioactive make it an invaluable commodity for NASA. Its principal application lies in cooling liquid hydrogen and oxygen, used extensively as rocket fuel. As these fuels must be kept at incredibly low temperatures to remain liquid, this task is achieved with helium's superior cooling capabilities. Additionally, gaseous helium is also used to pressurize the fuel tanks of liquid-fueled rockets, ensuring the fuel is pushed toward the engines in zero-gravity conditions. Which Country Has The Largest Reserve Of Helium In The World?Qatar currently has the world's largest helium reserves, standing at 10 billion cubic meters. However, the reserve scale does not directly correlate with extraction activity or production level. Because despite its vast reserves, Qatar has yet to fully capitalize on its helium mining potential. The United States had the highest helium production by country in 2022; it has comparatively fewer helium reserves than Qatar. This status quo between the largest helium producing country in the world and the highest helium production by country in 2022 reflects the dynamics that underlie the global helium market, where factors like technological capabilities, economic viability, political stability, and market demand determine actual production levels. What Is Helium Used For?According to data from 2022, the United States exhibited a substantial demand for Grade-A helium, with the estimated consumption totaling 43 million cubic meters, or equivalently 1.5 billion cubic feet. According to USGS, helium consumption was dominated, in order of decreasing volume, by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), lifting gas, analytical and laboratory applications, electronics, and semiconductor manufacturing, among others. MRI is reliant on superconducting magnets, which need to be cooled to extremely low temperatures using liquid helium, hence, making helium indispensable in this sector. Helium Reserves By Country and Biggest Helium ManufacturersOur Methodology We ranked helium reserves by country and 9 biggest helium manufacturers according to the countries' recorded helium deposits. Our primary source for this study was USGS Mineral Commodity Summaries from 2023, 2022, and 2021. However, being a micro-niche in mining means the helium sector is still rapidly growing, and there are only a handful of countries extracting it. As helium is often discovered and extracted as a by-product of natural gas, many countries haven't established their records of helium reserves. Therefore, even after coming across some countries' private sources claiming the discovery of massive helium deposits, we cross-referenced these claims with the said countries' official records of helium mining output over the years. Based on our findings, here are the top helium reserves by country and 9 biggest helium manufacturers:9. South Africa Claimed But Not Proven Helium Reserves: 920 million cubic meters Our list of helium reserves by country and biggest helium manufacturers starts with South Africa because of the country's 1 million cubic meters of helium production in 2022. Interestingly, the country is claimed to have one of the largest helium reserves in the world.South African renewable energy corporation Renergen Limited secured gas rights spanning 87,000 hectares within the Free State province in 2012. The initial gas tests run on the field illustrated helium concentrations between two and four percent, an astonishingly high figure in the context of global helium production. In comparison, U.S. helium producers commonly extract the gas from fields with concentrations as low as 0.3 percent.These preliminary results indicate that the Free State province could be one of the world's richest helium sources in the world. What makes this discovery remarkable is the potential volume of the helium reserves, which the company estimates at 9.74 billion cubic meters. This estimate, if accurate, would surpass the known helium reserves in the United States. However, more conservative estimates place the reserve at a minimum of 920 million cubic meters.Considering the depleting global helium reserves, this could fundamentally shift the dynamics of helium production worldwide. However, these claims are yet to receive any official stamp, so South Africa currently falls 9th on the list of helium reserves by country and biggest helium manufacturers. 8. Poland Helium Reserves: 24 million cubic meters Poland's helium reserves are 24 million cubic meters as of 2022. But while these resources exist in abundance, the country's capacity to extract and process helium gas remains more limited. Poland's recent average helium production stands at 1 million cubic meters.7. China Helium Reserves: 1.1 billion cubic meters China has considerable helium reserves, amounting to 1.1 billion cubic meters. Despite this, China's annual helium output amounts to just 1 million cubic meters, a stark disparity compared to its vast reserves. This shortfall cannot be attributed to resource scarcity; rather, it is predominantly a result of demand constraints, as China is one of the most advanced nations in mining. However, the fact that helium is a by-product and doesn't have a massive global market as of current might be pushing China behind in this sector. 6. CanadaHelium Reserves: 2 billion cubic meters Canada boasts 2 billion cubic meters of helium reserves, which shows the nation's potential to contribute to the global helium market. In 2022 alone, the country produced about 2 million cubic meters of helium. A particular area of interest within Canada's helium landscape is Saskatchewan. The province is rich in uranium reserves, and these same geological conditions render it an abundant source of helium. The relationship between uranium and helium is a fascinating one. As uranium decays naturally over time, it releases helium. Therefore, areas with high concentrations of uranium, like Saskatchewan, are invariably associated with large helium reserves. The Saskatchewan government, recognizing the province's helium potential, has approved an increase in exploration and production of this valuable resource. Also, the strategic aim is to account for approximately 10% of the world's helium supply by 2030.Click to continue reading Helium Reserves By Country And 5 Biggest Helium Manufacturers.  Suggested Articles:Titanium Reserves By Country: 10 Biggest Mines In The World20 Countries With The Largest Copper Reserves In The WorldLithium Reserves by CountryDisclosure: None. Helium Reserves By Country and Biggest Helium Manufacturers is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Carlson told viewers in January 2022 that Epps was a ""central figure"" in the attack and ""helped stage-manage the insurrection,"" according to the lawsuit.Story continuesFox fired Carlson in April.Epps is suing the network for defamation and false light, alleging that the statements about him on Fox ""would lead the public to believe that Epps was a federal agent working to provoke or otherwise incite others to attack the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021.""(Reporting by Helen Coster and Jack Queen in New York, and Tom Hals in Wilmington, Delaware; Editing by Jamie Freed)]"

Smartmatic's case has played out alongside a similar defamation lawsuit against Fox News and Fox Corp by Dominion Voting Systems, which settled on the eve of trial in April for $787 million.Bannon and Flynn representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment, nor did Smartmatic and Newsmax.A trial date has not yet been set in the Smartmatic case. Representatives of both companies previously have declined to say whether they are in talks over a possible settlement.Bannon, an influential figure on the American right, worked on Trump's 2016 campaign and later in the White House. He now hosts a podcast. Bannon last year was convicted of contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena from the committee that investigated the 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters.Story continuesBannon separately was charged in 2020 with defrauding donors to a private fund-raising effort to boost Trump's project to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border. Trump pardoned Bannon before that federal case went to trial. Bannon now is set to go on trial next year on state criminal charges related to the wall scheme.Flynn is a retired U.S. Army lieutenant general who served as Trump's first White House national security advisor until he stepped down after only a few weeks on the job amid revelations that he misled then-Vice President Mike Pence about his communications with the Russian ambassador to the United States.Trump also pardoned Flynn, who had twice pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI during the federal investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.(Reporting by Jack Queen; Editing by Will Dunham)]"

He took that role in 2022 to see through major projects, like the $3.7 billion acquisition of Meritor Inc. He served as Cummins’ chairman and CEO from 2012 to 2022. During his 10-year tenure, the company grew its revenue from $17.3 billion to a record $28.1 billion last year.Determining where Linebarger stops and Rumsey begins is difficult because of how closely they worked together in recent years. Rumsey became president and CEO in August 2022. During a two-decade career, she was chief technology officer and chief operating officer. Cummins has had only seven CEOs in its 104-year history. Rumsey is the first female.Rumsey and Linebarger co-developed the company’s signature Destination Zero campaign. Cummins plans to produce only zero-emissions powertrains by 2050. The company is pursuing its traditional diesel engine business. And it has a rebranded Accelera unit focused on hydrogen electrolyzers and fuel cells.Story continuesRecord revenues in Rumsey’s 1st year at helmIn her first year as CEO, Rumsey led Cummins to three consecutive quarterly revenue records. She also oversaw absorption of the Meritor business and smaller acquisitions from Siemens and Jacobs Vehicle Systems. She also led the rollout of an industry-first fuel-agnostic powertrain platform that will allow its internal combustion engines to run on natural gas in 2024 and hydrogen in 2027.Daimler Truck, a major customer that has handed off its medium-duty engine business to Cummins globally, said Tuesday that it too will pursue hydrogen ICE engines within its Detroit unit.Separately, Cummins on Wednesday increased its quarterly dividend by 7% after paying a quarterly dividend of $1.57 in each of the previous four quarters.Related articles:Cummins brands New Power division as future tech-focused AcceleraCummins names Jennifer Rumsey as CEO to succeed Tom Linebarger Stand-alone filtration business from Cummins seeks investorsClick for more FreightWaves articles by Alan Adler.The post Rumsey succeeds Linebarger as chair of Cummins appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

During this time, Cummins has continued to grow its core business with the acquisition of Meritor, accelerating the development of economically viable decarbonized powertrain solutions including the industry’s first fuel agnostic powertrain platform, enhancing the sales and service network and expanding customer relationships.Simultaneously, Cummins has progressed the development of innovative, zero-emissions solutions, rebranding that business unit and sending a clear signal to customers, employees, prospective talent and policy makers that the company is committed to leading in zero-emission technologies. In 2022, Cummins invested $1.2 billion in research and development to drive innovation and growth across the business, while delivering strong returns to shareholders. Fulfilling her commitment to keeping people at the center, Rumsey has forged new partnerships with key customers and led an effort to reconnect employees with Cummins leaders and the Destination Zero strategy following the COVID-19 pandemic.""On behalf of the Cummins Board of Directors, I want to express our deep gratitude to Tom for his leadership of Cummins over the past three decades,"" said Tom Lynch, Lead Director, Cummins Board.

If you want to see some more stocks on the list, go directly to Analysts are Upgrading These 5 Stocks.At the beginning of the week, European stocks experienced a decline, mirroring the fall in US equity futures. The focus for the week ahead will be on inflation and interest rates, particularly after China's soft price data raised concerns about its economic recovery. According to Bloomberg, traders will pay close attention to US inflation numbers on July 12, as they may provide insights into the Federal Reserve's future policy decisions and the increasing risk of a recession. Additionally, the UK jobs data scheduled for July 11 will play a crucial role in determining the Bank of England's upcoming policy decision in August. Market participants will closely monitor these economic indicators. China's stock market is under threat from a significant wave of selling pressure as cash trapped in mutual funds is set to be redeemed. This adds to the already mounting concerns that are negatively impacting market sentiment. Morningstar Inc.'s data reveals that more than 200 billion yuan ($28 billion) of cash, held in mutual funds for the past three years, is about to be released. This impending redemption offers frustrated investors an opportunity to explore alternative investment options outside of equities and potentially find a new place to allocate their funds.According to Reuters, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen's visit to Beijing did not bring about any immediate resolution or easing of tensions between the U.S. and China. The meetings between Yellen and top Chinese economic officials covered a range of issues, but it remains uncertain if they will change the trajectory of the relationship. The primary accomplishment of the meetings was establishing communication and conveying U.S. intentions on various policies. While the visit was described as pragmatic and rational, expectations for a positive outcome are considered weak and uncertain. The discussions addressed significant disagreements, including U.S. concerns about China's unfair economic practices and punitive actions against American companies. Predicting how the two sides will move toward compromise is still challenging, but maintaining dialogue is crucial.Story continuesAccording to Goldman Sachs, India is expected to surpass Japan, Germany, and, eventually, the United States to become the world's second-largest economy by 2075. Currently ranked as the fifth-largest economy, India's projected leap is attributed to factors such as a growing population, advancements in innovation and technology, increased capital investment, and rising worker productivity. Goldman Sachs Research's India economist, Santanu Sengupta, highlights that India is anticipated to have one of the lowest dependency ratios among regional economies over the next two decades. A low dependency ratio suggests a higher proportion of working-age adults who can support both the younger and older generations.Oil prices in Asian trade declined as investors approached the week with caution ahead of upcoming economic data from major consumers, the United States and China, reported Reuters. However, expected crude supply cuts by Saudi Arabia and Russia limited the losses. Brent crude futures dropped by 55 cents (0.7%) to $77.92 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude fell by 55 cents (0.7%) to $73.31 a barrel. Analysts noted that oil traders were exercising caution in anticipation of the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) data and China's economic data later in the week. Despite the cautious sentiment, the announcement of further supply cuts by OPEC+ could potentially lead to a rebound in crude prices. The economic slowdown in China and the ongoing interplay between demand concerns and supply control strategies by OPEC contribute to market uncertainty. Saudi Arabia extended its output cut into August, while Russia reduced crude exports to meet domestic demand. Additionally, non-OPEC+ supply has been keeping up with global demand, prompting suggestions for OPEC+ to deepen cuts and extend them into 2024.On the U.S. stock market front, Raymond James analyst Michael Rose upgraded First Horizon Corporation (NYSE:FHN) from Market Perform to Outperform. At the same time, according to Wolfe Research analyst Sam Margolin's research note issued on July 7, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) has been upgraded from Peerperform to Outperform.

(NYSE:BAP) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Peruvian banking franchise Credicorp Ltd. (NYSE:BAP) was another contributor to relative returns in the quarter as improving financial results and successful execution across its digital initiatives drove shares higher. We remain focused on Credicorp’s attractive long-term earnings potential. The company continues to garner higher customer satisfaction and strengthen its competitive moat by educating the unbanked and prospecting through a centralized data analytics platform to expand its client base. The company also views venture capital and the underdeveloped fintech market in Peru as an opportunity to boost growth and enhance shareholder value. At current levels, we believe the valuation is attractive and think Credicorp’s risk/reward dynamics are skewed to the upside, particularly in a rising interest rate environment.”07.

284,6c9f6d5a-db53-3054-a784-471b942576c4,MTB,2023-07-13,M&T Bank Corporation (MTB) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/m-t-bank-corporation-mtb-140036719.html,1689170436,STORY,['MTB'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when M&amp;T Bank Corporation (MTB) reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 19. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $4.14 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +33.6%.Revenues are expected to be $2.39 billion, up 20.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 5.84% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for M&amp;T Bank Corporation?For M&amp;T Bank Corporation, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.33%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that M&amp;T Bank Corporation will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that M&amp;T Bank Corporation would post earnings of $3.98 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.09, delivering a surprise of +2.76%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.M&amp;T Bank Corporation doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK), is soon expected to post earnings of $1.22 per share for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +6.1%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $4.37 billion, up 2.8% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation has been revised 0.3% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -0.21%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:UAA) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 67% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Last week's US$267m market cap gain would probably be appreciated by institutional investors, especially after a year of 8.8% losses.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Under Armour, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Under Armour ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Under Armour?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Under Armour. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Under Armour's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Under Armour. From our data, we infer that the largest shareholder is Kevin Plank (who also holds the title of Top Key Executive) with 12% of shares outstanding. Its usually considered a good sign when insiders own a significant number of shares in the company, and in this case, we're glad to see a company insider play the role of a key stakeholder. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.6% and 7.3%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 19 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Under ArmourWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own a reasonable proportion of Under Armour, Inc.. It has a market capitalization of just US$3.4b, and insiders have US$410m worth of shares in their own names. That's quite significant. Most would say this shows a good degree of alignment with shareholders, especially in a company of this size. You can  click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 21% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Under Armour. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Under Armour   you should know about.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do.

294,37b72003-bea5-3925-9601-9fa72d9b304b,CL,2023-07-13,"With 82% ownership, Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) boasts of strong institutional backing",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/82-ownership-colgate-palmolive-company-130025112.html,1689166825,STORY,['CL'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Colgate-Palmolive's stock price is sensitive to their trading actionsThe top 25 shareholders own 49% of the company Recent sales by insiders If you want to know who really controls Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 82% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Colgate-Palmolive. Check out our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Colgate-Palmolive?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.Colgate-Palmolive already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Colgate-Palmolive's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Colgate-Palmolive is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.7% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.2% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 5.8% of the company stock.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Colgate-PalmoliveWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Colgate-Palmolive Company in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$67m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 18% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified   3 warning signs for Colgate-Palmolive  that you should be aware of.If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. View our latest analysis for Juniper Networks Juniper Networks' Earnings Per Share Are GrowingIf you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. We can see that in the last three years Juniper Networks grew its EPS by 16% per year. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. Juniper Networks maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 14% to US$5.5b. That's progress.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyIn investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of Juniper Networks' forecast profits?Are Juniper Networks Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$10b company like Juniper Networks. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$130m. Investors will appreciate management having this amount of skin in the game as it shows their commitment to the company's future.Story continuesShould You Add Juniper Networks To Your Watchlist?One important encouraging feature of Juniper Networks is that it is growing profits. If that's not enough on its own, there is also the rather notable levels of insider ownership. That combination is very appealing. So yes, we do think the stock is worth keeping an eye on. What about risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Juniper Networks   you should know about.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features.

When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We can see that Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) does use debt in its business. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?Why Does Debt Bring Risk?Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together. Check out our latest analysis for Comcast What Is Comcast's Debt?The chart below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Comcast had US$100.7b in debt in March 2023; about the same as the year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$5.54b, its net debt is less, at about US$95.2b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Healthy Is Comcast's Balance Sheet?The latest balance sheet data shows that Comcast had liabilities of US$32.4b due within a year, and liabilities of US$143.6b falling due after that. Offsetting this, it had US$5.54b in cash and US$12.3b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$158.2b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.This is a mountain of leverage even relative to its gargantuan market capitalization of US$176.5b. This suggests shareholders would be heavily diluted if the company needed to shore up its balance sheet in a hurry.Story continuesWe measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.Comcast has a debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.6 and its EBIT covered its interest expense 5.8 times. This suggests that while the debt levels are significant, we'd stop short of calling them problematic. Comcast grew its EBIT by 6.3% in the last year. That's far from incredible but it is a good thing, when it comes to paying off debt. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Comcast's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. Over the most recent three years, Comcast recorded free cash flow worth 65% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.Our ViewComcast's level of total liabilities and net debt to EBITDA definitely weigh on it, in our esteem. But we do take some comfort from its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow. Looking at all the angles mentioned above, it does seem to us that Comcast is a somewhat risky investment as a result of its debt. Not all risk is bad, as it can boost share price returns if it pays off, but this debt risk is worth keeping in mind. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. For instance, we've identified   3 warning signs for Comcast  that you should be aware of.If, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a rock-solid balance sheet, then check out our list of net cash growth stocks without delay.Have feedback on this article?

Members have authorized a strike if negotiators cannot reach a deal, and A-list stars including Jennifer Lawrence and Meryl Streep have said they are ready to walk off the job.They would join about 11,500 members of the Writers Guild of America (WGA), who went on strike in early May. That walkout sent late-night television talk shows into endless reruns and disrupted most production for the autumn TV season and the filming of some big-budget movies.A strike by SAG-AFTRA would force more sets to shut down and pile pressure on studios to find a resolution.""Everybody’s feeling tense and hoping that the answer is the right one,"" said actor Florence Pugh, speaking in London at a promotional event for the upcoming film ""Oppenheimer.""Late on Tuesday, SAG-AFTRA negotiators agreed to a studio request to call in a federal mediator. But the union said studio representatives had ""abused our trust"" with leaks to the media and it would not budge from the Wednesday night deadline.Hollywood has not faced a double strike since 1960, when members of the WGA and the Screen Actors Guild called work stoppages in a fight over residuals from films sold to TV networks.""You have to make $26,000 a year to qualify for your health insurance and there are a lot of people who get across that threshold through their residual payments,"" said actor Matt Damon at the ""Oppenheimer"" event.Story continues""There’s money being made and it needs to be allocated in a way that takes care of people who are on the margins.""Today, the unions are battling Netflix, Walt Disney and other companies over base pay and residuals from streaming services and other issues including the use of generative AI. Actors want assurances that their digital images will not be used without their permission.Negotiations were taking place at a difficult time for media companies that have spent billions of dollars on programming to try to attract new streaming customers.Disney, Comcast Corp's NBCUniversal and Paramount Global each lost hundreds of millions of dollars from streaming in the most recent quarter. At the same time, the rise of online video has eroded television ad revenue as traditional TV audiences shrink.The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which negotiates on behalf of the studios, has declined to comment about its talks with SAG-AFTRA.With the writers, the AMPTP said it had offered ""generous"" pay increases but could not agree to all of the writers' demands. The studios and the WGA have not held talks since the writers' strike began on May 2. (Reporting by Lisa Richwine; additional reporting by Marie Louise in London; Editing by Bill Berkrot)]"

If you are not interested in reading the details, head straight to the 5 Most Hated Brands in the World.Starting a business in the US is the first step in building a global brand since it is a land of opportunities, where anyone with a great idea, the drive to succeed, and a willingness to work hard can prosper. Some well-known brands that originated in the United States and have now gone global include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), The Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT). Brands offer the innovations, concepts, and solutions that customers demand. In addition, they also contribute to the economy by generating wealth and income, paying taxes, supporting services, and making jobs available to the active population of a country.Although businesses and brands make our lives easier, there are a number of negative aspects to them, which is why some people have such a strong disdain or even hatred for them. Don’t Miss: 15 Most Hated Companies in America last year.Americans believe businesses are performing below expectations in various areas, according to a Bentley-Gallup Force for Good survey. 53% of Americans, who participated in the study, said that businesses generally have a negative impact on the environment. For large businesses, this number increased to 65%. Americans also believe that businesses are failing in the area of pay disparity. 82% of respondents said that it is crucial to treat all workers fairly and 72% agreed that they would be ready to pay more for a product from a company that treats its employees well. Moreover, the study also found that 55% of American workers, including 71% of those aged 18 to 29, would switch jobs to work for a company that had a greater beneficial impact on the globe.In a similar vein, Millennials' tolerance for large companies declined in 2019. According to a Deloitte Millennial Survey, fewer Millennials (from 76% in 2017 to 55% in 2019) agreed that business had a beneficial impact on society. Additionally, 26% of Millennials expressed no faith in corporate executives.Story continuesMost Loved and Successful Brands Have the Most HatersMany experts believe that if you want to be great, you must be prepared to face hatred. So, it should come as no surprise that some of the most admired brands in the world are also some of the most despised. Moreover, this hatred toward a brand isn't always detrimental to its financial standing. For instance, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has faced significant backlash following the announcement of 27,000 layoffs since November 2022. Nevertheless, the e-commerce behemoth, which has a large product range, a user-friendly website, is simple to use, and offers quick and dependable shipping, is still one of the most loved and trusted brands by customers. 89% of consumers think that they are more inclined to purchase things from Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) than from any other e-commerce websites.Similarly, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) appears to be loved and despised by people everywhere. Many hate it due to privacy concerns, but more than 77% of Internet users are active on at least one of its platforms. This clearly shows how successful the brand is.Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), one of the largest retailers in the world, is yet another example of a brand that people claim to dislike, but it continues to be profitable every year. It is accused of treating its employees unfairly. Furthermore, critics argue that the big-box giant has swooped in many places and destroyed local small businesses, leaving customers no other options. We believe that success of its business model is much to blame for that.It's easy to understand why brands people dislike persist. If there are significant benefits, customers will stick with a brand they don't like. Many customer decisions are heavily influenced by elements like price, convenience, and easy availability. For example, if a better airline cannot provide equal availability and affordability, consumers will continue to fly with the airline they dislike.Therefore, it is crucial to keep in mind that just because a brand is listed in this article as one of the most despised brands in the world, it doesn't automatically mean that it is no longer significant. This brand had to be on the list even though more people love it than hate it because we were focusing on the latter criteria.With these considerations in mind, let's look at the most hated brands in the world.20 Most Hated Brands in the WorldMilles Studio/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyWe used reputable sources for our rankings of the most hated brands in the world, including the 2023 Axios Harris Poll, 24/7 Wall Street, Business Insider, and USA Today. In addition, we took into account a number of online reviews and customer survey platforms. We assigned scores to each brand based on the number of mentions, so each time a brand was mentioned, it received a score of 1. Consequently, the more mentions and references, the higher the score and rank in our article. Basically, this list of the most hated brands in the world doesn't reflect our opinion but the consensus opinion of various sources.So, without further ado, let's examine the most hated brands in the world that must work very hard to regain the faith of their customers.Most Hated Brands in the World20. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), as reported in one of articles earlier, is one of the top drug companies in the world by revenue. It headquartered in New Brunswick, New Jersey.The company came under intense criticism following many lawsuits that claim its baby powder causes ovarian cancer. However, the pharmaceutical giant agreed to pay $8.9 billion in April 2023 to settle all cancer lawsuits related to its talc-based powders.19. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), with around 232.5 million subscribers, is a streaming service that offers a wide variety of award-winning TV shows, movies, anime, documentaries, and more on thousands of internet-connected devices.Although the streaming service continues to be a favorite among many, it recently attracted public criticism for only allowing members of the same household to share passwords, with outside users having to pay an extra $7.99 per month. However, we don't think that Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)’s inclusion on our list of the most hated brands in the world will have a negative impact on its reputation.18. Navient Corporation (NASDAQ:NAVI)Navient Corporation (NASDAQ:NAVI), one of the most hated brands in the world on our list, is an American student loan servicer based in Wilmington, Delaware.People despise the company because it takes advantage of borrowers by disregarding concerns, providing false information, processing payments improperly, and directing borrowers to more expensive repayment plans. Between November 2016 and January 2017, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau claims receiving over 1,500 consumer complaints about the company.A $1.85 billion settlement was reached between 39 states and Navient Corporation (NASDAQ:NAVI) last year on claims that the company used unfair and deceptive loan practices.17. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), with 32,800 employees as of 2022, primarily offers taxi services, allowing customers to hail a taxi through a mobile app.The company is disliked for its surge pricing as well as the negative effects of gig work replacing secure employment. Moreover, it is also disliked for causing disruption to the taxi industry and aggravating traffic congestion.However, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) offers several benefits, such as door-to-door convenience, safety, and dependable quality, thus we don't believe it deserves to be one of the most hated brands in the world.16. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), as reported in one our articles earlier, is one of the largest banks in the US by asset size.The bank earned the ire of general public when common people lost their homes, their jobs and their savings during the 2008 recession. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) agreed to pay $5.06 billion in 2016 to resolve charges that it mislead mortgage bond investors during the financial crisis.Furthermore, it has also received criticism from its employees. A 2021 poll of 13 first-year analysts at Goldman Sachs found that they were subjected to extremely long work hours, deadline pressure, and harsh behavior from superiors, which deteriorates their personal lives.15. The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI)The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI), with 71,300 employees as of 2022, engages in the provision of global health services. Forbes claims that state regulators get more consumer complaints about the company's health insurance than the national average. Based on ratings from the National Committee for Quality Assurance, it receives an average of 3.3 out of 5 stars.Moreover, the Guardian reported in 2021 that the company's call center employees complained about unfavorable working conditions. High demands for output, the risk of losing one's job, lack of training, and lengthy processing timeframes for consumers seeking reimbursement for Covid-19 testing expenses were the driving forces behind this.14. Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC)Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC), engaged in the provision of banking, insurance, investments, mortgage, and consumer and commercial finance, is headquartered in San Francisco, California. The bank received a lot of criticism in 2016 when it became known that its staff had been engaging in illicit practices for years.

(NYSE: URI), the world’s largest equipment rental company, today outlined ways companies can create more efficient and sustainable worksites using hybrid power solutions. Battery energy storage systems (BESS) are leading the transformation in portable power by storing energy from an energy source such as a power grid or generator.United Rentals released a white paper, ""Hybrid Power Solutions: The Future of Portable Power,"" that explores strategies for pairing a BESS with a power generator. When a BESS is paired with a power generator, the generator recharges the BESS batteries as the system runs. In low-load situations, the BESS shuts off the generator and carries the load on its own until the demand for energy increases again and the BESS instructs the generator to turn on.""Hybrid power solutions can help companies by supplying the power they need for productivity and safety in a way that lowers operations costs and emissions,"" said Dan Gribbell, PHVAC Region Sales and Marketing Director, United Rentals. ""United Rentals can help companies leverage a hybrid power solution that addresses their specific power requirements, including hydrogen or propane generators used with a BESS or on their own, so their businesses stay agile and responsive.""In a recent project, a large construction customer reduced cost by 34 percent and reduced generator runtime by two-thirds.Benefits of Hybrid PowerA BESS provides quality power and energy reliability for worksites. The high-density lithium battery system is charged by electricity from a power source. It can provide remote site power, charge electric vehicles, tools and other equipment, deliver emergency backup and more.When a BESS is integrated with a generator, the generator runs only when the load is high or the stored energy is nearly depleted, which can reduce fuel consumption by as much as 80 percent. When the generator is off, BESS batteries supply emissions-free power. Using batteries to power equipment can decrease worksite noise levels by up to 90 percent compared to traditional generator-only approaches.Story continuesHybrid power solutions can also reduce ongoing maintenance costs. Battery systems require less maintenance than generators, and generators need less maintenance when runtime is reduced. Minimizing generator wear and tear leads to longer service intervals, lower consumption of oil and filters by fossil fuel-powered generators and lengthier equipment lifespans.United Rentals Hybrid Power SolutionsUnited Rentals delivers a range of hybrid power solutions to address the specific needs of customer applications and worksites. The United Rentals Power and HVAC team provides support for project planning, equipment decisions, delivery, installation, on-site monitoring, removal and more. Equipment solutions include POWRBANK battery systems, ANA Energy Boss hybrid energy systems, JuiceBox mobile power generators powered by propane or natural gas, EODev GEH2 fuel cell electro-hydrogen generators, diesel generators and more.About United RentalsUnited Rentals, Inc. is the largest equipment rental company in the world.

Cloud and customer consumption revenues jumped 60% and autonomous database revenues were up 47%.Story continuesGen 2 Cloud Driving AI ClienteleOracle’s Gen 2 Cloud has won a contract worth $2 billion from generative AI customers, thanks to extremely high performance and related cost savings of running generative AI workloads.The company noted that Gen 2 Cloud is delivering better performance at a lower cost due to some fundamental advantages compared with other hyperscalers.In Oracle Gen 2 Cloud, the CPUs and GPUs are interconnected using an ultra-high-performance RDMA network, in addition to a dedicated set of cloud-controlled computers that manage security and data privacy, which is helping it to perform better than its competitors.Moreover, the company has added a fast query processor called Heatwave to its new version of MySQL database, which made it much faster than Amazon’s  version of MySQL. Oracle noted that customers are shifting from Amazon Aurora as the addition of Heatwave made query processing 1000 times faster.In the recently concluded first-quarter 2023, Amazon’s cloud division, Amazon Web Services, reported revenues of $21.3 billion, which rose 16% year over year and accounted for 17% of sales.High bandwidth and low-latency RDMA networks are enabling Oracle cloud data centers to build large-scale GPU clusters that are used to train generative large-language models. For instance, NVIDIA is using Oracle Gen 2 Cloud to work on AI development.Oracle is partnering with NVIDIA to build the world's largest high-performance computer, an AI computer, with 16,000 GPUs.The company also announced that it is launching a generative AI cloud service for enterprise customers.As of May 31, 2023, Oracle has 42 public cloud regions around the world, with another seven being built. In addition, 12 of these public cloud regions interconnect with Microsoft’s cloud service, Azure.In terms of performance, Oracle shares have underperformed Amazon but outperformed its other hyperscaler peers like Microsoft and Alphabet year to date. While Oracle has returned 42.4%, Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft gained 50.7%, 40.1% and 38.4%, respectively.Operating DetailsThe non-GAAP total operating expenses increased 23% year over year (up 24% at cc) to $7.681 billion.The non-GAAP operating income was $6.16 billion, up 10.1% year over year (up 12% at cc).

Roughly 49% of total RPO is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months.GuidanceTotal revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, including Cerner, are expected to grow between 7% and 9% at cc and are expected to grow between 8% and 10% in U.S. dollars.Total cloud growth, including Cerner, is expected between 28% and 30% at cc.

When economic uncertainty is high, knowing a dividend payment is coming through helps ease our worries. When the economy is booming, that extra dividend payout is a bonus. So how do we find these real estate investment trust (REIT) stocks to buy?I like hunting down income-generating REIT stocks based on their consistency and quality. In many cases, these names may fly under the radar despite the higher yields and incredible consistency.According to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), “To qualify as a REIT, a company must have the bulk of its assets and income connected to real estate investment and must distribute at least 90 percent of its taxable income to shareholders annually in the form of dividends.”InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDuring certain environments — mostly pertaining to the economy and interest rates — REIT holdings can struggle and we’re seeing that today. However, for many patient investors, it could be an opportunity to buy high-dividend REIT stocks for discounts.REIT Stocks to Buy: Realty Income (O)realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browserSource: ShutterstockRealty Income (NYSE:O) has become known as the Monthly Dividend Company. Only decades of consistency could deliver that type of title. As shares continue to languish around $60, long-term investors seem content to DRIP (dividend reinvestment program) their dividend payouts into the stock, slowly building their stake as shares yield just over 5%.That’s a rather high yield for this stock, which has only yielded more than 5% for brief periods of time over the last decade.The company has now raised its dividend for 103 straight quarters — or four times a year for more than 25 years. How many companies struggle to raise their dividend just once a year over a span like that? Plenty!Further, Realty Income has paid a dividend for 636 consecutive months (or more than 50 years).Lastly, the firm believes in diversification from a tenant and industry perspective, helping to insulate its risk and remain committed to the dividend. When investing in REIT stocks for income, diversification is key.Story continuesThe Longest Streak: Federal Realty (FRT)Commercial shopping center in a tropical climateSource: mTaira / Shutterstock.comLike Realty, it’s been tough to find Federal Realty (NYSE:FRT) with an elevated dividend yield over the last decade. However, despite a recent 15% rally in the stock price from the May low, shares still yield close to 4.5%.For a blue-chip name like this, it should have investors looking at it as one of the REIT stocks to buy.The company recently reported better-than-expected bottom-line results, while its portfolio had 94.2% of its properties leased as of quarter-end of March 31. That’s up 0.50% year over year. Further, CEO Donald Wood said, “Leasing volume has remained strong, exceeding pre-pandemic levels by 20%-30%.”According to the company, “With an increased annual dividend rate for 55 consecutive years, we hold the longest consecutive record in the REIT industry.”Despite a modest sub-$8 billion market cap, Federal Realty holds great properties in numerous markets.Income Generating REIT Stocks: Public Storage (PSA)a Public Storage sign in front of a facility of storage buildingsSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comHave you tried getting a storage unit lately? It seems impossibly difficult and it has been that way for years. As a result, it has us focused on Public Storage (NYSE:PSA). Shares currently yield 4.1% while the stock has been consolidating after a long pullback.PSA stock fell 35% from its high but has been trading between $275 and $300 for months. If the stock can clear multi-quarter resistance around $315, it could have a lot of room for the upside.Here’s the thing, though.The stock paid a dividend of $2.00 a share for years. That’s not like what we were used to with the other companies above — Realty Income and Federal Realty.In 2022, the firm did pay a big special dividend and earlier this year, management raised the payout by 50% to $3.00 a share. So there is a renewed focus on the dividend, but it should be pointed out that the streak is nowhere near some of the stalwarts in the REIT space.On the date of publication, Bret Kenwell did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

For several years, Hasbro’s returns on invested capital have been going the wrong way. That said, we believe the shares possess compelling turnaround and self-help potential.The company has made progress working down excess inventory at retailers. This progress comes in front of an impressive slate of new products and entertainment releases, including movies, which should help catalyze better sales. Hasbro is streamlining operations and strategic focus across its products/gaming/entertainment segments by allocating more resources to growing its larger brands, while simultaneously de-emphasizing smaller brands that have created unnecessary distraction in recent years. Additionally, we expect management to complete a partial divestiture of noncore assets in its entertainment segment to reduce expenses and relieve the burden of inefficiently deployed capital. Furthermore, we are encouraged by Hasbro’s undertaking of a $250-300 million multi-year cost saving initiative and a necessary supply chain management overhaul.Our purchase of Hasbro shares was motivated by these operational/strategic changes, our confidence in the company’s ability to significantly expand operating margins, and compelling multiples of earnings, cashflow and invested capital.""Story continueschild, baby, toyespies/Shutterstock.comHasbro, Inc.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Caterpillar Inc. CAT, salesforce.com inc. CRM, McDonald's Corp. MCD, Visa Inc.'s V and Honeywell International Inc. HON.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Will the Dow Regain Momentum in 2H23?U.S. stock markets rallied in the first half of 2023, after wrapping up 2022 as the worst year since 2008 and terminating a three-year winning streak. Large cap-centric indexes like the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite rallied 15.9% and 31.7%, respectively. The small cap -centric Russell 2000 and the mid cap-centric S&amp;P 400 advanced more than 5% and 7%, respectively. However, the blue-chip Dow gained only 3.8%.Importantly, the first-half rally was primarily driven by growth stocks like technology, communication services and consumer discretionary. These stocks have a relatively low weight in Dow rather than the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. The cyclical stocks, which have more weight in Dow, did not participate in the rally.However, the situation is likely to change in the second half. At present, cyclical stocks are undervalued. Technically, at its current level of 33,944.40, the Dow is well above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages of 33,662.29 and 32,992.06, respectively.The 50-day moving average line is generally recognized as a short-term trendsetter in financial literature, while the 200-day moving average is considered a long-term trend setter. Historically it has been noticed in the technical analysis space that whenever the 50-day moving average line surges ahead of the 200-day moving average line, a long-term uptrend for the index becomes a strong possibility.Our Top PicksDefying a tepid Dow, we have narrowed our search to five blue-chip (components of Dow) stocks with strong potential for 2023. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Story continuesCaterpillar Inc. has seen year-over-year revenue and earnings growth for nine straight quarters thanks to its cost-saving actions, strong end-market demand and pricing actions that offset the impact of supply-chain snarls and cost pressures. We expect the company's adjusted earnings per share for 2023 to grow 19% and revenues to rise 7%.Zacks Rank #2 Caterpillar has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 10.2% and 28.5%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.8% over the last 30 days.salesforce.com inc. is benefiting from a robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. The rapid adoption of its cloud-based solutions is driving demand for CRM's products.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.3% over the last 30 days.McDonald's Corp. continues to impress investors with robust comps growth. MCD's increased focus on menu innovation and loyalty program expansion is commendable. MCD is also undertaking every effort to drive growth in international markets. Robust digitalization is likely to help McDonald's in driving long-term growth and capture market share. MCD plans to open more than 1,900 restaurants globally in 2023.Zacks Rank #2 McDonald's has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 7.7% and 9.5%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days.Visa Inc.'s numerous buyouts and alliances paved the way for long-term growth and consistently drove its revenues. Constant investments in technology are solidifying V's position in the payments market. A shift in payments to the digital mode is a boon. Backed by a strong cash position, Visa remains committed to boosting its shareholder value through share buybacks and dividend payments.Zacks Rank #2 Visa has an expected earnings growth rate of 11% and 14.5%, respectively, for the current year (September 2023). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last 60 days.Honeywell International Inc. is benefiting from a recovery in commercial flight hours and strength in advanced materials and UOP businesses.

Supply-chain disruptions and a tough labor market will provide headwinds.Unfavorable foreign currency translations and high R&amp;D expenses are also likely to limit profits.

323,75b4d3f0-9344-3d9a-ad63-f692ccbec609,MCD,2023-07-13,20 Countries with the Best Food in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-countries-best-food-world-123631020.html,1689165391,STORY,['MCD'],"[In this article, we discuss the 20 countries with the best food in the world. To skip the detailed analysis of the food industry, go directly to the 5 Countries with the Best Food in the World.The food industry is estimated to bring in $9.3 billion in revenue to the global economy in 2023 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.21% between 2023 - 2027.After the Russia-Ukraine war, the global food industry was severely disturbed as Russia and Ukraine are major exporters of grains and oilseeds. Food transport was also heavily affected due to high energy prices. The food prices reached their peak in March 2022 but have since settled down a little. Between March 2022 and 2023, there were 11 back-to-back price declines in the food industry bringing the total decline during the period to 19%.Food prices have a direct impact on many other industries. Research suggests that when food prices rise the consumer demand not only drops for food but also for other consumer products. According to the General Mills, Inc. (NYSE:GIS) CEO, food inflation is expected to weaken but the prices are still expected to remain above historical levels. He said:“There have been a lot of a lot of commentary about disinflation or going negative, but we don’t actually see that. And it’s driven by labor cost inflating.”The company is also expected to hike its prices further during 2023.Restaurant IndustryThe restaurant segment is one of the main components of the food industry and falls under its food services segment. The restaurant industry saw steep declines after the COVID-19 pandemic and went through further disruption during the rising inflation in 2022. Nonetheless, a report states that 3 out of 4 food business operators believe that the conditions for the business are almost normal. In 2023, the food services industry is expected to grow to reach almost $1 trillion in sales and add 500,000 to its workforce.Some restaurant stocks that can prove to be good investments during this recovery period are McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Restaurant Brands International Inc. (NYSE:QSR), and Wingstop Inc. (NASDAQ:WING). These three stocks have already been proving the recovery predictions correct. As of July 4, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) stock is up 11.5%, Restaurant Brands International Inc. (NYSE:QSR) is up 19.8% and Wingstop Inc. (NASDAQ:WING) has increased by 46.6% year-to-date.Story continuesInflation in the US reached its peak of 9.1% in June 2022. Since then there has been a remarkable decline in inflation growth and between June 2022 and March 2023, it dropped to 5%. The number is still significantly higher than the Federal Reserve’s target of 2%. However, if the economy weathers the current storm and gets over this rough economic period, the future for food stocks looks very bright. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM), Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN), and Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) are some stocks that can rally after inflation drops to ideal levels and consumer spending increases.Countries with the Best Food in the WorldPhoto by Lee Myungseong on UnsplashOur MethodologyTo compile this list we used a consensus opinion-based approach and consulted several sources including US News, Ranker, and Travooo along with a few others. Each of the items on our list is in the top 20 of at least one of these sources. We calculated the number of times each country is listed in these sources and calculated the aggregate position of each of these countries according to their position in each of the sources.Countries with the Best Food in the World20. SwitzerlandSwitzerland ranks 20 on our list of countries with the best food in the world. The country is famous for chocolates and its different dishes are mostly made out of dairy products such as cheese, cream, butter, milk, and yogurt. Some of the most famous items in Swiss cuisine are rösti, muesli, and several types of fondues. 19. GermanyGerman cuisine mostly consists of grains, dairy and meat. Most of the German people were dependent on limited food items due to cold weather. Over time, the country’s cuisine got vast due to influence from around the world due to globalization. Germany is most widely known for its delicious pretzels and sausages.18. ArgentinaArgentinian cuisine is a mix of dishes from the indigenous people of the country and was later influenced by Spanish and Italian immigrants. Argentina’s food depends heavily upon meat. The country’s chimichurri and Asado (Argentinian BBQ) are some of the most famous food items in the world.17. TurkeyTurkish cuisine has been influenced by several Asian and European regions mixed with the cuisines from the Ottoman Empire and has influenced several neighboring regions. Some of the most widely used ingredients in Turkish cuisine are all-spice, black pepper, cinnamon, coriander, and poppy seeds along with several others. Baklava and Doner are some of the most famous food items in Turkey.16. MoroccoThe Moroccan cuisine is mostly inspired by the Berber and Arab foods. The country’s cuisine also has some influence on Spanish and Mediterranean cuisine. Moroccan food is rich in meat proteins, herbs, and spices. 15. PeruThe most common ingredient used in Peruvian cuisine is potato. It is the country with the most extensive varieties of potatoes. The modern cuisine of Peru is inspired by Europe, Africa, and Asia along with influences from its old indigenous cuisine. Ceviche and empanadas are a couple of the most famous Peru food items.14. USAThe USA is the most diverse country in the world, which is why its cuisine is globally influenced. The country’s cuisine broadened mostly in the 20th century when the US saw a rush of immigrants. USA is known for its hearty Thanksgiving dinners which include turkey and yams and also its burgers and steaks. American BBQ is also one of the most famous BBQs in the world. Some of the world’s biggest food companies such as McDonald's Corporation (NYSE: MCD), Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG), and The Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY) are also based in the United States.13. PortugalPortugal is famous for its spices and so is the Portuguese cuisine.

Their base cuisine is influenced by dozens of ethnolinguistic groups that live around the Philippines archipelago. 11. JapanJapan gave us sushi, sashimi, and soba noodles.

South KoreaSouth Korean cuisine is ideal for people who want to have a perfect balance of savory and spicy.

The Thai cooking methods are influenced by the Chinese and the cuisine itself has four categories. 8. FranceFrench cuisine is one of the most artistic cuisines in the world. Cooking methods in modern France are mostly credited to Georges Auguste Escoffier, a French chef and culinary writer. Escoffier also identified the five mother sauces used in cooking and created the kitchen brigade, a hierarchy system that is used in almost every professional kitchen around the world. 7. VietnamVietnamese cuisine uses less oil and dairy but a high amount of herbs and vegetables. 6. ChinaThe Chinese cooking style and flavors vary from region to region. However, the most commonly used ingredients are rice, wheat, noodles, soybean products, and several kinds of vegetables and herbs. The use of oil is very little in Chinese cuisine. Some of the biggest Chinese food companies are Yum China Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:YUMC) and Dingdong (Cayman) Limited (NYSE:DDL ). Click to continue reading and see the 5 Countries with the Best Food in the World. Suggested articles:15 States with the Worst Job Markets10 Best July Dividend Stocks To Buy12 Best Cities to Retire in Central AmericaDisclosure.

324,30cb0b58-eec9-36a0-8584-2a40951dbeec,PLD,2023-07-13,Did This REIT Really Go Up 107% In The Last Month?,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/did-reit-really-107-last-180311399.html,1689184991,STORY,"['MSFT', 'NVDA', 'ILPT', 'PLD']","[The buzz among investors over the last few months has been about artificial intelligence (AI) stocks and how NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) and many other tech companies are poised to make billions of dollars from the technology in years to come. As a result, Nvidia, Microsoft and other tech stocks have soared and brought the Nasdaq Stock Exchange back to life again.But tech isn't the only game in town, and occasionally, slower-moving dividend stocks like real estate investment trusts (REITs) have their moments in the sun as well. Traders know that when it comes to making big gains on stocks it's not only what you buy, but when you buy it that counts.Take a look at one heavily beaten down REIT that has rebounded to gain 107.37% over the last four weeks.Industrial Logistics Properties Trust (NASDAQ:ILPT) is a Newton, Massachusetts-based REIT that owns and leases 60 million square feet in 413 industrial and logistics properties throughout the United States. Industrial Logistics owns properties in 39 states, but 54% of those properties are in Hawaii. Of its annualized rental revenue, 78% is derived from investment-grade tenants, such as Amazon.com Inc., The Home Depot Inc. and FedEx Corp. Industrial Logistics is externally managed by the RMR Group Inc. (NASDAQ:RMR).Industrial Logistics was among the worst performing REITs of 2022, falling 87% from $24.69 on the first trading day of the year to a closing price of $3.03 on Dec. 30. But the carnage wasn't over yet. Its share price continued to fall through the early spring of 2023, and on May 15, Industrial Logistics Properties Trust touched a new low of $1.64.The market has a long history of overselling REITs when facing a potential recession, providing an incredible opportunity for investors to ""lock in"" massive yields. Gain access to insights from Benzinga's real estate research team with the free Weekly REIT Report. Story continuesThe main reason for its dismal 17-month performance was its March 2022 acquisition of Monmouth Real Estate for $4 billion in cash. The purchase added $323 million in debt to Industrial Logistics' balance sheet, and despite substantial increases in revenue, the REIT's funds from operations (FFO) fell by 50% year over year in the third quarter, missing estimates as well.In July 2022, to improve its liquidity position, Industrial Logistics was forced to cut its quarterly dividend from $0.33 to only $0.01 per share. This huge cut sent shares skidding almost 30% over the next several weeks. Management said it hoped to restore the dividend payouts by the end of 2023, but investors were not convinced.Industrial Logistics' rental occupancies have also slipped from 99.2% in 2022 to 98.7% in 2023. While that's still admirable and not a huge decline, it makes investors nervous to hear that REIT occupancy levels are declining because it makes them wonder whether further reductions are forthcoming.On April 25, Industrial Logistics announced its first-quarter 2023 operating results. Funds from operations (FFO) of $0.12 was far below FFO of $0.42 in the first quarter of 2022. But revenue of $110.26 beat the estimates of $106.64 million, and the stock rallied for a few days. But it was short-lived, and shares continued to fall until mid-May.June brought a change in fortune. Within the past month, there have been several days where shares of Industrial Logistics spiked higher without any news whatsoever to propel the stock. For example, on June 13, Industrial Logistics closed at $2.26, up 18.9% on 4.3 million shares, about double the volume of the previous day.On June 26, Prologis Inc. (NYSE:PLD) announced it had acquired a $3.1 billion portfolio from Blackstone Inc. The news lifted many other industrial REITs, including Industrial Logistics, with shares climbing 22% from the previous day. On June 30, shares rose another 10%. Clearly, something was going on.One possibility is that in anticipation of the Federal Reserve nearing the end of its tightening cycle, investors are beginning to snatch up oversold, badly beaten-down REITs. Some office REITs have rallied over 18% over the past month, and it looks like shares of some of the beaten-down industrial REITs, such as Industrial Logistics, are also being acquired at bargain prices. While it's true that it's easier for a stock to double from $1.80 than from a much larger share price, the increased volume on Industrial Logistics is a tip-off that institutional money has been at work.Investors still should proceed cautiously. Industrial Logistics is a $3.80 stock that is now extremely overbought after doubling in price over the last month. After such a large gain, it could well be ready for a pullback.Industrial Logistics announced that its second-quarter operating results will be declared after the closing bell on July 25. Given this latest rally on increased volume, it will be interesting to see those results.Weekly REIT Report: REITs are one of the most misunderstood investment options, making it difficult for investors to spot incredible opportunities until it’s too late.

A copy of the same can be downloaded here. On a relative and absolute basis, the fund continued its solid upward movement in the second quarter and returned 14.8% compared to 5.21% for the Russell 2000 Index and 3.18% for the Russell 2000 Value Index. In addition, you can check the top 5 holdings of the fund to know its best picks in 2023.Cove Street Capital highlighted stocks like Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc.

On July 11, 2023, Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:LTRPA) stock closed at $0.8632 per share. One-month return of Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:LTRPA) was 31.79%, and its shares gained 18.65% of their value over the last 52 weeks. Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:LTRPA) has a market capitalization of $242.294 million.Cove Street Capital made the following comment about Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:LTRPA) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:""Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:LTRPA) has been volatile over the last 6 months having been a top contributor to performance in Q1 2023 and now a top detractor in Q2. While travel at large has shown strength, the marketing budgets at hotel and travel related companies – from which the Core TripAdvisor platform takes share – have lagged in the recovery. In the quarter, Trip’s new CEO Matt Goldberg announced his new “strategic plan” to focus on curated travel planning tools, a mobile first approach, better rewards programs, and a more effective use of their data. The investment community largely took a negative view on the plan, desiring more “revolution” than the “evolution” that was delivered. Notwithstanding these concerns, TRIP’s leading experiences OTA Viator has continued its strong growth and more than doubled revenue YoY in Q1 of 2023. Smaller experience OTA competitor GetYourGuide was valued by VCs in June at $2B, and while we certainly don’t benchmark to profligate venture valuations, even a massive discount to that $2B figure for the Viator piece provides a strong case for the overall company with an enterprise value at ~$2.1B today. LTRIPA is a high beta security tied to TripAdvisor (Ticker: TRIP), and our 1.5% allocation is an interesting risk/reward bet on its prospects, which we think are excellent from current levels.""Story continuesLiberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc.

The stock lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 0.74%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.25%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 11.47%.Coming into today, shares of the truck maker had gained 8.37% in the past month. In that same time, the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector gained 25.05%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 3.34%.Paccar will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be July 25, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Paccar to post earnings of $2.11 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 52.9%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $7.95 billion, up 17.12% from the prior-year quarter.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $7.84 per share and revenue of $31.58 billion, which would represent changes of +36.35% and +15.61%, respectively, from the prior year.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Paccar. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.1% higher within the past month. Paccar is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Looking at its valuation, Paccar is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 10.99. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 11.82, so we one might conclude that Paccar is trading at a discount comparatively.Story continuesIt is also worth noting that PCAR currently has a PEG ratio of 1.1. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. PCAR's industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.4 as of yesterday's close.The Automotive - Domestic industry is part of the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 36, putting it in the top 15% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

This company, which is in the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.When looking at the last two reports, this truck maker has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 20.87%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the most recent quarter, Paccar was expected to post earnings of $1.82 per share, but it reported $2.25 per share instead, representing a surprise of 23.63%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.49 per share, while it actually produced $1.76 per share, a surprise of 18.12%.For Paccar, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Paccar currently has an Earnings ESP of +8.13%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on July 25, 2023.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

An improving residential construction market and favorable pricing dynamics have also been aiding companies in navigating hard times. Indeed, macroeconomic uncertainties, supply-chain disruptions, weather-related woes and higher labor costs are causes of concern. Nonetheless, prominent companies in the industry, like Vulcan Materials Company VMC, Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. MLM, Eagle Materials Inc. EXP and Summit Materials, Inc. SUM, have been gaining from the positives.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Building Products - Concrete &amp; Aggregates industry consists of manufacturers, distributors and sellers of construction materials, like aggregates and concrete, along with other related items for public infrastructure, residential and non-residential, as well as other end markets. The materials also include gypsum wallboard, recycled paperboard, concrete blocks, ready-mix concrete, and oil and gas proppants. The industry players are also involved in designing, engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and installation of external building products for commercial, residential, and repair and remodel markets in domestic as well as international markets.3 Trends Shaping the Future of Concrete &amp; Aggregates IndustryFocus on Reviving Infrastructure: On Nov 15, 2021, President Joe Biden signed a bipartisan infrastructure bill of $550 billion, in addition to the approved funds of $450 billion for five years in August 2021. Total spending may go up to $1.2 trillion if the plan is extended to eight years. This bill comprises new investments in almost every infrastructure sector over the next five-year period, including transportation, energy, broadband and water. Out of the total allotted spending, the infrastructure development law will provide $100 billion toward roads, bridges and other major projects. It will invest $66 billion in freight and passenger rail, including potential upgrades to Amtrak. The project will allocate $11 billion to reduce car crashes and fatalities through a “Safe Streets for All” program. The Biden administration’s endeavor to pump money for rebuilding the nation's roads, bridges and other infrastructure would give construction companies like Vulcan, Martin Marietta and others a solid foundation for growth.Acquisitions &amp; Focus on Operating Efficiency: The industry participants follow a well-chalked-out acquisition plan to enhance domestic and international portfolios. Moreover, companies are increasingly focusing on reducing controllable costs and maximizing operating efficiency across business lines to generate higher earnings and cash flows. The industry players have also been experiencing a solid pricing environment across their product portfolios, thereby helping to boost margins.Fluctuation in Input Prices, Weather Woes &amp; Shortage of Skilled Labors: The industry players are struggling with escalating material expenses, the shortage of skilled laborers and rising wage costs. The companies use electricity, diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources. Hence, supply-related woes and significant fluctuations in the prices of these resources affect operating results. Also, businesses are exposed to weather-related risks affecting production schedules and profitability. Excessive rainfall, flooding or severe droughts jeopardize shipments and production. The first and fourth quarters are mostly affected by winter. Again, hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf Coast are most active during these quarters. These impediments may bump up costs and mar the industry participants’ profits.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Building Products - Concrete &amp; Aggregates industry is an eight-stock group within the broader Zacks Construction sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #12, which places it in the top 5% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates impressive near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

QGEN is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, backed by the broad-based organic sales growth from its non-COVID product groups. The company’s next-generation sequencing (NGS) portfolio has been witnessing double-digit revenue growth over the past few quarters. QIAGEN is also progressing well with its testing menu expansion strategy. Meanwhile, COVID’s headwinds in China impacted the company’s international revenues. Escalating expenses are an added concern.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has declined 2.5% compared with a 12% decline of the industry. The S&amp;P 500 composite has witnessed a 15.8% rise in the said time frame.The renowned global provider of sample and assay technologies has a market capitalization of $10.27 billion. QIAGEN has an earnings yield of 4.70% compared with the industry’s -31.47%. QGEN’s earnings surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters, delivering an average surprise of 13.1%.Let’s delve deeper.UpsidesSolid NGS Platform Prospects: In the last reported quarter, Genomics/NGS portfolio reported solid CER growth in the universal NGS kits for use in any sequencer and in the QIAGEN Digital Insights bioinformatics business.

Yet, unfavorable currency movement and rising expenses are major dampeners. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Penumbra has outperformed the industry over the past year. Shares surged 169.5% in this period compared with a 10.9% rise of the industry.Penumbra exited the first quarter of 2023 with better-than-expected results. The company’s vascular and neuro product categories showed encouraging growth trends. Its robust estimate for 2023 revenues reflects continued demand for its products. Strong uptake following the launch of Lightning Flash during the first quarter accelerated the growth of the Vascular business. Penumbra’s Immersive Healthcare business is also making significant progress.The company recently established a multiyear collaboration with the Department of Veteran Affairs Office of Healthcare Innovation and Learning to test, co-develop and scale virtual reality solutions for veterans in multiple healthcare settings, including home. Although currency movements continue to adversely impact the top line, the impact is expected to become favorable in the second half of 2023.

In the first quarter, gross margin was impacted by higher start-up costs associated with multiple new product launches and regional mix. The company also experienced higher seasonality expenditures. Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 11%. Total operating expenses were up 8.8% year over year.Meanwhile, currency movements continue to adversely impact the top line. We note that a significant portion of Penumbra’s sales and costs is exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. The company’s operations use multiple foreign currencies, including the euro and Japanese yen.

The company was awarded by two organizations — Edison Electric Institute and Southeastern Electric Exchange — for first-of-its-kind use of this technology.The first U.S. electric utility to integrate this technology into real-time and market operations was PPL Electric Utilities in 2022. The DLR technology uses sensors to provide real-time data on factors influencing the operation of transmission lines, such as wind speed and line temperature. This information is used to increase the volume of electricity delivered over existing lines when required, thereby decreasing congestion.Since October 2022, the PPL subsidiary has been providing hourly, day-ahead projections produced by the DLR system to PJM Interconnection, the local transmission organization. The objective was to help coordinate more effective power generation and ensure reliability.Importance of DLR TechnologyMany utilities are either already deploying DLR as a practical means of increasing the transmission capacity of grids or considering doing the same. This is because the technology provides system operators with a quickly deployable, inexpensive method of increasing line ratings that can be implemented without the need to build new physical infrastructure or take key lines out of service.DLR deployment can increase transmission and distribution capacity, which, in turn, can boost the amount of power available for dispatch. This increased power supply can help reduce generation dispatch costs.It can also aid in the reduction of congestion costs due to more accurate forecasts by traders and generator commitments in day-ahead markets, as well as a more efficient real-time market with a better estimate for transmission capacity.In 2022, PPL Electric Utilities expected the DLR project to save $23 million annually in congestion costs. Thanks to technology, the unit can now control expenses and allocate funds to other initiatives aimed at enhancing system dependability while eliminating or postponing the need for transmission line modification and extension.Along with PPL, National Grid Transco NGG is also leveraging technology for its electricity transmission network that could expand the capacity of its existing overhead power lines. NGG, along with LineVision, is installing sensors and the DLR platform on a circuit in the North of England to boost its power carrying limit.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NGG’s 2023 earnings per share (EPS) is pegged at $4.52, indicating a year-over-year increase of 17.1%.Story continuesPrice PerformanceIn the last year, shares of PPL have nosedived 2.8% compared with the industry’s 7.6% decline. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Other Stocks to ConsiderPPL currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A couple of other top-ranked stocks from the same industry are TransAlta TAC, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and NiSource Inc.

Tractor Supply Company (NASDAQ:TSCO) has a market capitalization of $24.376 billion.Rowan Street Capital made the following comment about Tractor Supply Company (NASDAQ:TSCO) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:""Our current portfolio is made up of just 10 companies — we are very focused! We described our ‘10-Player All-Star Team’ philosophy in our Q1 2018 Letter (we encourage you to review it). We have been building this portfolio since our founding in 2015. In total, over the past 8 years, we bought stock in 47 different companies (that’s ~6 per year), and obviously, for anyone who is good at arithmetic, we sold 37 of them (~4.6 per year). We are constantly trying to learn from every decision (good or bad) that we make. We went through every position that we’ve sold since 2015 and analyzed how we would have done had we held on to those positions. The top 3 performing positions would have been: Chipotle (CMG) +630%, Tractor Supply Company (NASDAQ:TSCO) +315% and Novo Nordisk (NVO) +387%. Your managers are at fault here because we sold all of these (in 2017-18) for non-fundamental reasons. All of these continued to be great businesses and management has executed at very high levels. In all three cases, we made a decision to sell because we thought the stock price got way ahead of itself.Our main take-away lesson has to be Do NOT sell your winners and avoid adding more to your losers. Or as Peter Lynch once famously put it: “Selling your winners and holding your losers is like cutting the flowers and watering the weeds.”...""

Here are the 2 big reasons whyIf only electric vehicles would shoot sparks — in the marketplace, that is.Don't missRich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market — and are betting on these 3 assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwindsYou could be the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods and CVS (and collect fat grocery store-anchored income on a quarterly basis)Jeff Bezos and Oprah Winfrey invest in this asset to keep their wealth safe — you may want to do the same in 2023Despite the billions of dollars invested by private corporations, and government subsidies, Americans are still indifferent as a whole over electric vehicles.Just two in every 10 Americans say they're “very likely” to buy an EV as their next car, according to a survey by the University of Chicago’s Energy Policy Institute and the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.The U.S. is an outlier on the issueTwo-thirds of Europeans said their next car would likely be an EV, a EIB climate survey shows. Meanwhile, EVs already account for 86% of new car sales in Norway and 72% in Iceland, according to statistics cited by Canary Media.Even Chinese consumers are more enthusiastic about this transition than their American counterparts, those numbers show 16% of all cars sold in China in 2021 were electric, whereas the figure in the U.S. is just 5%, ranking it number 19 out of the 20 countries charted.The Biden Administration can’t be happy with those findings.The transition to clean energy is a key part of the government’s agenda and subsidies in the Inflation Reduction Act were supposed to make EVs more appealing. The legislation earmarked up to $7,500 in tax credits for each American motorist who ditched their gas guzzler. The administration’s strict new pollution limits are intended to push EV sales to 67% of the market by 2032.Unfortunately, the carrot-and-stick approach hasn’t worked. To drive EV adoption higher, the government and auto industry need to resolve two key hurdles for ordinary consumers: cost and infrastructure.Story continuesRead more: 3 big mistakes people make with cash back credit cards that cost them every time they swipeCost and charger conundrumRoughly 80% of Americans name “costs” and the “availability of charging stations” as their EV biggest concerns. There are only 53,000 electric charging stations in the U.S. compared to 145,000 gas stations, according to the World Economic Forum. Charging an EV is substantially more time consuming, which explains why charging stations need to exceed gas stations for comparable availability.Reliability ranks as another key issue. Drivers seldom have to worry about their local gas station being out of service – but one-fourth of charging stations tested by climate advocacy group Cool the Earth didn’t function.Resolving these issues could take years, which means the Biden Administration’s target of 67% EV adoption is likely unrealistic. It also means gas-powered vehicles and fossil fuels are here to stay for the foreseeable future. The petroleum sector is under appreciated by many investors, which could create bargain opportunities.Here are three top oil and gas stocks to put on your radar.Occidental Petroleum Corp.Warren Buffett’s favorite energy stock (NYSE:OXY) is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio just below 7. Berkshire Hathaway recently purchased 4.66 million shares of the Houston-based oil producer for about $275 million. Buffett’s company has been steadily increasing its stake in Occidental Petroleum, having received regulatory approval to up its stake of the company to 50%. If it’s good enough for the Oracle of Omaha, it has to be fit for your fossil fuel watch list.Hess Corp.This New York-based oil and gas giant (NYSE:HES) is special because of its exposure to Guyana. The tiny South American nation discovered oil off its coast a few years ago and could be a major producer, churning out 1 million barrels a day, by 2027. Hess Corp. has a 30% stake in a massive bloc in this region, which means its production is more insulated from government regulation and environmental action than its domestic peers. The stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 20.8.Schlumberger NVDrilling and exporting oil isn’t the only way to make money in this sector. Maintaining and servicing equipment at oil fields is just as important. The world’s largest energy equipment services corporation (NYSE:SLB) could see significant growth in demand as energy production remains elevated for the foreseeable future.

ILMN recently announced the launch of the latest version of DRAGEN software, DRAGEN 4.2, for analysis of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. DRAGEN 4.2 is expected to expand accuracy combined with its flexibility and scalability to enable efficient workflows and extract meaningful insights from genomic data.The latest launch is expected to significantly solidify Illumina’s foothold in the global genomics analysis space and boost its sequencing business.Significance of the LaunchPer an expert familiar with the use of DRAGEN software, the latest offering of DRAGEN 4.2 is likely to be a significant step for genomics analysis as it combines the detection of multiple variant types in addition to a single nucleotide variant or SNV. This will likely foster a comprehensive analysis of genomic samples. The expert also feels that DRAGEN 4.2’s new features, which include new approaches for cardiovascular diseases such as callers for Lipoprotein(a) or LP(a), will likely provide a deeper insight into the gene.Per Illumina, LP(a) is currently emerging as a clinically significant potential risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Targeted calling of the genetic variant associated with high levels of LP(a) can further help clinical research and aid in the development of testing and therapies.Per Illumina’s management, DRAGEN’s ability to perform high-quality, fast, accurate and comprehensive NGS analysis workflows is expected to be ideally suited to support the healthcare and research industry in secondary analysis.Industry ProspectsPer a report by MarketsandMarkets, the global genomics market was estimated to be $46.2 billion in 2023 and is anticipated to reach $83.1 billion by 2028 at a CAGR of 12.4%. Factors like the growing demand for gene therapy, increasing cancer incidence and significant decrease in sequencing costs are likely to drive the market.Given the market potential, the launch seems to have been timed well.Story continuesNotable DevelopmentsLast month, Illumina announced the new PrimateAI-3D, an artificial intelligence algorithm that predicts disease-causing genetic mutations in patients.In April, Illumina announced its first-quarter 2023 results, wherein it registered an improvement in its top line on a sequential basis.

ALC scaled a new 52-week high of $83.89 on Jul 11, before closing the session slightly lower at $83.78.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has gained 19% compared with the 15.4% rise of the industry. The S&amp;P 500 has witnessed a 18.5% growth in the said time frame.The company’s long-term expected growth rate of 14.9%. DaVita’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and break-even in one, the average surprise being 8.9%.Alcon is witnessing an upward trend in its stock price, prompted by solid demand, strong commercial execution and pricing improvements across the Surgical and Vision Care franchises. The upbeat guidance for 2023 is encouraging. However, escalated costs and a tough competitive space do not bode well for Alcon.Let’s delve deeper.Key Growth DriversSurgical Business Grows: In the first quarter, Total Surgical (consisting of implantables, consumables and equipment/other) recorded sales growth of 8% at CER. Within Implantables, excluding the impact from Korea, sales were up nearly 5% on a reported basis and approximately 9% on a constant-currency basis. The company continued with its ATIOL market leadership for another quarter with approximately half of the global market and two thirds of the U.S. market, despite increasing competitive activity. In consumables, first-quarter sales were up 13%, driven by favorable market conditions and pricing. In equipment, sales were up 14% year over year on continued strong demand for cataract and Vit-Ret devices, particularly in international markets as the company upgraded and expanded its installed base.Vision Care Returns to Growth: Total Vision Care (comprising contact lenses and ocular health) reported sales grew 16% year over year at CER. The upside includes approximately 5 points contribution from the ophthalmic pharmaceutical products the company acquired in 2022.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesNet sales of contact lenses increased 10% at CER. Sales were led by continued growth in silicone hydrogel contact lenses, including the Precision1 and Total product families and price increases.Upbeat Guidance: The company maintained its net sales projection in the range of $9.2-$9.4 billion, indicating growth of 6-8% at CER from 2022. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ALC’s revenues is pegged at $9.24 billion.Alcon raised its projection of core earnings per share in the range of $2.55-$2.65, suggesting growth of 20-24% at CER over 2022. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ALC’s earnings is currently pegged at $2.59 per share.DownsidesCost Pressure Remains: The cost of net sales in the quarter was up 6.5% year over year. The core operating margin was 14.2% in the quarter, contracting 14 bps year over year at CER. The company’s operating margin in the quarter was impacted by an unfavorable product mix from lower PCIOL sales in South Korea, higher R&amp;D investment following the acquisition of Aerie and a negative 1.3% impact from currency.Tough Competitive Landscape: The ophthalmology industry is highly competitive. In both surgical and vision care businesses, Alcon faces intense competition. In the surgical business, Alcon faces a mixture of competitors, ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small manufacturers that offer a limited selection of specialized products.Other Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

Many of them are set to beat on earnings results. This may generate further upside for stocks.Stocks in FocusWe have narrowed our search to five U.S. corporate behemoths that are poised to beat on second-quarter earnings results next week and provided more than 20% returns year to date.

(NYSE:MHK) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:""Consumer Discretionary. Mohawk Industries, Inc. (NYSE:MHK) is a new position that represents a perfect example of a stock that has “come to us.” A leading manufacturer of flooring including carpets, tiles, and wood and vinyl products for the residential and commercial markets, Mohawk ran into stiff headwinds in recent years owing to high inflation in its source materials. This compressed their margins, and the stock price was nearly cut in half between June 2021 and early this year.We believe the worst of those pricing pressures are largely behind the business, which stands to benefit from several trends, including ongoing growth in home remodeling; the anticipated reacceleration of existing home sales once rates begin to stabilize; and office space conversions as the commercial real estate market struggles with hybrid work.

The study enrolled more than 300 patients (age ≥2 to &lt;12 years) diagnosed with AD for at least three months and who were candidates for topical therapy.Atopic dermatitis is a chronic skin condition characterized by inflammation and itchiness, affecting approximately 13% of all children in the United States. The symptoms of AD include redness, dry skin and intense itch.The study successfully met its primary endpoint, demonstrating that a significantly higher number of patients treated with ruxolitinib cream achieved Investigator's Global Assessment Treatment Success (IGA-TS) compared to those treated with a non-medicated cream. Patients treated with ruxolitinib cream 0.75% and 1.5% demonstrated a significantly higher treatment success rate compared to those using the non-medicated cream.The positive results from the TRuE-AD3 study highlight the potential of ruxolitinib cream to provide an effective non-steroidal topical therapy for children suffering from this condition.The overall safety profile of ruxolitinib cream remained consistent with previous data, with no new safety signals observed. The long-term safety portion of the study will proceed as planned.The positive data from the TRuE-AD1 and TRuE-AD2 studies, involving adult and adolescent patients, further reinforce the potential of ruxolitinib cream as an effective topical therapy. Incyte plans to discuss these favorable results with regulatory agencies to determine the next steps in the approval process.Opzelura, the topical cream formulation of Incyte's selective JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib, has already received approval from FDA for the treatment of nonsegmental vitiligo in patients aged 12 years and older. Opzelura is also approved in the United States for the short-term and non-continuous chronic treatment of mild-to-moderate AD in non-immunocompromised patients aged 12 years and older, when other topical prescription therapies are not effective or advisable.Story continuesOpzelura cream 15mg/g is approved in Europe for the treatment of non-segmental vitiligo with facial involvement in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age.Incyte has worldwide rights for the development and commercialization of ruxolitinib cream, marketed in the United States and Europe as Opzelura.Shares of the company are down 21.7% in the year so far compared with the industry’s decline of 10.6%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe initial uptake of Opzelura has been strong. Positive regulatory decisions would likely lead to increased uptake of Opzelura in the market, expanding the patient population that can benefit from this innovative therapy. The potential approval of Opzelura for pediatric use opens up a new market segment and presents a growth opportunity for Incyte.We note that ruxolitinib is approved under the brand name Jakafi for the treatment of patients with polycythemia vera (PV) who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant to hydroxyurea. It is also approved for patients with intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis (MF), including primary MF, post-PV MF and post-essential thrombocythemia MF. The drug is also approved in the United States for treating steroid-refractory acute graft versus host disease in adult and pediatric patients aged 12 years or older.Incyte has a collaboration agreement with Swiss pharma giant Novartis NVS for Jakafi.Jakafi is marketed by Incyte in the United States and by Novartis as Jakavi outside the country.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderIncyte currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

BKD recently unveiled that its weighted average occupancy improved 160 basis points (bps) year over year to 76.8% in June 2023. The reported figure also represented an increase of 20 bps from the May level.The last month marked the rise in the weighted average occupancy level of BKD on a year-over-year basis for 20 straight months. Further, in the second quarter of 2023, the metric increased 190 bps year over year to 76.5%. It also denoted a 20 bps improvement from the first quarter of 2023. Consistent growth in weighted average occupancy level implies growing patient volumes, which brings a ray of hope for healthcare facility operators like Brookdale whose primary revenue source depends on the patient base.Through its affiliates, BKD operated and managed 672 senior living communities across 41 states as of Jun 30, 2023. Its scale, clinical prowess and innovative healthcare services position it well to cater to over 60,000 residents. An aging U.S. population is also likely to sustain the solid demand for healthcare services provided by BKD.Results of Brookdale suffered a significant setback due to COVID-induced restrictions imposed on visitors and move-ins across several of its senior communities. As an evidence of the same, it suffered a loss of 1,330 bps of weighted average occupancy consolidated senior housing occupancy between March 2020 and February 2021, which in turn, resulted in a substantial loss of resident fee revenues. The adverse effect of the pandemic even led BKD to witness its lowest-ever weighted average occupancy of 69.4% in February 2021.As the pandemic effects began to recede in 2022, the senior living community operator embarked on key initiatives to revive its occupancy levels and implement prudent rate increases for care and other services delivered.  The efforts bore fruits, as BKD was able to realize 760 bps of weighted average consolidated senior housing occupancy by the end of December 2022. This year, Brookdale aims to restore its occupancy back to or above pre-pandemic levels. Story continuesHigher occupancy levels might boost resident fee revenues, the most significant contributor to Brookdale’s top line. It accounted for 94.7% of BKD’s overall revenues in the first quarter of 2023. An increase in resident fees is likely to provide an impetus to adjusted EBITDA, which is anticipated within $72 million and $77 million in the second quarter of 2023. The mid-point of the guidance implies 46.9% growth year over year.Shares of Brookdale have gained 57.9% year to date against the industry’s 0.1% decline.

The award recognizes the top 80 companies that create and use best practices in hiring, retaining and promoting multicultural women in the United States.""Inclusion is a key pillar of Whirlpool Corp.'s enduring values, and we have continuously worked to create a culture where every person is welcome, respected, valued and heard,"" Kim Kavala, senior director of inclusion &amp; diversity and global learning, said. ""We are proud these efforts have once again been recognized by Seramount and remain committed to celebrating diverse perspectives and taking meaningful action to embed inclusion and belongingness throughout our organization and the communities where we live.""For 111 years, Whirlpool Corp. has been committed to supporting its employees, who embody the company's dedication to improve life at home, in the community and on the planet. CEO and Chairman Marc Bitzer became a Catalyst CEO Champion for Change signatory in 2018, pledging to increase the Whirlpool Corp.'s female representation in executive and senior level positions and ensure accelerated inclusion of women, including women of color, in senior roles. Representation of women at the most senior levels has increased overall as a result of this focus. The company also made significant strides to progress its U.S. Racial Equality Pledge including establishing new unconscious bias training, expanding its mentorship program to facilitate relationships for Black managers and senior managers.Whirlpool Corporation maintains 17 employee resource groups (ERGs) globally to further raise awareness for an inclusive culture, including the Whirlpool Women's Network (WWN), which empowers and engages women at all levels within the corporation and community through engagement, development and career progression.Story continuesThe company is frequently recognized for its efforts to cultivate an inclusive and diverse workplace and was recently honored by U.S. News &amp; World Report as One of the Best Companies to Work For in 2023 as well as named One of America's Most JUST Companies for 2023.To create its annual list, Seramount asked companies close to 600 questions on representation; hiring, attrition, and promotion rates; recruitment, retention, and advancement programs; and company culture. The 2023 Seramount survey also assessed progress for women by specific racial/ethnic group as well as factors influencing that progress, including mental health, anti-racism progress, and participation in mentoring and sponsorship programs. The report found that there has been significant progress in creating cultures encouraging multicultural women to join and rise through the ranks.This year's Best Companies for Multicultural Women employ about 3.9 million people at 39,810 work sites in every state across 16 industries. Key findings in the survey showed that multicultural women make up 10 percent of corporate executives this year, in comparison to only 8 percent last year. In addition, multicultural women represent 15 percent of the highest earnings, 1 percent more than last year.View original content hereWhirlpool Corporation, Wednesday, July 12, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Whirlpool Corporation on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Whirlpool CorporationWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/whirlpool-corporationEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Whirlpool CorporationView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/767394/Whirlpool-Corporation-Recognized-as-One-of-the-2023-Best-Companies-for-Multicultural-Women]"

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Trane Technologies (TT) earns a Zacks Rank #2 21 days from its next quarterly earnings release on August 2, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $2.60 a share.TT has an Earnings ESP figure of 1.87%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $2.60 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.55.TT is just one of a large group of Business Services stocks with a positive ESP figure. Fiserv (FI) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Fiserv, which is readying to report earnings on July 25, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $1.83 a share, and FI is 13 days out from its next earnings report.Fiserv's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 1.29% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.81.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, TT and FI could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

370,56e8d976-bc7c-36c0-ba3c-27e276352002,VMC,2023-07-13,Vulcan Materials' (NYSE:VMC) investors will be pleased with their favorable 82% return over the last three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vulcan-materials-nyse-vmc-investors-114500252.html,1689248700,STORY,['VMC'],"[By buying an index fund, you can roughly match the market return with ease. But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. For example, Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC) shareholders have seen the share price rise 77% over three years, well in excess of the market return (33%, not including dividends). On the other hand, the returns haven't been quite so good recently, with shareholders up just 51% , including dividends .So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 3 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. Check out our latest analysis for Vulcan Materials There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During three years of share price growth, Vulcan Materials achieved compound earnings per share growth of 0.1% per year. In comparison, the 21% per year gain in the share price outpaces the EPS growth. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did three years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the three-year track record of earnings growth. This optimism is also reflected in the fairly generous P/E ratio of 47.02.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthThis free interactive report on Vulcan Materials' earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Vulcan Materials the TSR over the last 3 years was 82%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Vulcan Materials shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 51% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 13% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Vulcan Materials better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Vulcan Materials .Of course Vulcan Materials may not be the best stock to buy.

371,4138c0c9-c3c8-3d77-86bd-7aa07e444743,VMC,2023-07-13,4 Stocks to Buy From Promising Concrete & Aggregates Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-stocks-buy-promising-concrete-160500116.html,1689177900,STORY,"['MLM', 'VMC', 'EXP', 'SUM', '^GSPC']","[A boost in infrastructural and public construction spending should continue to favor the Zacks Building Products - Concrete &amp; Aggregates industry. An improving residential construction market and favorable pricing dynamics have also been aiding companies in navigating hard times. Indeed, macroeconomic uncertainties, supply-chain disruptions, weather-related woes and higher labor costs are causes of concern. Nonetheless, prominent companies in the industry, like Vulcan Materials Company VMC, Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. MLM, Eagle Materials Inc. EXP and Summit Materials, Inc. SUM, have been gaining from the positives.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Building Products - Concrete &amp; Aggregates industry consists of manufacturers, distributors and sellers of construction materials, like aggregates and concrete, along with other related items for public infrastructure, residential and non-residential, as well as other end markets. The materials also include gypsum wallboard, recycled paperboard, concrete blocks, ready-mix concrete, and oil and gas proppants. The industry players are also involved in designing, engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and installation of external building products for commercial, residential, and repair and remodel markets in domestic as well as international markets.3 Trends Shaping the Future of Concrete &amp; Aggregates IndustryFocus on Reviving Infrastructure: On Nov 15, 2021, President Joe Biden signed a bipartisan infrastructure bill of $550 billion, in addition to the approved funds of $450 billion for five years in August 2021. Total spending may go up to $1.2 trillion if the plan is extended to eight years. This bill comprises new investments in almost every infrastructure sector over the next five-year period, including transportation, energy, broadband and water. Out of the total allotted spending, the infrastructure development law will provide $100 billion toward roads, bridges and other major projects. It will invest $66 billion in freight and passenger rail, including potential upgrades to Amtrak. The project will allocate $11 billion to reduce car crashes and fatalities through a “Safe Streets for All” program. The Biden administration’s endeavor to pump money for rebuilding the nation's roads, bridges and other infrastructure would give construction companies like Vulcan, Martin Marietta and others a solid foundation for growth.Acquisitions &amp; Focus on Operating Efficiency: The industry participants follow a well-chalked-out acquisition plan to enhance domestic and international portfolios. Moreover, companies are increasingly focusing on reducing controllable costs and maximizing operating efficiency across business lines to generate higher earnings and cash flows. The industry players have also been experiencing a solid pricing environment across their product portfolios, thereby helping to boost margins.Fluctuation in Input Prices, Weather Woes &amp; Shortage of Skilled Labors: The industry players are struggling with escalating material expenses, the shortage of skilled laborers and rising wage costs. The companies use electricity, diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources. Hence, supply-related woes and significant fluctuations in the prices of these resources affect operating results. Also, businesses are exposed to weather-related risks affecting production schedules and profitability. Excessive rainfall, flooding or severe droughts jeopardize shipments and production. The first and fourth quarters are mostly affected by winter. Again, hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf Coast are most active during these quarters. These impediments may bump up costs and mar the industry participants’ profits.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Building Products - Concrete &amp; Aggregates industry is an eight-stock group within the broader Zacks Construction sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #12, which places it in the top 5% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates impressive near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually gaining confidence in this group’s bottom-line growth potential. Since April 2023, the industry’s earnings estimates for 2023 and 2024 have increased 9% and 10.3% to $1.94 and $2.25 per share, respectively.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms Sector, S&amp;P 500The Zacks Building Products - Concrete &amp; Aggregates industry has outperformed the broader Zacks Construction sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.Stocks in this industry have collectively gained 52.2% versus the broader sector’s rise of 36.8% over the past year. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 has gained 15.7% in the same period.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month price to earnings, which is a commonly used multiple for valuing Building Products - Concrete &amp; Aggregates stocks, the industry is currently trading at 19.8X versus the S&amp;P 500’s 19.5X and the sector’s 16.1X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 24.7X, as low as 13.6X and at a median of 19.3X, as the chart below shows.Industry’s P/E Ratio (Forward 12-Month) Versus S&amp;P 5004 Concrete &amp; Aggregates Stocks to Bet OnBelow, we have discussed four stocks from the Zacks Concrete &amp; Aggregates universe that have solid earnings growth potential.

Eagle Materials Inc.: This Dallas, TX-based company produces and supplies heavy construction materials, light building materials and materials used for oil and natural gas extraction in the United States. Improved cement, concrete and aggregates sales volume, as well as a solid contribution from the recently acquired business, are aiding the company’s growth. Higher pricing is adding to the positives. The company remains well-positioned courtesy of its broad geographic footprint, population-growth trends, shortages of residential units, and higher state-level infrastructure spending owing to a multi-year federal highway bill.Eagle Materials currently sports a Zacks Rank #1. The shares have rallied 62.2% in the past year. Also, fiscal 2024 earnings estimates have increased 9.6% to $13.57 per share from $12.38, over the past 60 days. This depicts analysts’ optimism over the company’s prospects. Earnings for fiscal 2024 are expected to grow 8.3%.Price and Consensus: EXPVulcan Materials Company: This Birmingham, AL-based company produces and supplies construction aggregates, asphalt mix as well as ready-mixed concrete. The company’s focus on four strategic initiatives — Commercial Excellence, Operational Excellence, Strategic Sourcing, and Logistics Innovation — should enhance price performance and operating efficiencies. Vulcan Materials has been generating higher earnings on the back of prudent cost-control efforts and increased pricing in aggregates. Its focus on a systematic inorganic strategy for expansion is adding to the positives. Overall, improving residential and private non-residential construction, solid infrastructure investment and favorable pricing dynamics should drive growth.Vulcan currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. The company’s shares have risen 52.9% over the past year. Earnings estimates for 2023 have increased to $6.45 per share from $6.40, over the past 60 days. The estimated figure indicates 26.2% year-over-year growth.Price and Consensus: VMC Martin Marietta Materials: Based in Raleigh, NC, Martin Marietta produces and supplies construction aggregates as well as other heavy building materials — mainly cement — in the United States. Expanded infrastructure investment, recovering private non-residential and residential markets, heavy industrial projects of scale, large-scale energy projects and domestic manufacturing are expected to support near-term shipment levels. Also, the company has been realigning its overall portfolio for opportunities to maximize value by monetizing or exchanging select assets. Also, proficient acquisitions have been enhancing its reach in new geographies for consistent industry-leading growth.Martin Marietta currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. The company's shares have rallied 45.1% in the past year. Earnings estimates for 2023 have increased to $15.89 per share from $15.84, over the past 60 days. Also, earnings for 2023 are expected to rise 31.7%.Price and Consensus: MLMSummit Materials: Based in Denver, CO, this is a construction material company. Summit Materials has been witnessing solid pricing growth across all lines of business and expects the trend to continue in 2023. The company has also been optimizing its portfolio as it intends to shift toward a more materials-led portfolio. Meanwhile, the company remains optimistic as it believes public markets are poised to experience robust and durable growth driven by well-funded state budgets and infrastructure funding. A solid state Department of Transportation budget flow will aid the company, which has been receiving more contracts associated with highways and related works.Summit Materials currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. The company's shares have rallied 59% in the past year. Earnings estimates for 2023 have increased to $1.50 per share from $1.46, over the past 60 days.

In the past year, the stock has lost 14% against the industry’s increase of 18.1%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBusiness TailwindsCincinnati Financial is well-poised to grow on the back of solid performance across the Commercial Lines and Personal Lines segments. Performance of the Personal Lines segment is likely to be driven by the planned expansion of high-net-worth business produced by the agencies, higher renewal written premiums and the extended use of pricing precision tools.The Commercial Lines business is expected to gain from solid premiums earned, reflecting renewal written premium growth that continued to include higher average pricing and improved level of insured exposures.Investment income should continue to rise because of the surge in equity portfolio dividends and interest income. Moreover, cash flow from operating activities consistently helps the company boost investment income.The property and casualty insurer is focused on earning new business through appointment of new agencies from a combination of quality service and expansion of insurance products for clients of those agencies. Agencies, appointed since the beginning of 2022, contributed 5% of total new business written premiums. So far in 2023, the insurer has appointed 66 agencies, including 23 that market only personal lines products.Cincinnati Financial has a solid balance sheet with high liquidity and low leverage. Cash flow, a contributor to investment income and interest income, remains strong.CINF has returned capital to shareholders through regular cash dividends as well as special dividends. In January 2023, the board increased quarterly cash dividend by 9% and this action sets the stage for a 63rd consecutive year of rising dividend payments.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings has moved 0.5% north in the past 60 days.

However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. In this article, we decided to focus on UnitedHealth Group's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. Check out our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for UnitedHealth Group is:23% = US$21b ÷ US$91b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.23 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.A Side By Side comparison of UnitedHealth Group's Earnings Growth And 23% ROETo begin with, UnitedHealth Group has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 11% which is quite remarkable. This probably laid the groundwork for UnitedHealth Group's moderate 11% net income growth seen over the past five years.Story continuesWe then performed a comparison between UnitedHealth Group's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 12% in the same 5-year period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is UNH fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is UnitedHealth Group Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?UnitedHealth Group has a healthy combination of a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 30% (or a retention ratio of 70%) and a respectable amount of growth in earnings as we saw above, meaning that the company has been making efficient use of its profits.Besides, UnitedHealth Group has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 25%. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that UnitedHealth Group's future ROE will be 28% which is again, similar to the current ROE.SummaryIn total, we are pretty happy with UnitedHealth Group's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. The latest industry analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to maintain its current growth rate.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of popular hedge funds and their performance, head directly to 5 Most Owned Stocks by Hedge Funds. In 2022, the hedge fund industry experienced a decline of 2.4%, showing some improvement from a challenging first half of the year when the industry was down 4.6%. The losses were primarily influenced by the difficult market circumstances for high-risk assets, particularly impacting hedge funds with a long-biased approach and/or higher volatility. This marked the weakest performance for the hedge fund industry since 2018 when it also posted a 2.4% loss. Looking at the five-year performance, hedge funds have achieved a compounded annual return of +4.2%, demonstrating a more favorable performance compared to bonds, which experienced a decline of 2.0%. Aurum, a hedge fund investment specialist, noted that there were clear winners and losers in the hedge fund industry in 2022. The best-performing strategies were multi-strategy (+9.5%), quant (+8.5%), and macro (+6.7%). Strategies that typically have a higher correlation to equities and fixed income, which experienced poor performance, struggled the most. Patrick Ghali, managing partner of hedge fund advisory firm Sussex Partners, told Reuters on January 10, 2023: ""Investors need to look under the surface to understand the industry performance last year. Long-short hedge funds are the biggest asset-weighted part of the industry. Overall, I believe it was a good year for hedge funds.""Don't Miss: 15 Most Profitable Hedge Funds in the WorldAccording to Hedge Fund Research (HFR), the total global capital invested in hedge funds reached $3.83 trillion by the end of 2022, reflecting a quarterly increase of $44 billion. Hedge funds managed by The Citco Group Limited experienced a weighted-average return of -7.02% for the entire year. Smaller funds generally outperformed larger ones, as indicated by the median return of -2.86%. HFR also highlighted that macro strategies, including fundamental commodity, discretionary, and quantitative trend-following CTA sub-strategies, were the leading hedge fund strategies globally. Story continuesDespite the dull performance of hedge funds, Citadel, led by Ken Griffin, achieved an exceptional feat by generating an unprecedented $16 billion in profits for its clients in 2022. This performance not only surpassed other players in the industry but also stands as one of the most prominent financial successes in history. Chairman Rick Sopher of LCH Investments commented: “The largest gains were once again made by the large multi-strategy hedge funds like Citadel, DE Shaw and Millennium. The strong gains they have generated in recent years reflect their increasing dominance in strategies which do not depend on rising asset prices, and their substantial size.”Individual investors often look up to elite hedge funds and try to imitate their performance.

These are the most owned stocks among hedge funds.25 Most Owned Stocks by Hedge Fundsdrserg / Shutterstock.comMost Owned Stocks by Hedge Funds25. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 91Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) operates supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs, cash and carry stores, and discount stores. On February 21, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) declared a $0.57 per share quarterly dividend, a 1.8% increase from its prior dividend of $0.56. The next dividend payment is to be made on September 5, to shareholders of record as of August 11. 2023 marks the 50th consecutive year of dividend increases for the retail giant. In the first quarter of 2023, D E Shaw held the largest stake in the company, comprising 4.8 million shares worth approximately $710 million. In addition to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is one of the most owned stocks by hedge funds. In its Q2 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“The pandemic has created challenges for businesses large and small; one major challenge for large essential retailers such as ClearBridge holdings Home Depot, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Costco have been ensuring adequate staffing to meet demand under trying conditions. All three instituted enhanced pay practices during the pandemic, with raises, unplanned bonuses and other benefits helping compensate employees for their efforts in a difficult environment. In September 2020 Walmart raised wages for 165,000 employees, including a number of entry positions to $15 an hour. It followed this in February with a raise for 425,000 workers that moved its average pay above $15 an hour.”24. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 91Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) provides banking and financial products and services. The company’s operations are divided into Consumer Banking, Global Wealth &amp; Investment Management, Global Banking, and Global Markets segments. It is one of the top most owned stocks by hedge funds. On July 5, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) announced that it will increase its quarterly dividend from $0.22 per share to $0.24 per share, beginning in the third quarter. This decision comes after successfully completing the Federal Reserve's annual stress test and is subject to approval from the board of directors. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 91 hedge funds were long Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), compared to 100 funds in the earlier quarter. ClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy made the following comment about Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“Our quality bias has always led us to gravitate toward banks with strong and diverse deposit bases; those we own tend to be the larger players, which we also expect to be the biggest beneficiaries from a flight to safety in terms of deposits. JPMorgan Chase comes to mind especially here, but so does Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) despite its weakness in March, as well as U.S. Bancorp, to which we added opportunistically in the quarter.”23. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 95On June 27, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) stock saw a slight increase in pre-market trading after Bank of America expressed confidence in the company's strategic direction. Despite concerns regarding the box office, streaming business, and other challenges, analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich maintained a Buy rating and set a price target of $135 on the shares. The analyst acknowledged that some recent content, including the Pixar film Elemental, did not meet audience expectations, but attributed this to production circumstances during the pandemic and past leadership. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is one of the most owned stocks by hedge funds. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) was part of 95 hedge fund portfolios, with Nelson Peltz’s Trian Partners holding the largest stake, consisting of 5.9 million shares worth $592.4 million. VGI Partners made the following comment about The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) in its 2022 annual investor letter:“The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is a diversified media conglomerate operating media networks, theme parks, film and TV studios and direct-to-consumer streaming services. It is the global leader in theme parks with hotels and cruise lines aimed at families. Key assets within Disney are the instantly recognisable entertainment franchises that have multiple avenues of monetisation such as Mickey Mouse, Star Wars, ABC and Marvel’s Avengers.Disney’s share price declined due to a number of factors in 2022, presenting us the chance to purchase a long-admired business and its unique collection of valuable intellectual property assets at what we consider to be a very attractive valuation. Summarily, the EPS of Disney has declined from US$7 in 2018 to ~US$2.60 in 2022 but we believe that the earnings power of the assets has not diminished to anywhere near this extent.Disney is currently undergoing a business transition within the Media and Entertainment Distribution division (DMED) from traditional media property distribution via third parties (i.e. cinemas and broadcast networks) to a Direct-To-Consumer (DTC) model via the Disney+ streaming service. A key element of our thesis is that the earnings power of the company is currently being masked by the marketing and content investments within Disney+ and that this will normalize over the next several years. To put this in perspective, Disney+ (DTC sub-segment) currently generates operating losses of over US$3.3bn (a negative 14% operating margin) compared to operating margins at its nearest streaming competitor, Netflix, of +15.5%…” (Click here to read the full text)22. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 96ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) provides cloud computing solutions worldwide that help define, organize, streamline, and automate services.

(NYSE:NOW) in its April 2023 investor letter:“Despite a difficult macro environment, US-based software company ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) proved resilient with a healthy combination of organic growth and profitability. Subscription revenues grew 24% year-on-year (27% constant currency) to $2.0 billion and operating income grew 26% year-on-year to $552 million. The company’s core operating metrics were equally strong with remaining performance obligations growing 24% year-on-year and renewal rates holding firm at 98%. ServiceNow’s renewal rates are noteworthy as not only are they best-in-class but they are also remarkably consistent, typically in the range of 97% to 99%. They speak to the mission critical nature of the platform and are a key driver of long term annuity value. Overall, we continue to believe that ServiceNow is one of the highest quality software businesses around as the combination of consistent growth at scale, robust free cash flow generation and a large addressable market make it an attractive opportunity.”21. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 98Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

The company effectively sells pickaxes and shovels to the life sciences industry, is well balanced, is durable, and has a strong management team at the helm. We took an initial position recently and are now raising it to an average weight within the Portfolio. During the most recent quarter, the company grew revenue 11% in constant currency. Core organic growth, excluding COVID-19 testing revenue which fell 16%, grew a very strong 13%. This company plays an important role within the Portfolio as a “safety” within our growth spectrum approach and over the next five years we expect EBITDA and EPS to grow at roughly low double digits and low teens, respectively.”20. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99Adobe Inc.

If you own an iPhone, then you have an Apple Pay preloaded digital wallet. If you have a Samsung phone, you have Samsung Pay available for use. Those two, along with Google Pay and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), are the four most popular digital wallets today. According to the Payments Journal, PayPal has been used (over the last 12 months) by 62% of American consumers, followed by Apple Pay at 41% and Google Pay at 32%.Over the last several years, P2P payments have made tremendous strides in adoption and usage. Whenever something becomes a verb, like just Venmo me $10, you know that it has been widely embraced by society. The concept of allowing individuals to pay each other, via our smartphones, has clearly taken off.However, the biggest flaw or issue (that we’ve identified) is interoperability. Digital wallets allow users to pick their favorite card to make payments with. P2P acts as a bit of a “walled garden” and its funding source is still siloed. This is a critical aspect for future P2P growth, as Venmo users can’t pay Cash App users who can’t pay Zelle users. Visa is launching Visa+ next year and it has already signed up PayPal and Venmo as its initial customers. The global card networks seem like the perfect piece to solve this interoperability puzzle. Of course, this will only work if banks allow an independent network to serve as the gateway between disparate user bases…” (Click here to read the full text)17. Netflix, Inc.

(NYSE:JPM) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“It will be interesting to see what kind of policy decisions are made around regulation for institutions that are between $100 billion of assets and $700 billion of assets. As JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM)’s purchase of First Republic shows, scale is a competitive advantage. It now has 13% of total US deposits and it manages 21% of America’s credit card spending. With additional regulatory burdens coming, banks are facing a profitability headwind and 100 to 300 basis points of possible ROE erosion.The banking sector is facing a slow-moving crisis, but we aren’t sure it is enough to sink the overall health of the US consumer or economy. Credit will contract and lending standards will continue to rise. However, we do not see this problem escalating to the size and scale of previous banking crises.Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JP Morgan Chase clearly sees the risks these FINTECH companies present. In his annual letter to shareholders, he stated that all incumbent banks should be “scared shitless” of these FINTECH rivals. Not only is his bank being attacked from multiple angles, but Apple just launched a cash management program with Goldman Sachs. On the first day of Apple’s savings program, it raised $400 million and eclipsed $1 billion in its first four days. Dimon specifically labeled Apple a bank the other day in an interview when he said, “It may not have insured deposits, but it’s a bank. If you move money, hold money, manage money, lend money — that’s a bank.”14.

We did take advantage of improving sentiment to higher growth technology companies and the share price of more defensive companies drifting down to divest our investment in Adobe and increase the Fund’s investment in UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH). United Health’s share price was also under moderate pressure due to regulatory announcements being very slightly adverse. We believe the market over-reacted to these announcements and the share price has recovered strongly over recent weeks.”13.

Alibaba operates shopping platforms Taobao and Tmall and owns 33% of Ant Group, which operates Alipay, China’s largest third-party online payment provider. Shares of Alibaba were up this quarter, given meaningful margin expansion, guidance to stabilize core commerce market share in China, and an announced plan to split the company into six units which could further unlock value. We retain conviction that Alibaba is well positioned to benefit from China’s reopening and the ongoing growth in online commerce and cloud in China.”12. Activision Blizzard, Inc.

In January 2022, Microsoft (MSFT) agreed to acquire the company for $95/share, but regulators are determined to block the transaction, and appear increasingly activist, in our opinion.”11. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 131At the end of June 2023, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s valuation surpassed $3 trillion, solidifying its position as the world's most valuable company.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Despite this, the S&amp;P 500 is up 7% this year and the Nasdaq is up +11%. Technology rebounded from a challenging 2022 and many large tech companies are performing quite well this year. Through mid-May 2023, year-to-date performance of some of the most popular and largest tech names is impressive. For tech companies with market capitalizations over $1 trillion, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is up +35%, Microsoft +33%, Amazon +39%, and Google is +40%. In terms of contribution to the S&amp;P 500’s year-to-date return, Apple and Microsoft represent roughly half of its 2023 performance. Apple, and Microsoft now account for 13.9% of the entire S&amp;P 500 or 80% more concentrated than 2008. For additional perspective, Apple’s market cap is at $2.8 trillion and that is larger than the market cap of the entire Russell 2000. To conclude, it’s distinctly getting more concentrated at the top.For our purposes, we are just going to focus on software digital wallets, as they are much more common and accessible. If you own an iPhone, then you have an Apple Pay preloaded digital wallet. If you have a Samsung phone, you have Samsung Pay available for use. Those two, along with Google Pay and PayPal, are the four most popular digital wallets today. According to the Payments Journal, PayPal has been used (over the last 12 months) by 62% of American consumers, followed by Apple Pay at 41% and Google Pay at 32%.Digital wallets have tons of advantages that we are embracing. When we attend Tampa Bay Lightning games, we love having our season tickets easily accessible on our phones (via the Apple Pay wallet), as well as our timed parking pass. When we travel, loading the airline ticket into our Apple Pay wallet is much more convenient than printing out a paper boarding pass. Others are using digital wallets to track their expenses, budget properly, and even help them easily pay their bills. Digital wallets are still in their infancy and have decades of future growth; we believe the smartphone is simply the best interface and platform for digital wallets…” (Click here to read the full text)10. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 132NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), an American semiconductor giant, is one of the most owned stocks among smart investors. On July 10, Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari reaffirmed a Buy rating on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and expressed confidence in the company's advancement in the field of general artificial intelligence.

Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is a significant stakeholder of the company, with 8.2 million shares worth $2.3 billion. ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“The Strategy’s IT holdings also drove performance in the second quarter, led by the continued rerating of graphics chipmaker NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as a key beneficiary of the generative AI boom. Nvidia is a good example of a select growth stock bought opportunistically where our long-term thesis has bloomed. We initiated the position in the fourth quarter of 2018 knowing that inference and training in the data center was an interesting although still early-stage growth driver. We knew that GPUs could be used to solve complex computing problems, but we didn’t know how quickly the training and learning efforts by Nvidia’s mega cap customers would hit an inflection point. Volatility in the gaming business created the entry point into the stock and we have built the position accordingly over time. Since the end of 2021, the stock’s portfolio weight grew from 4.5% to a high of 7.2% earlier in the second quarter before we trimmed it to manage our overall position sizing.We will continue to monitor and adjust Nvidia’s position sizing to manage risk. Despite the sharp run up, we believe the company’s long-term runway remains compelling due to its advantaged positioning in a very large addressable market for GPUs. The current valuation looks expensive, yet Nvidia has real earnings and cash flow and the longer-term multiple looks more reasonable because of GPU pricing power.”9. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 136Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is an American tech company specializing in customer relationship management. On June 29, Salesforce, Inc.

(NYSE:CRM) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is the largest pure-play cloud software company, holding a leading market share in customer relationship management applications and a top-five market share position in the company’s other clouds (Marketing, Service, Platform, Analytics, Integration, and Commerce). The company’s software subscription term-license model differs from the traditional perpetual-license software model in two respects: (1) the software is hosted on centralized servers and delivered over the internet, as opposed to traditional enterprise software that is loaded directly onto customers’ hard drives or servers; and (2) the revenue model is subscription-based, typically charging monthly fees per user as opposed to charging one-time licensing fees. The stock’s strong relative performance followed a strong F4Q23 earnings release that easily beat Street expectations on the top- and bottom-lines. In addition to the beat, management announced a number of initiatives that activist investors have been clamoring for, specifically a halt to large M&amp;A transactions and a focus on operating profitability.”8.

We are FINTECH investors, and we define Fintech as “anything utilizing technology to improve an established process.” We realize that half of Fintech is financial, but we don’t invest in traditional, credit sensitive banks. Having managed money during the Financial Crisis, we learned firsthand how certain opaque and balance sheet intensive financials could go bankrupt or insolvent.We prefer transaction-based businesses, generating recurring revenue, with sustainable margins, and significant cash flow. From our perspective, the perfect example of a FINTECH business is the secularly growing payments industry. Names like Visa or Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), that generate revenue and profit per swipe or transaction, without the underlying credit sensitivity or risk associated with that underlying line of credit.”7. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 144Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is an American mobility technology firm. On May 24, Uber Technologies, Inc.

Gross Bookings grew 19% year over year to $31 billion, driven by 31% Mobility Gross Bookings growth and 6% Delivery Growth Bookings growth. 4Q Adjusted EBITDA of $665 million, up $579 million year over year, significantly beating management’s $600-$630 million guidance. Management guided to continuing growth in 1Q for Gross Bookings (20%- 24% growth) and Adjusted EBITDA (of $660-$700 million).UBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing, with a greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates. The company is also a leader in food delivery, where it is number one or two in the more than 25 countries in which it operates. Moreover, after a history of losses, the company is now solidly profitable with the potential for substantial margin expansion and free cash flow generation to come. We view UBER as more than just ride sharing and food delivery, but also as a global mobility platform with the ability to sell to its 131 million users (by comparison, Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and penetrate new markets of on-demand services, such as package and grocery delivery, travel, truck brokerage (the company had $1.5 billion in Freight revenue for 4Q22), and worker staffing for shift work. Given its $4 billion of unrestricted cash and $5 billion of investments, the company today has an enterprise value of $70 billion, indicating that UBER trades at 1.6x next year’s estimated revenue.”6.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (U.S.) was the top contributor to the Fund’s performance for the quarter. Alphabet’s first-quarter search revenue growth accelerated slightly sequentially, which was notable given that advertising spending has decreased across the board. Management cited the company’s travel and retail segments for their strong performance in contrast to the declines experienced in the finance and in the media and entertainment businesses. Advertising spending has also stabilized at YouTube, and the focus on “shorts” has driven strong viewership growth. In the near term, YouTube’s investment in shorts may not generate significant revenue, but we believe its profitability will accelerate over time. Alphabet’s cloud business reached GAAP profitability this quarter, moving from a -12% margin this quarter last year to a 3% margin this quarter. On the AI front, Alphabet upgraded Bard to run on its more powerful PaLM language model, and Bard can now assist with coding and software development. CEO Sundar Pichai compared AI’s evolution to the transition from desktop to mobile computing a decade ago and said there is “a lot more to come” in terms of its consumer AI applications. CFO Ruth Porat revised 2023 capital expenditures guidance due to higher spending on data center construction and servers that will support AI developments in consumer products, advertiser tools and the cloud business. Porat reiterated that the company plans to continue to hold expense growth below revenue growth and that Alphabet’s cost-reduction initiatives should bear fruit later this year and into 2024. At Alphabet’s annual developer conference in May, the company showcased an impressive array of new AI-powered consumer tools, which will be rolled out over the course of the year. Investors reacted positively to these presentations, which highlighted the extent of AI innovation occurring at Alphabet.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Most Owned Stocks by Hedge Funds. Suggested articles:10 Best Economic Recovery Stocks to Buy11 Best Breakout Stocks to Buy Now12 Best Mining Stocks Hedge Funds Are Buying Disclosure: None. 25 Most Owned Stocks by Hedge Funds is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

As the company has significant exposure to the healthcare business, continued membership growth is likely to have aided the quarterly performance. Community-based and senior offerings, as well as Commercial Domestic Group, are expected to have aided the unit.UnitedHealthcare BusinessThrough this segment, UNH offers healthcare benefits around the world. While it has significant exposure to the Medicare and Medicaid markets, it also serves individuals and employers. The defensive properties of the sector enable UnitedHealth to maintain its momentum despite economic headwinds.In the last reported quarter, the segment’s revenues jumped 12.6% year over year to $70.5 billion, whereas operating income improved 14.3% to $4.3 billion.UnitedHealthcare's Q1 PerformanceConsidering the unit’s products, premiums increased 12.5% year over year to $67.5 billion in the first quarter, whereas service revenues rose 1.6% to $2.6 billion. Total revenues from Employer &amp; Individual Domestic, Medicare &amp; Retirement, and Community &amp; State businesses came in at $68.3 billion, increasing 13% year over year. Also, from global operations, UNH reported revenues of $2.2 billion, up 1.4% year over year.Forecast for Q2 Segment PerformanceThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for UnitedHealthcare’s revenues indicates an 11.2% year-over-year increase from the year-ago level of $62.1 billion, whereas our estimate suggests a 9.3% rise. The consensus mark for second-quarter operating income signals a marginal year-over-year rise from $3,850 million a year ago.As seniors undergoing elective procedures, which were delayed due to pandemic-related constraints, have resumed, medical costs are expected to have risen in the second quarter. This is likely to have left lower premiums in hand for UNH after payments. As such, the consensus mark for second-quarter 2023 medical care ratio is pegged at 82.66%, indicating a deterioration from the year-ago level of 81.50%, while our estimate of 83.20% suggests a higher slump.Story continuesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2023 global revenues indicates 2.2% year-over-year decline from $2,247 million while our estimate implies a 2.6% fall. The consensus mark for UnitedHealthcare’s Community &amp; State revenues suggests a 13.8% rise from the year-ago period’s $15.7 billion.The consensus mark for Medicare &amp; Retirement business’ revenues suggests 13.8% year-over-year growth from $28.6 billion a year ago while our estimate indicates a 9.8% improvement.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UnitedHealthcare’s total number of people served in commercial domestic business indicates a 3.4% increase from the year-ago level of 26,490 thousand, while our estimate implies a 2.4% rise.Final ThoughtsThe UnitedHealthcare unit is expected to have positioned the company for remarkable year-over-year growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UNH’s second-quarter earnings of $6.03 per share signals an 8.3% increase from the prior-year figure of $5.57. The consensus estimate for revenues of $90.6 billion indicates a 12.8% increase from the year-ago reported figure.However, higher costs and expenses are likely to have affected the margins in the second quarter, making an earnings beat uncertain. Our estimate for medical costs indicates a 12.2% year-over-year increase while we expect operating expenses to have jumped 9.8%. Further, we expect the cost of products sold to have jumped 5.4% year over year in the second quarter.Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for UnitedHealth this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat, which is not the case here.UnitedHealth has an Earnings ESP of -1.41% and currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseUnitedHealth Group Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseUnitedHealth Group Incorporated price-eps-surprise | UnitedHealth Group Incorporated QuoteStocks to ConsiderHere are some companies from the broader Medical space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around:Neogen Corporation NEOG has an Earnings ESP of +33.33% and is a Zacks #1 Ranked player.

(NYSE:EL) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies Estée Lauder Companies Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the President, Fabrizio Freda, for US$5.3m worth of shares, at about US$268 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$191. So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.Estée Lauder Companies insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insiders At Estée Lauder Companies Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Estée Lauder Companies. In total, Executive Group President Jane Hudis sold US$3.9m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of Estée Lauder CompaniesI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Estée Lauder Companies insiders own about US$8.5b worth of shares (which is 12% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Estée Lauder Companies Insiders?An insider sold Estée Lauder Companies shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. For example - Estée Lauder Companies has 2 warning signs we think you should be aware of.Of course Estée Lauder Companies may not be the best stock to buy.

387,a3c8ce6f-2c3c-3f59-9fae-93f6c05de34e,PG,2023-07-13,FOCUS-Investors target consumer goods makers on fears of customer exodus over high prices,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/focus-investors-target-consumer-goods-152815202.html,1689175695,STORY,"['JHG', 'PG']","[(Adds U.S. inflation figures released Wednesday)By Richa Naidu and Jessica DiNapoliLONDON/NEW YORK, July 12 (Reuters) - Top U.S. and European investors are flagging their concerns about high prices to consumer goods companies, with Janus Henderson going so far as to cut some stakes it holds and shorting food makers it believes are at risk of losing customers.The industry, which is due to report second quarter earnings in the coming weeks, has sharply hiked prices for over two years to make up for soaring cost inflation that started with the COVID pandemic and worsened due to shortages triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and extreme weather.In the U.S., consumer prices rose 3% in the 12 months ending in June, the smallest year-over-year increase since March 2021, while food inflation in the euro zone stood at 12.5% in May.Consumer goods makers say the price hikes are necessary, and that they have taken a hit to margins over the past two years. Some companies such as Clorox have even begun to ease off the hikes to protect sales volumes as input costs fall.Janus Henderson, one of the world's top investors with over 250 billion pounds ($322.45 billion) in assets under management, said it had already cut stakes in some food companies because continued high prices could prompt a sharp fall in volumes they sell.""In the U.S. in particular, these pressures are more acute than in Europe,"" Janus Henderson portfolio manager Luke Newman told Reuters. ""There's a very real risk of volume falls, which could be very dramatic in terms of revenue for these companies.""In particular, the asset manager is scrutinizing food manufacturers, including cereal makers, Newman said.""We've reduced our holdings to those categories and actually initiated some short positions as well,"" he said.Other investors, including Richard Marwood, a senior fund manager at Royal London Asset Management, also said they were talking to consumer goods firms about the impact of high prices on volumes.Story continuesSan Francisco-based Parnassus Investments has been discussing trimming its stakes in companies making household staples because the asset management firm expects revenues to ""decelerate,"" said Robert Klaber, a portfolio manager.Parnassus holds shares of P&amp;G and Triscuit maker Mondelez, among other consumer products makers and retailers.In the U.S., some investors are worried that cuts to the food stamps program for low-income earners and the reversal of the Biden administration's student loan forgiveness plan will bite into consumers' spending power.U.S. consumer strength has begun weakening, ""and that's bad news for the consumer companies,"" Barclays analyst Iain Simpson said.TRADING DOWNWith raw material and energy costs soaring over the past two years, companies have minimized damage to profits and margins largely by passing them on to retailers and shoppers.Still, cost inflation has chipped away at margins, which have broadly fallen 2-4 percentage points over the past two years for the consumer goods industry. But, for some, they remain at a healthy 16-18% rate.Price increases have in many cases come at the expense of sales volumes, however, as shoppers ""trade down"" to cheaper private label alternatives and smaller pack sizes.On average, median reported prices at the world's top 30 consumer goods companies rose 11.2% in the fourth quarter of 2022, according to restructuring consultancy Alvarez &amp; Marsal, while median sales volumes were down about 2%.Sales volumes fell nearly 5% in the household &amp; personal care sector - where Procter &amp; Gamble is No.1 - while food, beverages and alcohol showed less dramatic declines.'GREEDFLATION' ACCUSATIONSSome lawmakers and regulators in the United States and Europe have accused consumer goods manufacturers and retailers of price gouging and ""greedflation"", or padding revenues by charging more than they need to recoup high input costs.David Chavern, CEO of the Consumer Brands Association, a trade group that counts P&amp;G and Clorox among its members, in response, says the industry has ""contended with a stream of unprecedented inflationary pressures"" since the pandemic.""The resulting domino effect has spurred waves of impacts on consumer costs that have been mischaracterized by some,"" he said. ""The reality is that our economy is still in a settling period, not a deflationary one, that the industry is carefully navigating as it continues working tirelessly to meet consumer demand.""The issue is an important one, and one for investors to talk to companies about since ""greedflation"" prioritises short-term profit over long-term consumer loyalty and sales, said Stephanie Niven, portfolio manager of the Ninety One Global Sustainable Equity Fund.""Relationships with consumers are coming under scrutiny, perhaps into jeopardy and the long term competitive advantage of that business, particularly if it rests on consumer brand loyalty, can be very problematic,"" said Niven.Irene Jensen, portfolio manager at Norway's sovereign wealth fund, Norges Bank Investment Management, said she believes ""there are some companies who have probably been a bit opportunistic"" and the perception of price gouging is ""potentially harmful.""""The risk now is that the consumer down-trades into private label, gets to test out these products and then discovers that they're as good as the brands or good enough for them,"" Jensen said, adding that her team had raised concerns with companies.Other asset managers argue the accusations of opportunistic price hikes are unmerited.""We will have to wait a few months or quarters till we know who's right,"" said Thomas Joekel, a portfolio manager at Unilever and Reckitt top-20 shareholder Union Investment, arguing that falling margins at companies were proof that they were not gouging consumers.($1 = 0.7753 pounds) (Reporting by Richa Naidu and Jessica DiNapoli; Editing by Matt Scuffham and Deepa Babington)]"
388,b68ee6b6-061f-383d-818a-9bb3f6e81fa0,PG,2023-07-13,"With 66% institutional ownership, The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is a favorite amongst the big guns",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/66-institutional-ownership-procter-gamble-130031742.html,1689166831,STORY,['PG'],"[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in Procter &amp; Gamble implies that they have significant influence over the company's share priceThe top 25 shareholders own 39% of the company Recent sales by insiders To get a sense of who is truly in control of The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 66% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Procter &amp; Gamble. See our latest analysis for Procter &amp; Gamble ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Procter &amp; Gamble?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Procter &amp; Gamble. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Procter &amp; Gamble, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Procter &amp; Gamble. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.6% of shares outstanding. With 6.9% and 4.3% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Procter &amp; GambleThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of The Procter &amp; Gamble Company in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$182m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 34% stake in Procter &amp; Gamble. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Procter &amp; Gamble better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Procter &amp; Gamble that you should be aware of before investing here.If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

A copy of the same can be downloaded here. In the second quarter, the portfolio returned 4.78% compared to a 3.86% gain for the Russell Midcap Value Index. Stock selection mainly in the Technology, Consumer Discretionary, and Utilities sectors led the fund to outperform in the quarter. The fund’s consistent performance was due to the positive stock selection in seven of the eleven sectors. In addition, you can check the top 5 holdings of the fund to know its best picks in 2023.Heartland Mid Cap Value Fund highlighted stocks like Stericycle, Inc. (NASDAQ:SRCL) in the second quarter 2023 investor letter. Headquartered in Bannockburn, Illinois, Stericycle, Inc. (NASDAQ:SRCL) provides waste management services.  On July 12, 2023, Stericycle, Inc. (NASDAQ:SRCL) stock closed at $46.68 per share. One-month return of Stericycle, Inc. (NASDAQ:SRCL) was -1.06%, and its shares gained 7.91% of their value over the last 52 weeks. Stericycle, Inc. (NASDAQ:SRCL) has a market capitalization of $4.379 billion.Heartland Mid Cap Value Fund made the following comment about Stericycle, Inc. (NASDAQ:SRCL) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:""Industrials. Stericycle, Inc. (NASDAQ:SRCL) is the largest medical waste disposal and compliance company in the U.S. Over the past few years, the company has transformed itself from an aggressive, acquisition-driven company to one focused on organic growth, integrating core assets, reducing debt, and expanding profit margins. Toward that end, the company has undertaken several self-help strategies. This includes divesting non-core operations in order to focus on its core businesses of medical waste disposal and document destruction in the U.S. and Europe. Today, SRCL is largely complete with this portfolio reshaping and has successfully reduced debt to target levels. The critical action items left for the company pertain to integrating technology systems and demonstrating further progress in operational execution. In summary, SRCL is morphing from a ”holding company” into an “operating company”, with the latter offering far better prospects of rewarding shareholders.Candidly, this is not our first time owning SRCL. The first time around, we became shareholders far too early in the company’s turnaround efforts and exited the position. However, we continue to monitor the progress made under a much-improved management team and expect a better outcome for shareholders going forward. Regulated waste companies with leading market shares and secular growth, like SRCL, trade at far more expensive multiples of EBITDA and free cash flow. Additionally, the company is significantly underearning its potential. As this dynamic changes, we can envision a virtuous circle where the company earns progressively higher trading multiples on higher earnings power.""Story continuesrubbish, street, organic, horizontal, yellow, refuse, recycling, environmental, recycle, rubish, waste, trash, bins, multicolored, several, dump, collection, blue, selective,Olaf Speier/Shutterstock.comStericycle, Inc.

Retailers are continuing to rent out more physical store spaces, which is aiding leasing activity and helping the company backfill its spaces.This June, MAC welcomed the Ireland-based retail brand — Primark — to its Green Acres Mall in Long Island, NY, replacing a former JCPenney site.Moreover, MAC has a solid tenant roster and a majority of its shopping centers are located in densely populated areas having an affluent customer base with a significant disposable income. This enables the company to generate decent cash flows. We expect its total revenues to improve 3.5% for 2023, 3.2% for 2024 and 4.4% for 2025 on a year-over-year basis.The company’s focus on the re-use and mixed-use of its properties by recapturing and repositioning anchor tenants augurs well. Its efforts to better utilize space and ring in premium brands at its properties are likely to drive more footfall and boost sales. Also, the adoption of omni-channel retailing is expected to pay off well.This June 2023, MAC acquired the remaining 50% interest in five former Sears boxes, encompassing a total gross leasable area of 819,000 square feet, from its joint venture partner — Seritage Growth Properties — and now wholly owns and controls each parcel.  The move provides scope to undertake redevelopment opportunities at these properties and enrich them with renowned in-demand retailers.Further, Macerich has been following an aggressive capital-recycling program to enhance its overall portfolio quality. Through this, it divests its non-core and slow-growing assets and uses the proceeds for acquisitions, developments and redevelopment activities. These measures highlight its prudent capital-management practices.The company maintains a healthy balance sheet position and has a well-laddered debt maturity profile. This is expected to enable the company to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities.Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have gained 23.7% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 7.9%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNonetheless, given the conveniences of online shopping, high e-commerce adoption is concerning for Macerich. Also, limited consumers’ willingness to spend amid persistent macroeconomic uncertainty could impair the company’s performance to some extent.A high interest rate environment could raise the company's borrowing costs, affecting its ability to purchase or develop real estate.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks in the retail REIT sector are Regency Centers REG, Kite Realty Group Trust KRG and Phillips Edison &amp; Company PECO, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2.

(NYSE:DHI) Trading At A 50% Discount?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/d-r-horton-inc-nyse-140014045.html,1689170414,STORY,['DHI'],"[Key InsightsD.R. Horton's estimated fair value is US$239 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityCurrent share price of US$119 suggests D.R. Horton is potentially 50% undervaluedOur fair value estimate is 89% higher than D.R. Horton's analyst price target of US$126Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for D.R. Horton The ModelWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.49bUS$2.91bUS$3.26bUS$5.43bUS$6.09bUS$6.64bUS$7.11bUS$7.51bUS$7.84bUS$8.14bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x1Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 12.12%Est @ 9.12%Est @ 7.02%Est @ 5.54%Est @ 4.51%Est @ 3.79% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.3% US$3.2kUS$2.4kUS$2.5kUS$3.8kUS$3.9kUS$3.9kUS$3.8kUS$3.7kUS$3.5kUS$3.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$34bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 9.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$8.1b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (9.3%– 2.1%) = US$115bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$115b÷ ( 1 + 9.3%)10= US$47bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$81b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$119, the company appears quite good value at a 50% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at D.R. Horton as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.213. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for D.R. HortonStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Consumer Durables industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Consumer Durables market.OpportunityGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value? For D.R. Horton, there are three additional aspects you should consider:Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with D.R.

Driven by the buoyant air-travel demand scenario, passenger revenues are likely to have moved north. This, in turn, is expected to boost Delta’s performance, when it reports second-quarter 2023 results on Jul 13.Passenger Revenues in Q1: A FlashbackAir-travel demand was strong in the first quarter of 2023. Riding on the rosy scenario, passenger revenues, accounting for 81.6% of total revenues, increased 51% year over year to $10,411 million at DAL.Domestic markets contributed 72.9% to total passenger revenues. Domestic passenger revenues in the March quarter increased 37% year over year. Passenger revenues also improved on the international front at DAL. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Passenger Revenues: A Tailwind for Q2 as WellWe expect upbeat air-travel demand, particularly on the domestic front, to have boosted Delta Air Lines’ top-line performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Our estimate indicates a 5.6% increase from the second-quarter 2022 actuals.Driven by the uptick, DAL’s management expects operating margin for the second quarter to be 16%. Load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) is also likely to have been impressive in the June quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for load factor is pegged at 86%, higher than 85% reported in second-quarter 2022.Backed by strong passenger revenues, management now estimates adjusted earnings per share to be between $2.25 and $2.50 for the quarter under review. The earlier projection was in the range of $2-$2.25. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $2.42.Overall Top &amp; Bottom-Line ProjectionsMainly owing to buoyant passenger revenues, the consensus mark for quarterly sales is presently pegged at $15.01 billion, implying an 8.57% increase from second-quarter 2022 reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings currently hints at an increase of 68.06% from second-quarter 2022 levels.Story continuesOur TakeHigh passenger revenues coupled with low fuel costs (oil price declined 6.6% in the Apr-Jun period) are likely to aid Delta’s results when it kicks off the second-quarter earnings season for airlines.Apart from Delta, we expect the above tailwinds to have aided performances of fellow airline players like United Airlines UAL and American Airlines AAL. While United Airlines is scheduled to report second-quarter 2023 results on Jul 19, American Airlines will release the same on Jul 20. Each stock is currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

As ticket pricing relies on a convoluted model based on demand and spreading passengers between different airports, this technique can sometimes be cheaper than the layover the airline offers or — the most expensive option of all — a direct flight. As it causes unfilled flights for the airline, the practice is severely frowned-upon and often outright banned — a teenager traveling from Gainesville, FL to New York City with a layover in North Carolina's Charlotte ran into trouble when an American Airlines employee suspected that he was not planning to board the flight to his final destination.Continue reading]"

But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.However, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this auto parts retailer is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for O'Reilly Automotive is 22.7%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 11.3% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 11.2%.Impressive Asset Utilization RatioAsset utilization ratio -- also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio -- is often overlooked by investors, but it is an important indicator in growth investing. This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.Story continuesRight now, O'Reilly Automotive has an S/TA ratio of 1.19, which means that the company gets $1.19 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 1.06, it can be said that the company is more efficient.While the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot, so does the sales growth of a company. And O'Reilly Automotive looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well. The company's sales are expected to grow 7.7% this year versus the industry average of 6.8%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for O'Reilly Automotive have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.1% over the past month.Bottom LineWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made O'Reilly Automotive a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that O'Reilly Automotive is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Aflac in FocusAflac (AFL) is headquartered in Columbus, and is in the Finance sector. The stock has seen a price change of -2% since the start of the year. The insurer is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.42 per share, with a dividend yield of 2.38%. This compares to the Insurance - Accident and Health industry's yield of 2.56% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.64%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $1.68 is up 5% from last year. Aflac has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 12.36%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Aflac's current payout ratio is 30%. This means it paid out 30% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.AFL is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $5.81 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 9.01%.Bottom LineFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.Story continuesFor instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, AFL is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

When economic uncertainty is high, knowing a dividend payment is coming through helps ease our worries. When the economy is booming, that extra dividend payout is a bonus. So how do we find these real estate investment trust (REIT) stocks to buy?I like hunting down income-generating REIT stocks based on their consistency and quality. In many cases, these names may fly under the radar despite the higher yields and incredible consistency.According to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), “To qualify as a REIT, a company must have the bulk of its assets and income connected to real estate investment and must distribute at least 90 percent of its taxable income to shareholders annually in the form of dividends.”InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDuring certain environments — mostly pertaining to the economy and interest rates — REIT holdings can struggle and we’re seeing that today. However, for many patient investors, it could be an opportunity to buy high-dividend REIT stocks for discounts.REIT Stocks to Buy: Realty Income (O)realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browserSource: ShutterstockRealty Income (NYSE:O) has become known as the Monthly Dividend Company. Only decades of consistency could deliver that type of title. As shares continue to languish around $60, long-term investors seem content to DRIP (dividend reinvestment program) their dividend payouts into the stock, slowly building their stake as shares yield just over 5%.That’s a rather high yield for this stock, which has only yielded more than 5% for brief periods of time over the last decade.The company has now raised its dividend for 103 straight quarters — or four times a year for more than 25 years. How many companies struggle to raise their dividend just once a year over a span like that? Plenty!Further, Realty Income has paid a dividend for 636 consecutive months (or more than 50 years).Lastly, the firm believes in diversification from a tenant and industry perspective, helping to insulate its risk and remain committed to the dividend. When investing in REIT stocks for income, diversification is key.Story continuesThe Longest Streak: Federal Realty (FRT)Commercial shopping center in a tropical climateSource: mTaira / Shutterstock.comLike Realty, it’s been tough to find Federal Realty (NYSE:FRT) with an elevated dividend yield over the last decade. However, despite a recent 15% rally in the stock price from the May low, shares still yield close to 4.5%.For a blue-chip name like this, it should have investors looking at it as one of the REIT stocks to buy.The company recently reported better-than-expected bottom-line results, while its portfolio had 94.2% of its properties leased as of quarter-end of March 31. That’s up 0.50% year over year. Further, CEO Donald Wood said, “Leasing volume has remained strong, exceeding pre-pandemic levels by 20%-30%.”According to the company, “With an increased annual dividend rate for 55 consecutive years, we hold the longest consecutive record in the REIT industry.”Despite a modest sub-$8 billion market cap, Federal Realty holds great properties in numerous markets.Income Generating REIT Stocks: Public Storage (PSA)a Public Storage sign in front of a facility of storage buildingsSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comHave you tried getting a storage unit lately? It seems impossibly difficult and it has been that way for years. As a result, it has us focused on Public Storage (NYSE:PSA). Shares currently yield 4.1% while the stock has been consolidating after a long pullback.PSA stock fell 35% from its high but has been trading between $275 and $300 for months. If the stock can clear multi-quarter resistance around $315, it could have a lot of room for the upside.Here’s the thing, though.The stock paid a dividend of $2.00 a share for years. That’s not like what we were used to with the other companies above — Realty Income and Federal Realty.In 2022, the firm did pay a big special dividend and earlier this year, management raised the payout by 50% to $3.00 a share. So there is a renewed focus on the dividend, but it should be pointed out that the streak is nowhere near some of the stalwarts in the REIT space.On the date of publication, Bret Kenwell did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

400,61e77f66-a173-339e-a4d2-c855023c13cf,FCX,2023-07-13,"FOCUS-Chile miners, facing higher taxes, seek faster permits, lower energy costs",Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/focus-chile-miners-facing-higher-110000439.html,1689246000,STORY,"['HG=F', 'BHP', 'FCX']","[By Fabian CamberoSANTIAGO, July 13 (Reuters) - Now that Chile has passed an increase in mining royalties, copper miners are pushing for incentives to keep investing in production of the metal needed for the renewable energy revolution, with steps such as cuts in energy costs, speeded-up permit approvals and other incentives.Beginning in 2024, mining royalties will rise to a range of 8% to 26% of operating margin from the current range of 5% to 14%. There will also be a 1% ad valorem tax based on sales for miners that post a profit.Chile's Mining Council, which comprises large private firms, estimates this will ultimately boost the average tax rate of 44.7%, exceeding the top of the range of 38-to-44% in competing countries such as Peru and Australia.""We're hoping that this competitive disadvantage is somehow compensated with other public policy actions that encourage investment,"" said the association's head of studies, Jose Tomas Morel.The elevated royalty is the latest flashpoint between the mining industry in the world's No. 1 copper and No. 2 lithium producer and the leftist government of Gabriel Boric, who came to office promising to get the country's mining industry to help pay for expanded social programs. Industry lobbying did prompt a cut in the original royalty rise plan, and some miners have said they will continue to invest.""Despite being a strong left-wing government, they engaged the industry and sought to understand and work towards an outcome that struck a balance between public needs and what was required to maintain the competitivity of the industry and the country,"" said Mark Henry, CEO of BHP Group, Chile's No. 2 player which had initially said the royalty would prompt a review of its $10 billion investment plan in Chile.""BHP will continue to invest.""Other big miners were more tentative, and some mining executives are skeptical the industry will follow through on an estimated $70 billion in planned investment without additional stimulus. With Chile's aging mines producing less copper, analysts noted that the more mining investment was needed to produce the government's desired revenue increase, even with the higher royalty.Story continuesIndustry experts are closely watching whether Chilean miner Antofagasta's decides to invest $3.7 billion to expand its Centinela mine towards year end.Antofagasta did not respond to a request for comment. In June, CEO Ivan Arriagada told local media the company was reevaluating the project because the new royalty ""does impact competitiveness.""""Some projects on the margin will have to be reassessed to determine whether they are viable or not,"" Arriagada said.Freeport-McMoRan, one of the world's largest copper producers, has said it will put Chile investment decisions on hold due to political uncertainty.Boric has pledged investment incentives. The government is in talks with mining companies and other interested parties. Miners have yet to provide a detailed list of incentives they are seeking.Morel said the government should speed up and simplify the permitting process in which projects need hundreds of permits with each taking months to approve. He said the government should also help miners navigate thorny environmental and indigenous regulation issues which can lead to lengthy court cases.Energy costs are another concern. Chile's mining industry consumes about 15% of the country's total energy output, and the Chilean Copper Commission says energy represents about 11% of miners' costs. The industry would like the government to pass regulations cutting energy costs for miners.DECLINING PRODUCTIONThe mining royalty increase was part of a wider tax reform plan that congress rejected in March. Boric's government hopes to boost total copper revenue for the state up to 0.45% of GDP or about $1.35 billion a year, using the funds to boost programs such as child care, security, health care and education.Gustavo Lagos, a professor at the mining department at Catholic University in Santiago, said the new royalty might not hit its target since most new projects are focused on compensating for declining production rather than adding supply.""I think there will be investment, what I don't think is that production will grow more, it will be difficult for us to go above 6 million (metric) tons in Chile and that is what ultimately determines revenue,"" Lagos said.Chile's copper supply has fallen due to the natural decline in mineral grades of its oldest deposits, delays in project start-ups, accidents and other problems. Production in 2022 totaled 5.33 million metric tons, down from a record 5.83 million in 2018.The government is holding talks with business groups and other political actors for a second shot at tax reform, and miners hope this might possibly boost their chances for incentives.One mining executive, who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue, said the government might compromise further to try and boost future investment.""The (projects) that are not carried out are going to come to a point where they are going to negotiate with the government and say 'I'm doing this project but I need another guarantee,'"" the executive said.

(NYSE:FCX) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Freeport-McMoRan Step By Step Through The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$5.32bUS$6.12bUS$8.06bUS$6.19bUS$5.19bUS$4.63bUS$4.31bUS$4.13bUS$4.03bUS$4.00bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ -16.26%Est @ -10.75%Est @ -6.89%Est @ -4.19%Est @ -2.30%Est @ -0.98% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.3% US$4.9kUS$5.1kUS$6.2kUS$4.3kUS$3.3kUS$2.7kUS$2.3kUS$2.0kUS$1.8kUS$1.6k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$34bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 9.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.0b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (9.3%– 2.1%) = US$57bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$57b÷ ( 1 + 9.3%)10= US$23bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$58b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$40.7, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Freeport-McMoRan as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.210. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Freeport-McMoRanStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Metals and Mining market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.ThreatDividends are not covered by cash flow.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

Yet net pricing rose 15%, the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit price increases from PepsiCo.The Purchase, New York, company reported better-than-expected revenue and raised its full-year earnings forecasts. Pepsi’s revenue rose 10% to $22.3 billion, topping Wall Street’s projections for $21.7 billion, according to analysts polled by FactSet.PepsiCo shares were flat in early trading.CEO Ramon Laguarta said the company has been surprised by consumers' willingness to keep buying its brands despite higher prices. Even when consumers trade down to dollar stores, rather than traditional grocery stores for example, they continue to buy PepsiCo brands like Cheetos, he said.""Our brands are stronger. The perceived value of our products is better than it was, and obviously, we’ve been able to raise prices and consumers stay within our brand,"" Laguerta said on a conference call with investors Thursday.New products, like the bite-size Frito-Lay Minis, are also fueling growth, he said.Still, pricing clearly took a toll. In the company’s Africa, the Middle East and South Asia division, volumes dropped 6% as Pepsi hiked prices 24%. In Latin America, volume fell 3% as prices rose 16%. In North America, Frito-Lay volumes rose less than 1% but Quaker Foods volumes fell 5% and beverage volumes declined 4%.Net pricing includes price hikes as well as changes in the mix of products sold and package sizes. PepsiCo used to sell a 9.75-ounce bag of Flamin' Hot Doritos; that recently shrunk to 9.25 ounces. Target's website still advertises both sizes for the same price: $5.19.Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston said the company's price hikes in the second quarter reflected the higher prices it is paying for commodities like cooking oil. But he also said price increases will likely return to the single-digit range in the second half of the year.Story continues""We’ll see how the year plays out but the implication that we have in the forecast right now is kind of back to our relatively more normal pricing,"" Johnston said the investors call.Pepsi and other food companies could have less leverage on pricing prices as inflation eases. In June, U.S. inflation reached its lowest point since early 2021.Lael Brainard, director of President Biden’s National Economic Council, told the Economic Club of New York this week that consumer price increases that have outpaced companies’ costs should start coming down as consumers become more price-sensitive.“It will be important for corporations to continue to bring their markups back down after having raised them to unusually elevated levels over the past 2 years, which would help in reducing inflation,” Brainard said.Pepsi's net income nearly doubled to $2.75 billion in the second quarter. Last year, its profit was lower due to a $1.36 billion impairment charge.Excluding one-time items, the company earned $2.09 per share. That easily beat the $1.95 per share that analysts forecast.The company now anticipates full-year earnings up 12%, on a constant currency basis. Its prior outlook was for a 9% increase. Organic revenue is now predicted to rise 10%. Pepsi previously expected an 8% increase.]"

The company benefited from price increases on its various lines of products and new innovations in the Frito-Lay division, PepsiCo CFO Hugh Johnston told Yahoo Finance Live.Similar to when the company last reported, it materially hiked its full-year outlook, suggesting the momentum in the business will be sustained.""The Frito-Lay business is having a very, very strong year. We are expanding the portfolio into permissible snacking and more center-of-the-plate food products. In addition to that, we really have been putting more advertising into the business as well,"" Johnston added on the company's performance.The earnings rundownNet Sales: +10.4% year over year to $22.3 billion vs. estimates for $21.68 billionFrito-Lay North America Sales: +14% year over year to $5.90 billion vs. estimates for $5.77 billionQuaker Foods North America Sales: +1% year over year to $684 million vs. estimates for $704 millionNorth America Beverages: +10% year over year to $6.75 billion vs. estimates for $6.64 billionEurope Sales: +13% year over year to $3.42 billion vs. estimates for $3.14 billionLatin America Sales: +18% year over year to $2.89 billion vs. estimates for $2.7 billionAfrica/Middle East Sales: - 8% year over year to $1.57 billion vs. estimates for $1.62 billionAsia Pacific Sales: +1% year over year to $1.12 billion vs. estimates for $1.12 billionOrganic Sales Growth: +13% year over year vs. estimates for +9.75%Core EPS: +15% year over year to $2.09 vs. estimates for $1.96What else caught our attentionOrganic sales growth for 2023 is seen at 10%, up from 8% previously.Core EPS growth for 2023 is seen at 12%, up from 9% previously.Profit growth at North America Beverages of 9% was slower than the 10% increase in organic sales.Story continuesWhat analysts are saying post-earnings""We raise our 12-month target by $5 to $225, based on a 2024 P/E of 28x, a justified premium to its 5-year average forward P/E of 24.2x due to its growth potential, strong execution, and dividend yield. We raise our adjusted EPS estimates by $0.10 to $7.50 for '23 and by $0.05 to $8.05 for '24. PEP posts Q2 adjusted EPS of $2.09 vs. $1.86 (+12%), well ahead of the $1.96 consensus. Net revenue rose 10% to $22.32B ($590M above consensus) on robust organic revenue growth of 13%, with double-digit increases across all segments with the exception of the Asia Pacific region (+7%) and Quaker Foods (+2%). The bad news was that it appears PEP's aggressive price increases are beginning to hurt volumes, as beverage volumes were down 1% and food/snack volumes fell 3%. PEP raised full year EPS guidance to $7.47 from $7.27, implying 10% growth from the $6.79 earned in '22.

However, there are still bargains to be found among the wide-ranging world of tech stocks.Some of the biggest and most well-known names in tech have underperformed. Some have badly trailed the market in recent months, and are currently trading at undervalued levels.Accordingly, while many stocks associated with artificial intelligence have skyrocketed, shares of companies in less-desirable industries haven’t performed as well. Companies involved in wireless internet, personal computers, telecommunications equipment, online payments, and e-commerce have not enjoyed the same rally.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThat said, this presents an opportunity to investors who are hunting for bargains among growth stocks. Investors who get in on undervalued tech stocks now can ride them to big future gains as the market rally broadens out and a rising tide lifts all boats. Here are three of the most undervalued tech stocks investors may want to consider right now.Amazon (AMZN)Amazon (AMZN) logo on a corporate buildingSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comAmong mega-cap tech stocks, e-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been the laggard this year. Since January, AMZN stock has gained 50% while Meta Platforms’ (NASDAQ:META) stock has increased 127% and Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) share price has risen 190%, at the time of wiring. Amazon’s stock also remains below its 52-week high and well beneath its all-time high reached two years ago. For investors searching for undervalued tech stocks, there is still an opportunity to take a position in Amazon and ride its recovery higher.Analysts are increasingly pounding the table on AMZN stock. Investment bank Roth/MKM just named Amazon its top mega-cap stock pick and raised its price target on the shares to $155 from $130. The raised price target implies 21% upside from current levels. Roth/MKM also maintained its “buy” rating on AMZN stock and said that the e-commerce company stands to gain from the current artificial intelligence craze. Notably, Amazon’s financials are also expected to improve after the company aggressively cut staff and curtailed spending earlier this year.Story continuesDell Technologies (DELL)Dell (DELL) Technologies Display and LogoSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comPersonal computer (PC) maker Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) is another woefully undervalued technology stock. Over the past two years, DELL stock has barely budged. And while this PC maker has seen some momentum of late, it’s clear that this is a company that hasn’t seen the kind of move many of its peers have this year.Fundamentally, Dell is also an attractive company to consider. Its price-earnings ratio of 19-times is low for a tech company of Dell’s size. And, the stock offers shareholders a quarterly dividend payment of 37 cents, which equates to a yield of 2.9%. That’s reasonable for any publicly-traded company, but exceptionally high for a technology stock.The poor performance of DELL stock can be attributed to slumping sales of personal computers. In this year’s first quarter, global shipments of PCs declined 29% from a year earlier due to weak demand, excess inventory, and a deteriorating global economy, according to market research firm International Data Corporation (IDC). That has led investors to take a wait-and-see approach to DELL stock. However, the PC market can be expected to recover, and with it, Dell’s share price. In the meantime, there is the dividend for shareholders to enjoy as they patiently wait for capital appreciation over the long-term.Cisco Systems (CSCO)cisco (CSCO) logo on an office buildingSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comAnother undervalued tech stock to consider is Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO). The telecommunications equipment manufacturer’s share price has badly trailed other major tech firms and the Nasdaq index this year. So far in 2023, CSCO stock has gained 6%. Over five years, its share price is up roughly 20%. The stock’s price-earnings ratio sits at a low 18-times, suggesting it’s cheap right now. And investors who take a position benefit from a quarterly dividend of 39 cents that yields 3.1%, which isn’t bad at all for a legacy tech giant.Notably, CSCO stock has been hurt by concerns over future demand for the telecom and networking hardware the company makes. Cisco reported a 23% decline in total product orders in its most recent quarter, which prompted many investors to reach for the sell button. However, the company still managed to report blockbuster financial results that beat consensus Wall Street forecasts, raising its forward guidance for this year. Cisco, which has been a going concern for nearly 40 years, should be fine long-term.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in NVDA.
