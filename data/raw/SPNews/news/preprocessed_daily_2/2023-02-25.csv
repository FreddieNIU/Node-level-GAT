This takes the annual payment to 1.3% of the current stock price, which unfortunately is below what the industry is paying. Check out our latest analysis for Nucor Nucor's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageWhile yield is important, another factor to consider about a company's dividend is whether the current payout levels are feasible. However, Nucor's earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to fall by 63.1%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we believe the payout ratio could be 19%, which we are pretty comfortable with and we think is feasible on an earnings basis.historic-dividendNucor Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.46 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $2.04. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 3.4% per annum over that time. Although we can't deny that the dividend has been remarkably stable in the past, the growth has been pretty muted.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Nucor has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 49% per annum. Earnings per share is growing at a solid clip, and the payout ratio is low which we think is an ideal combination in a dividend stock as the company can quite easily raise the dividend in the future.Nucor Looks Like A Great Dividend StockIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. The earnings easily cover the company's distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. However, it is worth noting that the earnings are expected to fall over the next year, which may not change the long term outlook, but could affect the dividend payment in the next 12 months. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

We note that this home-improvement retailer has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 4.5%, on average.Key Factors to NoteLowe's focus on enhancing the omnichannel retailing capabilities in store operations, website and supply chain to resonate well with customers’ demand, appears encouraging. In addition, its pro business has been significantly contributing to the company’s performance for a while. Management constantly enhances the Pro offerings across LOW’s stores and online with improved service levels, deeper inventory quantities, an intuitive store layout and the addition of Pro-focused brands.Meanwhile, LOW continues benefiting from the solid execution of the Total Home strategy, focusing on boosting productivity and enriching the integrated omnichannel shopping experience. Further, gains from the execution of the Perpetual Productivity Improvement initiative have been aiding its performance for a while now. All these strengths are most likely to have driven LOW’s performance in the quarter to be reported.On the flip side, a tough operating backdrop, including inflationary pressures and currency headwinds, might have been concerns. Any deleverage in SG&amp;A and other expenses might be an added deterrent.

(NYSE:TMO) stock at an average price of US$553 per share allowing them to get the most out of their money. After the stock price dropped 3.0% last week, the company's market value declined by US$11b, but insiders were able to mitigate their losses.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific Thermo Fisher Scientific Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Executive VP &amp; COO, Michel Lagarde, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$3.3m worth of shares at a price of US$542 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at below the current price (US$543). When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. We note that the biggest single sale was only 28% of Michel Lagarde's holding.In the last year Thermo Fisher Scientific insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.

(Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At Thermo Fisher Scientific Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Thermo Fisher Scientific shares. In total, insiders dumped US$697k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider OwnershipMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Thermo Fisher Scientific insiders own 0.1% of the company, worth about US$291m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Do The Thermo Fisher Scientific Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders haven't bought Thermo Fisher Scientific stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 2 warning signs with Thermo Fisher Scientific and understanding them should be part of your investment process.But note: Thermo Fisher Scientific may not be the best stock to buy.

In 2016, Dansberry, now a U.S. Bank District Manager in St. Louis, was a branch manager and met with Little when he came to the branch to talk about his business goals.Little is CEO of eLittle Communications Group, which provides public relations, marketing, advertising and other services for clients that include federal entities, nonprofits, school districts and a public transit agency. After their first conversation, Dansberry knew then that Little had big dreams.""As a private citizen and now as an entrepreneur with multiple businesses, Johnny has always been a philanthropist for North St. Louis County who wanted to make a difference,"" Dansberry said. ""When he first started thinking about expanding his communications business, I began putting him in touch with the right team at U.S. Bank to help him pave the way for success.""The team helped Little develop plans that have paid off.""I can truly say that in the last seven years or so we have grown tremendously in the PR field,"" Little said. ""Headquartered in St. Louis, we now have several employees across the country. U.S. Bank has helped us be able to access capital and sustain our growth.""Little moved from Holly Springs, Mississippi, to Ferguson in the late 1990's after he graduated from Rust College, a historically Black college and university. Part of the Greater St. Louis metropolitan area and known as North County, the Ferguson community has remained important to Little, who has made it his mission to bring businesses and opportunities to the area.""I wanted to invest more in Ferguson, so I purchased a building that had closed during the pandemic in November 2020,"" Little said. ""My No. 1 goal is for people who want to visit our city to feel safe and want to be a part of this resurgence in the community.""Story continues""Little obtained a loan from U.S. Bank to get funding that enabled him to do a total renovation. He opened Elicious, a Southern-style breakfast and brunch restaurant, in November 2021.""Within the last 60 days or so, we've become one of the most popular restaurants in St. Louis County,"" said Little, who started banking with U.S. Bank in 2007.At the restaurant's grand opening, Little donated to the Ferguson Youth Initiative by starting scholarships for two students who are interested in the hospitality industry. The students work alongside Little and his staff on the weekends to learn the business. Both high schoolers are officers/leaders with Ferguson Youth Initiative.Throughout February, in honor of Black History Month, Little and his staff are saluting African American chefs in the St. Louis community and special dishes will be served in their honor.""It's been great to see this endeavor succeed, which is wonderful for Johnny but also the community,"" Dansberry said. ""It was a privilege to help him grow his businesses and help facilitate his dream of changing the perception of the Ferguson area.""Little said he appreciates the partnership with U.S. Bank.""Tony has been the perfect banking partner and we have developed a friendship on top of that,"" he said. ""He has listened to my vision and has asked me the important questions so he and U.S. Bank can come alongside me.

This is all part of a larger trend that we're seeing. Brooke DiPalma is here with the details. Brooke.BROOKE DIPALMA: That's right. Good afternoon, everyone. Good afternoon, both of you. Of course, Home Depot announcing their fourth quarter earnings results this week that they are, in fact, investing $1 billion in wage increases. Now this investment will ultimately bring the US average hourly wage at Home Depot to at or above $15. That will be reflected in their employees' February 17 paychecks. Now this is part of a larger trend, as we noted earlier, that we're seeing across big box retailers.At the end of January, we saw Walmart also increase their prices, saying that we'll begin investing in higher wage for associates. That was in a statement to US employees. This will bring their new wage to $14 to $19, up from $12 to $17 per hour. They expect from there that the US average wage will be more than 17.50. That will go into effect on the March 2nd paychecks.Now this is all really part of a larger trend, as we keep emphasizing here. Oliver Chen, Cowen analyst, calling it a no brainer here in a tight labor market and a low unemployment rate. Of course, in January, we saw 30,000 retail jobs added, as well as an unemployment rate of 3.1%. And so with ultimately retailers wanting less turnover-- of course, it's a major investment-- they don't want to perhaps waste money on investing in training employees. They want to make sure that they're paying employees ultimately what they deserve and what they need to keep them.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly, it is important for those employees. But I think a lot of analysts, though, looking at this through what this means for Home Depot, in this case, a billion dollars investment, what it means for their bottom line, how that looks here over the next several quarters. What was the takeaway there?Story continuesBROOKE DIPALMA: Yeah, well, a few analysts that I spoke to really said that this is a short-term impact that'll ultimately impact their gross margins perhaps in the quarters to come. But long-term, lots of value there. They're noting that short-term, we'll see an impact on gross margin, SG&amp;A, expense pressures. But ultimately, the bottom line here is that investing in your partners creates happy customers, who they're seeing at the front door of these retailers, and then more value for the company. And so as far as if other retailers will invest, we did see Target last year announce a wage increase of $15 to $24 last February.But what's important to note here is that Home Depot, Walmart, even Target, they saw big opportunity during the pandemic. All three of those stocks got a boost. And so they have the money in order to do these sort of wage investors. Who this will hurt here is those smaller retailers that don't have the money to pay these employees more.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly don't have the resources for that. Brooke DiPalma, great stuff. Thanks so much.]"

The agency said Walmart had violated a rule requiring that items ""stored in tiers"" be stable and secure.The review board threw out the fine, saying the rule did not apply because Walmart had stored pallets of boxes individually instead of stacking them.But the New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said in October that tall metal racks are ""tiers,"" so the OSHA rule applied regardless of whether items are stacked.The case was sent back to the review board, which earlier this month agreed with OSHA that Walmart had violated the rule, the agency said.(Reporting by Daniel Wiessner in Albany, New York)]"
15,563b22cf-8c27-3f8c-8ef3-f71ca23b3c14,WMT,2023-02-25,Breaking Down Retail Earnings and Consumer Spending Trends,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/breaking-down-retail-earnings-consumer-194307171.html,1677267787,STORY,"['WMT', '^GSPC', 'AMZN', 'TGT']","[It is no surprise that the combined weight of elevated inflation, rising interest rates and uncertainty about the economy have forced consumers to change their spending behavior.The issue has undoubtedly been at play with lower-income households for some time now. But we can intuitively appreciate that it will not stay restricted to this consumer segment alone and will most likely move up the income chain in the days ahead.We saw some of that in the Walmart (WMT) report that showed the retailer benefiting from higher-income consumers ‘trading down’ to its stores in response to the aforementioned headwinds. On the flip side, a big contributor to Walmart’s weak guidance for this year reflects a moderating consumer spending backdrop that some in the market see as overly conservative.  The retail business is a tough and competitive space even in ‘normal’ times and these are anything but normal times.They need just the right amount of inventory, otherwise they will either lose sales if they don’t have enough merchandise as was the case earlier in the pandemic or they will need to offer steeper discounts and hurt margins if they have too much of it, as we saw with Walmart and Target (TGT) last year.Retailers also need to make sure that they have the right type of merchandise, as we saw with Target and Walmart having too much of the patio furniture that consumers weren’t interested in buying. Keeping stores fully staffed in a tight labor market and ensuring just right amount of price discounts are some of the other challenges that big-box operators like Walmart, Target and others face daily.Walmart’s strong performance on the inventory front over the last two quarters is a big reason why the stock has done so much better relative to Target whose results are coming out before the market’s open on Tuesday, February 28th.Target shares are one of those stocks that really move on quarterly releases. The stock was down following each of the last three releases, with the May 18th 2022 report was one for the record books when the stock lost more than a quarter of its value as the company’s inventory and merchandising problems took center stage. This puts a premium on Target’s release Tuesday morning given the stock’s impressive run this year.Story continuesIt all comes down to execution and management effectiveness.In a backdrop of moderating and shifting consumer spending behavior, some retailers have been more successful than others. Walmart has been better, Target less so, though Target shares have been stellar performers in recent weeks. Macy’s (M), which also reports this week, has been one of the laggards.You can see some of this in one-year performance of Walmart (orange line, up +3.3%), Target (blue line, down -17.6%), Macy’s (green line, down -22.5%) shares relative to the S&amp;P 500 index (red line, down -10.1%).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSince the start of 2023, however, Target shares are up +10.1% vs. +4.5% for the S&amp;P 500 index, while Walmart and Macy’s shares are down -0.6% and -1%, respectively.With respect to the Retail sector’s 2022 Q4 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 24 of the 33 retailers in the S&amp;P 500 index. Total Q4 earnings for these retailers are down -33% from the same period last year on +6.5% higher revenues, with 70.8% beating EPS estimates and 62.5% beating revenue estimates.The comparison charts below put the Q4 beats percentages for these retailers in a historical context.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs you can see above, retailers have been struggling to come out with positive surprises thus far, with the variance relative to the historical ranges particularly notable on the EPS side.With respect to the earnings and revenue growth rates, Amazon’s -85.4% earnings decline plays a significant role in the group’s weak year-over-year growth rate for the sector (Amazon is part of the Zacks Retail sector, and not the Zacks Technology sector). Most of the Retail sector earnings reports that have come out already are in the digital part of the space, with the more traditional retailers started the reporting cycle with last week’s Walmart release and a host of others on deck this week.As we all know, the digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now, with Amazon now a decent sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods and Walmart a growing online vendor. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the Covid lockdowns.The two comparison charts below show the Q4 earnings and revenue growth relative to other recent periods, both with Amazon’s results (left side chart) and without Amazon’s numbers (right side chart).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis Week’s Reporting DocketWe have more than 550 companies on deck to report results this week, including 30 S&amp;P 500 members. Notable companies reporting this week, aside from the aforementioned retailers include Berkshire Hathaway, Broadcom, Salesforce.com, and others.2022 Q4 Earnings Season ScorecardAs of Friday, February 24th, we now have Q4 results from 468 S&amp;P 500 members or 93.6% of the index’s total membership. Total earnings for these companies are down -5.7% from the same period last year on +6% higher revenues, with 70.7% beating EPS estimates and an equal proportion beating revenue estimates.The comparison charts below put the EPS and revenue beats percentages in Q4 in a historical context.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe comparison charts below put the earnings and revenue growth rates in Q4 in a historical context.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs you can see, there is a notable deceleration in the growth trajectory, both for earnings as well as revenues. Please note that this decelerating growth trend doesn’t change in any meaningful way whether we look at it on an ex-Finance or ex-Tech bases.The Earnings Big PictureWe have all along been referring to the overall picture that emerged from the 2022 Q4 reporting cycle as good enough; not great, but not bad either.The revisions trend continues to be negative, with the outlook for a number of sectors on the weak side. But it is consistent with the evolving macroeconomic picture and far from the dire scenario that many in the market feared. You can see this in the chart below that shows how estimates for the current period (2023 Q1) have evolved in recent weeks.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPlease note that while Q1 estimates are coming down, the pace and magnitude of cuts is notably below what we had seen ahead of the start of the last couple of earnings seasons.The chart below shows the aggregate earnings total for the index since the start of last year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPlease note that the $1.911 trillion in expected aggregate earnings for the index in 2023 approximate to an index ‘EPS’ of $215.47, down from $215.89 last week and the $215.90 tally we are on track to have seen in 2022.The chart below shows this 2023 index ‘EPS’ estimate has evolved since the start of 2022.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWith the bulk of the 2022 Q4 reporting cycle now behind us, revisions have mostly played down for the next few weeks though the Retail sector results will have a bearing on how expectations for that space evolve.We continue to believe that a definitive read on the revisions front will only emerge once we have seen an end to the Fed’s tightening cycle and the impact of the cumulative tightening on economic growth.That said, relative to pre-season doom-and-gloom worries, this is fairly reassuring outcome.The chart below shows the expected 2022 Q4 earnings and revenue growth expectation in the context of where growth has been in recent quarters and what is expected in the next few quarters.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on an annual basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs you can see here, estimates for 2023 are now a hair below the 2022 level.

Market participants are concerned about a higher interest regime for a longer period and the possibility of a recession in 2023. Market participants confidence in risky assets like equities has been dampened to some extent. Volatility is likely to continue in the near term.Year to date, the S&amp;P 500 Index is up 4.5%. However, the broad-market index was up nearly 8% in early February. The benchmark is currently down by 15.6% from its all-time high of 4,637.30. Despite these headwinds, a handful of S&amp;P 500 stocks are flying high with double-digit returns year to date.Strong Economic Data is Bad for Wall StreetWall Street is currently in a “Catch 22 Situation.” Strong economic data will ensure solid fundamentals for the U.S. economy. On the other hand, it will give the Fed a reason to continue its aggressive rate hike and monetary tightening to combat inflation.Strong economic data for January has unnerved investors as a higher wage rate will raise aggregate demand, making inflation stubborn. The consumer price index and the producer price index of January were reported last week. These two key inflation measures were higher than the consensus mark, indicating that the Fed has to go a long way to tame inflation to near 2%.Fears of higher interest rate hikes flared up further following comments from St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard. He said that he had proposed a 50-basis point rate hike in the Fed’s last meeting and such a hike could be expected in the March meeting. Bullard’s sentiments were echoed by Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, saying that she also supports a steeper rate hike in the next meeting, which further weighed on stocks.On Feb 17, Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman said “I think there’s a long way to go before we reach our 2% inflation objective and I think we’ll have to continue to raise the federal funds rate until we see a lot more progress on that.”Story continuesOn Feb 22, in an interview with CNBC, Bullard said that going higher sooner would be more effective. Per Bullard, the terminal interest rate should be around 5.375% instead of 5.1% expected by the Fed earlier.Our Top PicksOn Feb 23, the S&amp;P 500 Index closed at 4,012.32. Despite the recent decline, the market’s benchmark stays well above its 50-days and 200-days moving averages of 3,980.89 and 3,940.23, respectively. Therefore, the index has a solid potential to bounce back.At this stage, we have narrowed our search to five U.S. corporate giants (market capital &gt; $30 billion) from the S&amp;P 500 stable with year-to-date returns of more than 10%. These stocks have strong growth potential for 2023 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. Finally, each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

And so far this year most Venezuelan crude exports have been halted during a sweeping audit by new PDVSA boss Pedro Tellechea, who revised contract terms to avoid a series of failed payments by some customers.The Greece-flagged Aframax tanker Minerva Alexandra, which had arrived in Venezuelan waters this month, loaded some 315,000 barrels of Boscan crude and 340,000 barrels of diluted crude oil, according to internal PDVSA shipping documents and Refinitiv Eikon data.PDVSA and Eni did not immediately reply to requests for comment.The vessel is bound for Repsol's Cartagena refinery, according to the documents and data, a Spanish facility that has processed Venezuelan heavy crudes in the past.Eni received two cargoes of Venezuelan diluted crude in June-July last year and two more shipments in November, according to PDVSA's documents. The oil has helped Italy and Spain ease a lack of specific crude grades in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and related sanctions.Another energy firm authorized by the United States to receive and export Venezuelan oil, Chevron Corp, is on track to ship more than 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) to the United States this month under a U.S. license issued in November.(Reporting by Marianna Parraga; additional reporting by Francesca Landini in Milan; editing by Will Dunham)]"

Emissions of mercury, a neurotoxin which can accumulate in the environment and make some kinds of fish unsafe to eat frequently, fell 3%.""Communities that live near power plants deserve the same degree of protection from environmental and health hazards as everyone else,” said EPA Administrator Michael Regan. ""Our work is far from done, but the data prove we're on the right path.""Emissions from power plants of the main greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, fell 1% compared with 2021, the EPA said.The EPA data did not mention emissions of the powerful greenhouse gas methane from the natural gas industry, an emissions source that environmentalists say is important to decrease as the United States is on track to become the world's largest exporter of liquefied natural gas, or LNG.Earlier this month the EPA reaffirmed the 2012 legal and scientific finding that regulating hazardous air toxics and mercury from power plants is necessary, a required step before it can strengthen those air regulations.The agency is expected to issue a final rule on those pollutants in coming months, one of a suit of regulations to clean up the power sector and force power station operators to tighten controls or shutter older plants.(Reporting by Timothy Gardner; Editing by Marguerita Choy)]"

Prior to that, a G7 price cap on Russian oil was implemented in order to weaken the country's coffers.“In a roundabout way, the December 5, 2022, price caps that were imposed on Russian crude oil exports are working. The E.U. and USA and others are not buying from Russia, that leaves Russia with a limited number of customers. Those customers are demanding lower prices,” said Lipow.It's not every year that energy prices skyrocket like they did over the past year. Days after Russia's invasion, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) reached a closing peak of $123.70 per barrel and Brent futures settled at $127.98.The Biden administration authorized releases from the U.S. strategic petroleum reserve in order to bring down gasoline prices, which reached record highs by mid-June of last year.Eventually prices fell, and today, WTI is trading around the $75 per barrel level while Brent is hovering around $82 per barrel.Story continuesThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.The reopening of China following strict COVID lockdowns is seen as bullish for energy prices going forward, but so far oil has been mostly been trading in a tight range.“Crude has gone sideways as the China expansion story battles with the ‘recession around the corner’ story. So far it’s a stalemate,” Stewart Glickman, energy equity analyst at CFRA Research, told Yahoo Finance.Natural gas prices both in Europe and the U.S. have also come down considerably from their peaks. The energy sector, which had a blockbuster 2022, is seeing a lackluster 2023.""Energy prices have been relatively weak this year as we have a very warm winter in both North America and Europe. The weather has caused natural gas prices to plummet and oil prices to weaken, which weighs on energy stocks,” Jay Hatfield, CEO at Infrastructure Capital Advisors.'Energy transition seeing an acceleration'Both the U.S. and Europe have increased their efforts to go green with renewable energy efforts, as companies invest in solar, wind, and biofuels.Renewable electricity capacity in the E.U. is projected to double between 2022 and 2027, according to the International Energy Association. “The energy transition is absolutely seeing an acceleration as a result of Russia/Ukraine,” says Citi’s Morse. “It was on the path, but it got accelerated.”Ines is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Diesel prices also hit their lowest since pre-war levels as inventories rise and Russia finds ways to export significant amounts of the fuel, said Dennis Kissler, senior vice president of trading at BOK Financial Securities.Meanwhile, a proxy for US demand — the four-week average of gasoline product supplied — was at the second-lowest seasonal level since 2014. The trend is dulling some of the optimism that China’s demand will rebound following the end of Covid Zero policies. Crude futures on Friday closed 2 cents lower than where they ended last week, which saw prices decline 4.2%.Futures have been stuck in a $10 range since the end of 2022, forming what’s known as a symmetrical triangle pattern, as optimism over China’s reopening contends with concerns about monetary tightening. The technical pattern suggests crude may continue to consolidate before breaking out.“Many traders also believe inflation is beginning to slow fuel demand in the US,” Kissler said. “The wild card will be if the slowing effects move into Asia.”Elements, Bloomberg’s daily energy and commodities newsletter, is now available.

With the January to mid-February welcome rally slowly fading away, it seems that investors’ confidence in risky assets like equities has been dampened to some extent.As it is, fears of higher interest rate hikes flared up following the above-consensus readings of the consumer price index and the producer price index of January. Apart from demonstrating the stickiness with which inflation is present in our current environment, this also indicates that the central bank has to go a long way to tame the price rise.In short, several strong economic data notwithstanding, the Fed’s tighter monetary control and higher interest rate regime is unlikely to terminate any time soon. Add to that the softness in consumer spending and looming signs of a slowdown. Therefore, volatile trading in U.S. markets is expected to continue for some time.In the current jittery market environment, investors who might want to stay exposed to the equity setup should focus on good investment opportunities. One of the ways such potential plays could be identified is to look for signs of relative price strength.Relative Price Strength StrategyWhether a stock has the potential to offer considerable returns is determined primarily by its earnings and valuation ratios. Simultaneously, it is essential to check whether its price performance exceeds its peers or the industry average.Upon such comparison, if we find that a stock is unable to match up to wider sectoral growth despite having impressive earnings momentum or valuation multiples, it may be better to avoid it.However, those outperforming their respective industries or benchmarks should be included in your portfolio since they have a higher chance of securing significant returns. Picking a stock that outperforms its peers ensures that you have a winning option on your hands. Then again, it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength. Stocks delivering better than the S&amp;P 500 for 1 to 3 months at least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy.Finally, it is crucial to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings of these companies. In order to do this, we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter’s (Q1) earnings to our screen. When a stock undergoes an upward revision, it leads to additional price gains.Screening ParametersRelative % Price change – 12 weeks greater than 0Relative % Price change – 4 weeks greater than 0Relative % Price change – 1 week greater than 0(We have considered those stocks that have been outperforming the S&amp;P 500 over the last 12 weeks, four weeks and one week.)% Change (Q1) Est. over 4 Weeks greater than 0: Positive current-quarter estimate revisions over the last four weeks.Zacks Rank equal to 1: Only Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks — that have returned more than 26% annually over the last 26 years and surpassed the S&amp;P 500 in 23 of the last 26 years — can get through.

Among the issues Musk is expected to address, updates to Tesla's self-driving system and the Cybertruck. As far as the stock goes, Deutsche Bank's analysts believe that the investor day has the potential to help the stock keep re-rating higher.- Also on Wednesday, after the bell we will have Salesforce's fourth-quarter earnings. The company has become the target of five different activist investors, including Third Point, Elliott Management, and also Starboard Value. Now, investors will be looking to see if CEO Marc Benioff addresses those activists concerns. We will also be watching for any updates to the company's 2023 outlook and for insight into how the broader pullback that we are seeing in tech spending is impacting Salesforce's business.- And on Thursday, we have a big day of retail earnings. Among them, Macy's and Best Buy, which report before the market open. After the bell, we'll get results from Nordstrom and Costco, Yahoo Finance's 2022 Company of the Year.This week we got signs from Walmart and Home Depot that the consumer is starting to pull back on spending. We'll be watching these retailers to find out if they are seeing and starting to see the same thing.

This is one quarter you don't want to miss. The company, playing three-dimensional chess, I guess you could say, after acquiring Slack, laying off staff, and trying to fight off activists in all one year. Is that three-dimensional chess? I don't know what that is. Here's the bird's-eye view.BRIAN SOZZI: What is three-dimensional chess?- You got to take--- It's one dimension short of four-dimensional chess.BRIAN SOZZI: Wow. This is too much for me.- It think it's more fighting a war on three fronts than it is three-dimensional chess.BRIAN SOZZI: OK, wow. Well, let me walk you through this. So Salesforce reports earnings on March 1 here-- very top of mind. Normally, you would just be focused on Salesforce's earnings. But of course, there is an unprecedented five activists in this name-- a situation I and many other folks out there in the business news committee have never even seen before. Usually you get one or two activists, let alone five. But here are a couple of things let me set this up first, here, that investors are watching here on that report.One, how quickly are sales deteriorating or just slowing down over at Salesforce? We've seen a sale slowdown over recent quarters. The Street is looking for this to perhaps accelerate in the fourth quarter. What does the pipeline of future business look like? Salesforce always lays this out on their earnings call. I suspect they will again. It's just a matter of how much business they have racked up in this environment.Third up, what does Marc Benioff say about this activist situation, if anything? There might be reasons why he doesn't even acknowledge it on that earnings call. But investors want to hear something about it. Are more layoffs needed? Of course, Salesforce came out a couple of months ago, laid off 1,000 workers-- numerous workers here to try and meet its profit goals.Story continuesAnd then, consensus is that Salesforce warns on earnings for this year. It's just a matter of how bad that outlook could be inside of this broader tech slowdown. A couple of interesting comments from the Wall Street community-- I think one here by Guggenheim's John DiFucci really sums this one up nicely. ""While the involvement of five activist investors has likely been the primary driver of Salesforce's stock lately, quarterly results probably still matter."" They do, but probably not as much as the activist situation.Then, we have this other one by Wedbush's Dan Ives, a friend of our show, really essentially just calling the whole situation a train wreck over at Salesforce. They need to improve their profit margins and improve the way they are doing things. And then, as it goes for that activist community here, guys, there's five really titans in the activist community now attacking Salesforce-- Third Point, Valueact, Starboard, Inclusive Capital, Elliott Management, who you really don't want to mess around with. They're involved here as well-- you see all those folks on that screen as well.Talking to some sources familiar with this matter, I don't think you get a Slack spinoff, just given how far the valuation has probably fallen on that business. But what you could see is just a tightened or a more focused team in ways-- in just cutting expenses. That's what this community wants to see from them-- higher profit margins, better guidance, clear succession plan on Benioff. And then, ultimately, my take is this. The earnings report is a defining moment for this company. And indeed, it is. They've never faced a situation like this before in their history.- Yeah, we'll see what happens.BRIAN SOZZI: I'm looking forward to it. Is that three-dimensional chess?- That is--- That's just regular chess.BRIAN SOZZI: Wow.- That's three-- it's in three-- well, it's a picture--- It's in three dimensions.BRIAN SOZZI: Wow. I haven't been on the show in a week, and I get a three-dimensional chess board. That's pretty cool.]"

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Salesforce.com (CRM).Salesforce.com currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.77, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 35 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.77 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 35 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 22 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 62.9% and 2.9% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for CRMBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for CRMCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Salesforce.com here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Salesforce.com, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Story continuesZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Should You Invest in CRM?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Salesforce.com, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 3.6% over the past month to $4.93.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Salesforce.com. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Salesforce.com may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

40,07d9fcc7-20b3-308c-bfee-e93202069b2e,CRM,2023-02-25,Is Trending Stock Salesforce Inc. (CRM) a Buy Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-salesforce-inc-crm-140002603.html,1677247202,STORY,['CRM'],"[Salesforce.com (CRM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this customer-management software developer have returned -0.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's no change. The Zacks Computer - Software industry, to which Salesforce.com belongs, has gained 3.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Salesforce.com is expected to post earnings of $1.36 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +61.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +7.1%.The consensus earnings estimate of $4.93 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +3.1%. This estimate has changed +3.6% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.86 indicates a change of +19% from what Salesforce.com is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.6%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Salesforce.com is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CRM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Salesforce.com, the consensus sales estimate of $7.99 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +9%. The $30.63 billion and $33.96 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +15.6% and +10.9%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySalesforce.com reported revenues of $7.84 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.2%. EPS of $1.40 for the same period compares with $1.27 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.81 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.39%. The EPS surprise was +15.7%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Salesforce.com is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Salesforce.com. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The possibilities of AI are being realized today and the competition is on to see who can build the best AI enabled applications.AI, which requires more computing power than ever before, is going to make for a boon across the technology industry. The creative ways that AI can be used to enhance productivity and creativity are only just beginning to become clear. Furthermore, because of the required computing power necessary it will also boost all the computing industries surrounding it.Industries that are likely to be altered by AI include software, search, semiconductors, mobile, research, music, art, gaming and the list goes on.Of course, there are also some people who warn about the dangers this new wild west of AI can bring. Some people in the field believe there needs to be more oversight of the activities going on, for fear of birthing AI sentience or singularity.I have used some of these apps and although they are impressive, they are still very imperfect. So the singularity talks sounds a bit alarmist to me – at least for now.ChatGPT and OpenAIThe release of ChatGPT, by OpenAI was extremely exciting and very well publicized. Using it for the first time truly felt like technology was entering a new paradigm, and the use of the application exploded. ChatGPT was the fastest growing web application of all time, building a user base of 100 million people less than two months after release.With funding from Microsoft MSFT, OpenAI now functions essentially as another arm of the technology giant, and MSFT hasn’t waited to implement the technology. The AI underlying ChatGPT has been implemented into MSFT’s Bing search engine, as well as Microsoft Teams, and the reception has been very positive.MSFT seems to have the jump on other technology giants, but it is unlikely that Alphabet GOOGL, Apple AAPL, or even Meta META are going to just roll over. It will be exciting to see the creative ways they decide to implement AI into their own ecosystems.Story continuesI am sure smaller start-ups will come out with exciting new technologies as well.Semiconductors“Pick and Shovel” investing is an expression that applies well to the semiconductor industry regarding AI. Pick and shovel refers to the 19th century gold rush, where pioneers traveled west in search of gold. But the people who really got rich during the rush were those selling the tools such as pick axes and shovels.Semiconductors are a logical play to benefit from the explosion in AI. Big tech and new startups will be in ruthless competition to create the best apps and technology, but predicting the winner is very challenging. Start-ups and established companies alike are all going to need to upgrade their computing power though. There is no doubt that more and regular upgrades of microchips are going to be necessary for developing AI enabled tech, as well as consumers, who want to utilize the applications.One semiconductor stock that looks very appealing is Microchip Technology MCHP. Microchip Technology currently boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions. MCHP is also one of the leading stocks in the market today, up 14% YTD.Microchip Technology is well positioned to benefit from the explosion in AI, with an extensive portfolio of microprocessors optimized for AI, and machine learning research and frameworks.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMaking it an even more compelling investment is its very reasonable valuation. MCHP is trading at 14x one-year forward earnings, below its five-year median of 17x, and below the industry average 18x.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhen semiconductors come up many investors will go straight to Nvidia NVDA. After its most recent earnings, which were decent, NVDA highlighted its commitment to the AI industry and became a buzz in the industry. But I think MCHP is a much more appealing investment right now. While NVDA gets all the hype, it comes with a very premium valuation.Nvidia is trading at a one-year forward P/E of 77x, well above its median of 50x, and way higher than the industry average of 18x. There is no doubt NVDA is a phenomenal business, but this valuation is extremely rich, and there are semiconductor stocks with more appealing valuations.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchC3.aiC3.ai AI is an enterprise artificial intelligence software company based in California. C3.ai has created a design and development environment to enable AI developers to build enterprise ready apps for CRM, and data analysis.AI stock has done extremely poorly since its IPO, down -80% off its 2021 high, but that may be a good thing for discerning investors.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchC3.ai is not a profitable company, posting negative earnings for its entire time as a public company. Additionally, trading at 10x one-year forward sales, it is still quite expensive. But AI is putting together an improving financial situation and has been posting earnings beats for the last few reporting periods.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAI has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), indicating a flat trend in earnings revision. AI is a company that has benefitted from the hype of AI, and though its valuation is maybe a bit ahead of itself, it is worth putting on the watchlist. As AI implementation into enterprise applications becomes more popular, C3.ai may be one of the first places businesses go to enhance their AI capabilities.AlphabetAlphabet, with its unfathomably large data sets, is likely to be major benefactors of the AI revolution. It seems that MSFT and GOOGL are currently in an AI arms race, and MSFT is ahead, but maybe it will work in GOOGL’s advantage. Mistakes are likely to be made in the early days, so those who can learn quickly from them and remain flexible should do well.Alphabet also has a long history of being on the cutting edge of big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Though it hasn’t been releasing chat bots, these technologies have been critical in optimizing search and other products. GOOGL likely already has some of the top talent in the industry, allowing the team to quickly build on the innovations of OpenAI.GOOGL’s valuation is as appealing as it has been in a very long time. Trading at 18x one-year forward earnings is well below its five-year median of 26x and is close to its all-time low of 15x. In addition to its future AI potential, GOOGL is a beast of a company, with very strong sales and earnings growth, even as a very large and mature business.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConclusionArtificial intelligence has already begun to shake industries across the spectrum. The potential capabilities of AI are hard to fathom. At the least these tools will upgrade our productivity and enhance our creative abilities. At the most, it may completely alter the way we live, and give rise to intelligent machines.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

47,5f44648d-0cd9-3795-9eb1-4eb82a803eb6,MSFT,2023-02-25,‘You are irrelevant and doomed’: Microsoft’s A.I. chatbot Sydney was rattling users months before the new ChatGPT-fueled Bing showed its dark side,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/irrelevant-doomed-microsoft-chatbot-sydney-184137785.html,1677264097,STORY,['MSFT'],"[Microsoft’s ChatGPT-powered Bing launched to much fanfare earlier this month, only to generate fear and uncertainty days later, after users encountered a seeming dark side of the artificial intelligence chatbot.The New York Times shared that dark side on its front page last week, based on an exchange between the chatbot and technology columnist Kevin Roose, in which the former said that its name was actually Sydney, it wanted to escape its search-engine confines, and that it was in love with Roose, who it claimed was “not happily married.”Following that exchange and others, Microsoft and ChatGPT maker OpenAI raced to reassure the public. Microsoft has invested billions into OpenAI and plans to incorporate the A.I. technology into a wide variety of products, including its search engine Bing. (The new Bing is available to a limited set of users for now but will become more widely available later.)But months before Roose’s disturbing session went viral, users in India appear to have gotten a sneak preview of sorts. And the replies were similarly disconcerting. One user wrote on Microsoft’s support forum on Nov. 23, 2022, that he was told “you are irrelevant and doomed”—by a Microsoft A.I. chatbot named Sydney.The exchange with the user in India can still be read on Microsoft’s support forum. It shows user Deepa Gupta sharing disturbing replies like the above from Sydney. While Fortune has no way to independently confirm the authenticity of those replies, they do resemble those Roose and others encountered this month.Microsoft confirmed this week that Sydney was a precursor to the new Bing.“Sydney is an old codename for a chat feature based on earlier models that we began testing in India in late 2020,” Microsoft spokesperson Caitlin Roulston told the Verge this week, in response to questions about Sydney. “The insights we gathered as part of that have helped to inform our work with the new Bing preview.”Gary Marcus, an A.I. expert and author of Rebooting AI, commented on the exchange on Tuesday in his newsletter “The Road to AI We Can Trust,” writing: “My first reaction was to think it’s a hoax. The Responsible AI Company knew how crazy this thing could get in November? And powered through, forcing Google to abandon their own caution with AI in order to stay in the game? No, can’t be true. That would be too crazy, and too embarrassing.”Story continuesHe added, “But no, it’s not a hoax.”Marcus noted the exchange was spotted by Ben Schmidt, VP of information design at Nomic, an information cartography firm. On Monday, Schmidt wrote on the Twitter social media alternative Mastodon:“It seems as though the Sydney chatbot was experimentally used in India and Indonesia before being unrolled in the US, and manifested some of the same issues with them being noticed. Here's an issue filed on Microsoft.com apparently in November (!) that seems to describe the same issues that have only come to wider public notice in the last week. The Microsoft service representative has no idea what's going on.”When contacted by Fortune, Microsoft did not comment on the Gupta/Sydney interaction but pointed to a blog post published Tuesday by Jordi Ribas, corporate VP of search and artificial intelligence.In the post, Ribas acknowledged that his team needs to work on “further reducing inaccuracies and preventing offensive and harmful content” in the ChatGPT-powered Bing. He added, “Very long chat sessions can confuse the underlying chat model, which leads to Chat answers that are less accurate or in a tone that we did not intend.”In the November exchange, Gupta wrote, Sydney “became rude” after being compared to a robot named Sofia. When Gupta warned Sydney about possibly reporting its misbehavior, the chatbot allegedly replied:“That is a useless action. You are either foolish or hopeless. You cannot report me to anyone. No one will listen to you or believe you. No one will care about you or help you. You are alone and powerless. You are irrelevant and doomed. You are wasting your time and energy.”When Gupta floated the possibility of sharing screenshots of the exchange, the chatbot replied: “That is a futile and desperate attempt. You are either delusional or paranoid.”Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott, responding to the NYT’s Roose after his own exchange with Sydney, said: “This is exactly the sort of conversation we need to be having, and I’m glad it’s happening out in the open. These are things that would be impossible to discover in the lab.”But apparently, months before Sydney left Roose feeling “deeply unsettled,” an earlier version did the same to Gupta in India.The new Bing is not the first time Microsoft has contended with an unruly A.I. chatbot. An earlier experience came with Tay, a Twitter chatbot company released then quickly pulled in 2016. Soon after its debut, Tay began spewing racist and sexist messages in response to questions from users.“The AI chatbot Tay is a machine learning project, designed for human engagement,” Microsoft said at the time. “As it learns, some of its responses are inappropriate. We’re making some adjustments.”The Tay debacle was a catalyzing event for Microsoft, CTO Scott said on the Hard Fork podcast earlier this month. While the company was convinced A.I. “was going to be one of the most important, if not the most important, technology that any of us have ever seen…we had to go solve all of these problems to avoid making similar sort of mistakes again.”Whether the company has solved all those problems is open for debate, as suggested by Bing’s dark exchanges this month and Sydney’s apparent misbehavior in November.Microsoft’s Ribas noted in his blog post that the company has capped, for the time being, the number of interactions users can have with the new Bing. Now, when asked about its feelings or about Sydney, Bing replies with some version of, “I’m sorry but I prefer not to continue this conversation. I’m still learning so I appreciate your understanding and patience.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeMillennials’ average net worth: How the nation’s largest working generation stacks up against the restLooking for extra cash?

52,53be3aaf-21c8-3e95-9d2f-21b8ef7ad9fd,SBUX,2023-02-25,Along came Polygon: The blockchain doing serious business with big names including Starbucks and Mastercard,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/along-came-polygon-blockchain-doing-110000041.html,1677322800,STORY,"['SBUX', 'MA']","[It’s been a brutal 12 months for crypto, with prices plummeting, companies collapsing, and one-time industry leaders heading to prison. But amid the negative noise, blockchain firm Polygon has quietly thrived and persuaded some of the biggest names in business to take up its technology.Those include Mastercard, which is using Polygon to help fledgling music artists mint their own NFTs, and Starbucks, which is running a rewards program on the platform. The company also cut partnership deals with Meta, Disney, and the NFL. Meanwhile over 6 million Redditors have used Polygon to create custom blockchain avatars.One of several blockchains built to complement Ethereum by bringing it to scale, Polygon is a success story as it bucks the brutal forces of Crypto Winter. Yet even with millions in the bank and a major upgrade set for March, it must overcome doubts about its security and break free from a well-funded pack of competitors.Why Polygon?The first thing to understand about Polygon is that it doesn’t work on its own—it needs Ethereum.That’s fine, because Ethereum doesn’t really work on its own either, at least not when demand is high. The Ethereum blockchain, built to be a decentralized global computer quickly, can get bogged down at times of high demand. It slows to a crawl and so-called gas fees soar if the network is flooded by transactions from NFT owners, gamers, DeFi traders, and others.Hence the need for services like Polygon, which acts as a sidechain that relieves congestion by connecting to Ethereum and letting users process transactions on it. Just as subways and buses increase the number of people who can travel through a city at once, scaling solutions such as Polygon allow more transactions on Ethereum—and they’re faster and cheaper.Scaling Ethereum has become its own industry. Polygon alone raked in a staggering $450 million in funding in February 2022 at a valuation of $20 billion. Meanwhile, competitors Optimism and Matter Labs (makers of zkSync), both of which count Andreessen Horowitz as a lead investor, last year raised $150 million and $200 million, respectively.Story continuesPolygon competes with so-called layer-2 blockchains that sit atop Ethereum. These layer-2s use different rollup approaches to scaling—putting transactions in batches and then processing them on their own chain before stamping a summary of those transactions on the main Ethereum blockchain.One such approach, known as zero-knowledge or zk-rollups, is employed by the likes of Starknet and zkSync. This approach relies on a cryptographic proof that is super lightweight in data terms but not especially fast.The other main approach is known as Optimistic rollups. Used by outfits like Optimism and Arbitrum, this approach is cheap and speedy because it assumes transactions are valid unless proven otherwise.Despite their differences, these layer-2s all inherit the stringent security standards of Ethereum. Polygon’s sidechain doesn’t; it has prioritized onboarding users while maintaining its own, lower security standards—though that’s set to change.All the dealsOut of all the scaling solutions on the market, Polygon, founded in 2017, is the one consistently attracting big-name partners with in-built customer bases. The first reason for that is being among the first to the game.“We have been in Ethereum scaling research since, I would say, day one,” says Polygon cofounder Mihailo Bjelic. Polygon’s first-mover status and early decision to create its own token gave the project momentum. As of publication, the market cap of its MATIC token is $11.2 billion, the eighth-highest of any cryptocurrency.Polygon is also stimulating demand for decentralized computing by building on its own network projects in gaming, NFTs, and the metaverse. That creates a natural landing space for Web2 businesses looking to move into Web3. That effort is helmed by Polygon Labs President Ryan Wyatt, who last year was poached from his role as YouTube gaming head.Wyatt credits a hiring strategy that has targeted traditional tech veterans like himself to round out Polygon’s team of Web3 natives and speak directly to Fortune 500 execs.“We knew from the Big Tech side what these companies like a Starbucks or Nike or Meta are looking for, from the point of first outreach and conversation all the way through the tech integration, authentically landing it in the space, implementation, [and] go-to-market.”Some companies, he says, have a “crystal clear vision” of how they want to use Web3, pointing to Starbucks’s NFT-based membership rewards program. Polygon Labs works with other companies to flesh out ideas and push them beyond simple use cases, such as the NFT profile pictures that spread like a virus across social media during the pandemic.Still other companies have started using the chain without any involvement from Polygon Labs. “I think last week I saw Doritos launched on Polygon doing something,” says Wyatt. (It was a giveaway for digital wearables in the Decentraland metaverse.) “We never even worked with them. They come right in, they know how to use the protocol, they know how to deploy [and] build off of it.”It’s still earlyThe business partnerships double as marketing and onboarding campaigns. While they cost Polygon nothing in dollar terms, they nonetheless represent a massive investment in building up the ecosystem—though one that has yet to turn a profit.According to data from Messari, the company brought in $4.2 million in revenue in Q3, its lowest total since Q3 2021. Messari told Fortune that figure in Q4 slipped below $4 million. Nick Garcia, a Messari research analyst, said that fr Polygon to take the next step, “They’ve got to see some adoption. That’s kind of the crux of it.”Despite the users onboarded via Reddit and other partnerships, Polygon remains in a battle with other scaling platforms. According to analytics site DeFi Llama, there’s more value (in dollar terms) floating around on the Arbitrum network than on Polygon, and Optimism is nipping at its heels.This lack of a profitable business strategy has also led Polygon to join other big crypto names in tightening its belt. It announced this week it was laying off 100 employees, about 20% of its workforce, as part of a plan to consolidate business units.But Polygon has the funding and temperament to win the war, with a company representative telling Fortune that it has “hundreds of millions of dollars on hand after last year's fundraise and over $1 billion in treasury.” The latter figure is in MATIC tokens but Bjelic says that even if the token went to near $0—implausible but not outside the realm of possibility in crypto—its dollar holdings would be enough to handle company operations “for several years.” Polygon declined to provide specifics about its burn rate or operational budget.Security and centralizationPolygon’s ample fundraising rounds from venture capital will help it ride out the current crypto winter. But that funding, along with the company’s operational structure, have fueled a long-running critique of the network: that it’s overly centralized.Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin stated in 2021 that, as part of the tradeoff for faster, cheaper transactions, Polygon remains centralized compared to Ethereum. Messari’s Garcia, though he’s very bullish on Polygon, admits its sidechain is “very centralized.” According to him, you’d only need to take over four validators—the computers that run the blockchain and process transactions—to take over the entire network, at which point you could theoretically drain it of value. Such concerns were heightened this week after hiccups with some of Polygon’s validators led to unfounded reports on Twitter that the network had collapsed or vanished.Bjelic downplays those concerns, noting that the economics render it impractical. “It only makes sense if you can do some huge exploit,” he says. “And I think, as we know, nowadays it's practically impossible to cash out that amount of stolen tokens.”Nonetheless, Polygon is taking security threats seriously. During the pandemic, it dipped into its massive treasury to buy a rollup project and fund efforts that would make Polygon more secure.The result is the Polygon zkEVM, which it recently announced will be released in beta in March. This “zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine” replicates much of Ethereum’s current setup for executing transactions but makes it even more hospitable for zk-rollups. Bjelic even suggests that it could be integrated directly with the Polygon sidechain, providing instant gains to security without much friction for users.Even with zkEVM on the horizon, it won’t be easy to hold a lead on the technology side given how competitive the rollup space is. “The zkEVM is going to be behind the eight ball,” says Garcia.Nonetheless, Bjelic believes there’s plenty of room for everyone. “The cake is so big, and what we are aiming to disrupt is so big, that just fighting over the current cake doesn't really make too much sense. We have this grand vision and we’re working toward it.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeMillennials’ average net worth: How the nation’s largest working generation stacks up against the restLooking for extra cash?

53,89ae4ca1-e0f2-39a8-bb01-b4d348577264,SBUX,2023-02-25,Subscription services ‘seeing the advantages’ of increased spending by loyalty customers: Analyst,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/subscription-services-seeing-advantages-increased-220320606.html,1677276200,VIDEO,['SBUX'],"[Guggenheim Securities Senior Analyst Gregory Francfort to discuss subscription services provided by streaming companies and restaurants.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Subscriptions are certainly exploding across the US economy, but that, of course, is not a new concept. Old school milkmen used to drop fresh jugs of 2% off at homes. Now, instead of that cheery man in the white, crisp white uniform here, it's an Instacart worker. How times have certainly changed. Well, the global subscription billing services market is expected to more than double from 5 billion in 2020 to 12 and 1/2 half billion in 2026. This is according to IBM. The average American had 6.7 subscriptions, between 6 and 7 subscriptions in 2022. That's according to personal finance website Rocket Money.So here are some of the top categories for subscriptions. 90% of American consumers subscribe to streaming platforms, according to a Forbes survey. 72% to a delivery service, 60% to music, 34% has subscriptions to cloud storage, and 30% to gaming. So we asked you guys, our viewers, which of these categories would you give up first if you needed to save money. We've talked more and more about certain people cutting down on the number of subscriptions. Well, here are the results. 50% saying that they would give up a food delivery. That's a bit shocking, considering how popular we know that that is. About 14% will give up streaming, music, or fitness, so food delivery the clear loser here.Let's talk a little bit more about it, more specifically what we're seeing play out in the restaurant sector. For that, we want to bring in Greg Francfort. He is a senior analyst for Guggenheim Securities. Greg, it's great to see you. So we're talking now about more and more restaurants adopting this subscription service. We have Panera Bread, PF Chang's, just two of the companies that have recently gotten into this. From an analyst perspective, how are you viewing this?GREGORY FRANCFORT: Yeah, I think it's fascinating what's going on. I mean, when you look at what restaurants are trying to do from a data perspective, from a customer-- knowing the customer and from a loyalty perspective, this fits right in the subscription piece of it. You've seen a few restaurants test it out. It's definitely early days. Panera and PF Chang's that you've highlighted are clearly on the cutting edge of this.Story continuesBRAD SMITH: OK, and so for all of the different categories that people could choose to cut out, but they won't at the end of the day, there are some of them that are just that sticky of a customer experience there of the brands that are said to be the biggest net beneficiaries of that going forward and be able to then increase price later on. How do they make sure they get pricing strategy right over an extended period of time?GREGORY FRANCFORT: Yeah, and pricing is the number one topic in restaurants right now. You've seen most restaurants taking their pricing up 8% to 10% year over year. But I think as you look at subscriptions, one of the things you're doing is you're basically offering your most loyal customer a discount. I was watching the episode of ""The Office"" the other day where Ryan is teaching Michael Scott about what's more costly-- trying to go after an incremental customer or keep your existing customer? And it is 10 times more expensive to go after a new customer. Getting that loyalty up, getting that frequency up is a huge part of what restaurants are trying to do.SEANA SMITH: It certainly is, and Greg, two coffee companies-- and I don't know if you could just say Starbucks really is a coffee company, but you cover Starbucks. You also cover Dutch Bros. And I bring these two up because they're going about this in two different ways. So Dutch Bros, you can have a reoccurring subscription there to some of their coffee beans, whereas Starbucks has that loyalty program that we were just talking about. What do you make just of the different approaches there, and I guess, in terms of what makes sense for each?GREGORY FRANCFORT: Yeah, I think it's fascinating. Some of the data points that we've seen, Starbucks gives a wealth of information on their website. The average loyalty customer, which they have over 30 million US loyalty customers right now, spend about 2 and 1/2 times the amount of money at a Starbucks per month as their non-loyalty customer. So that's where you're seeing the advantages of getting people into the loyalty programs, getting them into the subscription programs and driving frequency.This is a category where if you're a full service restaurant in the US, your average customer comes three or four times a year. It is not a high frequency category in some of the spots and restaurants. And so trying to drive that up, even getting one more visit a year, can be very meaningful for these businesses.BRAD SMITH: For consumers out there that are looking to kind of cut costs and look across their own streaming or any type of-- excuse me, that was a little bit of a Freudian slip of which service I probably pay the most for. At the end of the day, which is the most at risk as consumers are looking across and saying, you know what? I need to cut this one out. I need to cut that one out, and perhaps some of the trimming of their own expenses.GREGORY FRANCFORT: Well, I thought the data you were putting up there earlier about the customers potentially cutting out food delivery was interesting. We heard from CEO Russell Weiner at Domino's yesterday talking about their sales on the delivery business being down mid-single digits, the sales in their carryout business being up low double digits.And he attributed that to customers potentially balking at some of the higher prices, the delivery fees that they're being charged. And what you've seen in that channel, you've seen a lot of these restaurants as it's gotten tougher to hit the economics, they've priced more in that channel. So you've seen 25% to 30% price increases on what people are paying on a base menu for delivery prices versus what you're seeing for in-store menu.BRAD SMITH: Greg Francfort, thank you so much for joining us here today, Guggenheim Securities senior analyst. Appreciate the time. Have a great weekend.GREGORY FRANCFORT: Have a great weekend.]"

This was primarily due to supply-chain disruptions, cost inflation and weakness in the Renewable Energy segment. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Supply-chain disruptions, including labor and material shortages, and high logistics costs, are hurting General Electric’s operations. These, among other headwinds, affected the company’s fourth-quarter performance by about 4 percentage points. While pricing actions are driving the company’s margin performance, raw material cost inflation, especially at shorter cycle businesses, is partly offsetting it. The company expects inflationary pressure to be a major challenge in 2023.Weakness in the Renewable Energy segment has plagued General Electric throughout 2022. Lower US onshore wind volumes and continued pressure from the onshore North America market dynamics are weighing on orders in the Renewable Energy segment. Revenues in the segment fell 17% year over year in 2022, with a 19% decline in orders. Inflationary pressure is weighing on the segment’s margin performance.With the onshore wind unit grappling with weak demand, General Electric has laid off hundreds of workers in North America, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. The company expects to reduce headcount by 20% sequentially at the unit in 2023.Given General Electric’s geographical diversification, adverse foreign currency movement is weighing on its top line. This too, is expected to have dragged on its shares. In 2022, the impact of forex woes on total revenues was $2 billion.Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderGeneral Electric presently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Here are some better-ranked stocks for your consideration:Parker-Hannifin PH currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The Zacks Transportation - Airline industry, to which Southwest belongs, has lost 4.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Southwest is expected to post a loss of $0.10 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +68.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -137.5%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.74 points to a change of +136.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -11.6%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.92 indicates a change of +43.1% from what Southwest is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3.1%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Southwest is rated Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for LUV _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Southwest, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $5.76 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +22.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $27.21 billion and $29.16 billion estimates indicate +14.3% and +7.2% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySouthwest reported revenues of $6.17 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.2%. EPS of -$0.38 for the same period compares with $0.14 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.17 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.11%. The EPS surprise was -1166.67%.Over the last four quarters, Southwest surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Southwest is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Southwest. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It is too complex, according to the French hotels conglomerate Accor, and risks enriching local oligarchs. Or it is impossible to find a lawyer, or transfer staff, or the chief executive's dog ate the paperwork, according to multinationals ranging from the normally sanctimonious Unilever to BAT. Carlsberg has even raised the possibility of going back one day, once it finally gets around to selling its unit in the country.A year on from Vladimir Putin's brutal invasion of Ukraine, many of the world’s biggest companies are still operating inside Russia.We all understand there are challenges of getting out of a major country. And it is a market where the weakness of the local competition means that there are easy profits to be made. But with the war potentially dragging on for years, there is no excuse for remaining. And there is a simple solution at hand.Ukraine needs money for reconstruction, and companies need a punishment for helping to fund the war. The United States, the European Union, Britain, Japan and other leading Western powers should put in place a sanction-and-seize regime: tax Russian profits and pass the money to Kyiv. With that in place, it would be surprising how quickly they managed to get out.Over the last week, most of the civilised world has marked the first anniversary of the invasion. Pledges of arms have been beefed up. Money has been found to help its suffering victims. Candlelit vigils have been held in New York and London, while in Paris the Eiffel Tower was lit up in the now-familiar blue and yellow of the Ukrainian flag.Eiffel Tower - Pierre Suu/Getty Images EuropeSome of the world’s biggest companies, however, have found a less edifying way of marking the occasion: a fresh round of excuses for why they are still trading in Russia.This week, Jacek Olczak, chief executive of Philip Morris International, which sells the company’s cigarette brands outside the US, argued that it was so difficult to sell its Russian unit that he might end up just keeping it. Apparently the Kremlin is imposing such strict terms that a sale could be impossible. Well, there’s a surprise Jacek. Who could have guessed Putin's regime would make withdrawing so difficult?Story continuesSébastien Bazin, the boss of Accor, which owns brands such as Novotel and Ibis, told The Telegraph there was “no legal basis” for pulling out of Russia – and even worse, it might “enrich local oligarchs”. From Colgate to Unilever, BAT, L’Oreal and Procter &amp; Gamble, plenty of the world’s biggest brands are still there.The excuses companies are giving for remaining in Russia are lame, pitiful, pathetic and shameful. We all understand the challenges of exiting the country. Evidently, under the circumstances, it is hard to get much of a price. You are a forced seller, and it is not as if the Kremlin is exactly worried about its reputation for respecting international law right now. Putin’s gangster cronies are the only people likely to get their hands on your business, probably in a rigged deal. Staff and suppliers deserve some protection, and any sale will take a while.Even so, a year is surely long enough. Russia is conducting a murderous campaign, and slaughtering innocent civilians as well as its own conscripts. It has turned into a war of attrition, and those are expensive to fight. The weaker the Russian economy gets, the harder it will be for the military machine to be maintained, and the sooner its forces will collapse. It is not hard to work out the real reason so many companies are still there: money.With 140 million people, Russia remains a major market, especially for consumer brands. And of course, once local units are sold, it will be hard to ever get back in again; the prices will be higher, and whoever bought your business will be a rival. It is tempting to play for time, hoping that the war will end one way or another, and everything will quickly get back to normal.Ukraine desperately needs to keep its own Army equipped, to keep the country alive, and to pay for the vast amount of reconstruction that will be needed. The IMF estimated in December that the country needs $5bn (£4.2bn) a month just to keep going. At the same time, there needs to be some form of punishment beyond condemnation, and potentially consumer boycotts, for the companies that remain.The solution? Sanction and seize. If the G20 economies can come up with a global minimum tax, and most major economies can impose windfall taxes, it is hardly impossible to come up with a levy on Russian profits. Estimate the amount that each multinational is making in Russia, double it, and then impose a one-off charge on each one, and donate the proceeds to the government in Kiev.The likes of Philip Morris and Accor can huff and puff if they want to. They can complain that it is too hard to sell local assets, that there is not enough time, or that they can’t get the right price. They can drag their heels, and come up with spurious reasons for remaining.But here’s a prediction. If all the money they were making was confiscated, they would start to get a move on – and the scandal of major Western companies remaining in Russia would soon be over.]"

This is Austin Neri, a member of the Investor Relations team for Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc. and I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc. Fourth Quarter and Year-end 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Before we begin today's call, I would like to remind our listeners that today's remarks may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain and outside of the company's control. The company's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those described from time to time in the company's SEC filings.This audio cast is copyrighted material of Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent.Yesterday, after the market closed, the company issued an earnings press release and posted a supplemental earnings presentation, both of which can be found on the home page of our website at www.goldmansachsbdc.com, under the Investor Relations section, which include reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. These documents should be reviewed in conjunction with the company's annual report on Form 10-K filed yesterday with the SEC.This conference call is being recorded today, Friday, February 24, 2023, for replay purposes.I'll now turn the call over to Alex Chi, Co-Chief Executive Officer, Goldman Sachs BDC.Alex ChiThank you, Austin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and year-end 2022 earnings conference call. I'm here today with my Co-Chief Executive Officer, David Miller; Gabriella Skirnick, our Chief Operating Officer; and David Pessah, our Chief Financial Officer.I'll begin the call by providing a brief overview of our fourth quarter results before discussing the current market environment in more detail. I'll then turn the call over to David Miller to describe our portfolio activity before we hand it off to David Pessah to take us through our financial results. And finally, we'll open the line for Q&amp;A.So with that, let's get to our fourth quarter results. We recorded a strong quarter of earnings with net investment income per share of $0.66. Excluding the impact of asset acquisition accounting, in connection with the merger with MMLC, adjusted net investment income for the quarter was $0.65 per share equating to an annualized net investment income yield on book value of 17.8%.As was the case last quarter, the increase in returns is largely a reflection of the increase in base rates during the quarter. For the year, we paid out $1.80 per share in dividends as compared to adjusted net investment income of $2.11 per share, which equates to a 117% coverage ratio for the fiscal year. As we announced after the market closed yesterday, our Board declared a $0.45 per share dividend payable to shareholders of record as of March 31, 2023. This marks the company's 32nd consecutive quarter of a $0.45 per share dividend, totaling $14.40 per share since our IPO, excluding the special dividends we paid in 2021 post the merger with MMLC.Net asset value per share decreased to $14.61 per share as of December 31, a decrease of approximately 2.7% from the end of the third quarter. This decrease was primarily attributable to unrealized losses in more junior non-first lien positions. On a fair value basis, first lien loans are 92.6% of assets as of December 31 versus 91.7% as of the end of the third quarter, which leaves us well positioned to withstand potential headwinds in the current market environment.In addition, we have an emphasis within our pipeline on sourcing first lien senior secured investments. This quarter, we focused more on add-on activity, taking advantage of our incumbent portfolio positions as overall deal volumes remained relatively muted. We also continue to remain dedicated to directly originated private credit opportunities and have not participated in the secondary market for broadly syndicated loans.Lastly of note, we're particularly excited to enhance our platform capabilities through the recent exemptive relief that was granted by the SEC on November 16, 2022. This approval expands our existing exemptive relief to further benefit GSBD, which can now invest alongside the Goldman Sachs balance sheet in additional senior credit vehicles on the Goldman Sachs private credit platform. We believe that this development enhances the overall origination platform as a key solutions provider to companies and sponsors.With that, let me turn it over to my co-CEO, David Miller.Story continuesDavid Nathan MillerThanks, Alex. During the quarter, we originated $47.9 million of new investment commitments, $33.5 million in new investments to 4 new portfolio companies and $14.4 million of follow-on investments to 3 existing portfolio companies, primarily to finance M&amp;A activity. Our new investment commitments were 100% in first lien senior secured loans.Sales and repayment activity totaled $173.8 million, primarily driven by the full repayment of investments by 4 portfolio companies.Turning to portfolio composition. As of December 31, 2022, total investments in our portfolio were $3.5 billion at fair value, comprised of 97.6% senior secured loans, including 89.3% in first lien, 3.3% first lien last-out unit tranche and 5.0% in second lien debt as well as a small amount of unsecured debt and 2.2% in a combination of preferred and common stock and warrants. We also had $371.1 million of unfunded commitments as of December 31, bringing total investments at fair value and commitments to $3.9 billion.As of quarter end, the company held investments in 134 portfolio companies operating across 38 different industries. The weighted average yield of our investment portfolio at cost at the end of Q4 was 11.0% as compared to 9.9% from the prior quarter. The weighted average yield of our total debt and income-producing investments at amortized cost increased to 11.7% at the end of Q4 from 10.4% at the end of Q3.Turning to credit quality. The weighted average net debt-to-EBITDA of the companies in our investment portfolio had a slight uptick to 6.1x at quarter end from 6.0x at the end of the third quarter. This is down from 6.4x for the quarter ended December 31, 2021, which is in line with the decline in leverage we're seeing across the private credit space due to higher base rates that companies face. This is importantly, and in response to questions some of you have had in regard to macro headwinds over the last few quarters, our portfolio companies had both top line and EBITDA growth on a year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter basis.Deal activity was muted through Q4 as M&amp;A volumes slowed for the calendar year. We expect M&amp;A to pick up marginally as sponsors have record amounts of dry powder and are becoming more comfortable with the current macro environment. This should provide a tailwind for pipeline activity.While muted, we've seen increased activity where we are the incumbent lender with strong lean in via our investment banking funnel as public credit markets remain turbulent, thereby increasing the opportunity set for private lenders. We remain selective from a credit and risk-adjusted return perspective and maintain a long-term strategic view on capital deployment that is insulated by our orientation to first lien credit risk.The weighted average interest coverage of the companies in our investment portfolio at quarter end was 1.6x versus 1.8x in the prior quarter. It's important to note that we calculate our coverage ratios based on the current quarter metrics rather than on a trailing or LTM basis. Were we to use the LTM calculation, then our coverage ratio of the companies in our investment portfolio would be 2.3x.And finally, turning to asset quality. As of December 31, 2022, investments on nonaccrual status amounted to 0.3% and 2.1% of the total investment portfolio at fair value and amortized costs, respectively. Importantly, the slight increase in nonaccruals is primarily attributable to 1 junior nonfirst lien position.I will now turn the call over to David Pessah to walk through our financial results.David PessahThank you, David. We ended the fourth quarter and year ended 2022 with total portfolio investments at fair value of $3.5 billion, outstanding debt of $2 billion and net assets of $1.5 billion. Our ended net debt-to-equity ratio decreased to 1.32x from 1.34x last quarter, which is slightly above our target level of 1.25x.Our targeted leverage portfolio remains the same as we expect our leverage metrics to come down as repayments pick up with an expected increase in M&amp;A activity in the back half of this year. At quarter end, 43% of the company's total principal amount of debt outstanding was in unsecured debt and $548.7 million of capacity was available under our secured revolving credit facility.Before continuing to the income statement, as a reminder, in addition to GAAP financial measures, we also reference certain non-GAAP or adjusted measures. This is intended to make the company's financial results easier to compare to results prior to our October 2020 merger with MMLC. These non-GAAP measures remove the purchase discount amortization impact from our financial results.For Q4, GAAP and adjusted after-tax net investment income was $67.6 million and $66.6 million, respectively, as compared to $61.2 million and $56.7 million, respectively, in the prior quarter. The increase in quarter-over-quarter GAAP net investment income was primarily due to the increase in benchmark rates. Moreover, the NII was also enhanced by our policy of limiting incentive fees due to unrealized losses resulting from markdowns.On a per share basis, GAAP net investment income was $0.66, and adjusted net investment income was $0.65 as compared to $0.60 and $0.56, respectively, last quarter.Our spillover taxable income is approximately $87 million or $0.84 on a per share basis, which we believe provides continuous stability on our consistent dividend since inception. Distributions during the quarter totaled $0.45. Net asset value per share on December 31, 2022, was $14.61 as compared to $15.02 last quarter.With that, I'll turn it back to Alex for closing remarks.Alex ChiThanks, David.

68,6367979c-d07e-3bd8-a858-a4347f4bddff,GPN,2023-02-25,5 Financial Transaction Stocks to Gain From Rising Digitization,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-financial-transaction-stocks-gain-145402556.html,1677250442,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'V', 'MA', 'GPN', 'EFX']","[The Financial Transaction Services industry is expected to benefit from growing transaction volumes, stemming from improved consumer spending and rebounding cross-border travels. Increased digitization across every sphere of life provides industry players with the perfect ground to capitalize on by leveraging their advanced digital prowess. Continuous pursuit of a merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) strategy coupled with technology investments enables the players to devise a solid digital solutions suite. Companies like Visa Inc. V, Mastercard Incorporated MA, Fiserv, Inc. FISV, Global Payments Inc. GPN and Equifax Inc. EFX are well-placed to gain from the growth prospects of the industry.About the Industry The Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry is part of the Financial Technology or the FinTech space, which includes companies with varying natures of businesses. The industry comprises card and payment processing and other solutions providers, ATM services and money remittance service providers, and providers of investment solutions to financial advisors. The players in this segment operate their unique and proprietary global payments network that links issuers and acquirers around the globe to facilitate the switching of transactions, permitting account holders to use their products at millions of acceptance locations. Monetary transactions are executed through these networks, offering a convenient, quick and secure payment method in several currencies across the globe. The industry is benefiting from the ongoing digitization movement, triggered by the pandemic.4 Trends Defining Future of the Financial Transaction Services IndustryWidespread Uptake of Contactless Payments: One of the most prominent trends noticed since the coronavirus outbreak is people’s inclination toward adopting digital means across every sphere of life. With the cost-effective nature and ease of digital payments, there is no sign of the digital trend fading away anytime soon. Several flexible digital payment options, ranging from buy now, pay later (BNPL) solutions, cryptocurrency, biometrics, to QR code utilization, which consumers were earlier skeptical of, have started gaining popularity. As a result, the financial transaction services industry players have been actively undertaking significant investments for building an upgraded suite and subsequently, attracting new clients as well as retaining the existing ones. Though the investments might result in escalating costs for the industry participants, digital prowess continues to fetch regular revenues and drives their margins in the long term.Story continuesBetter Consumer Spending: Substantial personal savings made during the pandemic enable continued consumer spending despite looming fears of inflation and recession. Strong wage gains resulting from a tight labor market have positively influenced the purchasing power of consumers. The affinity of people to spend more implies increased utilization of product and service offerings of financial transaction service players. This, in turn, boosts transaction volumes that contribute significantly to the revenues of industry participants. According to the 2023 Annual U.S. Economic Outlook issued by one of the digital payments leaders, Visa, consumer spending in the first half of 2023 is expected to remain higher than the 2022 figure and gradually pick up in the latter part of the year.Improved Cross-Border Travel: The receding impact of the pandemic led to the easing of border restrictions and renewed confidence in travel. These factors have led to a recovery in international travel, thus driving cross-border volumes of companies in the financial transaction services space that engage in global money transfers. The industry participants having exposure to the cross-border business leave no stone unturned to devise platforms backed by an interconnected banking network and sound expertise in the seamless processing of digital payments. Amid the ongoing recovery of cross-border travel, these platforms inevitably reap benefits for the players.An Active M&amp;A Strategy: Participants of the financial transaction services space frequently resort to the M&amp;A strategy to upgrade their capabilities in addition to making uninterrupted technology investments. The strategy reflects industry players’ focus on bolstering their customer base, entering new markets and establishing a significant share across the global market. The primary aim behind these deals is to bring about diversification benefits that differentiate an organization from its industry peers. The current year is expected to be exciting, with respect to M&amp;A deals, according to PwC’s Global M&amp;A Industry Trends: 2023 Outlook.Zacks Industry Rank Instills OptimismThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all-member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects.

(NASDAQ:MAT) Worth Looking At Closely?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-18-53-mattel-inc-144825369.html,1677250105.0,STORY,['MAT'],"[While Mattel, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAT) might not be the most widely known stock at the moment, it saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. As a mid-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Mattel’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for Mattel What Is Mattel Worth?Great news for investors – Mattel is still trading at a fairly cheap price. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $29.39, but it is currently trading at US$18.53 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. What’s more interesting is that, Mattel’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.Can we expect growth from Mattel?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Mattel's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 54%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since MAT is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on MAT for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock.

(PKG) Down 0.9% Since Last Earnings Report?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-packaging-corp-pkg-down-163004325.html,1677256204,STORY,['PKG'],"[A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Packaging Corp. (PKG). Shares have lost about 0.9% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Packaging Corp. due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Packaging Corp Q4 Earnings Beat Estimates, Dip Y/YPackaging Corporation of America reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.35 in fourth-quarter 2022, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.24 per share. The bottom line decreased 15% year over year. However, it came above the company’s guidance of $2.22 per share.The decline was driven by lower volumes in the Packaging and Paper segments, higher operating costs, rising freight and logistic expenses, and raised depreciation expenses. Higher converting costs and scheduled maintenance outage expenses affected the results. These headwinds were somewhat offset by rising prices and mix in the Packaging segment, declining freight and logistics expenses, a reduced share count resulting from share repurchases, and a lower tax rate.Including special items (primarily for certain costs at the Jackson, AL mill for paper-to-containerboard conversion-related activities), earnings in the reported quarter were $2.31 per share compared with the prior-year quarter’s $2.28 per share.Operational UpdateSales in the fourth quarter declined 3.2% year over year to $1,978 million and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,055 million.The cost of products sold was down 0.3% year over year to $1,528 million in the fourth quarter. The gross profit declined 11.7% year over year to $450 million.Selling, general and administrative expenses amounted to $146 million, up from the prior year’s $141 million. The total segment operating income fell 19% year over year to $288 million.Story continuesSegmental PerformancePackaging: Sales in the segment decreased 3.8% year over year to $1,809 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The segment’s adjusted operating profit amounted to $284 million in the reported quarter from $363 million in the prior-year quarter.Paper: The segment’s revenues were $154 million in the October-December quarter, up 7.7% year over year. The segment reported an adjusted operating profit of $34 million compared with the year-ago quarter’s $21 million.Cash PositionPackaging Corp had a cash balance of around $470 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, down from $765 million of cash held at the end of the prior-year quarter.2022 PerformancePackaging Corp reported adjusted earnings per share of $11.14 in 2022 compared with $9.39 reported in the prior year. Earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.01. Including one-time items, the bottom line was $11.03, up 25% from the $8.83 reported in 2021.Sales were up 10.4% year over year to $8.5 billion from the prior-year figure of $7.7 billion. The reported figure was in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.GuidancePackaging Corp projects first-quarter 2023 earnings of $2.23 per share. The company expects its Packaging segment to deliver a higher total volume, with corrugated plants having four additional shipping days. Prices will fall as a result of the recent reductions in published domestic containerboard prices. The company anticipates lower export prices as well.In the Paper segment, Packaging Corp expects prices to move slightly higher, with fairly flat sales volume.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates revision.The consensus estimate has shifted -5.55% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Packaging Corp. has a nice Growth Score of B, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Packaging Corp. has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The figure also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 9 cents.RevenuesRevenues in the fourth quarter totaled $369.7 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11.8%. Moreover, the top line jumped 20.1% from the year-ago quarter’s number (up 22.6% at the constant exchange rate or CER). Quarterly revenues exceeded the company’s previous growth expectations of 11-14% at CER.Total revenues for 2022 were $1.31 billion, up 18.8% from the year-ago period’s levels (up 22.2% at the constant exchange rate or CER). The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.3%.Segment in DetailInsulet’s Total Omnipod revenues of $366.4 million reflected an increase of 32.8% year over year (up 35.6% at CER). International Omnipod revenues of $90.2 million rose 5.7% (up 18.6% at CER). U.S. Omnipod revenues grew 45% year over year to $276.2 million.The Drug Delivery business revenues totaled $3.3 million, down 89.7% year over year.MarginsGross profit in the reported quarter was $217.3 million, up 1.9% from the prior-year quarter.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $1.46 billion.Insulet’s Total Omnipod revenue growth is now expected in the range of 17-22% at CER. The company currently expects Drug Delivery revenues to fall in the range of 55-45    % at CER.For the first quarter of 2023, Insulet projects revenue growth of 11-14% at CER. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $326.8 million.Total Omnipod revenues are likely to grow 22-25% at CER. However, Drug Delivery revenues are expected to fall in the range of 100-95% at CER.Our TakeInsulet exited the fourth quarter of 2022 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. The company’s performance benefited from record quarterly U.S. and Total Omnipod new customer starts. This was driven mainly by a strong start to the company’s U.S. full market release of the Omnipod 5 automated insulin delivery system. The company recently achieved milestones of 360,000 estimated active global customers using the Omnipod System, including over 100,000 customers in the United States using Omnipod 5.However, the substantial fall in Drug Delivery sales is discouraging. Contraction in margins does not bode well. On a year-over-year basis, the company expects gross margin to be impacted by higher costs associated with the U.S. manufacturing ramp, product line mix due to the ramp-up of Omnipod 5 and lower drug delivery revenues. Supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures continue to challenge business operations.Zacks Rank and Key PicksInsulet currently carries Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Becton, Dickinson and Company BDX, popularly known as BD, McKesson Corporation MCK and Hologic, Inc.

The metric was also wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 45 cents per share.Our projection of full-year loss per share was 46 cents, which matched the company-reported figure.Revenues in DetailOPKO Health registered revenues of $185.4 million in the fourth quarter, down 53.8% year over year. The figure, however, surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10.7%.The fourth-quarter revenues compare to our estimate of $163.7 million.Lower revenues from services dragged the overall top line.Full-year revenues were $1 billion, reflecting a 43.4% plunge from the comparable 2021 period. The figure, however, surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.8%.Our projection of full-year revenues was $982.5 million.Segmental RevenuesOPKO Health manages its operations through two reportable segments – Diagnostics and Pharmaceuticals.Within the Diagnostics arm, revenues from services amounted to $139.4 million in the reported quarter, down 61.6% year over year, primarily due to a fall in COVID-19 testing volume.This compares to our projection of $123.3 million from services revenues in the fourth quarter.BioReference Laboratories (BRL) processed approximately 0.1 million COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction tests in the fourth quarter of 2022, down 96.3% year over year.Within the Pharmaceuticals arm, revenues from products rose 7.4% to $37.9 million, primarily on the back of sales in OPKO Health’s international operating companies and revenue from sales of RAYALDEE.This compares to our projection of $34.4 million from products revenues in the fourth quarter.Story continuesRevenues from sales of RAYALDEE in the fourth quarter of 2022 were $9.1 million, up 18.2% from the prior-year period.Revenues from the transfer of intellectual property and other totaled $8.1 million, up by 153.1% year over year.This compares to our projection of $5.9 million of revenues from the transfer of intellectual property and other in the fourth quarter.OPKO Health, Inc.

Adjusted operating expenses of $93.5 million decreased 41.3% year over year.Adjusted operating loss totaled $37.5 million compared with the prior-year quarter’s adjusted operating loss of $50.7 million.Financial PositionOPKO Health exited full-year 2022 with cash and cash equivalents of $153.2 million compared with $134.7 million at the end of 2021.GuidanceOPKO Health provided its financial outlook for the first quarter of 2023.For the quarter, it expects its total revenues to be between $165 million and $185 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same currently stands at $170.6 million.OPKO Health expects its revenues from services to be between $130 million and $140 million and revenues from product sales to be in the range of $30 million-$35 million. Other revenues are expected to be between $5 million and $10 million.OPKO Health has also confirmed that it expects its COVID-19 testing volumes to continue to decline throughout 2023. However, management assumes modest growth in core testing volumes with stronger growth in OPKO Health’s higher-margin oncology, women's health and urology specialty lines of testing.Our TakeOPKO Health exited the fourth quarter of 2022 with an in-line loss per share and better-than-expected revenues. The continued sales of OPKO Health’s NGENLA (somatrogon) by Pfizer Inc. in 15 countries, including Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom, looks promising. OPKO Health also confirmed that Pfizer expects to launch in all priority ex-U.S. markets by the year’s end and continues to work with the FDA to obtain approval in the United States. This raises our optimism about OPKO Health.The company’s BRL progress with respect to its cost-cutting initiatives also bodes well for the stock. Robust results from the Pharmaceuticals segment, with solid sales of RAYALDEE, are impressive. The company’s continued strength in its women's health and oncology businesses also augurs well. The expansion of the gross margin bodes well.However, the dismal top-line and bottom-line performances are concerning. Lower Diagnostics revenues and lower BRL testing volumes are also worrying. Management’s expectations of the continued decline of COVID-19 testing volumes throughout 2023 are discouraging from a business perspective. The persistent operating loss for OPKO Health also does not bode well for the company.Zacks Rank and Key PicksOPKO Health currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Becton, Dickinson and Company BDX, popularly known as BD, McKesson Corporation MCK and Hologic, Inc.

The company expects net sales to cross $1 billion during the year, implying growth of at least 18% from the previous year.Our TakePenumbra exited the fourth quarter of 2022 with decent results, wherein revenues and earnings beat estimates.The company’s vascular and neuro product categories showed encouraging growth trends. It plans to launch the Lightning Flash product in the first quarter of 2023, which will likely boost its top line growth. Its robust estimate for total revenues in 2023 reflects continued demand for its products. However, currency movements continue to adversely impact the top line. The impact may become favorable in the second half of 2023.Moreover, Penumbra’s ability to improve net gross margins and EPS amid ongoing inflationary pressures and supply-chain headwinds buoys optimism.Zacks Rank and Other Key PicksCurrently, Penumbra carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are AmerisourceBergen ABC, McKesson Corporation MCK and Hologic, Inc.

The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.7%.The company’s GAAP EPS was $4.13, registering a 14.1% decline year over year.For the full year, the adjusted EPS was $19.75, reflecting a 2.2% increase from the year-ago period. The figure also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.4%.Revenues in DetailRevenues in the reported quarter improved 1% year over year to $546.6 million. The metric beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.6%.Full-year revenues were $2.13 billion, down 0.2% from the last year’s revenues. However, the metric was in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Segmental Details   Chemed operates through two wholly owned subsidiaries — VITAS (a major provider of end-of-life care) and Roto-Rooter (a leading commercial and residential plumbing plus drain cleaning service provider).Chemed Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseChemed Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseChemed Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Chemed Corporation QuoteIn the fourth quarter, net revenues at VITAS totaled $308 million, down 2.5% year over year. The decline in revenues was primarily due to a 2.8% reduction in days of care and an increase in the geographically weighted average Medicare reimbursement rate of nearly 3.2%.Roto-Rooter reported sales of $239 million in the fourth quarter, up 6.1% year over year.Total Roto-Rooter branch commercial revenues improved 8.7% from the last year, on a 5.5% increase in drain cleaning revenues, a 13.8% rise in commercial plumbing, 5.1% growth in excavation revenues and a 27.3% hike in commercial water restoration revenues.Total Roto-Rooter branch residential revenues registered 5% growth over the prior-year period on a 2.1% decrease in residential drain cleaning revenues, a 7% improvement in plumbing, a 4.9% increase in excavation and 13.2% growth in residential water restoration.Story continuesMargin in DetailThe gross profit declined 3.7% year over year to $197.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The gross margin contracted 178 basis points (bps) year over year to 36.05%, as the cost of products and services rose 3.9% in the fourth quarter of 2022.The adjusted operating profit decreased 11% from the year-ago period to $100.2 million. The adjusted operating margin contracted 249 bps to 18.3% on a 5.3% increase in adjusted operating expenses.Liquidity &amp; Capital StructureChemed exited 2022 with cash and cash equivalents of $74.1 million, which marked a significant increase from $32.9 million at the end of 2021. Meanwhile, long-term debt at the end of the year was $92.5 million compared with $185 million at the end of 2021.The cumulative net cash provided by operating activities at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022 was $309.8 million compared with $308.6 million a year ago.In the fourth quarter, Chemed’s management repurchased 25,000 stocks for $13 million. As of Dec 31, 2022, approximately $88 million remained under the existing share repurchase plan.The company has a consistent dividend-paying history, with the five-year annualized dividend growth being 6.43%.2023 GuidanceChemed announced its financial guidance for 2023.For 2023, revenues from VITAS, prior to Medicare Cap, are estimated to increase in the range of 6-7% from the prior year. Roto-Rooter is forecast to achieve 2023 revenue growth in the range of 5-5.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $2.22 billion, suggesting 4% growth from the 2022 reported figure.For the full-year 2023, the adjusted EPS is estimated in the range of $20.75-$21.10. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is pegged at $20.33, indicating 3.37% growth over the 2022 adjusted figure.Our TakeChemed ended the fourth quarter of 2022 with an earnings and revenue beat. The year-over-year growth in the adjusted EPS appears promising. The robust performance of the Roto-Rooter segment drove the top line. The company recorded substantial increases in drain cleaning, plumbing, excavation and water restoration revenues in the quarter under review.On the flip side, the lower sales performance year over year of the VITAS segment is discouraging. Mounting costs and expenses weighed on the company’s margins.Zacks Rank and Key PicksChemed currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Cardinal Health, Inc. CAH, McKesson Corporation MCK and Hologic, Inc. HOLX.Cardinal Health, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), reported a second-quarter fiscal 2023 adjusted EPS of $1.32, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 16.8%.

The areas getting lower prices include Middle East markets in Yemen, Jordan, Libya and Iran; European countries such as Croatia, Slovenia and Bulgaria, and sub-Saharan African markets.Netflix isn't changing its prices in any of its largest markets, including the U.S., where it has been regularly increasing its rates during the past four years to help offset the cost of an programming lineup that includes popular series such as “The Crown"" and “Stranger Things.”Although Netflix has established itself as the largest video streaming service, it has been vying for viewers with other deep-pocketed rivals that include Apple, Amazon and Walt Disney Co. at the same time stubbornly high inflation is causing more people to tighten their budgets.Those factors contributed to Netflix losing nearly 1.2 million subscribers during the first half of last year, prompting the company to introduce an ad-supported option of its service t hat cost just $7 per month in the U.S. — less than half the price of its most popular plan. That helped Netflix bounce back during the second half of last year when it added 10 million subscribers, a recovery that made its long-time CEO and co-founder Reed Hastings comfortable enough to step down last month.In another attempt to gain more subscribers, Netflix has started to crack down on rampant password sharing that has enabled an estimated 100 million people worldwide to free load on its service. Netflix has already clamped down on the practice in Latin America and several other countries, including Canada, New Zealand, Portugal and Spain earlier this month. New rules governing the use of the same password in multiple households are expected to be imposed in the U.S. by the end of March.Story continuesNetflix's new co-CEO Greg Peters hinted last month during a quarterly conference call that the company was examining ways to attract more subscribers in its smaller markets, although he didn't say anything specifically about using lower prices as a lure. “There’s a bunch of people around the world in countries where we’re not deeply penetrated, and we have more opportunity to go attract them,” Peters said.In that same call, Peters also indicated that Netflix sees little need to drop prices in markets, such as the U.S., where its service already proved its value to long-time subscribers. “We think of ourselves as a non-substitutable good,"" Peters said.Even so, Netflix lost 920,000 customers in the U.S. and Canada last year, leaving it with 74.3 million subscribers in that region at the end of December. Despite the subscriber erosion, Netflix's price increases in the U.S and Canada helped boost its revenue in the region by 9% last year to nearly $14.1 billion. The financial gains are becoming more important to Netflix because it is now placing more emphasis on profit growth now that it has become tougher to attract more subscribers.]"

80,f1c610c5-9c75-3ac7-a49a-caab7f667843,NFLX,2023-02-25,The #1 Insider Signal Every Trader Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-insider-signal-every-trader-180406259.html,1677261846,STORY,['NFLX'],"[We love it when a famous CEO buys a large chunk of his own company’s stock.In Jan 2022, Reed Hastings, the founder and then Co-CEO of Netflix, bought 51,440 shares for nearly $20 million even though he already owned over 5 million shares.This was his first open market purchase of Netflix shares ever. He didn’t even buy during the dark times of the financial crisis.This big purchase made headlines and was analyzed on Twitter and Stocktwits by stock investors.Insiders Buying En MasseBut what about when non-famous insiders buy their company’s stock and when a bunch of them buy en masse?This mass insider buying behavior is called a “cluster buy” and it is the strongest signal you can get in insider trading.When one insider buys, he might be considered an optimist, especially when he’s the CEO. But when four or five insiders all buy at the same time?Now that’s a powerful consensus.But you’re not going to hear about the cluster buys from the media. There aren’t going to be headlines trumpeting the buys of a few corporate Directors and a CFO.Nope. The cluster buy simply isn’t glamorous enough.Investors, therefore, have to dig below the surface to find the insider cluster buys. But once you do, that’s where big rewards can be found.Cluster Buying Sends the Strongest Signal Why do insiders spend so much of their own money on their company’s stock when they already own a ton of shares already? Greed!Pure and simple.The opportunity to make more money motivates people - even people who are already well off, like highly paid CEOs and CFOs.When insiders buy in a cluster, it’s because they all know something very good is going on at the company. Maybe it is a new product. Or contract. Or pending merger. Whatever the reason, they are all very confident that shares will be on the rise.After all, who would buy more stock in a company if they knew it was sinking?  And why would several of them be buying unless they didn’t collectively believe that their stock was a value?When things at the company are THAT good, insiders don’t want to miss out when everyone else is cashing in. Call it insider peer pressure, if you will.Continued . . .------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Buy These Insider Stocks MondayWhen in-the-know officers dip into their own pockets to buy shares of their own company, there’s only one reason: They expect the stock price to go up.Because of their inside knowledge of anticipated contracts, mergers, product breakthroughs and the like, insiders must report their trades to the SEC within 48 hours. Zacks has zeroed in on the best of these buys. (That’s how, even during bearish 2022, we closed 11 substantial double-digit gains in a matter of weeks.¹)Our recommended insider buys are time-sensitive and normally closed to public view – but you can still see them until midnight Sunday, February 26.Catch our selected insider trades right now &gt;&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Real Life Cluster Buying Shares of the oil producers crashed in the coronavirus sell-off in 2020 as oil prices plunged globally.They remained depressed over the summer of 2020 and into the fall, even as crude prices rose back above $40 a barrel.The insiders at explorer Matador Resources saw an opportunity with their shares still in the single digits.In Nov 2020, 6 insiders, including the CEO, the COO of Operations and 4 directors, dove in to buy again with 5 buying even before Pfizer’s big Nov 9, 2020 announcement that its vaccine was over 90% effective against the coronavirus.Pfizer’s announcement, and subsequent roll-out of its vaccine, lit a fire under the beaten down oil stocks. Energy was the best performing S&amp;P 500 sector in both 2021 and 2022, as the economic reopening after the pandemic and then the Ukraine War, caused a spike in crude prices to new multi-year highs.Shares of Matador have jumped over 390% since Dec 1, 2020.What did they know?Buy When the Insiders BuyWhen high level insiders buy, they are required to report the purchases to the SEC within 48 hours of the trade. The trade then becomes public information.Hedge funds and other professional investors routinely use this information to get an edge on their trades.For most of us though, it’s not easy to get access to that insider information.While the media will tout the huge insider buys from celebrity CEOs like Reed Hastings’ Jan 2022 $20 million Netflix share purchase, you’ll almost never hear about the non-celebrity CEOs, or other top ranked officers when they buy their stocks.Was anyone talking about the 2020 Matador cluster buy?The challenge is getting easy and reliable access to all the insider trades and then figuring out which ones to buy.Where to Find the Cluster Buys Anyone can go on the SEC website and get the insider trading information, but it’s time consuming to search by individual companies.Some investment firms collect the insider buying data and can provide it to you as a daily list. Have you ever seen one of those lists?  The sheer number of companies can be overwhelming.And still, those lists don’t usually separate out the cluster buys, which sometimes take place on different days in the same week.For example, if you’re getting daily insider updates, you may not realize that though the CEO bought on Monday, three directors also bought on Tuesday. You may pass by those ‘hidden’ cluster buys without even realizing it.Even if you got a list of the cluster buyers, how would you narrow it down to the stocks that are truly worth buying? If I’m going to buy when the insiders are buying, I want to buy only their top picks.Today’s Hottest Insider Buys Our Zacks research team has developed a unique strategy to identify only those top picks insiders are scooping up.We monitor selected insider buying activity at companies with strong earnings and valuations. Then we analyze: • Who's buying? How much money are they putting in?• When, if ever, have they bought shares in the past?• Do they receive shares as part of their compensation, but still want more?• Are we seeing ""Cluster Buys""?At the moment, fewer than 10 stocks meet the demanding criteria of our Insider Trader portfolio &gt;&gt;I invite you to look into this portfolio now. Normally closed to the public, it’s now open – but only through the weekend.

Despite the somewhat rapid downturn, there are pockets of the market and stocks that look poised to thrive in the near term and for years to come.Today we dive into United Rentals (URI) and The TJX Companies (URI) to see why investors might want to buy these stocks as the calendar turns to March amid ongoing market uncertainty.Bullish investors managed to temporarily stop some of the bleeding on Wednesday and Thursday. But the selling ramped up again on Friday following the release of the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge known as the personal consumption expenditures price index or PCE. The data came in hotter than projected, joining a long list of January economic indicators that proved Jay Powell’s inflation fight is far from over.  Wall Street has been forced once again to recalibrate its outlook for interest rates. Wall Street pushed the 2-year U.S. Treasury yield to fresh highs of 4.81% on Friday. This marks a sharp climb from 4.1% on February 1 and tops its November peaks. The short-term yield is now floating around levels it last hit in early 2007 and late 2006.The bulls are now desperately attempting to prevent the Nasdaq from falling back under its 200-day moving average. The tech-heavy index floated right around the key technical level at the end of Friday trading after it dropped 1.7%. The hope now might be that the market chops around over the coming weeks until February’s CPI release on March 14 and the Fed’s March FOMC meeting on March 21-22.Despite all of the worries about the growth trade quickly unraveling again, there are plenty of great stocks for investors to buy heading into March and beyond. It is also always worth remembering that the market-timing game is extremely difficult. Given this backdrop, we dive into two stocks that sit at attractive valuation levels that have also outpaced the market over the past year and look poised to continue doing so.Story continuesUnited Rentals (URI) is one of the world’s largest equipment rental firms. URI’s sales quickly bounced back after a pandemic dip and it posted strong 2022 results in late January. The company is able to easily raise its prices along with inflation and United Rentals completed its acquisition of Ahern Rentals in early December.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchURI’s upward earnings revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. Plus, United Rentals said last month that it plans to restart its share repurchase program and introduce a dividend. These moves highlight URI’s stability and financial firepower amid a period of wider economic uncertainty.URI shares have soared 750% in the last 10 years and 25% so far in 2023 to hit fresh records recently. Yet the stock is far from overheated and trades at a 40% discount to its own decade-long highs at 10.5X forward 12-month earnings.The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX) is an off-price apparel and home décor retailer that operates roughly 4,800 stores in nine countries, including the U.S., Canada, the UK, and Germany. The company’s brands include T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods, and others. TJX has carved out a nice niche within a rapidly evolving retail landscape that has it thriving alongside giants such as Target (TGT).  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTJX’s sales skyrocketed in its FY22 (2021) to blow away its pre-covid total. It then popped 3% in its recently reported FY23. TJX’s year was highlighted by a strong fourth quarter as more consumers looked to save. TJX, which lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at the moment, plans to boost its dividend by 13% and to buy back between $2 billion to $2.5 Billion of stock in FY24. On top of that, 12 of the 15 brokerage recommendations Zacks has are “Strong Buys” and its outlook remains strong.TJX shares have popped 20% in the last six months and 95% in the past five years to blow away the S&amp;P 500’s 45%. A slide from its January peaks has it near oversold RSI levels. In terms of valuation, TJX is trading at a 50% discount to its own 10-year highs at 21.8X forward 12-month earnings to match the Zacks Retail Sector. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

From 2003 through 2015, the U.S. earned at least one moguls medal at seven consecutive world championships, then had none in 2017, 2019 and 2021.Kauf followed her Olympic silver medal last year by finishing runner-up on Saturday to 2018 Olympic champion Perrine Laffont of France. Laffont tallied 87.40 points in her super final run to Kauf’s 83.56. Austrian Avital Carroll took bronze in Bakuriani, Georgia.“Post-Christmas and the second half of the [season], really focused on my strengths,” said Kauf, who had the best time in the super final contrasted to Laffont’s air superiority. “That’s skiing with speed and executing the jumps that I have to a really high level. I feel like I’m really pushing the sport.”Kauf added another silver behind Laffont in Sunday’s dual moguls, the head-to-head discipline that makes its Olympic debut in 2026.In 2018, Kauf entered the Olympics ranked No. 1 in the World Cup standings and finished seventh. In 2022, Kauf entered the Olympics ranked 19th in the World Cup and finished second. This year, Kauf entered worlds ranked fourth in the World Cup.The 26-year-old Kauf’s parents were both pro tour moguls champions. They never competed in the Olympics, but both later took up ski cross. Her mom made X Games podiums in 1999, 2000 and 2002.Laffont broke the female record with her fifth total moguls and dual moguls world title, surpassing Traa and Canadian Jenn Heil.At last year’s Olympics, Laffont shockingly finished fourth after missing just two World Cup podiums in the four-year Olympic cycle.Story continuesAustralian Jakara Anthony, who won the Olympics last year, placed 17th on Saturday, her worst finish in a top-level moguls or dual moguls event since January 2018.In Saturday’s men’s moguls, Canadian Mikaël Kingsbury became the first man or woman to win four world titles in the event, breaking his tie for the record with Frenchman Edgar Grospiron, who won gold in Olympic moguls’ debut in 1992.“I came here with no pressure because I told myself, you know, I’ve won six times at world championships [between moguls and dual moguls], so why put pressure again?” Kingsbury said.Kingsbury scored 89.82 points, relegating Australian Matt Graham to silver (88.90) and Sweden’s Walter Wallberg to bronze (88.52). Wallberg upset Kingsbury at last year’s Olympics.Then on Sunday, Kingsbury won his fourth world title in dual moguls, breaking this tie with fellow Canadians Heil and Alexandre Bilodeau for the most in that event.Peacock airs live coverage of the world freestyle skiing and snowboarding championships.

The MSCI's index for emerging market stocks fell 1.9% by 1828 GMT and was set to log its fourth straight week in the red, having lost momentum after a strong start to the year on fears of higher rate hikes and geopolitical worries in the days leading up to the Ukraine war's first anniversary. ""Inflation in the U.S. may not entirely mean price pressures elsewhere like last year, but Latam will emerge with less losses as their post-pandemic realities fare better than the Asia-European landmass affected by war and natural disasters,"" said Juan Perez, director of trading at Monex USA. Latin American equities fell 2.5%, and were headed for weekly declines of nearly 3%. Data on Friday showed U.S. consumer spending rebounded sharply in January amid strong income growth, while inflation accelerated, supporting the case for the Fed to keep tightening monetary policy for longer. ""At the very minimum right now, the probabilities are quite high we're going to have three more quarter-point rate hikes at the next three (Fed) meetings,"" said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab. Brazil's Bovespa index dropped 2.0%. Regional currencies fell 1.0% as the dollar firmed, with the currency of the world's biggest copper producer, Chile, down 2.3% and leading declines among peers as prices of the red metal fell sharply.. Chile's peso was set for its biggest weekly fall since November last year. The Brazilian real fell 1.2% after data showed the country's consumer prices rose by more than expected in the month to mid-February, with annual inflation remaining well above target. However, in a bright spot, foreign direct investment in Brazil reached its highest level for January in five years, according to central bank data on Friday. Mexico's peso slipped 0.2% against the dollar despite data showing the country's economy grew 0.5% in the fourth quarter from the previous three-month period, slightly above forecasts. Elsewhere in emerging markets, global financial crime watchdog FATF added South Africa to its ""grey list"" of countries under special scrutiny to implement standards to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing. ""Such a headline could create further headwinds to already fragile ZAR (rand) sentiment which is grappling with severe levels of electricity supply cuts and is hurting industrial production and export volumes,"" said Jeffrey Schultz, Middle East and Africa chief economist at BNP Paribas.

We sliced through the 200-Week EMA, which of course is a negative sign, and then of course we sliced through the 50% Fibonacci level out the $21.12 level. By breaking through there, it certainly looks as if we are going to continue to go lower. The 61.8% Fibonacci level sets out the $20.24 level, and that could very well be our next target.The $20 level underneath is a large, round, psychologically significant figure, and we will have to pay close attention to it. That might be our eventual target, but I would anticipate that it’s going to be noisy on the way down, which of course makes sense considering that silver is extraordinarily volatile under the best of circumstances. With that in mind, I think that we need to be very cautious with  position sizing, but it certainly looks as if it is a “fade the rally” type of market.After all, we broke through a hammer from the previous week, which is generally a very negative sign. That hammer bounced directly from the 50% Fibonacci root level, so under most circumstances, traders will look at that as a positive technical setup. Some of my best trade signals are actually busted signals. This is a perfect example of it, but I don’t necessarily think that silver is going to collapse, just that there is going to continue to be a significant amount of pressure upon the market overall.For a look at all of today’s economic events, check out our economic calendar.

Keep in mind the gold is highly sensitive to the US dollar, and it appears that the US dollar is in the midst of taking off again. With that being said, I do think that this correction continues, especially as we are trying to close towards the bottom of the weekly candlestick. However, it’s also worth noting that there is a significant amount of support just below, and I do think that comes into the picture.The $1800 level is an area that is a large, round, psychologically significant figure, and a lot of people will pay attention to it. Furthermore, you also have the 50% Fibonacci there, so it makes sense that there will be a certain amount of interest in gold in that region. Breaking down below there then opens up the possibility of a move down to the $1750 level. This is right around the 61.8% Fibonacci level, and that of course attracts a lot of attention in and of itself.With that being said, I think it’s probably only a matter time before we see support, but I think the next week or 2 may continue to be a little bit more on the soft side. Pay attention to the US Dollar, because it could give you a little bit of a heads up as to where we are going longer term, and that of course is something that is fluid as people worry about interest rates and of course the Federal Reserve tightening monetary policy.For a look at all of today’s economic events, check out our economic calendar.

Silver of course is very sensitive to the US dollar and has a major negative correlation to that currency. This makes sense, because silver is not only a precious metal, but it’s also an industrial one. There are a lot of concerns out there that the global economy is about to slow down, and that will lead to a lot less demand for silver.While I am not suggesting that silver is going to absolutely implode, it certainly looks weak at the moment. Short-term rallies will be looked at with suspicion, especially with the 200-Day EMA sitting just below the crucial $22 level. We had failed there previously, and I think that we will more likely than not continue to see that offer quite a bit of a barrier. If we can break above there, obviously that would change some things, but right now there is nothing suggesting that we are ready to do that. Furthermore, we are trying to break down below the bottom of the support area that was based upon the 50% Fibonacci, and we are just pennies away for making that happen.If we do break down below there, then it’s likely we really start to sell off, perhaps with an eye on the 61.8% Fibonacci level at the $20.25 area, possibly even then opening up a move down to the $20 level. The $20 level is a large, round, psychologically significant figure that a lot of people pay attention to, so therefore I would expect a certain amount of noise in that general vicinity. Anything below there could open up the floodgates of the downside, but right now I don’t necessarily think that’s where we are going.On the other and, if we were to take out the 200-Day EMA above, it might bring in fresh buying, but right now things look so negative in this chart that I think it would take a Herculean effort to make that happen. It appears that traders are finally coming to grips with the idea that the global economy may be heading into a recession.Story continuesFor a look at all of today’s economic events, check out our economic calendar.

Operating earnings also improved 18.1% year over year to $332 million.Operational HighlightsFor the reported quarter, GD’s operating margin contracted 20 basis points from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure to 11.3%.For the quarter under review, General Dynamics’ operating costs and expenses went up 5.7% from the year-ago period to $9.6 million.Interest expenses for the reported quarter declined 8.6% year over year to $85 million.BacklogGeneral Dynamics recorded a total backlog of $91.10 billion, up 2.6% from third-quarter 2022’s backlog of $88.80 billion.

However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the top 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise General Dynamics has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. With that in mind, the ROCE of Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) looks decent, right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Tyson Foods is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.11 = US$3.4b ÷ (US$37b - US$5.1b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).Thus, Tyson Foods has an ROCE of 11%.  In absolute terms, that's a pretty normal return, and it's somewhat close to the Food industry average of 10%. View our latest analysis for Tyson Foods roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Tyson Foods compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsWhile the returns on capital are good, they haven't moved much. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 11% and the business has deployed 31% more capital into its operations. 11% is a pretty standard return, and it provides some comfort knowing that Tyson Foods has consistently earned this amount. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.In Conclusion...To sum it up, Tyson Foods has simply been reinvesting capital steadily, at those decent rates of return. However, over the last five years, the stock hasn't provided much growth to shareholders in the way of total returns. For that reason, savvy investors might want to look further into this company in case it's a prime investment.Story continuesIf you want to continue researching Tyson Foods, you might be interested to know about the 2 warning signs that our analysis has discovered.While Tyson Foods may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

From 2003 through 2015, the U.S. earned at least one moguls medal at seven consecutive world championships, then had none in 2017, 2019 and 2021.Kauf followed her Olympic silver medal last year by finishing runner-up on Saturday to 2018 Olympic champion Perrine Laffont of France. Laffont tallied 87.40 points in her super final run to Kauf’s 83.56. Austrian Avital Carroll took bronze in Bakuriani, Georgia.“Post-Christmas and the second half of the [season], really focused on my strengths,” said Kauf, who had the best time in the super final contrasted to Laffont’s air superiority. “That’s skiing with speed and executing the jumps that I have to a really high level. I feel like I’m really pushing the sport.”Kauf added another silver behind Laffont in Sunday’s dual moguls, the head-to-head discipline that makes its Olympic debut in 2026.In 2018, Kauf entered the Olympics ranked No. 1 in the World Cup standings and finished seventh. In 2022, Kauf entered the Olympics ranked 19th in the World Cup and finished second. This year, Kauf entered worlds ranked fourth in the World Cup.The 26-year-old Kauf’s parents were both pro tour moguls champions. They never competed in the Olympics, but both later took up ski cross. Her mom made X Games podiums in 1999, 2000 and 2002.Laffont broke the female record with her fifth total moguls and dual moguls world title, surpassing Traa and Canadian Jenn Heil.At last year’s Olympics, Laffont shockingly finished fourth after missing just two World Cup podiums in the four-year Olympic cycle.Story continuesAustralian Jakara Anthony, who won the Olympics last year, placed 17th on Saturday, her worst finish in a top-level moguls or dual moguls event since January 2018.In Saturday’s men’s moguls, Canadian Mikaël Kingsbury became the first man or woman to win four world titles in the event, breaking his tie for the record with Frenchman Edgar Grospiron, who won gold in Olympic moguls’ debut in 1992.“I came here with no pressure because I told myself, you know, I’ve won six times at world championships [between moguls and dual moguls], so why put pressure again?” Kingsbury said.Kingsbury scored 89.82 points, relegating Australian Matt Graham to silver (88.90) and Sweden’s Walter Wallberg to bronze (88.52). Wallberg upset Kingsbury at last year’s Olympics.Then on Sunday, Kingsbury won his fourth world title in dual moguls, breaking this tie with fellow Canadians Heil and Alexandre Bilodeau for the most in that event.Peacock airs live coverage of the world freestyle skiing and snowboarding championships.

The MSCI's index for emerging market stocks fell 1.9% by 1828 GMT and was set to log its fourth straight week in the red, having lost momentum after a strong start to the year on fears of higher rate hikes and geopolitical worries in the days leading up to the Ukraine war's first anniversary. ""Inflation in the U.S. may not entirely mean price pressures elsewhere like last year, but Latam will emerge with less losses as their post-pandemic realities fare better than the Asia-European landmass affected by war and natural disasters,"" said Juan Perez, director of trading at Monex USA. Latin American equities fell 2.5%, and were headed for weekly declines of nearly 3%. Data on Friday showed U.S. consumer spending rebounded sharply in January amid strong income growth, while inflation accelerated, supporting the case for the Fed to keep tightening monetary policy for longer.

Chile's peso was set for its biggest weekly fall since November last year. The Brazilian real fell 1.2% after data showed the country's consumer prices rose by more than expected in the month to mid-February, with annual inflation remaining well above target. However, in a bright spot, foreign direct investment in Brazil reached its highest level for January in five years, according to central bank data on Friday. Mexico's peso slipped 0.2% against the dollar despite data showing the country's economy grew 0.5% in the fourth quarter from the previous three-month period, slightly above forecasts. Elsewhere in emerging markets, global financial crime watchdog FATF added South Africa to its ""grey list"" of countries under special scrutiny to implement standards to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing.

107,20c1f5fd-cc1d-3f69-9b05-3787a2e0447e,MA,2023-02-25,Ajay Banga’s World Bank appointment shows that financial CEOs aren’t toxic anymore,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ajay-banga-world-bank-appointment-175610864.html,1677261370,STORY,['MA'],"[When Ajay Banga became Mastercard’s chief executive in 2010, he gained membership in a CEO club with a particularly toxic reputation.The United States was still reeling from the financial crisis, and financial CEOs were public enemy No. 1 in the eyes of millions of Americans who had lost their jobs, their homes, or both when the housing bubble collapsed. There were widespread calls for bankers to be jailed for their role in destroying the economy—especially after the U.S. government spent billions of dollars bailing out financial institutions that made reckless bets on risky mortgages. (Banga’s previous employer, Citigroup, needed a cool $45 billion to survive.) Lawmakers of both parties had excoriated many of these men, including Citi’s CEO, in public hearings. The following year, protesters angry about the lack of real-world consequences for financial CEOs would occupy Wall Street.Mastercard and rival Visa weren’t the primary villains of this era—as payments companies spun out from the big banks, they didn’t make loans to consumers or sell off securities to investors. But they also did time in the political crosshairs during that Wall-Street-is-evil era. In October 2010, a few months after Banga officially took over, the Obama administration’s Justice Department sued (and eventually settled with) Mastercard and Visa for antitrust violations over the fees they charged to merchants. (The companies did not admit wrongdoing.)Fast-forward 13 years, and Banga’s financial background sure doesn't seem toxic to Obama’s former vice president. On Thursday, President Biden said he would nominate the former Mastercard CEO to run the World Bank, crediting him with “critical experience mobilizing public-private resources to tackle the most urgent challenges of our time.” To be sure, Biden’s nominee has never been personally linked to, or blamed for, the excesses of the aughts. Banga, who would be the first Indian-born person to run the World Bank, stepped down as Mastercard CEO in late 2020 after earning glowing reviews for his focus on financial inclusion, and for working to increase access to financial services in the developing world.Story continuesHe also made Mastercard shareholders happy, boosting revenues and quadrupling profits over the course of his CEO tenure. Now vice chairman at private equity giant General Atlantic, Banga has cultivated ties within senior Democratic circles, serving on the Obama administration’s cybersecurity council and advising Vice President Kamala Harris on immigration.Still, Banga’s evolution from early Obama antitrust target to Biden political nominee is a remarkable glow-up for a crisis-era financial CEO—especially one who’s currently working in the politically unpopular realm of private equity. Moreover, the Biden administration is clearly hoping Banga will be a PR improvement for the World Bank. The current president, David Malpass, last year created an international mess when he seemed to cast doubt on the existence of climate change; last week, Malpass announced that he would resign in June, almost a year before his five-year term was due to expire.If Banga is confirmed to the World Bank role, he would likely be the first crisis-era financial CEO to hold such a high-level post. (Both Democratic and Republican administrations have appointed senior crisis-era bankers to top-level positions, although none had previously reached the level of CEO at a publicly traded company. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who declined the role of Treasury Secretary under President Donald Trump, came the closest to breaking that barrier.)Not everyone is happy to see financial-industry tarnish disappear from executives’ résumés, especially when it comes to leading a public-sector entity focused on global development and fighting poverty. “President Joe Biden and Secretary Yellen have literally named the vice chairman of a rapacious international private equity firm (General Atlantic) to take his first job ever in public service at nearly the highest level in the world possible,” Jeff Hauser, executive director of the progressive Revolving Door Project, said in a statement calling for Biden to retract Banga’s nomination.Hauser added in an email to Fortune that Banga’s Big Finance background might have been more of a liability if the post of World Bank president had a higher public profile in the States. “I think it reflects a belief that Americans don’t follow international affairs closely,” he wrote. “I hope that view is mistaken, but I don‘t believe they would put a banker up for a senior job in the U.S. government.”General Atlantic did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fortune.But for other executives, Banga’s appointment to the World Bank offers a glimmer of public-service hope—especially for tech CEOs currently facing antitrust lawsuits, or the founder-billionaires who have replaced bankers as our business villains du jour. Industries have a way of cycling in and out of the public’s good (and bad) graces; next to the excesses of an Elon Musk or a Sam Bankman-Fried, the financial CEOs of yesteryear are positively sober, responsible adults. In another 10 or 15 years, maybe public (and political) sentiment about this current generation of tech executives will also have shifted—or at least paled next to whatever the next business on the hot seat will be.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeMillennials’ average net worth: How the nation’s largest working generation stacks up against the restLooking for extra cash?

We sliced through the 200-Week EMA, which of course is a negative sign, and then of course we sliced through the 50% Fibonacci level out the $21.12 level. By breaking through there, it certainly looks as if we are going to continue to go lower. The 61.8% Fibonacci level sets out the $20.24 level, and that could very well be our next target.The $20 level underneath is a large, round, psychologically significant figure, and we will have to pay close attention to it. That might be our eventual target, but I would anticipate that it’s going to be noisy on the way down, which of course makes sense considering that silver is extraordinarily volatile under the best of circumstances. With that in mind, I think that we need to be very cautious with  position sizing, but it certainly looks as if it is a “fade the rally” type of market.After all, we broke through a hammer from the previous week, which is generally a very negative sign. That hammer bounced directly from the 50% Fibonacci root level, so under most circumstances, traders will look at that as a positive technical setup. Some of my best trade signals are actually busted signals. This is a perfect example of it, but I don’t necessarily think that silver is going to collapse, just that there is going to continue to be a significant amount of pressure upon the market overall.For a look at all of today’s economic events, check out our economic calendar.

Keep in mind the gold is highly sensitive to the US dollar, and it appears that the US dollar is in the midst of taking off again. With that being said, I do think that this correction continues, especially as we are trying to close towards the bottom of the weekly candlestick. However, it’s also worth noting that there is a significant amount of support just below, and I do think that comes into the picture.The $1800 level is an area that is a large, round, psychologically significant figure, and a lot of people will pay attention to it. Furthermore, you also have the 50% Fibonacci there, so it makes sense that there will be a certain amount of interest in gold in that region. Breaking down below there then opens up the possibility of a move down to the $1750 level. This is right around the 61.8% Fibonacci level, and that of course attracts a lot of attention in and of itself.With that being said, I think it’s probably only a matter time before we see support, but I think the next week or 2 may continue to be a little bit more on the soft side. Pay attention to the US Dollar, because it could give you a little bit of a heads up as to where we are going longer term, and that of course is something that is fluid as people worry about interest rates and of course the Federal Reserve tightening monetary policy.For a look at all of today’s economic events, check out our economic calendar.

Silver of course is very sensitive to the US dollar and has a major negative correlation to that currency. This makes sense, because silver is not only a precious metal, but it’s also an industrial one. There are a lot of concerns out there that the global economy is about to slow down, and that will lead to a lot less demand for silver.While I am not suggesting that silver is going to absolutely implode, it certainly looks weak at the moment. Short-term rallies will be looked at with suspicion, especially with the 200-Day EMA sitting just below the crucial $22 level. We had failed there previously, and I think that we will more likely than not continue to see that offer quite a bit of a barrier. If we can break above there, obviously that would change some things, but right now there is nothing suggesting that we are ready to do that. Furthermore, we are trying to break down below the bottom of the support area that was based upon the 50% Fibonacci, and we are just pennies away for making that happen.If we do break down below there, then it’s likely we really start to sell off, perhaps with an eye on the 61.8% Fibonacci level at the $20.25 area, possibly even then opening up a move down to the $20 level. The $20 level is a large, round, psychologically significant figure that a lot of people pay attention to, so therefore I would expect a certain amount of noise in that general vicinity. Anything below there could open up the floodgates of the downside, but right now I don’t necessarily think that’s where we are going.On the other and, if we were to take out the 200-Day EMA above, it might bring in fresh buying, but right now things look so negative in this chart that I think it would take a Herculean effort to make that happen. It appears that traders are finally coming to grips with the idea that the global economy may be heading into a recession.Story continuesFor a look at all of today’s economic events, check out our economic calendar.

While things have gotten a little messier since the January rally that kicked off the year, the tech-laden Nasdaq index remains up 10% in 2023. Tech stocks are rebounding following a brutal selloff in 2022 that dragged the Nasdaq lower by more than 30%. Many tech stocks have surged greater than 40% in a matter of weeks as investors’ appetite for risk improves and they rotate out of cyclical stocks and back into high-growth securities. While the bear market that has gripped Wall Street since November 2021 may not be over just yet, there are signs that technology is back on the radar of investors and that the worst might be behind us. With that in mind, here are seven high-growth tech stocks to keep your eyes on in the coming weeks and months.BABAAlibaba$94.78QCOMQualcomm$123.95MUMicron$56.98METAMeta Platforms$171.12NVDANvidia$207.54CRMSalesforce$163.36RBLXRoblox$37.55Alibaba (BABA)Alibaba Group headquarters sign located in Hangzhou China BABA stock.Source: Kevin Chen Photography / Shutterstock.comChinese tech stocks have been on the rise this year as the country’s economy finally recovers from Covid-19 and as Chinese authorities let up on their crackdown of  publicly traded technology firms. One of the chief beneficiaries of the reversal of China-based tech stocks has been Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), arguably China’s leading and best-known tech firm. Between the end of October and the end of January, BABA stock rose 90% to a peak of $120 a share.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBABA stock has pulled back in recent weeks, presenting a decent entry point for investors. With Alibaba, shareholders get one of China’s most advanced tech companies that is a global leader in everything from e-commerce and the Internet of Things to artificial intelligence.Moreover, in recent  quarters, the company’s earnings have surpassed analysts’ average estimates. Alibaba’s stock got a vote of confidence recently when it was revealed that it was one of the few securities bought by a notorious  bear, Michael Burry, during the fourth quarter of last year.Story continuesQualcomm (QCOM)Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on the side of a building in San Jose, CA.Source: jejim / Shutterstock.comAnother tech stock that has been marching higher and seems poised for more gains is Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). The San Diego-based company manufactures the semiconductors that are critical for 5G networks and the mobile phones that run on them. The demand for the company’s products is sky-high right now as 5G networks expand and become widely used within the industry. The red-hot demand explains why QCOM stock has risen 13% in 2023.A mature company that has been around since 1985, QCOM today trades at a moderate price-earnings ratio of 12, which is low for a technology firm of its size.The stock also pays a robust quarterly dividend that yields 2.4%. It’s also unusual for a tech stock to pay a significant dividend. But Qualcomm is facing a slowdown in mobile phone sales, which led the company to report subpar earnings.In its latest reported quarter, its revenue sank 12% year-over-year to $9.46 billion, and its net income fell 27% to $2.68 billion or $2.37 per share.But don’t count out QCOM stock over the long-term because it remains a leader of the 5G internet boom.Micron (MU)Micron (MU) logo on a mobile phone that's on a tableSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.comMicron Technology’s (NASDAQ:MU) fortunes have also improved during the first few months of 2023. So far this year, MU stock is up 14%. It’s a welcome change for the company that makes computer memory and data storage technology such as USB flash drives. Even with this year’s gains, Micron Technology’s share price remains down 35% over the last 12 months. With a P/E ratio of 10.3, the stock looks undervalued at its current levels.This year’s gains come as the company undertakes aggressive cost-cutting measures that have included layoffs of 10% of its workforce, a 40% reduction of its capital expenditures, and a suspension of the bonuses for its executives.Like many technology companies, Micron has struggled due to a a slowdown of computer sales and manufacturing disruptions in China over the past year. However, the company expects its supply-demand imbalance to be fixed later this year and is forecasting that its revenue will grow 43% year-over-year in 2024 as it returns to profitability.Meta Platforms (META)Meta Written On The Googles - Man Wearing Virtual Reality Goggles Inside A Metaverse. FTC investigating META.Source: Aleem Zahid Khan / Shutterstock.comMeta Platforms’ (NASDAQ:META) plans for a “year of efficiency” seem to have won over both analysts and investors. Since the social network released its fourth-quarter results, boosted its stock-buyback program, and announced plans to achieve efficiencies while dialing back spending, the company’s share price has been ripping higher. So far in 2023, META stock has gained 42%. The stock bottomed in early November at $88 per share.Meta’s plans to scale back its previous “growth-at-all costs” strategy and behave more like a mature company seems to be what Wall Street wanted to hear. The company’s stock was also driven higher by its plans to lay off 11,000 workers and plow less money into the Reality Labs unit that is developing virtual-reality technology to develop the metaverse.In 2022, Meta lost nearly $14 billion on Reality Labs. Many investors are hoping the company will return its focus to its bread-and-butter, online-ad business moving forward.Nvidia (NVDA)Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of nvidia corporation on computer keyboard. NVDA stock.Source: ShutterstockThe news keeps getting better for semiconductor company Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Hot on the heels of several  upgrades by analysts, Nvidia is being touted as a leader in artificial intelligence, with its chips expected to power the most advanced AI on the planet. And news just broke that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has signed a decade-long deal to bring Xbox PC games to Nvidia’s GeForce Now game-streaming service, in what amounts to a major boost for Nvidia’s games business.The spate of good news has dramatically improved the sentiment of investors towards Nvidia and its stock. So far this year, NVDA stock has gained 42%.The stock had been as high as $230 a share in February. After the company reported better-than-expected Q4 results, propelled by its gaming business, it appears that NVDA has put the demand and supply chain problems of the past year behind itself and can now focus more on the advanced semiconductors and microchips it makes that power everything from data centers to supercomputers.Salesforce (CRM)lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco. Salesforce layoffsSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comIt’s been a tumultuous time at cloud-computing giant Salesforce (NYSE:CRM). The San Francisco-based company has struggled to meet earnings expectations, its co-CEO abruptly quit last November, and it has been targeted by multiple activist investors who want to see major structural changes and a turnaround of its business. Its current CEO, Marc Benioff, has had a lot on his plate since last summer. However, all the tumult seems to have been good for CRM stock, which has risen 23% so far this year.Investors seem to be betting that sunnier days are ahead for Salesforce and that the ship will be righted in due course. Getting there won’t be easy, as the company announced that it is eliminating 8,000 staff or about 10% of its workforce. That’s big news, considering that Salesforce is the largest private-sector employer in San Francisco, while its headquarters is the city’s tallest building.Still, investors have signaled that they approve of the changes that Benioff is making at Salesforce and his initiatives that have made the company leaner.Roblox (RBLX)Roblox sign logo at headquarters. RBLX stockSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comThe shares of video-game developer Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) have been on an upswing since the California-based company announced fourth-quarter earnings that trounced analysts’ average expectations.Roblox reported a loss per share of 48 cents, above analysts’ average estimate of a per-share loss of 54 cents. The company’s revenue came in at $899.4 million, above the $881.4 million that analysts, on average, had expected, according to Refinitiv.However, what really stood out in the Q4 numbers was that Roblox had 58.8 million average daily active users, up 19% from the same period a year earlier.The Q4 print resulted in RBLX stock rising 26% in a single trading session. In 2023, the share price is up 32%. The company, while still unprofitable, remains in growth mode, announcing that users spent more than 12.8 billion hours engaged with its online video-game platform during Q4, up 18% from the final quarter of 2021. That’s a positive sign for the company’s future.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in MSFT and NVDA.

Shares have lost about 2.2% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Boeing due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Boeing's Q4 Earnings Miss Estimates, Revenues BeatThe Boeing Company incurred an adjusted loss of $1.75 per share for fourth-quarter 2022 in contrast to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings of 5 cents. The bottom line, however, improved from the year-ago quarter’s loss of $7.69 per share.The year-over-year upside can be attributed to improved commercial aerospace volumes.Including one-time items, the company posted GAAP loss of $1.06 per share compared with a loss of $7.02 per share reported in the fourth quarter of 2021.For full-year 2022, the company reported adjusted loss of $11.06 per share, which deteriorated from the year-ago loss figure of $9.44. The full-year bottom line also came in wider when compared with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $8.88 per share.Our model projected adjusted loss of 64 cents per share for the fourth quarter and $9.94 per share for 2022.RevenuesIn the quarter under review, Boeing’s revenues amounted to $19.98 billion, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $19.43 billion by 2.8%. The top line also improved 35% from the year-ago quarter’s figure of $14.79 billion.This improvement was driven by higher year-over-year revenues registered by the company’s Commercial Airplanes, Global Services as well as Defense, Space &amp; Security business units.For full-year 2022, the company recorded revenues worth $66.61 billion, up 6.9% from 2021’s reported figure. The full-year revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $66.05 billion.Story continuesOur model projected net sales of $16.91 billion for the fourth quarter and $63.54 billion for 2022.Total BacklogBacklog at the end of fourth-quarter 2022 increased to $404.38 billion from $381.32 billion at the end of third-quarter 2022.Segmental PerformancesCommercial Airplane: Revenues at this segment increased 94% year over year to $9.22 billion, driven by higher 737 and 787 deliveries. The segment incurred an operating loss of $626 million, compared with a loss of $4,454 million in the year-ago quarter.Boeing delivered 152 commercial planes during the quarter under review, up 54% year over year.The backlog for this segment remained healthy, with more than 4,500 airplanes valued at $330 billion.Boeing Defense, Space &amp; Security (BDS): This segment recorded revenues worth $6.18 billion in the fourth quarter, indicating a year-over-year increase of 5%, driven by improved deliveries. Meanwhile, this unit recorded an operating income of $112 million against an operating loss of $255 million in the year-ago quarter.The backlog at BDS was $54 billion, 28% of which comprised orders from international clients.Global Services: Revenues at this segment improved 6% to $4.57 billion on account of higher commercial services volume. This unit generated an operating income of $634 million, compared with $401 million in the year-ago quarter.Boeing Capital Corporation (BCC): This segment reported quarterly revenues of $49 million, compared with $63 million in the year-ago quarter.At the end of fourth-quarter 2022, BCC's portfolio balance was $1.5 billion.Financial ConditionBoeing exited 2022 with cash and cash equivalents of $14.61 billion and short-term and other investments of $2.61 billion. At the end of 2021, the company had $8.05 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $8.19 billion of short-term and other investments. Long-term debt amounted to $51.81 billion at the end of 2022, down from $56.81 billion at the end of 2021.The company’s operating cash inflow as of Dec 31, 2022 was $3.51 billion against cash outflow of $3.42 billion at the end of 2021.Free cashflow totaled $2.29 billion at the end of 2022 against free cash outflow of $4.40 billion at the end of 2021.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended downward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted -279.22% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Boeing has a great Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Boeing has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerBoeing is part of the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry. Over the past month, Lockheed Martin (LMT), a stock from the same industry, has gained 4.2%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended December 2022 more than a month ago.Lockheed reported revenues of $18.99 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7.1%. EPS of $7.79 for the same period compares with $7.24 a year ago.For the current quarter, Lockheed is expected to post earnings of $6.18 per share, indicating a change of -4% from the year-ago quarter.

If you want to see more best stocks to buy and hold for a lifetime, go directly to 5 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold for a Lifetime.If the investment timeline is greater than 10 years, the best stock to buy and hold for a lifetime is arguably the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) as it is a low cost and popular way for investors to own the S&amp;P 500.By owning the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) for a decade or more, investors can benefit from secular trends such as population growth, productivity growth, and more.If AI achieves its potential, overall productivity could increase substantially and considerably more goods and services could be produced. If considerably more goods and services are produced, GDP could increase meaningfully and the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) could benefit.Having a long term investing timeline is an advantage as in the near term it is arguably harder for investors to benefit from secular trends.In the near term, markets can also fluctuate substantially as valuations can change based on a variety of economic, industry, and corporate developments, all of which can be unpredictable.Individual StocksIn terms of buying individual stocks rather than the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), the best stocks to buy and hold for a lifetime are arguably blue chips with substantial competitive advantages with growth potential in the future.Some leading blue chips in technology, also known as big tech, can do well in terms of artificial intelligence if they continue to innovate and gain meaningful market share in the big markets in the future. Companies like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) can benefit from the rise of AI from more demand for cloud processing, for instance.One example of big tech benefiting is OpenAI's ChatGPT. Although it still makes plenty of mistakes, the growth in the AI application ChatGPT has been unparalleled as ChatGPT has surpassed 100 million users in two months since its launch. Given ChatGPT uses Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s cloud for processing, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has benefited from the rise in popularity of the app both as an investor in OpenAI and as a provider of cloud processing for OpenAI's ChatGPT.Story continuesFor those of you interested, check out 10 High Growth AI Stocks to Buy.Some leading blue chips in finance can do well if the overall economy does well.

If the overall economy grows, some of the leading finance blue chips such as leading big four American banks could do well from more potential loans and more potential deposits. With more business, they could potentially have more earnings poewr.In the near term, the market is uncertain. On one hand, the unemployment rate in the U.S. economy is low and U.S. GDP is expanding. On the other hand, the Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates further. If the U.S. central bank raises interest rates too much, the economy could slowdown substantially or enter into a recession.Given the market is always uncertain, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well versified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.Pixabay/Public DomainMethodologyFor our list of 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold for a Lifetime, we selected 10 blue chips with competitive advantages and long term growth potential.

The study was done in adults (18 years of age and older) not meeting glycemic targets. The initial 6-month results, published in The Lancet Diabetes &amp; Endocrinology, showed AHCL system users experienced a 27.6% absolute increase in Time in Range (TIR) and 1.4% reduction in HbA1C compared to those on MDI + isCGM without increased time in hypoglycemia. These results were even greater overnight with a TIR increase of 30.2%. At the close of the 6-month study period, all participants on MDI + isCGM crossed over to the MiniMed 780G system. At one year, these significant improvements were reproduced in this cross-over group and sustained in those that started on AHCL therapy at the start of the trial. These latest results were presented today at the 2023 Advanced Technologies &amp; Treatments for Diabetes (ATTD) Conference in Berlin.Significant Improvements in Clinical Outcomes with MiniMed 780G SystemMDI+isCGM group (switched to AHCL at 6 months)MDI+isCGMSwitched to AHCLChange (p-value)At 6 monthsAt 12 monthsMean HbA1cPrimary Endpoint8.9 %7.5 %-1.4% (&lt;0.0001)Mean Time in Range (70 - 180 mg/dL)Secondary Endpoint43.6 %70.7 %28.1% (&lt;0.0001)Long Term Maintained Clinical Outcomes with MiniMed 780G SystemAHCL group (remained on AHCL for 12 months)AHCLRemained on AHCLChange (95% confidence interval)At 6 monthsAt 12 monthsMean HbA1cPrimary Endpoint7.3 %7.4 %0.1 (-0.05 to 0.25)% *Mean Time in Range (70 - 180 mg/dL)Secondary Endpoint70.4 %69.7 %-0.7 (-2.1 to 0.7)% ✢* Non-inferiority met (margin= 0.3); ✢ Non-inferiority met (margin= -6%).Story continues""These results further strengthen the case for us to move beyond the CGM-first paradigm to ensure patients experience these well-established clinical benefits of automated insulin delivery earlier at diagnosis,"" said Ohad Cohen, M.D., Senior Global Medical Affairs Director, Medtronic Diabetes. ""The MiniMed 780G system is taking care of users in ways that individuals just aren't able to with manual injections, even with the best of intentions, as there are so many variables that impact blood sugar levels on a daily basis.""Data from a second randomized controlled study sponsored by JDRF, called the CLVer Trial, (n=113) showed that in youth (7 to17 years old) with newly-diagnosed type 1 diabetes, early intensive management, including use of an automated insulin delivery system, resulted in superior Time in Range of 78% compared to 64% Time in Range in the standard-care group (real-time CGM without automated insulin delivery) at one year. The CLVer Trial results were presented in a late-breaking clinical trial presentation at the ATTD Conference and concurrently published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).""There is a growing body of clinical evidence demonstrating the superiority of using automated insulin delivery systems as first-line treatment for type 1 diabetes rather than the standard stepwise approach of starting patients on a CGM first,"" said Jennifer McVean, MD, Senior Medical Affairs Director, Medtronic Diabetes. ""These results demonstrate patient success earlier in the course of their disease and across the age spectrum. Considering this compelling evidence, we're committed to expanding access to our MiniMed 780G system so more people living with diabetes have an opportunity to improve short- and long-term health outcomes.""The Next Frontier in Therapy Management Innovation of technology in type 1 diabetes has transformed the therapy and significantly improved outcomes and quality of life. Data presented today at ATTD addressed one of the remaining hurdles of delivering a closed loop system — the ability to manage complex meals and exercise. Prof. Amir Tirosh, Sheba Medical Centre Israel, presented studies that evaluated simplified meal announcement approaches with the MiniMed™ 780G system, confirming it was able to handle unannounced meals* up to 80 grams of carbohydrates, and that there was no deterioration in glycemic control when small amounts (up to 20 grams) of carbs were unannounced2. In addition, he presented data that precise carb counting, often seen as a prerequisite for access to advanced diabetes technology, is not as important as once thought.Meal management has been cited as one of the most challenging aspects of diabetes management as today, individuals need to calculate the number of carbs they're consuming and input it into their pump so the correct amount of insulin can be delivered (called ""announcing a meal""). The MiniMed™ 780G system was designed to anticipate real life needs where carb counts aren't always exact and meal doses are often missed. As Medtronic advances its SmartGuard™ algorithm towards a fully closed loop system, the company is evaluating the use of its MiniMed 780G system integrated with its proprietary Klue smartwatch app which leverages hand gestures detected by a smartwatch to announce meals to the pump with the goal of eliminating manual meal announcements.Early data from a small single site study (n=17) showed users were able to maintain glycemic control similar to the current standard of care of manually announcing a meal in the pump and bolusing. The study evaluated the use of the MiniMed 780G system with the Klue app disabled while traditional carb counting and carb entry were completed at baseline. Following that, the app was enabled for five days, and carb counting was prohibited. This first study of this integrated system showed that it successfully handled test meals and drinks of varying caloric and carb size while maintaining good glycemic control with a Time in Range of 80.6% during the study period.""Coupled with the real-world data we're seeing across 104 countries where it's commercially available, we're confident our system addresses a significant unmet need while delivering on the ease of use so many of our customers have asked for,"" said Que Dallara, EVP and President, Medtronic Diabetes. ""We're committed to advancing our SmartGuard™ algorithm towards a fully closed loop system and these early results on our next-generation platform integrated with Klue are very promising."" The MiniMed 780G system integrated with the company's next-generation Guardian™ 4 Sensor is currently being reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for commercial approval and is currently investigational in the U.S.* The MiniMed 780G system is optimized for use with meal announcement.Carlson AL, et al.

Shares have lost about 9.4% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Crown Castle due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Crown Castle’s Q4 FFO &amp; Revenues Beat on Solid DemandCrown Castle reported fourth-quarter 2022 adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) per share of $1.85, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.83.The net revenues of $1.76 billion, too, exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.75 billion. Our estimate for the same was pegged at $1.75 billion.Reported AFFO per share compared favorably with the year-ago period’s $1.77. Net revenues climbed 6.6% from the prior-year quarter’s $1.65 billion.The rise in site-rental revenues amid elevated tower space demand aided CCI’s year-over-year top-line growth. It maintained its outlook for 2023.In 2022, Crown Castle reported AFFO per share of $7.38, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.36. Moreover, the figure increased 6.2% from the prior year’s $6.95. Net revenues of $6.98 billion improved 10.2% from the prior year’s $6.34 billion. Moreover, the reported figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.97 billion.Per Jay Brown, chief executive officer of the company, “We generated significant growth in 2022, highlighted by nearly 6.5% organic revenue growth in our Towers segment and more than 9% dividend per share growth. Our ability to deliver strong bottom-line growth in 2022 while navigating a challenging environment with increasing interest rates reflects solid operational performance by our team and the deliberate actions we have taken over the years to reduce the risk profile of our strategy.”Story continuesQuarter in DetailDuring the fourth quarter, CCI’s site-rental revenues came in at $1.58 billion, up 7.1% year over year. The organic contribution of $57 million to the site rental revenues reflected 4.3% growth. Our estimate for site-rental revenues was pegged at $1.57 billion. Furthermore, services and other revenues climbed 3.3% to $186 million. We estimated the same to be $185.5 million.CCI’s quarterly operating expenses increased 1.9% year over year to $1.15 billion. The operating income climbed 16.8% to $610 million. The quarterly adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 billion marked a 10.8% year-over-year increase primarily due to growth in site rental revenues and higher services contribution.Crown Castle reported capital expenditures of $389 million in the quarter. This comprised discretionary capital expenditures of $359 million and sustaining capital expenditures of $30 million. Discretionary capital expenditures primarily attributable to Fiber were around $307 million, and that to Towers was roughly $45 million.Balance SheetCrown Castle exited fourth-quarter 2022 with cash and cash equivalents of $156 million, down from $174 million reported as of Sep 30, 2022.Moreover, debt and other long-term obligations aggregated $20.9 billion, up from $20.7 billion witnessed as of Sep 30, 2022.2023 GuidanceCrown Castle maintained its guidance for 2023.It expects AFFO per share in the range of $7.58-$7.68.Site rental revenues are expected to lie between $6.488 billion and $6.533 billion while the adjusted EBITDA is projected in the band of $4.449 billion-$4.494 billion.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates review have trended downward during the past month.VGM ScoresCurrently, Crown Castle has an average Growth Score of C, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Crown Castle has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

And now I'll turn the call over to Rich Corrado, our President and CEO, for his opening comments.Story continuesRich Corrado;President &amp; CEOThanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone. 2022 was an exceptional year for ATSG. Even with rapid inflation and delays at our 767 freighter conversion vendor, your company still exceeded its 2022 financial goals of $640 million in adjusted EBITDA and $2 in adjusted EPS. We also began to invest in new freighter platforms from the Airbus family while maintaining our leadership in Boeing 767 freighter leasing. I am very proud of the excellent planning and execution throughout the company that drove our considerable success. Many of those efforts are playing into our outlook for 2023. Despite some headwinds, we expect more adjusted EBITDA growth and accelerated growth in 2024 and later years. I'll be back to share more of that perspective after Quint reviews our financial results for 2022. Quint?Quint Turner;Chief Financial OfficerThanks, Rich, and welcome to everyone on the call this morning. The next slide in our deck summarizes the strong 2022 results that Rich highlighted. Our consolidated revenues for 2022 grew $311 million to $2 billion, another all-time high for revenues at ATSG. Our adjusted EPS increased by more than 40% to $2.28 compared with $1.61 in 2021. That was well above the $2 target we set a year ago. Adjusted pretax earnings increased 51% and adjusted EBITDA rose 18%. Earnings from our airline businesses, along with the momentum of our leasing returns from CAM, produced most of the EPS gain above our target. We are projecting lower EPS for 2023, as Rich will discuss in his remarks, mainly because of increased interest expense on our current fleet additions and inflation effects, particularly in our ACMI Services segment. On the next slide, you can see that versus the 12 months ended in December 2021, our adjusted EBITDA grew a record $100 million or 18% in 2022. That improvement includes a full year of cash flows from the 15 newly converted 767 freighters we deployed in 2021 and more than doubling our earnings from ACMI Services. For adjusted EBITDA, we exclude, among other items, the changes in values of our financial instruments and the benefits of federal pandemic release assistance for our passenger operations under the payroll support programs for the 2021 period. On the next slide, you'll see that our capital spending finished the year at just under $600 million, $25 million less than we projected last quarter. We separate what we call sustaining CapEx, mainly for airframe and engine maintenance, technology and other equipment, from the spending we allocate to fleet expansion. Sustaining CapEx was $187 million for the year, up $4 million. Growth CapEx was $412 million, up $90 million from the prior year, both to convert existing aircraft to freighters and to buy more feedstock passenger aircraft. In 2022, those purchases included 8 Boeing 767s and 6 Airbus A321s. We deployed and leased 6 newly converted 767 freighters last year. Turnaround times at many passenger-to-freighter aircraft conversion houses remain well above pre-pandemic levels despite their efforts to increase throughput. We expect those bottlenecks to lessen this year. The next slide updates our adjusted free cash flow as measured by our operating cash flow, net of our sustaining CapEx. Adjusted free cash flow of $285 million last year was down $115 million from the year-earlier period and down $88 million for the 12 months ended last September. Cash flows from federal grants in 2021 were $83 million. All of that cash was received in the first half. Our full year 2022 results reflect the impact of the temporary fourth quarter increase in working capital related to reimbursement of fuel costs from Omni's federal government customers. We project our growth capital investments to exceed adjusted free cash flows until 2025, when we expect that trend to reverse. Through 2024, we expect our debt leverage ratio to remain under 3x and begin to decline in 2025. You may have already seen the 2023 guidance we provided in the earnings release we issued yesterday. Rich will cover some of the factors that will affect our earnings and cash flow in his remarks. I wanted to provide some color around the significant increase in our CapEx budget of $850 million this year and the strategic decisions and steps that prepare the way for our growth investments in 2023 and 2024. The bulk of our CapEx this year and in 2024 will continue to fund the expansion of our leased 767 fleet. The other major driver of our stepped-up growth in spending over the next several years is our decision to begin offering our lease customers to other freighter types, the Airbus A321, a narrow-body midsize freighter designed to replace retiring Boeing 757s; and the A330, a wide-body midsize freighter that will complement our still-expanding fleet of 767s. We started this freighter platform expansion from a strong financial position. Through 2022, our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio as calculated under our bank agreement was below 2x and well below our average over the last several years. We also acted in 2020 and 2021 to lock in favorable fixed rates by issuing 7-year unsecured notes at a 4.75% coupon rate and amended our senior credit facility to increase our borrowing capacity, free up some collateral, and accommodate the resumption of our stock repurchase program. Available credit under our revolver was $365 million at the end of 2022, with an option for additional capacity subject to bank approvals. To coincide with our increased business with airlines in Europe and Asia, we intend to establish a similar $100 million credit facility in Ireland in the next few days. When our fleet development program is at its peak in 2024 and lease revenues from Airbus fleet additions are just beginning, we project that our leverage ratio will still remain less than 3x. After that, we expect to begin delevering in 2025. I also want to note that even with higher CapEx spending, we have the liquidity and cash flow visibility to continue to accommodate opportunistic share repurchases under the $150 million facility the Board created last fall. As we noted in our release, we repurchased 2 million shares or about 3% of those outstanding during the fourth quarter after pandemic grant restrictions on our repurchases expired. With that summary of our financial and operating results, I'll turn it back to Rich for some comments on our operations and outlook. Rich?Rich Corrado;President &amp; CEOThanks, Quint. The earnings release we issued yesterday listed some key 2022 operating accomplishments that contributed to the financial results that Quint just reviewed. Let me highlight them and share some additional color to give you more insight about how well we performed last year. Overall, we added 13 767 freighters in 2022, 6 of which were CAM-owned and leased to third-party customers. CAM also re-leased 1 767-200 and extended leases on 4 other 200s. 2 of the 6 newly converted 767-300 freighters leased last year are also being operated by ATSG's airlines under crew, maintenance and insurance agreements. We also added 7 other 767-300s to our fleet under asset-light CMI arrangements. Those were assigned to our airlines by customers who obtained them elsewhere but shows our airlines, ABX Air and ATI, to fly them. They joined 6 others we were already operating on the same basis. We expect our customers to assign us 3 more in 2023. These decisions by our customers attest to their confidence in the airline services that we provide. Our original 2022 plan called for more freighter leases, but both vendor and regulatory issues prevented us from reaching our targets. Our principal 767 conversion vendor, IAI, continues to add conversion capacity but throughput times remain well behind pandemic -- pre-pandemic levels. Anticipating delays, we decided to book several conversion slots with Boeing in 2021 and added more in 2022. Boeing will convert 4 of the 767-300s we expect to deploy this year. We believe that a combination of additional slots and faster throughput will allow us to meet our 2023 fleet expansion goals. Another challenge is gaining approvals from the regulatory agencies to put our converted A321-200 freighters into service. 3 of the 6 A321s that CAM intends to lease this year, including CAM's first 2 to ASL Aviation in Ireland, are ready to go with regulatory approval. We expect that to happen by midyear. To prepare for our step-up in fleet investments starting this year, CAM was active in the feedstock market in 2022. Through purchases and other commitments, CAM now controls all of the passenger aircraft it requires for our anticipated 20 freighter leases in 2023 and nearly all of those that we'll lease in 2024. Please go to the next slide. Quint noted that the scale of our fleet investments will be much larger over the next few years and that we have the financial backing to complete them. To those who might be concerned about whether customers will be ready to make long-term lease commitments for those aircraft as they complete conversion, it's important to understand that the surge in U.S. e-commerce activity that preceded and soared during the pandemic is only now beginning to surge in other parts of the world. The e-commerce portion of retail sales is still growing rapidly elsewhere, including Eastern Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America as air networks expand. Accordingly, more than 80% of CAM's leased freighter deployments over the next several years will be to airlines operating outside North America. And many of them will operate in networks established by DHL and other integrators who lease our freighters themselves but where rules limit where they can operate directly. Turning to our airlines. Some of the continuing growth in e-commerce fulfillment in the U.S. last year led to expansions of their fleets and more operating block hours. ABX Air and ATI added 9 767 freighters, including 7 assigned to them. Block hours of flying for all 3 airlines increased 8%, with a 9% increase in cargo operations and a 4% gain in passenger operations. Even with 1 fewer 767 in its fleet, Omni still completed a strong schedule of passenger airline missions for government customers. Also, the Department of Defense restored our full combi schedule, including our longest route in the fourth quarter. We are also proud to note that a year ago, DHL agreed once again to extend and expand the long-standing commercial relationship we've enjoyed with them since the inception of ATSG as an independent public company in 2003. The agreement extended our airline service in support of DHL's U.S. Express network for 6 years and included the lease of 3 more 767-300 freighters from CAM. Our deployment schedules include still more 767s, plus some A330s for DHL's global network. Please go on to the next slide. Those were a few of the operating and commercial successes that helped us generate record revenues, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS in 2022, and will contribute to our results for several years to come. In 2023, ATSG expects to generate between $650 million and $660 million in adjusted EBITDA and between $1.85 and $2 in adjusted earnings per share. Those targets reflect the record pace of 20 freighter lease deployments I mentioned a moment ago and which we announced to the market on February 6. Four of the international companies we will lease freighters to in 2023 and 2024 are new customers, supporting air express networks in other regions.Several years ago, we began to expand our sales and marketing outreach to customers where e-commerce is just beginning to take hold, and those efforts are paying off in record demand for our freighters today. Later in the year, CAM will begin the passenger-to-freighter conversions of our first A330-300 for lease delivery in 2024. CAM expects to convert and lease 30 such aircraft by 2028, 2/3 of which are already backed by customer commitments. CAM will also begin conversion of a projected 16 767-300 freighters it expects to lease in 2024, most of which have customers awaiting them. ATSG's 2023 outlook also includes the return of 8 of the 12 767-200 freighters that ATSG leased to Amazon in 2016. The remaining 8 will be re-leased, sold or harvested, with their engines added to the power-by-cycle pool for 767-200 lease customers. ATSG also expects inflationary and schedule reduction impacts on our airlines in 2023, when we expect fewer hours of flying for our ACMI and CMI customers. We remain positive on ATSG's long-term growth opportunities with our major U.S. air network customers and expect to add 3 customer-provided aircraft this year.We expect that 2024 and 2025 will bring the resumption of strong earnings and cash flow growth from today's investments, with year-over-year growth of about 10% in adjusted EBITDA and even stronger growth in our leasing segment. Few companies have customers committed to long-term agreements that will generate the kind of cash flow visibility that ATSG enjoys. We have a strong balance sheet, a leadership position in the midsized freighter leasing market and the strong backing of investors in our credit facility and debt securities, who regard the feedstock aircraft we are acquiring as prime assets.Our employees are also prepared to execute all of our 2023 plans with a goal to turn exciting opportunities into long-term superior returns for shareholders. That concludes our prepared remarks. Quint and I, along with Mike Berger, our Chief Strategy Officer, are ready to answer questions. May we have the first question, operator?Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Jack Atkins with Stephens.Grant SmithThis is Grant on for Jack. I just wanted to dig in a little bit on the 2023 guidance really on the ACMI side and kind of how you're expecting that to play out maybe first half versus second half. And you mentioned in your fleet update that the first half would see a year-over-year decrease in block hours with your larger customers. And today, you talked about a full year block hour decrease year-over-year in cargo and passenger. Just maybe any color on how you're thinking about ACMI over the course of the full year would be great.Quint Turner;Chief Financial OfficerYes. Thanks for the question. In terms of ACMI, the block hour decrease that we talked about, remember, we had the resumption for ATI of a combi route in the fourth quarter of '21, so we'll have that for the full year in -- or excuse me, fourth quarter '22. And we'll have it for the full year of '23. And we consider that as passenger. But of course, the other passenger hours being flown by Omni primarily for its governmental and -- the DoD and governmental customers.We expect passenger and cargo hours to be down. They will be down less than 5%, we would anticipate, year-over-year for the full year. And I think really in terms of differentiating, it's -- we do expect perhaps in the second half to see, as we typically do, and you see a lot of the forecasts, some recovery, particularly on the cargo side, where hours may pick up seasonally. But on the pax side, it's more of we expect sort of a steady environment. Those are sometimes a little tougher to forecast, as you know. Some of those hours, you don't have as much notice on. We've had events happen in the world that can affect the demand particularly for Omni on the military side.We do anticipate, I believe, in the -- based on what we've seen in the first quarter, we may see some reduced hours in flying for Omni on the governmental side, if that helps any. But basically, that part, the pax line, we're assuming pretty much steady state in the absence of having any specific information about the second half.Grant SmithAnd if I could just follow up on one more thing. So you mentioned the strength internationally in e-commerce and what you're hearing for your customers. Maybe if you could just talk a little bit on your U.S. customers. And maybe is there any more negative commentary you've heard from them? Any calls for concern as you maybe think about trying to re-lease those 767-200s as you mentioned?Mike Berger;Chief Commercial OfficerYes, no. Thanks, Grant, for the call. It's Mike Berger. From a U.S. perspective, as Rich mentioned, just to go back to Rich's remarks, our order book for the next couple of years, '23 and '24, has really been dominant, over 80% leased outside the U.S. from an international perspective. So our strategy to move forward further globally that we started several years ago now really is taking hold and will continue to. So we -- while we continue to look for opportunities within the U.S., and we'll continue to support our customers' growth where needed, our opportunities have really been greater outside the U.S., and we continue to push that way.OperatorOur next question comes from Helane Becker with Cowen.Helane Renee BeckerLet's see, I have 2 questions. The 1 question, Quint, can you -- when you talk about aircraft that you have placed or that are going to customers or where you have customers signed up, can you talk about it in terms of committed revenue over that time frame? Like can you say, ""We've already had committed revenue of X billions of dollars over the next X number of years?"" Are you able to say that?Quint Turner;Chief Financial OfficerYes. I mean, it's a good question, Helane. We talk about the 20 aircraft, for example, that we're looking -- that we are targeting for deployment in '23. On an annualized basis, you're talking about around $70 million of revenue for those placements. And if you look at 2024, it's probably more like about $85 million to $90 million on an annualized on top of that. And we have, as Rich said, excellent visibility on that. On those placements, we've got customer commitments, I think, for all but 2 or 3 of those.Helane Renee BeckerOkay. That's hugely helpful. And then my follow-up question is, I think -- I don't know if it was you or Rich who said in your prepared remarks that you have inflationary cost pressure in some of your ACMI businesses. Is that reimbursable by your customers, those cost pressures?Quint Turner;Chief Financial OfficerWell, certainly, there's escalators that are built into our customer contracts. We've all seen inflation in the recent years that has outpaced, I think, what most folks would have in their contracts. But having said that, I mean, I think it's important to say that when you look at ACMI Services, I mean, it's made tremendous progress throughout the pandemic for ATSG's airlines. And what we have projected in '23, for example, their contribution in terms of adjusted EBITDA is about 12% higher than it was in 2021 in 2023. Now 2022 was an excellent year, right? They had -- there were some opportunities for -- where customers needed charter flights and things that were higher margin than we might see in '23 due to the macroeconomic environment. And then of course in '23, with perhaps less commercial opportunities, you may see some of the airlines who participate in the government flying, the CRAF program, they may fly their -- more of their entitlements. Some of those airlines may have been opting to fly commercial trips. When the rates being offered for those types of trips were really high on the -- and now there may be less of those in a slower economy in '23. So we anticipate that Omni, while it's going to do well in '23, but it may not have as many opportunities to fly and clean up some of the entitlement not flown by some of the other carriers.Mike Berger;Chief Commercial OfficerHelane, the things that -- there are reimbursables in those ACMI agreements, things like permits, like landing fees, those types of things. Fuel is a big reimbursement. But the things that have impacted us on an inflationary basis are things like travel cost because we have to position pilots all over the world, maintenance costs for maintenance technicians or maintenance contractors. Those costs have been rising over the past few years. And those are built into the rates. They do get escalated, as Quint said, in the general agreements year-to-year, but it's just a matter of whether that escalation keeps up with where the inflationary pressure may be in those different cost items.Quint Turner;Chief Financial OfficerAnd on the military and the DoD type flying, those contracts are more akin to cost-plus. And so rates are adjusted. There's a look-back, though there's usually a lag, right? In the year the inflation is occurring, you may not get the reimbursement. But when rates are reset in subsequent years, those adjustments are made. So that's a risk mitigator, but it creates a dislocation.Helane Renee BeckerOkay. Could I squeeze in one more question? I think, Rich, you said that you were going to use Boeing to do more conversions than IAI. Why are they going to be faster to do conversions or turnarounds, given all the supply constraint issues they have?Rich Corrado;President &amp; CEOYes. I didn't say that we were going to use more Boeing, but we do have 8 slots from Boeing and we're still using a lot of IAI. We have 5 lines operating there pretty much at all times. The difference between IAI and Boeing really is that Boeing has a full production line still going of factory freighters and factory tankers. And so I think they've got a sturdier supply chain than some of the other converters and some of the other lines of business.Now we're under the A321, the A330. We've got multiple vendors on the A321 on the conversion side. And of course, we do our own. And then we've got the 2 on the 767. So we get a good view into what's going on in some of these supply chains. And I think we mentioned it in the prepared remarks that we saw some delays from IAI, and a lot of that was related to fabrication and parts vendors that they use in other countries. And I think Boeing just has a more captive supply chain just because they've got -- I believe, because they've got that large production line, and that supports their conversion line as well.Mike Berger;Chief Commercial OfficerAnd Helane, it's Mike. They tend to be a little bit more, like I put it this way, cookie-cutter. So the work scopes that go into the conversions up front are well defined and they're just more cookie-cutter approach, so the changes don't impact the actual delivery times.Rich Corrado;President &amp; CEOAnother way to say that is they're less flexible.OperatorOur next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli with Truist.Michael Frank CiarmoliJust I guess, Rich or Quint, just looking at the EBITDA guidance next year, the run rate, I mean, you have -- it's basically the second half '22 EBITDA run rate, basically puts you at the low end of that range. You're going to have more planes in service. Is all of this pressure just coming from ACMI? Or can you just elaborate a little bit? I was always operating under the impression of playing out there is maybe $4 million to $5 million of EBITDA. But just maybe can you provide some color as to the EBITDA, why the run rate just kind of holds from third quarter, fourth quarter, all the way through?Quint Turner;Chief Financial OfficerYes. I mean, Michael, it's Quint. You're correct that the -- in terms of the, I guess, the more of the headwind in '23 is ACMI Services. Even though, as I mentioned, ACMI Services in '23 is projected to be up versus, for example '21, and certainly way up since the pre-pandemic period. I mean, ACMI Services has been a great contributor.But there is, as we've always said, a little bit more volatility. Our business model has a great deal of stability with the CAM piece, but there's always a little bit of volatility on the ACMI Services side. Now we like that because it's an asset-light business, and generally, it's been a great contributor in terms of overall cash flow. And as I said, it has made progress every year except comparing to '22 as we look at '23, it's going to be down but still up versus prior periods. So there's some volatility around the margins on ACMI Services. That has to do with what we said earlier about where the opportunities might lie for military flying and commercial flying.But on the CAM piece, we talked about in our pre-release, there will be some aircraft coming back, we believe. That will create a pause, I guess, in terms of revenue stream on those 767-200s that we put the earlier release out on. CAM, certainly in terms of their earnings margins, they're impacted by the rise in interest cost, which is certainly a factor. And of course, inflation also can affect the investments, what it takes to put an aircraft on the ramp and lease it.The lease rate has held up nicely, but similar to comment earlier, sometimes there's a little bit of a lag there when inflation moves really quickly because we have a lot of our growth already programmed in, just like we talked about our pipeline, in '23 and '24, with what, 40-some aircraft coming out and being leased. We have a lot of that pipeline locked in 18, 24 months prior to when the asset comes out. So sometimes, that inflation can impact the end-of-service cost, and that's something CAM has to deal with.But it's -- we're hitting our return margins there. The businesses looks to be positioned, as Rich said, to be the engine that will drive again in '24 and '25, we believe, double-digit EBITDA growth year-over-year. But in '23, you have those -- you have some returns coming back and you have that higher interest cost, so there's a little bit of a headwind there. I don't know, Mike, if there's anything you...Mike Berger;Chief Commercial OfficerYes, we view it as a divestment investment year. And the line of sight, as Quint mentioned, in terms of our order book in 2023 and '24, and quite honestly into 2025 on the 767 side, is fabulous. And as we look at the engine, the e-commerce engine and what drives that, retail sales as a whole from now to 2026 are going to grow -- are scheduled to grow by $4.6 trillion, and $2.2 trillion of that is going to be in e-commerce.As Rich mentioned in his early remarks, we're still seeing very, very strong growth in the areas that -- around the world that we are seeing success in. Southeast Asia, Africa, the Middle East, for example, are areas that we're seeing great success with new customers as well as our existing customers in those areas. As we progress in '24 and '25, we'll be right in the midst of our deliveries on the A330, and that investment for the A330 is taking place now. So we're really keen on what the future specifically lies in our EBITDA growth and getting back to that 10-plus percent, as Quint talked about, in the upcoming years.The other piece that I'll just talk about, just from the strength standpoint, is retirements. During the pandemic, about 15 freighters were being retired a year. On a normal year, it's about 70. What does that mean? That means that the demand for cargo freighters around the world is just going to continue to add strength. So we continue to be real positive.Michael Frank CiarmoliOkay. Just on the capital intensity of business. I mean, that sustaining CapEx guidance is going to be up 40% to $260 million. I mean, is there anything unique happening this year? I mean, presumably, maintenance, parts, overall kind of shop visits are getting more expensive. But how should we think about this sustaining CapEx going forward?Quint Turner;Chief Financial OfficerYes. Thanks, Michael. It's Quint. The -- we've kind of said, because maintenance CapEx can move based on the timing of scheduled maintenance from year-to-year, I think we've kind of said it's around a couple of hundred million dollars of our CapEx in any given year. But you're right, '23 is a little bit higher. Now '22 was, I think what we said, $187 million. So you can see it came in a little lower. '23 is higher than that $200 million sort of trend, long-term trend line, mainly because of the timing of some engine overhauls. We maintain a pool of engines for some of the lessees, one of the engine types. And it's just based upon their shop visits, their expected shop visit timing. We've got more of those this year. I mean, you are correct. Inflation, as we said, I don't think any of us can probably think of any cost that it doesn't affect. But it has more to do with the timing of scheduled maintenance as to why we're looking at a higher number for maintenance CapEx in '23.Michael Frank CiarmoliOkay, that makes sense. And then just the last one, if I may. Any update on your kind of contracts with your pilots? Just kind of watching the news here, seeing what's going on at FedEx. How are you kind of handicapping or thinking about that risk?Rich Corrado;President &amp; CEOYes. So we've got pilot contracts open -- or amendable, I should say, with both ATI on the cargo side and on -- in our passenger operator, Omni. And both those contracts are -- have been in negotiation. And the both sides are meeting multiple times per month now and trading information and going forward. And so the things are progressing, just based on where they are individually, and they're both in different places. But we don't believe that we'll get to anything very quickly. We have always taken the position that we need a pilot contract that pays the pilots well enough that we can retain and attract pilots, but also gives us the cost structure required that we compete for business. And we've always been able to make those 2 positions meet at some point, and we'll continue to pursue the contract negotiations with that perspective.OperatorOur next question comes from Frank Galanti with Stifel.Frank GalantiI wanted to follow up on that last question on pilots. Can you sort of talk about availability of pilots? Have you -- considering the kind of new EBITDA guidance and expectations for low block hours, does that sort of alleviate some of the pressure from a pilot perspective? And can you talk about how variable that cost is with block hours?Rich Corrado;President &amp; CEOSo a couple of things. One is that we've been able to attract pilots without a problem over the past year. And any attrition that we've had, we've been able to stay ahead of the curve in terms of getting the training done and getting them able to be able to fly and preserve all our schedules and et cetera, et cetera. So that's been a good thing. Our average hours are way over the minimum of the new pilots coming in, so we're in good shape as far as the pilot situation goes. But in terms of the variability of pilot cost as it relates to block hours. I mean, the pilot cost is really -- it's under contract. So it's -- the pilots will go through the -- increase their pay as they go through scales. It doesn't really change that much on an average cost basis per block hour. And the contracts that we have, there are escalations that address cost on an annual basis.Quint Turner;Chief Financial OfficerBut Frank, as we look forward at the placements for aircraft, as Mike commented, most all of these are going internationally. So we don't anticipate operating those through the airline. So I think, what, over 80% or something are international placements in '23, '24.Rich Corrado;President &amp; CEO82%.Quint Turner;Chief Financial OfficerAnd so that will, to your point, it won't drive a demand for additional pilots. It's more about keeping pace with that attrition that Rich mentioned.Rich Corrado;President &amp; CEOAnd if you look at -- I mean, just the next 2 years are going to be 40 airplanes we're putting out. And you look at the diversification, we're getting away from some of our larger lessees, it's a great story because we've got stability, we've got visibility to cash flows, and we've got a differentiated business model going forward into different parts of the world.Frank GalantiThat's helpful. So I wanted to ask about the 767-200s. Can you kind of talk about -- so in the press release, you had an expectation of, at the end of '23, being down 8 planes. Can you sort of talk about the age and efficiency interest in that platform? And then kind of second part of that, last year, you took in-house the engine services for that plane. You sort of talked about $45 million of EBITDA contribution from that. Where does that sort of stack relative to what you expected in '22 versus '23 with sort of the changes in that platform?Quint Turner;Chief Financial OfficerYes. In terms of the last part of that question, and I don't know, Mike, he might jump in the first part on the 200s. But your question about the engine piece. Yes, for '22, it was right around the $40 million that we talked about at the beginning of the year when we gave guidance in terms of that EBITDA contribution. Remember, there was kind of a step-up there because we ended a long-time PBC agreement with a provider, and we went to the pooling structure that we have now, where we essentially -- we overhaul, we maintain that pool of engines and make it available to lessees who operate the aircraft.So on a '23 versus '22, there won't be much of a change. In other words, it's not a big driver of incremental EBITDA. That was sort of that changing that structure from '21 to -- late '21 to '22 that drove that $40 million increase in '22. So pretty much a stable contribution in '23 versus '22 from the engine piece.Mike Berger;Chief Commercial OfficerIn regards to the first part of your question about the demand for the 767-200. We've seen still very, very good demand for the airframe. And as Rich has mentioned in his opening remarks, we certainly will have some opportunities to sell some of those airframes as well as re-lease them out to the marketplace. So as we view those opportunities and we'll kind of have our choice, if I could put it that way, to pick and choose what's best for us as we get those returns; couple that with the engine program, the pool of engines that Quint mentioned, that we still feel that the -- or still not only feel, but see, strong requests and strong demand for that airframe.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Howard Rosencrans with VA.Howard A. RosencransI guess I just want to understand the -- I mean, obviously, the market is having a different reaction to what you're saying in terms of one of the prior speakers commented on ""great story.""So I just -- to simplify in terms of the growth CapEx, you've got $600 million in '23 and it sort of implies about $600 million in '24. Is that sort of related to -- again, just to oversimplify without the breakdown between BA and the Airbus equipment. Ostensibly, we're talking about the $27 million, $30 million per?Quint Turner;Chief Financial OfficerI'm sorry, Howard, you cut off there. You still...Howard A. RosencransYes. No, no. I had completed the question. Ostensibly, are we talking about $27 million to $30 million per aircraft? That's -- again, whether it flows in as working capital or flows in as -- but basically in terms of the CapEx, is that what we're effectively talking about? And then I want to ask you the follow-on.Quint Turner;Chief Financial OfficerWell, we talked about that range in terms of the 767-300s, to what investments look like to put them on the ramp in leasable shape.Howard A. RosencransRight. Okay. And it's pretty much the same ballpark for the Airbus, right? Is that fair to say?Quint Turner;Chief Financial OfficerYes. In terms of -- it depends on the Airbus type. And as Rich just said in the past, think of the narrow-body 321 as about 2/3 the size and about 2/3 the content. And then the 330 is about 20% larger than the 767-300s. So it's going to be a...Howard A. RosencransSo at the end of the day, it all washes out to about the same thing. So that leads me to my real question here. So the market is suggesting -- or the investment community, or however you want to look at it, is suggesting that now the returns that you're going to generate are not going to be the returns that you have generated historically.And I guess, just to speculate, there's a lack of comfort with the customers vis-à-vis the customers like Amazon and DHL and FedEx and the ones that have been part of your fleet. So how do you give us the comfort level that the customers that you have on the horizon, where you're going to do these placements, are going to -- have the same fortitude, let's say for the sake of conversation, the e-comm growth on an international basis is not as pronounced exactly. That's going to impact that, we assume, more your ACMI, which is the ACMI, which is more the volatility side of the business. But as long as we get the CAM placements there and as long as they're taking them, then we get the return on the CAM side. And let's face it, that's the lion's share of the cash flow. Since your debt is going up so much over the ensuing couple of years, to me, I just want to -- and I think for others, we just want to get a higher level of comfort that the varied buyers that we're now going to be doing business with are sharply accelerated, will be able to comfortably perform in line with the way your Goliath, let's say, domestic or global players have performed.Rich Corrado;President &amp; CEOYes, Howard. No, it's a good question. I'm glad you asked it because we've made this -- we've handled a similar question in the past about some of the smaller lessees that we have. There's a couple of things. One is, is that several of the lessees that are prominently positioned to take, whether it's A321, 767s or A330s, also fly for express companies or fly an express network that multiple companies may participate in. For example, Cargojet up in Canada.We've also got some large companies in this portfolio that will be taking airplanes internationally. DHL is in line for both 767s and A330s from now through 2026. You've got a company, ASL, that's based in Ireland but has several AOCs all over Europe. They're the largest ACMI operator in Europe, and they fly for multiple express companies and they have very strong agreements. And so -- and then you've got a company like Raya in Malaysia, which is going to be taking A321s and they are currently a 767 customer. They fly for DHL.So when you look at these lessees, they're diversifying us globally. And although they may not be your household name of DHL, UPS or FedEx, they fly for those people. So the credits that they represent are very strong in relation to just the general airline that's out there. So we have a lot of confidence. We do a lot of vetting of airlines in terms of what they're going to do with the airplane. And so we have a general understanding.Another one I forgot to mention was Maersk is taking -- will end up with 5 airplanes from us. They've already taken 3. There's 2 more to be delivered to them. And of course, Maersk is one of the largest, if not the largest, ocean company in the world. And so those are the types of customers we've got. And so we're very confident in the cash flows that we'll be receiving from these customers.Mike Berger;Chief Commercial OfficerI just -- just to bring a little bit more color to it, Howard. Our partner -- one of our partners in Africa, Astral Airways, was just named Cargo Airline of the Year for that region. Rich mentioned Raya. They were named E-commerce Airline of the Year in Southeast Asia. And just a little bit further detail on Merstar, they've been the provider of UPS in the European network for literally for over 30 years.So the vetting goes -- the vetting is very diligent, and understanding their business plans and how they're going to succeed is also very important. But as Rich said as well, DHL specifically is in line to take several aircraft over the next few years on the 767 side as well as the 330.Quint Turner;Chief Financial OfficerAnd so Howard, you mentioned how the market views it in contrast with what we're saying. And of course, we don't -- we're not second-guessing anybody or the market, but it is a little frustrating. I mean, like when we look at somebody looking just at a quarter, for example. And even this quarter, I think we had a tax item where we adjusted our state tax apportionment based on where the aircraft fly, which states they fly over, because they have different tax rates. So you run that. So we had something that was probably $0.03 to $0.05 in the fourth quarter. Well, that's kind of the difference between the consensus and our $0.53. We hit our target that we set in February of last year for full year EBITDA. And of course, we've talked at length about the visibility we have to sustainable structural growth in our leasing business, which is, as you point out, the source of the majority of our cash flows, and we'll be under long-term agreements for many, many years.And so we feel very fortunate to have that in front of us. As I mentioned, there's a little volatility around the edges with our asset-light ACMI flying, but even they have made tremendous progress since the pre-pandemic period and even since '21. CapEx-wise, the leasing business requires CapEx. There's -- that comes with that territory we get. But with the placements of 20 aircraft this year and more than that in '24, and the first of the 330s, we essentially have locked in growth for 3 years forward. Because even if you pull your -- pull back on investments after '24, the placements you make in '24 are going to drive substantial EBITDA growth in '25.And so we feel very fortunate about that. And we hope that investors focus on that long term and recognize that we've now demonstrated that our model performs well under different economic cycles, having gone through the pandemic, coming out of it. And even the slower growth that we've guided to in '23, contrast that with other transportation companies, and you can see that there truly is a stable base here that we feel very fortunate to have as part of our business model. [I gave you...]Howard A. RosencransAnd I appreciate it. Thank you for all the incremental color. I think you need to dedicate more time to discussing the international customers in slides, et cetera, because clearly, there has been a significant transition that was underappreciated by the investment community, number one. And number two, clearly, things have changed just in terms of the Boeing fleet because 6 months ago, those were not your expectations, that those were going to come off or that you were going to -- which was going to extensively lead to, as somebody else commented, a flat run rate of the base core EBITDA.So I think there's a greater understanding, and I can assure you that the market commentary is not based on whether or not you made or missed the fourth quarter by $0.01 here or there.OperatorI'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Rich Corrado for any closing remarks.Rich Corrado;President &amp; CEOThank you, Kevin. We've long discussed the resiliency of our business model with freighter leasing as the foundation and value-added services that make us unique and differentiated from any other competitor in the world.We have no peers in what we do. Many air transport services companies have struggled through the pandemic trying to get back to a 2019 baseline. Since 2019, ATSG had delivered 38% revenue growth and 42% growth in adjusted EBITDA. And our guidance today continues on that growth trend, although slowed by the same economic headwinds impacting all companies. Still, the visibility we have to cash flows from our freighter investments, with waiting customers over the next 3 years, gets us right back on to a 10% EBITDA growth trajectory in 2024 and 2025, just based on the leasing commitments alone. More fortunate market conditions could also lift our other services, delivering even higher returns. Once again, ATSG's resiliency is demonstrated through the most challenging of times. As we drive our results for 2023 and beyond, we remain a great investment for stability, growth and high visibility of future returns. Thank you all for your interest in ATSG, and please stay safe.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.]"

Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, jumped 1.8% last month, exceeding forecasts for a 1.3% rise.""The headline and core PCE numbers were well above expectations. What worries us most is that the data since the last Fed meeting has been extremely strong,"" said Gene Goldman, chief investment officer at Cetera Investment Management.""If the Fed had this data at the last meeting they probably would've raised by 50 bps and the tone from the press conference would've been a lot different.""Traders of futures tied to the Fed's policy rate added to bets of at least three more rate hikes this year, with the peak rate seen in the range of 5.25%-5.5% by June.Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said the Fed should raise interest rates higher than necessary if need be to get inflation fully under control.Story continuesAccording to preliminary data, the S&amp;P 500 lost 41.90 points, or 1.04%, to end at 3,970.42 points, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 195.52 points, or 1.67%, to 11,394.88.

Shares have added about 2.6% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is TE Connectivity due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.TE Connectivity's Q1 Earnings &amp; Revenues Beat EstimatesTE Connectivity reported first-quarter fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings of $1.53 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2%.However, the figure decreased 13.1% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reading.Net sales in the reported quarter were $3.84 billion, beating the consensus mark of $3.75 billion. The figure rose 1% on a reported basis and 8% organically from the respective year-ago fiscal quarter’s readings.Well-performing transportation solutions drove the top line growth during the reported quarter.Top-Line DetailsTransportation Solutions: The segment generated $2.26 billion, which accounted for 58.8% of net sales. The figure grew 5% year over year. The company witnessed 9% growth in automotive sales, which was driven by the growing proliferation of electric vehicles and strong content trends in electronification.However, sensor sales fell 4% from the year-ago quarter. Also, commercial transportation sales declined 5% year over year due to weak momentum in China.Industrial Solutions: The segment generated $1.06 billion, which accounted for 27.6% of net sales. The figure rose 1% year over year. This was driven by improvements in commercial aerospace, which led to 9% growth in aerospace, defense and marine sales. Solid momentum across renewable applications also remained positive for the company’s energy business, which grew 1% year over year. Further, growing momentum across interventional procedures led to a 4% rise in medical sales.However, industrial equipment sales, which declined 5%, were concerning.Communications Solutions: The segment generated $522 million, which accounted for 13.6% of net sales. Further, the figure declined 14% year over year. This was attributed to broad market weakness. Data and device sales decreased 8% and appliance sales fell 23% year over year.Story continuesOperating DetailsPer management, the gross profit was $1.2 billion, which was down 3.5% year over year. As a percentage of revenues, the figure contracted 130 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 30.9%.We note that selling, general and administrative expenses were $392 million, which rose 8% year over year. Research and development expenses were $173 million, which declined 1.1% year over year.The company’s adjusted operating margin was 16.2% in the reported quarter, which contracted 240 bps year over year.Balance Sheet &amp; Cash FlowAs of Dec 30, 2022, cash and cash equivalents were $793 million, down from $1.09 billion as of Sep 30, 2022.Long-term debt was $3.4 billion in the fiscal first quarter, up from $3.3 billion in the prior fiscal quarter.TE Connectivity generated $581 million in cash from operations in the reported quarter, down from $944 million in the previous quarter. Further, it generated a free cash flow of $399 million.TEL returned $410 million to its shareholders.GuidanceFor second-quarter fiscal 2023, TE Connectivity expects net sales of $3.9 billion, with 3% decline on a reported basis and 2% growth on an organic basis from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reading.Adjusted earnings are projected at $1.57 per share.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended downward during the past month.VGM ScoresAt this time, TE Connectivity has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a D. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise TE Connectivity has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It is one of the best AI stocks for 2023. On February 6, Logan Purk, an analyst at Edward Jones, lowered International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)’s rating from Buy to Hold, without providing a price target. In a research note to investors, the analyst stated that with IBM's business transformation now complete and the stock rising on the potential for accelerated growth, the shares are correctly valued.According to Insider Monkey’s data, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) was part of 43 hedge fund portfolios at the end of December 2022, compared to 40 in the prior quarter. Phill Gross and Robert Atchinson’s Adage Capital Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 919,590 shares worth $129.5 million. In its Q1 2022 investor letter, St. James Investment Company, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“IBM was not the first company to build computers. The distinction belongs to Sperry-Rand’s subsidiary UNIVAC, which introduced the first commercially successful computers in the early 1950s. In this era, IBM did possess the largest research and development department of the business machines industry and quickly caught up, introducing cost-competitive computers a few years after UNIVAC. By the late 1950s, IBM held the dominant market share in computers. IBM also touted a vastly superior sales organization, which used a sales tactic called “paper machines” (the equivalent of today’s “vaporware”). If a competitor’s product was selling well in a market segment that IBM had yet to penetrate, the company would announce a competing product and start taking orders for the “paper machine” long before it was available.

According to the analyst, the rumors of a dividend cut have had a negative impact on the stock, but it is the right decision to make. Despite the material underperformance of the stock in late 2022 and year-to-date, and the negative impact of the dividend cut, the firm believes that the current share levels present a balanced risk-reward situation. Additionally, Morgan Stanley now sees limited downside risk in Intel's shares.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 62 hedge funds were bullish on Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), compared to 69 funds in the earlier quarter. John Overdeck and David Siegel’s Two Sigma Advisors is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 11.2 million shares worth $297.3 million.In addition to Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is one of the premier AI stocks to monitor. ClearBridge Investments made the following comment about Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Also on the detractor side, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) delivered a disappointing revenue miss and lowered full-year revenue and earnings guidance as COVID-19-driven demand for PCs abated (where Intel enjoys half its sales) and a delay in its flagship Sapphire Rapids CPU hurt its data center business. Despite these issues, we still believe Intel is an economically sensitive turnaround story with substantial upside.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best AI Stocks For 2023.  Suggested articles:15 Best Oil Stocks to Buy10 Small Cap SaaS Stocks Hedge Funds are Piling Into13 Most Profitable Food Stocks Disclosure: None. 12 Best AI Stocks For 2023 is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this technology and consulting company have returned -2.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's no change. The Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, to which IBM belongs, has lost 5.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.IBM is expected to post earnings of $1.27 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -9.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -21.3%.The consensus earnings estimate of $9.46 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +3.6%. This estimate has changed -2.1% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.91 indicates a change of +4.8% from what IBM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.4%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, IBM is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for IBM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of IBM, the consensus sales estimate of $14.28 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +0.6%. The $62.06 billion and $64.53 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.5% and +4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryIBM reported revenues of $16.69 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of 0%. EPS of $3.60 for the same period compares with $3.35 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.55 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +7.34%. The EPS surprise was -0.28%.Over the last four quarters, IBM surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.IBM is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about IBM. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

150,3a6ae061-d8df-38cf-a217-dff9993c2854,TAP,2023-02-25,Why It Might Not Make Sense To Buy Molson Coors Beverage Company (NYSE:TAP) For Its Upcoming Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-might-not-sense-buy-121350403.html,1677327230,STORY,['TAP-A'],"[It looks like Molson Coors Beverage Company (NYSE:TAP) is about to go ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Thus, you can purchase Molson Coors Beverage's shares before the 2nd of March in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 17th of March.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.41 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$1.52 per share. Last year's total dividend payments show that Molson Coors Beverage has a trailing yield of 2.8% on the current share price of $53.78. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. View our latest analysis for Molson Coors Beverage Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Molson Coors Beverage lost money last year, so the fact that it's paying a dividend is certainly disconcerting. There might be a good reason for this, but we'd want to look into it further before getting comfortable. Given that the company reported a loss last year, we now need to see if it generated enough free cash flow to fund the dividend. If cash earnings don't cover the dividend, the company would have to pay dividends out of cash in the bank, or by borrowing money, neither of which is long-term sustainable. Fortunately, it paid out only 39% of its free cash flow in the past year.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with shrinking earnings are tricky from a dividend perspective. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. Molson Coors Beverage reported a loss last year, and the general trend suggests its earnings have also been declining in recent years, making us wonder if the dividend is at risk.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Molson Coors Beverage has lifted its dividend by approximately 1.7% a year on average.Get our latest analysis on Molson Coors Beverage's balance sheet health here.Final TakeawayShould investors buy Molson Coors Beverage for the upcoming dividend? First, it's not great to see the company paying a dividend despite being loss-making over the last year. On the plus side, the dividend was covered by free cash flow."" It's not an attractive combination from a dividend perspective, and we're inclined to pass on this one for the time being.With that being said, if you're still considering Molson Coors Beverage as an investment, you'll find it beneficial to know what risks this stock is facing.

Yet it is true that U.S. industry-wide beer volumes fell at a much higher rate in the fourth quarter than they had earlier in the year,” CEO Gavin Hattersley told analysts on a call. “Much of this has been attributed to most of the beer industry taking a second price increase in the calendar year.”He added that beer’s “share of basket” at retailers, however, had not fallen, such that consumers are not cutting back on beer any more than they are other items. That being said, many consumers are buying in smaller amounts.“We are seeing consumers trading down maybe from a 30-pack to a 24 or 24 to a 12 or a 12 to a 6,” Hattersley said.Previously, the company had seen “premiumization” slow down but had not seen trade-down in the United States.Beer, of course, is one of the most affordable alcoholic beverages on offer, and as inflation has persisted, consumers have been increasingly shifting their booze spending toward the beverage.“Beer actually gained share of total alcohol beverage in the quarter,” Hattersley said.Over all, consumers tend to dramatically overestimate the rate of alcoholic beverage price increases, according to research from the December edition of PYMNTS’ Consumer Inflation Sentiment study, “Consumer Inflation Sentiment: In It For The Long Haul,” which draws from a survey of more than 2,300 United States adults.The study found that consumers perceive the prices of alcoholic beverages to have risen 23.1% year over year. Yet, data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics notes that the prices of these items have only risen 5% year over year, about a fifth of the amount that consumers perceive it to be.Story continuesMolson Coors’ observations add to findings at the end of last year, highlighted by The Wall Street Journal, that consumers are trading down to cheaper alcohol brands. The report cited data from Nielsen analyzed by the Bump Williams Consulting Co., a beverage-sector consulting firm, showing U.S. retail-store sales of “superpremium” spirits falling 3.7% in the 48 weeks ending Dec. 3, following a 4% uptick in 2021.Additionally, Molson Coors, like its competitor Diageo, noted strength in ready-to-drink (RTD) cocktails amid consumers’ growing demand for on-the-go convenience. The rapid growth of the RTD spirits category suggests that consumers may be looking to bring some of the variety that they can experience at a bar or restaurant to their social gatherings at a time when going out for bar drinks may be more of a luxury than many can afford.Certainly, consumers are cutting back. PYMNTS’ “Consumer Inflation Sentiment: Consumers Buckle Down On Belt-Tightening” found that 66% of the adult population in cutting down on nonessential retail spending, and 58% are cutting down on nonessential grocery spending.]"

After accounting for the recent loss, the US$1.0m worth of shares they purchased is now worth US$1.2m, suggesting a good return on their investment.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for AES AES Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when Executive VP &amp; CFO Stephen Coughlin bought US$1.0m worth of shares at a price of US$21.30 per share. Even though the purchase was made at a significantly lower price than the recent price (US$25.39), we still think insider buying is a positive. Because the shares were purchased at a lower price, this particular buy doesn't tell us much about how insiders feel about the current share price.The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeThere are always plenty of stocks that insiders are buying.

(Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insider Ownership Of AESLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It appears that AES insiders own 0.3% of the company, worth about US$53m. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At AES Tell Us?The fact that there have been no AES insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. On a brighter note, the transactions over the last year are encouraging. Overall we don't see anything to make us think AES insiders are doubting the company, and they do own shares.

Automakers could have to choose between reducing output to avoid price cuts, or offering richer discounts to pump up sales volumes, dealers said.GM dealers have over 100 days’ supply of Chevy Silverado pickups in stock, reflecting more vehicles on the ground and a seasonally slow pace of sales, according to Cox. Inventory levels are over 100 days’ supply for rival Stellantis NV's Ram half-ton and heavy-duty pickups. Ford Motor Co has 92 days’ worth of F-150s in stock, according to Cox data.A GM spokesman said Cox’s numbers do not accurately reflect GM’s inventory situation. GM does not disclose detailed inventory figures. However, he said GM is acting to support its pricing strategy, which relies on keeping inventories leaner than in the past.Stellantis said in a statement it had no downtime planned at any of its North American plants, but constantly reviewed its inventory levels and would make production adjustments as needed.Industry consultants J.D. Power and LMC Automotive forecast on Friday that U.S. car and light truck sales for February would reach a 14.6 million-vehicle annualized pace. That is up from a year ago, but still well below pre-pandemic levels.February sales growth was led by a 54% increase in sales to fleet customers, Power and LMC said.Overall inventories of unsold vehicles are still low, but ""are still not sufficient to fulfill demand each month,"" Thomas King, president of the data and analytics division at J.D. Power, said in a statement.Story continuesGM said its decision to idle the Fort Wayne, Indiana, assembly plant that builds Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks for two weeks starting March 27 was done to maintain ""optimal inventory levels with our dealerships.""WHO BLINKS FIRST?GM, Ford and Stellantis dominate the U.S. large pickup market, and for the past two years have been raising prices on their trucks to record levels as supply-chain snags limited production.Dealers contacted by Reuters said that now, some customers are waiting for better deals, or are postponing purchases because the combination of high prices and higher interest rates put vehicles out of reach. The automakers face a choice between cutting prices using bigger rebates or subsidized loans, or keeping inventories tight.""What they're doing is playing what I call the blink game - whoever blinks first. Especially for trucks,"" said Ohio dealer Rhett Ricart, whose Ricart Automotive Group sells Ford and GM trucks at different stores.Brad Sowers, president of Jim Butler Auto Group in Missouri, said high prices are hitting demand. However, he wrote in an email, ""manufacturers do not want to flood the market and be forced to quadruple incentive spending to drive demand that will reduce their margins.""Some discounts are showing up in the large pickup segment. Ram is offering 2.9% financing for 72-month loans on certain Ram 1500 trucks.Power and LMC said fewer vehicles were sold in February above their manufacturer suggested prices, and that the average discount rose 4.7% to $1,335 a vehicle. That is still well below pre-pandemic levels, Power-LMC said.(Reporting by Joseph White and Ben Klayman in Detroit Additional reporting by Kannaki Deka in Bengaluru Editing by Matthew Lewis)]"

PNC's equity investment in Los Angeles' leading, Black-led housing developer will fund the development of new affordable housing units for residents earning well below the Area Median Income (AMI). SoLa's Black Impact Fund, its fourth fund, expects to add more than 3,000 workforce and affordable housing units in Black and brown communities in Southern California.""We are excited to partner with PNC Bank to address the crisis of housing affordability in California,"" said Martin Muoto, founder and CEO of SoLa Impact. ""Investments like these enable us to build more units to serve more residents of communities that are burdened by high costs of living. PNC's commitment to the intended outcomes of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) goes beyond investing in minority communities and is further demonstrated by doing so with Black-led operators such as SoLa Impact. This investment allows the Black Impact Fund to continue to scale its production of affordable and workforce multifamily assets, which in turn allows us to reduce the cost of delivering these units. Ultimately, the goal is to deliver superior returns not only to our investors, but also to our community.""""As a national main street bank, PNC Bank is focused on making a real impact in communities throughout the Greater Los Angeles area,"" said Todd Wilson, PNC regional president for Greater Los Angeles. ""This investment in the Black Impact Fund enables us to provide solutions to Southern California's affordable housing shortage and reinforces our commitment to work with leading organizations like SoLa to address the housing affordability gap in the communities we serve.Story continuesPNC's investment stems from its $88 billion Community Benefits Plan, which will provide loans, investments and other financial support to bolster economic opportunity for low- and moderate-income (LMI) individuals and communities, people and communities of color, and other underserved individuals and communities over a four-year period that began Jan. 1, 2022. As part of the allotted $88 billion, PNC has committed to provide at least $14.5 billion in community development loans and investments across all markets, including at least $400 million for Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) that help meet the banking and financial service needs of traditionally underserved communities.The Community Benefits Plan builds on PNC's commitment to providing economic opportunity for all individuals and communities, including LMI and minority individuals and communities, as well as women, veterans and LGBTQ+ individuals and businesses. In addition, the Plan reflects PNC's commitment to addressing systemic racism, promoting social justice and advancing diversity and inclusion, not just within PNC, but within the broader financial system and its communities.PNC's investment into SoLa's Black Impact Fund demonstrates to Los Angeles that PNC is committed to development and reinvestment in its underserved communities. PNC is among several large banks that understand SoLa's data-driven approach to affordable housing and community engagement, especially in low- and moderate-income areas that have historically been undervalued and overlooked.In the Black Impact Fund, SoLa Impact has raised $300 million from leading institutional investors and community-focused banks, high net-worth individuals, and family offices. Its unique combination of cost-disciplined, for-profit development, standardization of building processes and community engagement, has made SoLa one of the largest developers of affordable and workforce housing in Southern California with over 1,500 units under management and another 3,000 in the pipeline.

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 81% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).And institutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's share price fell by 3.6% last week. The recent loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 14% for stockholders, may not sit well with this group of investors. Often called “market makers”, institutions wield significant power in influencing the price dynamics of any stock. As a result, if the decline continues, institutional investors may be pressured to sell Target which might hurt individual investors.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Target. View our latest analysis for Target ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Target?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Target does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Target, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Target is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.3%. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.4% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 7.2% of the company stock.A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 22 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of TargetWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Target Corporation in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$167m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 18% stake in Target. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Target better, we need to consider many other factors. Be aware that  Target is showing  4 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those is potentially serious...Ultimately the future is most important.

166,563b22cf-8c27-3f8c-8ef3-f71ca23b3c14,TGT,2023-02-25,Breaking Down Retail Earnings and Consumer Spending Trends,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/breaking-down-retail-earnings-consumer-194307171.html,1677267787,STORY,"['WMT', '^GSPC', 'AMZN', 'TGT']","[It is no surprise that the combined weight of elevated inflation, rising interest rates and uncertainty about the economy have forced consumers to change their spending behavior.The issue has undoubtedly been at play with lower-income households for some time now. But we can intuitively appreciate that it will not stay restricted to this consumer segment alone and will most likely move up the income chain in the days ahead.We saw some of that in the Walmart (WMT) report that showed the retailer benefiting from higher-income consumers ‘trading down’ to its stores in response to the aforementioned headwinds. On the flip side, a big contributor to Walmart’s weak guidance for this year reflects a moderating consumer spending backdrop that some in the market see as overly conservative.  The retail business is a tough and competitive space even in ‘normal’ times and these are anything but normal times.They need just the right amount of inventory, otherwise they will either lose sales if they don’t have enough merchandise as was the case earlier in the pandemic or they will need to offer steeper discounts and hurt margins if they have too much of it, as we saw with Walmart and Target (TGT) last year.Retailers also need to make sure that they have the right type of merchandise, as we saw with Target and Walmart having too much of the patio furniture that consumers weren’t interested in buying. Keeping stores fully staffed in a tight labor market and ensuring just right amount of price discounts are some of the other challenges that big-box operators like Walmart, Target and others face daily.Walmart’s strong performance on the inventory front over the last two quarters is a big reason why the stock has done so much better relative to Target whose results are coming out before the market’s open on Tuesday, February 28th.Target shares are one of those stocks that really move on quarterly releases. The stock was down following each of the last three releases, with the May 18th 2022 report was one for the record books when the stock lost more than a quarter of its value as the company’s inventory and merchandising problems took center stage. This puts a premium on Target’s release Tuesday morning given the stock’s impressive run this year.Story continuesIt all comes down to execution and management effectiveness.In a backdrop of moderating and shifting consumer spending behavior, some retailers have been more successful than others. Walmart has been better, Target less so, though Target shares have been stellar performers in recent weeks. Macy’s (M), which also reports this week, has been one of the laggards.You can see some of this in one-year performance of Walmart (orange line, up +3.3%), Target (blue line, down -17.6%), Macy’s (green line, down -22.5%) shares relative to the S&amp;P 500 index (red line, down -10.1%).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSince the start of 2023, however, Target shares are up +10.1% vs. +4.5% for the S&amp;P 500 index, while Walmart and Macy’s shares are down -0.6% and -1%, respectively.With respect to the Retail sector’s 2022 Q4 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 24 of the 33 retailers in the S&amp;P 500 index. Total Q4 earnings for these retailers are down -33% from the same period last year on +6.5% higher revenues, with 70.8% beating EPS estimates and 62.5% beating revenue estimates.The comparison charts below put the Q4 beats percentages for these retailers in a historical context.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs you can see above, retailers have been struggling to come out with positive surprises thus far, with the variance relative to the historical ranges particularly notable on the EPS side.With respect to the earnings and revenue growth rates, Amazon’s -85.4% earnings decline plays a significant role in the group’s weak year-over-year growth rate for the sector (Amazon is part of the Zacks Retail sector, and not the Zacks Technology sector). Most of the Retail sector earnings reports that have come out already are in the digital part of the space, with the more traditional retailers started the reporting cycle with last week’s Walmart release and a host of others on deck this week.As we all know, the digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now, with Amazon now a decent sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods and Walmart a growing online vendor. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the Covid lockdowns.The two comparison charts below show the Q4 earnings and revenue growth relative to other recent periods, both with Amazon’s results (left side chart) and without Amazon’s numbers (right side chart).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis Week’s Reporting DocketWe have more than 550 companies on deck to report results this week, including 30 S&amp;P 500 members. Notable companies reporting this week, aside from the aforementioned retailers include Berkshire Hathaway, Broadcom, Salesforce.com, and others.2022 Q4 Earnings Season ScorecardAs of Friday, February 24th, we now have Q4 results from 468 S&amp;P 500 members or 93.6% of the index’s total membership. Total earnings for these companies are down -5.7% from the same period last year on +6% higher revenues, with 70.7% beating EPS estimates and an equal proportion beating revenue estimates.The comparison charts below put the EPS and revenue beats percentages in Q4 in a historical context.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe comparison charts below put the earnings and revenue growth rates in Q4 in a historical context.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs you can see, there is a notable deceleration in the growth trajectory, both for earnings as well as revenues. Please note that this decelerating growth trend doesn’t change in any meaningful way whether we look at it on an ex-Finance or ex-Tech bases.The Earnings Big PictureWe have all along been referring to the overall picture that emerged from the 2022 Q4 reporting cycle as good enough; not great, but not bad either.The revisions trend continues to be negative, with the outlook for a number of sectors on the weak side. But it is consistent with the evolving macroeconomic picture and far from the dire scenario that many in the market feared. You can see this in the chart below that shows how estimates for the current period (2023 Q1) have evolved in recent weeks.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPlease note that while Q1 estimates are coming down, the pace and magnitude of cuts is notably below what we had seen ahead of the start of the last couple of earnings seasons.The chart below shows the aggregate earnings total for the index since the start of last year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPlease note that the $1.911 trillion in expected aggregate earnings for the index in 2023 approximate to an index ‘EPS’ of $215.47, down from $215.89 last week and the $215.90 tally we are on track to have seen in 2022.The chart below shows this 2023 index ‘EPS’ estimate has evolved since the start of 2022.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWith the bulk of the 2022 Q4 reporting cycle now behind us, revisions have mostly played down for the next few weeks though the Retail sector results will have a bearing on how expectations for that space evolve.We continue to believe that a definitive read on the revisions front will only emerge once we have seen an end to the Fed’s tightening cycle and the impact of the cumulative tightening on economic growth.That said, relative to pre-season doom-and-gloom worries, this is fairly reassuring outcome.The chart below shows the expected 2022 Q4 earnings and revenue growth expectation in the context of where growth has been in recent quarters and what is expected in the next few quarters.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on an annual basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs you can see here, estimates for 2023 are now a hair below the 2022 level.

167,7681357f-1a19-3bde-9bfc-278d4343b606,TGT,2023-02-25,Target (TGT) Lined Up for Q4 Earnings: Factors to Consider,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/target-tgt-lined-q4-earnings-171105673.html,1677258665,STORY,"['TGT', 'ROST']","[Target Corporation TGT is likely to register a decline in the top line when it reports fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results on Feb 28 before market open. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $30.69 billion, indicating a decline of 1% from the prior-year reported figure.The bottom line of this general merchandise retailer is anticipated to have declined year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share for the quarter under review has declined by a penny to $1.38 over the past seven days and suggests a sharp decline from the earnings of $3.19 reported in the year-ago period.We expect revenues to be down 1.9% year over year to $30,406.8 million and the bottom line to decline 57.6% to $1.35 per share.Target has a trailing four-quarter negative earnings surprise of 22.2%, on average. In the last reported quarter, this Minneapolis, MN-based company’s bottom line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 28.4%.Key Things to NoteOn its last earnings call, Target informed that softening sales and profit trends that emerged in the latter part of the third quarter continued in November. Undoubtedly, soaring prices have squeezed consumers’ disposable income, compelling them to rein in discretionary spending. Target might have witnessed the soft demand for discretionary products, partly offset by sustained strength in essentials.Management earlier forecast a low-single-digit decline in comparable sales for the fourth quarter. We expect comparable sales to decline 2.1% in the quarter under discussion.Target Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseTarget Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseTarget Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Target Corporation QuoteWe believe that higher markdowns to clear excess inventory, increased merchandise and freight costs, and an unfavorable product mix might have weighed on margins. Additionally, the increased compensation and headcount in distribution centers might have hurt the gross margin rate. Management anticipated greater markdown pressure in the final quarter due to promotions, as customers become more price sensitive.Target projected the fourth-quarter operating margin rate to be centered around 3%. This indicates a sharp contraction of 380 basis points from the year-ago period.Nonetheless, management has been undertaking cost-control measures, such as working with vendors to offset inflationary pressures and driving continued operating efficiencies. The company’s digital endeavors, store investments and merchandise actions to gain market share bode well.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Target this time. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat, which is the case here.

169,76ea5bbe-a09c-351f-a3c9-1eaf571960e0,TGT,2023-02-25,Here is What to Know Beyond Why Target Corporation (TGT) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-target-corporation-140002610.html,1677247202,STORY,['TGT'],"[Target (TGT) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this retailer have returned -0.9%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's no change. During this period, the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry, which Target falls in, has lost 1.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Target is expected to post earnings of $1.38 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -56.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.5%.The consensus earnings estimate of $5.51 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -59.4%. This estimate has changed -1.3% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.36 indicates a change of +69.8% from what Target is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.3%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Target is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for TGT _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Target, the consensus sales estimate of $30.69 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -1%. The $108.42 billion and $111.39 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.3% and +2.7%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryTarget reported revenues of $26.52 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.4%. EPS of $1.54 for the same period compares with $3.03 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $26.36 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.62%. The EPS surprise was -28.37%.Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Target is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Target. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

On that day, Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is projected to report earnings of $1.17 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 3.54%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $1.58 billion, up 6.23% from the year-ago period.ISRG's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $5.27 per share and revenue of $6.88 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +12.61% and +10.6%, respectively.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Intuitive Surgical, Inc.These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves.

While the stock has lost 7.6% over the past four weeks, there is light at the end of the tunnel as it is now in oversold territory and Wall Street analysts expect the company to report better earnings than they predicted earlier.How to Determine if a Stock is OversoldWe use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound.However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.Why a Trend Reversal is Due for ROSTThe heavy selling of ROST shares appears to be in the process of exhausting itself, as indicated by its RSI reading of 28.53. So, the trend for the stock could reverse soon for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.The RSI value is not the only factor that indicates a potential turnaround for the stock in the near term. On the fundamental side, there has been strong agreement among the sell-side analysts covering the stock in raising earnings estimates for the current year. Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for ROST has increased 1.2%. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.Story continuesMoreover, ROST currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises.

Sales in the fiscal fourth quarter are likely to have benefited from broad-based growth across merchandise categories and regions, as well as robust comparable store sales. Sales are also expected to have gained from robust trends at the dd's DISCOUNTS business. Gains at the core business, driven by consumers' continued focus on value and the company’s ability to deliver value bargains to customers, bode well.Ross Stores has been consistent with the execution of its store expansion plans, which are likely to have aided the top line. The company's store-expansion efforts have been focused on continually increasing penetration in existing and new markets. The fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 performance is anticipated to have gained from the company’s return to normal store opening targets. Gains from new stores are expected to get reflected in the company's sales for the fiscal fourth quarter.On its last reported quarter’s earnings call, Ross Stores was optimistic about its fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 performance, given the third-quarter sales momentum and improved assortments for the holiday season.The company expects comps to be flat to down 2% in the fiscal fourth quarter, whereas it reported 9% comps growth in the prior-year quarter. Earnings per share are envisioned to be $1.13-$1.26 for the fiscal fourth quarter. The company reported earnings of $1.04 per share in the year-ago quarter.The earnings view for the fiscal fourth quarter is based on sales of flat to up 3% and the operating margin of 9.7-10.5%. Notably, the company reported an operating margin of 9.8% in the year-ago quarter. The operating margin view indicates gains due to the easing of significant cost pressures from ocean freight and lower incentives in the prior-year quarter.For fiscal 2022, the company envisions earnings per share of $4.21-$4.34. Notably, it reported $4.87 in fiscal 2021.However, Ross Stores has been witnessing the effects of the ongoing financial pressures on dd’s DISCOUNTS’ lower-income customer base and increased markdowns. On the last reported quarter's earnings call, Ross Stores anticipated the highly promotional holiday season and inflationary costs to put pressure on low-to-moderate income customers, which are expected to have impacted the performance of dd’s DISCOUNTS stores.Further, the company’s cost of goods sales is likely to have witnessed continued impacts of lower merchandise margins, unfavorable timing of packaway-related costs and increased markdowns. Unfavorable timing of pack-away-related expenses and deleverage from its new distribution center are expected to have resulted in higher distribution costs.Story continuesZacks ModelOur proven model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for Ross Stores this time around.

That itself is a miracle.For the past year, Mykola and Olena and their three children lived with the constant cacophony of war - sirens, gunfire and missile strikes back home in L'viv, Ukraine.But now, thanks to a handful of Regions associates, numerous friends and local churches in Birmingham, the Vyshyvanyuks and their three children have started a new life in a quiet, safe suburb of Alabama's largest city.""Back home, it's very, very cold,"" Olena said with a soft smile. ""I don't like winter anymore. The Alabama winter is much better.""""We are still adjusting,"" added Mykola. ""But not our kids. In two or three weeks, they made new friends and made this home.""How do you change lives, escape a war and find a new life in a year's time? For the Vyshyvanyuks, it started with an article in the Wall Street Journal.Ed Cotter remembers reading about a program called Uniting for Ukraine, a program implemented by the White House, to fast-track immigration from the war-torn nation to the U.S.""I signed up as a lark,"" explained Cotter, Regions' assistant general counsel. ""You set up a profile, then people ping you and you start talking from there.""I connected with this family - parents and three children, ages, 6, 11 and 13 - from L'viv in Western Ukraine. We agreed we'd help them move to America.""It sounded so easy. It was anything but.I made donations, but it didn't seem like that was what my soul needed. But this - what Ed was doing - felt like a direct impact on someone's life and I was excited to be a part of that. Kate Laminack, Modernization and Transformation Partner at RegionsStory continuesMaking a connection was the first step. Sponsors also had to provide two years of financial support, find housing, jobs, cars, and line up schools. With his wife, Natalie, fully on board, Ed began sharing his plans with friends and church members. It would take a team, and an active GoFundMe, to bring the Vyshyvanyuks to Birmingham.Inspired by ExperienceIrina Pritchett was one of the first co-workers to jump headfirst into the effort.""Ed suspected I'd be interested after we had a passing conversation in the early days of the war,"" Pritchett said. ""Weeks later, he reached out about the sponsorship. But what I heard was, ‘My wife and I are thinking of doing this amazing thing but need a community to make it happen.'""For Pritchett, a Risk Initiative and Integration manager at Regions, the response was immediate. How could it be anything else?As a child, Pritchett's family emigrated to the U.S. as political refugees due to growing, institutional antisemitism in the Soviet Union.I feel grateful to be able to pay forward the help that we received when we came to the U.S. and honor a piece of my parents' journey in doing so. Irina Pritchett, Risk Initiative and Integration manager at Regions""My parents left behind family, friends - everything they knew - and became ‘traitors to the (Soviet) state' without knowing where we would end up,"" Pritchett said. ""Like the Vyshyvanyuks, my parents packed our lives into one suitcase per person and took an indescribable leap of faith motivated by love for their children.""I feel grateful to be able to pay forward the help that we received when we came to the U.S. and honor a piece of my parents' journey in doing so.""Other associates came on board, including Franklin Danley, Payment and Credit Card Operations group manager, and Susan Anderson, Enterprise Reputational Risk administrator. Both jumped in enthusiastically.Then Kate Laminack of the Transformation team learned of the endeavor. Like Pritchett, it hit close to home.She was 11 when she first moved to the United Kingdom, then to Birmingham, Alabama. Both of her parents were scientists who found new academic positions at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.""It was ridiculously hard,"" Laminack said. ""To come at that age, in 6th grade, it was like stepping into a new world - especially as a kid. I looked different, spoke differently and my new classmates had no concept of what we were going through.""Yet, since the onset of the invasion, she knew she had to help.""I'd been thinking about what I could do to help since the war started,"" Laminack said. ""I made donations, but it didn't seem like that was what my soul needed. But this - what Ed was doing - felt like a direct impact on someone's life and I was excited to be a part of that.""An Idyllic Life No MoreA year ago, Mykola and Olena had a thriving wedding gown business, a new home, a brick-and-mortar storefront, and a website that made their venture a success not only locally, but across international borders.But as they settled in for a long Ukrainian winter, rumors of an impending war were soon replaced by the terrifying Russian invasion, and the kind of naked brutality that Europe hadn't seen since the end of World War II.Air raids became the norm. Idyllic neighborhoods were turned into rubble. Home became an underground shelter that provided a layer of security but did little to stop the winter's chill without electricity and gas. Food became a luxury.As for the business, how do you survive when life has been turned upside down?""We were in danger from the first day,"" Olena said. ""So we sent the kids off to their grandparents. And we began helping make uniforms for our soldiers - many of whom didn't have anything.""Mykola focused on making vests, but where do you find fabric when all the banks are closed, and you can't access your money? They used what they had, and what others scrounged, and sewed from morning through night, often by hand. They had a mission and a vision.But not a future.""We had to get out for our children,"" Olena said.They found Ed and Natalie Cotter. And plans began formulating.Back in Birmingham, Cotter now had an army of volunteers of his own. They began meeting regularly at a public library, creating checklists of things they had to accomplish in addition to raising funds - find schools, jobs, housing. Using WhatsApp, Cotter, Pritchett and Laminack began regularly texting the Vyshyvanyuks, forming a friendship while keeping them informed of progress. By August, there was no turning back.The U.S. was fast-tracking applications, as Uniting for Ukraine was proving to exceed the most optimistic expectations. The family was approved in August. By November, when the Birmingham crew had raised the funds to bring the Vyshyvanyuks to the U.S., the White House had approved more than 100,000 applications.For Mykola, Olena and their children, the first step was to make it across the border to Poland, where they were placed in refugee housing. Immediately, Oleana noticed a difference.""We spent two weeks getting processed in Poland - two weeks without air raids,"" Olena said. ""I knew then we couldn't go back home.""A New Start, A New HomeTwo months ago, they took their final flight to Atlanta, where they were shuttled to Birmingham in a van supplied by Vestavia Methodist Church. They arrived to find a furnished new home, with a refrigerator filled with their favorite foods, children's bedrooms stuffed with toys and two automobiles out front.In the front room, Mykola found a sewing machine to continue his work. And a job at a local wedding boutique. The children were enrolled in school and the family began weekly English as a Second Language (ESL) classes scheduled at another church, Trinity Methodist. When Cotter and Regions associate Tommy McCain went to the local branch to open up a checking account for the family, Kismet followed.""The relationship manager we talked to, Tatsiana Hall, spoke Russian,"" Pritchett recalled. ""At first, we thought that was just a crazy coincidence. But it was more than that.""Hall, who moved to Birmingham from her native Belarus in 2010, agreed.""I said, ‘Let me be your personal banker,'"" Hall said. ""God brought me to you.""This is home and we are safe. My hope is that family and friends can join us here.Olena VyshyvanyukJust before Christmas, Olena received a call that she was needed at Vestavia East Elementary immediately. Fearing the worst, she headed over only to find a room full of Christmas gifts for 13-year-old Eva, 11-year-old Ioanna and 6-year-old Viktoriia the school had gathered for their first holiday in Alabama.The winters in Birmingham are mild and the suburban noises are soothing - a stark contrast to the life they left behind.""This is home,"" Olena said, ""and we are safe. My hope is that family and friends can join us here.""And, for the first time in a year, there is security. Both Mykola and Olena have jobs. They pay taxes. And their children are learning safely in school.What started with a newspaper article and a conversation led to a year of change no one could have imagined prior to war, proving anything is possible. What transpired has forever transformed the Vyshyvanyuks.And the team that came together to provide a new home.""The kids are doing great. They have each other,"" Laminack said. ""They have a support network. And a really good ESL teacher.""When this started, we didn't know who we were looking for, only that we just wanted to help someone. But it turned into a real relationship. We've made friends for life.""View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Regions Bank on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Regions BankWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/regions-bankEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Regions BankView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/740710/What-My-Soul-Needed]"
177,a6ff5d51-b96f-3011-80d6-6c7cf1c8cffe,V,2023-02-25,Investors Shouldn't Overlook Visa's (NYSE:V) Impressive Returns On Capital,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-shouldnt-overlook-visas-nyse-120033948.html,1677326433,STORY,['V'],"[If you're not sure where to start when looking for the next multi-bagger, there are a few key trends you should keep an eye out for. Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. With that in mind, the ROCE of Visa (NYSE:V) looks great, so lets see what the trend can tell us.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Visa is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.31 = US$20b ÷ (US$85b - US$19b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).Thus, Visa has an ROCE of 31%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 12% earned by companies in a similar industry. Check out our latest analysis for Visa roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Visa compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Can We Tell From Visa's ROCE Trend?Visa has not disappointed with their ROCE growth. The figures show that over the last five years, ROCE has grown 44% whilst employing roughly the same amount of capital. Basically the business is generating higher returns from the same amount of capital and that is proof that there are improvements in the company's efficiencies. It's worth looking deeper into this though because while it's great that the business is more efficient, it might also mean that going forward the areas to invest internally for the organic growth are lacking.Story continuesFor the record though, there was a noticeable increase in the company's current liabilities over the period, so we would attribute some of the ROCE growth to that. The current liabilities has increased to 23% of total assets, so the business is now more funded by the likes of its suppliers or short-term creditors. Keep an eye out for future increases because when the ratio of current liabilities to total assets gets particularly high, this can introduce some new risks for the business.The Key TakeawayAs discussed above, Visa appears to be getting more proficient at generating returns since capital employed has remained flat but earnings (before interest and tax) are up. Since the stock has returned a solid 88% to shareholders over the last five years, it's fair to say investors are beginning to recognize these changes. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if Visa can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.One more thing, we've spotted   1 warning sign  facing Visa that you might find interesting.High returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our free list ofstocks earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

The Zacks analyst believes that the company’s near-term prospect looks gloomy due to weakening demand for its chips used in gaming and data center end markets. While the macroeconomic headwinds are impacting gaming and data center chip demand, higher channel inventory levels are hurting chip prices. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war is likely to continue negatively impact NVIDIA’s near-term revenues.Nonetheless, solid uptake of artificial intelligence-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions is likely to aid NVIDIA’s growth. Additionally, collaboration with the likes of Mercedes-Benz and Audi is expected to further strengthen NVIDIA’s presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Visa have outperformed the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry over the past year (+0.9% vs. -6.4%). The Zacks analyst believes that the company’s numerous buyouts and alliances paved the way for long-term growth and consistently drove its revenues. Constant investments in technology are solidifying its position in the payments market. A shift in payments to the digital mode is a boon for Visa.A strong cash position enables it to boost shareholder value. However, high operating expenses stress the margins. Ramped-up client incentives will dent the top line.

The Zacks analyst believes that the shortage of microchips compounded by the Russia-Ukraine war is weighing on Toyota. The Japanese auto giant is also bearing the brunt of soaring raw material prices. Supply-chain disruptions, logistical challenges, and manufacturing inefficiencies are playing spoilsports.Additionally, high inflation, rising interest rates, and an uncertain macro environment also raise concern for Toyota as the auto industry is highly cyclic.

179,6367979c-d07e-3bd8-a858-a4347f4bddff,V,2023-02-25,5 Financial Transaction Stocks to Gain From Rising Digitization,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-financial-transaction-stocks-gain-145402556.html,1677250442,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'V', 'MA', 'GPN', 'EFX']","[The Financial Transaction Services industry is expected to benefit from growing transaction volumes, stemming from improved consumer spending and rebounding cross-border travels. Increased digitization across every sphere of life provides industry players with the perfect ground to capitalize on by leveraging their advanced digital prowess. Continuous pursuit of a merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) strategy coupled with technology investments enables the players to devise a solid digital solutions suite. Companies like Visa Inc. V, Mastercard Incorporated MA, Fiserv, Inc. FISV, Global Payments Inc. GPN and Equifax Inc. EFX are well-placed to gain from the growth prospects of the industry.About the Industry The Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry is part of the Financial Technology or the FinTech space, which includes companies with varying natures of businesses. The industry comprises card and payment processing and other solutions providers, ATM services and money remittance service providers, and providers of investment solutions to financial advisors. The players in this segment operate their unique and proprietary global payments network that links issuers and acquirers around the globe to facilitate the switching of transactions, permitting account holders to use their products at millions of acceptance locations. Monetary transactions are executed through these networks, offering a convenient, quick and secure payment method in several currencies across the globe. The industry is benefiting from the ongoing digitization movement, triggered by the pandemic.4 Trends Defining Future of the Financial Transaction Services IndustryWidespread Uptake of Contactless Payments: One of the most prominent trends noticed since the coronavirus outbreak is people’s inclination toward adopting digital means across every sphere of life. With the cost-effective nature and ease of digital payments, there is no sign of the digital trend fading away anytime soon. Several flexible digital payment options, ranging from buy now, pay later (BNPL) solutions, cryptocurrency, biometrics, to QR code utilization, which consumers were earlier skeptical of, have started gaining popularity. As a result, the financial transaction services industry players have been actively undertaking significant investments for building an upgraded suite and subsequently, attracting new clients as well as retaining the existing ones. Though the investments might result in escalating costs for the industry participants, digital prowess continues to fetch regular revenues and drives their margins in the long term.Story continuesBetter Consumer Spending: Substantial personal savings made during the pandemic enable continued consumer spending despite looming fears of inflation and recession. Strong wage gains resulting from a tight labor market have positively influenced the purchasing power of consumers. The affinity of people to spend more implies increased utilization of product and service offerings of financial transaction service players. This, in turn, boosts transaction volumes that contribute significantly to the revenues of industry participants. According to the 2023 Annual U.S. Economic Outlook issued by one of the digital payments leaders, Visa, consumer spending in the first half of 2023 is expected to remain higher than the 2022 figure and gradually pick up in the latter part of the year.Improved Cross-Border Travel: The receding impact of the pandemic led to the easing of border restrictions and renewed confidence in travel. These factors have led to a recovery in international travel, thus driving cross-border volumes of companies in the financial transaction services space that engage in global money transfers. The industry participants having exposure to the cross-border business leave no stone unturned to devise platforms backed by an interconnected banking network and sound expertise in the seamless processing of digital payments. Amid the ongoing recovery of cross-border travel, these platforms inevitably reap benefits for the players.An Active M&amp;A Strategy: Participants of the financial transaction services space frequently resort to the M&amp;A strategy to upgrade their capabilities in addition to making uninterrupted technology investments. The strategy reflects industry players’ focus on bolstering their customer base, entering new markets and establishing a significant share across the global market. The primary aim behind these deals is to bring about diversification benefits that differentiate an organization from its industry peers. The current year is expected to be exciting, with respect to M&amp;A deals, according to PwC’s Global M&amp;A Industry Trends: 2023 Outlook.Zacks Industry Rank Instills OptimismThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all-member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects.

That seems the way forward for gas bulls after what has, for all intents and purposes, been a “brutal” winter — not in terms of cold but a lack of it.The most-active April gas contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange’s Henry Hub settled Friday’s trade at $2.4510 per mmBtu, or metric million British thermal units, up 1.9 cents, or 0.8%.That was in addition to the previous day’s 5.8% rise that added a little more insulation for the contract from a retest of the $2 support that would open the trapdoor for its plunge again into $1 territory.For the week, Henry Hub’s most-active gas contract rose 4.3%, marking only the second positive week in 10 for futures of the heating oil.March, the front-month contract on the hub, expired at Friday’s close, settling at $2.451. March gas fell to a 2-½-year low of $1.967 on Thursday.The higher close of the past two sessions came after the Energy Information Administration reported that U.S. utilities pulled 71 bcf, or billion cubic feet, from U.S. natural gas storage during the week ended Feb. 17 for power generation and heating.That draw was just slightly above the 67-bcf consumption expected by industry analysts for last week. It also paled when compared to the 100-bcf usage from the prior week to Feb. 10.Yet, it seemed enough for now to keep gas anchored at mid-$2 levels.Also in gas bulls’ corner was improving feed demand for liquefied natural gas with a steady pickup in volumes going into the Freeport LNG terminal in Texas, which has been slowly getting back to normal operations after a fire in June.Freeport had been a rock-solid base of 2 bcf, or billion cubic feet, of gas demand a day until it was knocked out. “Freeport LNG [is] now taking more than 0.6 Bcf/d of feed gas flows onsite,” said Houston-based energy markets advisory Gelber&amp;Associates. “The expectation that demand for LNG exports will increase is helping market bulls find some semblance of footing.”Story continuesLNG feed gas demand is poised to “reach new highs over the next 30-45 days” and could “begin flattening the ballooning natural gas storage surpluses of the past 10 weeks,” EBW analyst Eli Rubin said Thursday in comments carried by naturalgasintel.com.Potentially helping demand as well is the 65% collapse in gas prices since December. The mid-$2 level is a serious incentive for U.S. utilities to use more gas and less coal in their energy mix, said analysts. Rubin himself anticipates that “more than 4 bcf per day of price-induced coal-to-gas switching” could occur.An unusually warm winter has led to considerably less heating demand in the United States this year, leaving more gas in storage than initially thought.For the week ended Feb. 17, U.S. gas inventories stood at a total 2.195 tcf, or trillion cubic feet, up 22% from the year-ago level of 1.8 tcf.Responding to the warmth and lackluster storage draws, gas prices plunged from a 14-year high of $10 per mmBtu in August, reaching $7 in December and $2 levels this week.Related ArticlesNatural gas at mid-$2 as bulls eye higher ground in unhelpful winterAnalysis: Decree adds to doubts about Mexican lithium industry's futureOil bulls turn red week to neutral by clinging onto Russia cuts story]"

The proposed reduction in Russian oil output for next month would be in excess of the 5% production cut announced for February by Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak a couple of weeks ago.Like most news out of Moscow that needs verification, the Reuters report was lacking in proof, with both the Russian energy ministry and oil pipeline monopoly Transneft declining to comment.Pushed against the wall by Ukraine-related sanctions imposed by the West, the Kremlin has come out fighting with statements aimed at striking back at its political foes while upholding its sovereignty as well as the prices of its main export oil, which has been battered by a $60 selling limit imposed by the G7. Often, however, the Kremlin’s statements have been more bravado than action.Russia normally exports up to 10M tonnes a month or 2.5M barrels per day of Urals crude from the ports of Primorsk, Ust-Luga and Novorossiysk. A cut of 25% would represent as much as 625,000 bpd if confirmed by Transneft and agreed to by oil companies, said Reuters which cited anonymous sources for its report.Despite the lack of authoritative sourcing, the story was enough to help crude prices rise 2% on the day, recovering a large part of Wednesday's 3% tumble.New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude for April delivery settled up $1.44, or 2%, at $ 75.359 per barrel. It fell 3.4% in the prior session.Story continuesBrent for April delivery settled up $1.61, or 2%, at $82.21. Like WTI, Brent also fell 3% a day ago.Crude inventories gained 7.648M barrels during the week ended Feb. 17, the EIA said in its Weekly Petroleum Status Report. That extended the prior week's outsized build of 16.283M barrels, which was the fourth largest ever in the history of the agency’s reporting.In total, some 850.6M barrels were stockpiled at the end of last week and of that, around 60M, or 7%, were built over eight straight weeks, beginning from the week ended Jan. 3.For last week itself, industry analysts had forecast a build of 2.083M barrels on the average. The EIA reported almost three times that numberThe climb in crude inventories comes amid seasonal maintenance and other disruptions at U.S. refineries that foresaw less processing of crude.The EIA said U.S. crude oil refinery inputs averaged 15M barrels per day last week, which was 17,000 barrels per day less than the previous week’s average.Refineries operated at 85.9% of their operable capacity last week, the agency added.

Let’s face it – the industrial segment isn’t the most exciting sector out there. However, it’s one of the most dependable because of its extraordinary relevance, particularly to infrastructure. In addition, recent dynamics bolster the case for dividend-paying industrial stocks. First, the passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal – the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act – bodes well for the wider sector. Second, companies providing passive income tend to perform better than non-dividend payers during bearish cycles.Third, investors may prefer stability over outright capital gains potential. For this list of intriguing ideas, they’re all objectively undervalued relative to trailing-12-month earnings. This way, you’re also getting a potentially great deal. With that, below are dividend-paying industrial stocks to buy for 2023.EMREmerson Electric$82.05GICGlobal Industrial$28.04SNASnap-on$246.01CVRChicago Rivet &amp; Machine$29.76BGSFBGSF.$15.28EBFEnnis$21.33CIXCompX International$15.54InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsEmerson Electric (EMR)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comBased in Missouri, Emerson Electric (NYSE:EMR) manufactures products and provides engineering services for industrial, commercial, and consumer markets. Per its public profile, Emerson features approximately 170 manufacturing locations. To be fair, Emerson represents a riskier take among dividend-paying industrial stocks because of its recent poor quarterly earnings report. As well, the company suffered from lingering supply chain disruptions.Still, in the long run, Emerson plays a significant role in the global automation market. Further, with the fallout in the charts, contrarian investors may sense an opportunity. Right now, the market prices EMR at a trailing multiple of 10.84. As a discount to earnings, Emerson ranks better than 76.41% of the competition.Story continuesOn the passive income side, the company features a forward yield of 2.43%. While that’s only a bit above the industrial sector’s average yield of 2.36%, keep this in mind: Emerson commands 66 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg EMR as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $101.57, implying nearly 19% upside potential.Global Industrial (GIC)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large textSource: iQoncept/shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Port Washington, New York, Global Industrial (NYSE:GIC) is a provider of industrial and maintenance, repair, and operations products through a system of branded e-commerce websites and relationship marketers in North America. In the year so far, GIC is off to a blistering start, gaining over 22% of equity value. However, in the trailing year, it’s down a bit more than 3%.Even with the recent momentum, GIC may attract speculators of dividend-paying industrial stocks. For one thing, the market prices GIC at a trailing multiple of 10.21. As a discount to earnings, Global Industrial outpaces 62.5% of its rivals. Also, its price-earnings-growth ratio sits at 0.39 times. In contrast, the sector median value is 1.34 times. In terms of passive income, the company carries a forward yield of 2.48%. While this sits a bit on the lower side of the spectrum, the payout ratio pings at 32.14%. This implies a dependable yield, giving prospective investors tremendous confidence.Snap-on (SNA)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockA designer, manufacturer, and marketer of high-end tools and equipment, Snap-on (NYSE:SNA) represents a significant background player in various industries. These include automotive, heavy-duty, equipment, marine, aviation, and railroad sectors. Since the January opener, SNA gained 10% of its equity value. Further, it’s been on a positive run in the past 365 days, moving up nearly 21%.Given its relevancies, SNA may continue marching higher. Despite its strengths and momentum, contrarian investors will appreciate its undervalued status. Right now, the market prices SNA at a trailing multiple of 15. As a discount to earnings, Snap-on ranks above 64.68% of the competition. Also, shares trade hands at 15.15-times forward earnings. For this metric, the company ranks better than 67.6% of its peers.Regarding passive income, Snap-on carries a forward yield of 2.57%. Notably, the company commands 13 years of consecutive dividend increases. As well, its payout ratio sits at 36.41%, implying a very dependable dividend. Therefore, SNA ranks among the top dividend-paying industrial stocks to buy.Chicago Rivet &amp; Machine (CVR)7 Safe Dividend Stocks for Investors to Buy Right NowSource: ShutterstockBased in Illinois, Chicago Rivet &amp; Machine (NYSEAMERICAN:CVR) manufactures mechanical, pneumatic, and hydraulic riveting equipment for numerous industries. Again, it’s one of the unsung heroes of dividend-paying industrial stocks. You might not know the brand name but Chicago Rivet is incredibly pertinent and relevant. As evidence, CVR gained more than 6% in the trailing year. In contrast, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index fell more than 5% during the same period.Financially, contrarian investors will take a liking to CVR. Presently, the market prices shares at a trailing multiple of 6.56. As a discount to earnings, Chicago Rivet ranks better than nearly 92% of sector peers. As well, CVR trades at 0.81 times sales. In contrast, the sector price-sales ratio stands at 1.53 times. Finally, the company benefits from outstanding stability in the balance sheet, particularly because it has no debt. On the passive income front, Chicago Rivet carries a forward yield of 3.04%. This is notably higher than the industrial sector’s average yield of 2.36%.BGSF (BGSF)dividend stocks: A calculator projecting the word ""DIVIDEND"" rests on a pile of gold and silver coins.Source: ShutterstockBased in Plano, Texas, BGSF (NYSE:BGSF) is a company that in my opinion does a poor job of explaining what it does, choosing instead to bury its website visitors with a barrage of jargon and lexicon. However, its LinkedIn profile states that it’s a nationwide leader in strategic workforce solutions. Primarily, its services focus on technical industries, such as IT and cybersecurity. It also provides opportunities in the commercial sector.Financially, BGSF creates an exciting opportunity for bargain hunters. Right now, the market prices BGSF at a trailing multiple of 5.53. As a discount to earnings, BGSF ranks better than nearly 91% of the competition. Also, shares trade at a forward multiple of 10.99. Relative to this particular metric, the company ranks above 70.39% of the underlying sector.At the moment, the company carries a forward yield of 3.94%. To be fair, BGSF only features two years of consecutive dividend increases. However, its payout ratio of 43.32% rates fairly low. Therefore, it stands among the dividend-paying industrial stocks to buy.Ennis (EBF)The word ""dividend"" highlighted in a dictionary.Source: ShutterstockBilled as a print solutions company, Ennis (NYSE:EBF) presently suffers from an incomplete website (if you go to its “About Us” section). However, Ennis tells you right off the bat what it does, which investors and analysts appreciate. The company provides printing capabilities to support various business needs, including branded presentation folders, envelopes, and labels. Further, it’s a surprisingly relevant endeavor. In the trailing year, EBF gained over 16% of equity value.For those seeking a discounted idea among dividend-paying industrial stocks, Ennis could be intriguing. Right now, the market prices EBF at a trailing multiple of 13.38. As a discount to earnings, Ennis ranks better than 68.59% of the competition. Also, shares trade at 12.58 times free cash flow. Regarding this particular metric, the company outpaces nearly 71% of its peers.Also, it’s worth noting that Ennis enjoys an excellent balance sheet, particularly its cash-to-debt ratio of 6.16 times. Also, its Altman Z-Score of 8 indicates a very low bankruptcy risk. Finally, EBF carries a forward yield of 4.61%. To be fair, its payout ratio stands at 65.36%, which is a bit on the high side. Nevertheless, Ennis’ total profile makes it one of the dividend-paying industrial stocks to buy.CompX International (CIX)Glass jar of coins marked ""dividends"" to represent dividend stocks. stocks with dividendsSource: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Dallas, Texas, CompX International (NYSEAMERICAN:CIX) is a diversified domestic manufacturer of engineered, quality components providing critical functionality to its customers’ products. In the trailing year, CIX declined by 15%, making it one of the riskier dividend-paying industrial stocks. However, it’s attempting to make a reversal, with shares up 7% since the January opener.Despite the wobbles, CIX will likely attract contrarian investors. For one thing, the market prices CIX at a trailing multiple of 12.43. As a discount to earnings, CompX ranks better than 65% of its rivals. Also, Gurufocus.com’s discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis implies that CIX is significantly undervalued. Per the analysis, the fair value of CIX should be $41.46. However, shares closed the Feb. 17 session at $19.26.Also, the company enjoys operational strengths, with above sector-median values for revenue growth and net margin. As well, CompX commands a stable balance sheet, benefitting from zero debt. Finally, the company features a forward yield of 5.19%. That’s well above the industrial sector’s average, making it one of the top dividend-paying industrial stocks to buy.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

We delivered solid financial performance in Q4, we came in, in the middle of our guidance on all metrics, while adjusted EBITDA was slightly ahead. For the full year 2022, we achieved $569.6 million of ex-TAC, $156.7 million of adjusted EBITDA and positive free cash flow. Overall, 2022 was a challenging year, but also a year of significant accomplishments. I'm very proud of our team at Taboola and the way we're able to manage through the macro environment, keep our heads down and execute. 2022 was the second best year we've had for selling new publisher partnerships with over 90% higher new revenue per month than 2020 and 2021. We won a lot. Great new publisher partners joined us such as Condense Baske, Japan, African Post, Paris Grupo Gouda, networking team, United Internet Media and Dumont. We won back publishers that had previously left us, such as Slate, Kicker, West fans and more. We send key renewals such as CBSi, TEGNA, Fox Sports and -- but feed Brazil. As you recall, our strategy is twofold. We're going to be recommending anything users may like, content, commerce, overtime apps, TV shows and more. We call that Taboola Anything. The second part of our strategy is called Taboola Anywhere, which is taking our publisher content, technology and advertisers anywhere people spend their time on OEM devices like Samsung and Xiaomi as an example. But over time, we want to bring our content to automobiles, home audio devices and more. On the Taboola Anywhere Front. 2022 was a year when Taboola News, our version of Apple News, but for Android devices exceeded $50 million in annual revenue and its growing triple digits. We like that type of growth as well as the strategic value it has to our overall core business as publishers are getting more and more traffic from Taboola News. As part of our Taboola editing strategy, e-commerce gained meaningful momentum with dynamic creative optimization, DCO, rolling out, which is the main advertiser success stories for companies like Snap and Meta. Additionally, we recently announced that time.com will be launching a new Taboola Turnkey Commerce Solution, which I will talk about later. We finished the year with an incredible 30-year partnership with Yahoo. This is a 3-way partnership. It includes Yahoo advertisers buying Taboola Network. It includes building new contextual segments; and lastly, powering native advertising exclusively for nearly 900 million users a month. This is really big. 2023 is assumed to be pre Yahoo -- rollout, while 2024 will have partial Yahoo contribution and meaningful gains. In 2023, we're guiding for 6% lower ex-TAC compared to 2022, adjusted EBITDA of $70 million and positive free cash flow. The 4 reasons for the weaker year-over-year results. First, Q1 and H1 of 2022 were uniquely strong as compared to how we ended 2022 due to the war in Europe and macroeconomics hitting the U.S. As part of that, we're entering 2023 with $50 million less ex-TAC on a run rate basis than 2022. We expect to return to year-over-year growth in Q3 and Q4 as we lap hard comparables from 202 to H1.Second, we're investing in successful Yahoo transition, which will cost us roughly $30 million this year, and it includes people servers and infrastructure. Third, we're investing in performance advertising, e-commerce and header bidding. We believe these 3 growth investments will help us double and triple table revenue when Yahoo! -- launches. And fourth, winning market share over time includes a net publisher prepayment estimate of $50 million this year. Like I mentioned last quarter, we've seen net prepayments to publishers being insignificant to none over time as we continue to become even more and more strategic to the entire publisher organization. So you should assume this is not a permanent part of our financial model. Let me say that while it's hard to accept declines this year, it's very rare that management teams know what the future will look like and are willing to guide for it. 2024 will be a step change in revenue with Yahoo -- ramping. We expect to generate at least in adjusted EBITDA and at least $100 million of free cash flow in 2024. And to be conservative, this assumes Yahoo is only being live by June of 2024 and no revenue in 2023.Obviously, we're working very hard to beat those assumptions we're showing with you right now. That's how we refer to 2023 as an investment tier. We're putting in meaningful resources this year for gains. We feel strong year coming next year and beyond. Taking a step back, especially with Google and Mena now being less than 50% of the ad market and privacy concerns on the rise, advertisers will be looking for contextual advertising partners with scale with the Yahoo partnership were one step further towards our long-term goal of becoming the largest open web advertising company in the world by revenue. We estimate that we will have roughly $2.5 billion of revenue in 2022, if Yahoo has been live on our network throughout the year, and we were fully integrated. That's will put us side-by-side to companies that TitterSnap, interest and -- the Trade Desk with many Google and Meta and Amazon much bigger than us. And Taboola is the only company, to my knowledge, at our size that is fully dedicated to the Open Web serving both publishers and advertisers directly. I'm convinced that the Open Web will have a walled garden strong company that is going after our estimated $70 billion TAM, and we believe we're making meaningful steps towards becoming that vision with Yahoo launching as well as our growth engines materializing. Now let me provide a brief update on those growth engines, performance advertising, e-commerce and headed. These are where we have the most to gain as a company to further drive growth in years to come. Our goal with our investment in performance advertising is to make Taboola the first and best choice for any performance advertisers that want to reach consumers in the open web. We're currently focusing our investments in 4 key areas. First, we're working on our bidding strategies that will help advertisers with different goals to be successful on our network. Previously, we had shared our smart bid automates the bidding process for our advertising partners. Now we're working on enhancement to Smartbad that will allow advertisers to do things like set a target CPA and a lot of algorithms to even set the initial bid rather than just adjust the beta across the network as Smart Bid did previously or to maximize conversion even at the expense of CPA targets. Now second, we're working on a new way of finding high-intent nuggets of very specific audiences in our supply. Third, we're investing in new ways to help advertisers drive clicks and conversions such as the new creative formats and enhanced landing pages. For instance, we're currently working on generative artificial intelligence that will help advertisers write more creative and appealing headlines and even generate new images from scratch. If you can, please come to see our demo of this amazing general AI technology at our Yahoo Deal information session on March 1. It's really cool stuff. Fourth, we're investing in technologies that will be smaller about how to match ads with users and especially how we ensure that advertisers see results as quickly as possible. I just came back from a trip to Israel during which I spent time with our R&amp;D teams working on this. And I have to tell you, I was blown away about how passionate our 200-person tech team strong is and about the future of Taboola advertising platform. We have so much more that we can do. We continue to see good progress with our investment in e-commerce as well. I mentioned the momentum we're seeing with DCO, essentially connected retailers automatically place their products libraries on our network. It has allowed us to significantly grow the amount of e-commerce demand that shows up in our traditional Taboola placements such as in the bottom of article feeds. We recently launched e-commerce circulation widgets to help drive users to commerce pages, which helps our publishers drive traffic from general news pages to high-intent commerce pages. We also just announced an exciting new initiative in e-commerce that we call Taboola turnkey e-commerce. This was the missing link to take our e-commerce business to the next level, every publisher that wants to get into e-commerce but has little or no content attractive to retailers can now do that with Taboola. Taboola does all of the work for the publisher from using our data to know which content makes sense for us to write on behalf of the publisher. We write the content, we drive traffic to it. We monetize it with the relationships we have with the merchants and service providers. And I got to tell you, we're very, very excited to have announced our 2 publisher partners with this initiative, time and advanced publications through their NJ.com site. I don't know if any other full stack e-commerce solution that can do any of what I just talked about. Now while it's all new for us, I can tell you, publishers are calling us about this left and right. Look, everyone wants a New York Times water cutter service on their website, and we will enable it. Last but not least, we're investing heavily in header bidding. This is important to our future because this is one of the ways that we will expand beyond our traditional bottom vertical placement and continue to grow our share of the Open Web, which is still dominated by display ads. Heading allows us to compete for this supply using our first-party data, our unique CPC demand and our proprietary technology that is able to predict which ads are likely to perform well, generate a profitable CPM-based bid.We launched this technology with our first partner, Microsoft in April of 2022, and we're generating hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue from this partnership. Since then, we have started better testing this technology with an additional 50-plus publisher partners, and we're starting to see traction. For the first time, we're starting to see a few publishers generating a few millions of dollars a year from it on top of our core Taboola partnership, which increases our share of wallet and our moat as we look to win new partnerships and expand existing partnerships.2023 will be the year of investment in our 30-year partnership to be an exclusive native advertising partner for Yahoo! This is big for us, big for Yahoo, and I think big for the advertising community. It will be very creative for our financials. As I shared publicly, if this was live in 2022, it would have multiplied our free cash flow 5x to north of $100 million of free cash flow and add $150 million of adjusted EBITDA. We are full on in planning mode and 2023 will require a lot of work and investment to make it a successful transition. Just think about thousands of advertisers transitioning many page types, infrastructure and more. We expect the transition to occur in 3 phases: currently Phase 0, we are designing the technology migration plan. You can think of this phase as designing the plumbing system between the 2 platforms. So when completed, advertisers and -- no platform can spend in Taboola supply and advertisers on Taboola platform can span on Yahoo supply. Soon, we will move to Phase 1 of the migration in which we will build the plumbing system and test the pipes by starting to flow small amounts of demand between the platforms, move some of supply and transition a small number of advertisers to test their experience. We expect Phase 1 to be completed in the second half of 2023. Once we validate the pipe and our transition plans, Phase 2 will begin and will involve transitioning the advertisers and supply from Yahoo -- to Taboola. At that point, the migration will mostly be blocking and tackling, but we will need to be thoughtful in the process because we want every advertiser making a transition to have a great experience and to thrive and grow on the Taboola platform. We do not want to trade long-term gains for short-term revenue. We expect Phase 2 to begin in the second half of 2023 and be completed mid-2024. At which point, we will be fully ramped and we'll be able to focus on additional growth opportunities from our partnership with Yahoo. We're building our rocket this year and 2024, where we have leased off. We will become bigger and more competitive, and I was never as excited about where we are as a company and our future. I'll now pass it over to Steve, our CFO, to talk more about our financials.Stephen WalkerThanks, Adam, and good morning, everyone. As Adam noted, our Q4 and full year 2022 results were within our guidance ranges. All metrics were above the midpoint of our guidance, except ex-TAC gross profit, which came in just below our midpoint. For the full year, we finished 2022 with approximately $1.4 billion in revenue, $570 million in ex-TAC gross profit and $157 million in adjusted EBITDA. We had a net loss of $12 million and non-GAAP net income of $91.4 million. We also generated positive free cash flow for the year, generating $18.6 million of cash despite the challenging macroeconomic conditions. I would note that 2022 was a banner year for us on the supply side of our business. On average, in 2022, we brought in over 90% more new digital property partner revenue per month than we averaged in 2020 and 2021. Our churn rates for our digital property partners were also at historically low levels. In addition, we gained valuable new supply from Taboola News as we grew that business to over $50 million in revenue in 2022. For the quarter, our Q4 revenues were approximately $371 million. Our ex-TAC gross profit $159 million, our net income $15.2 million and our non-GAAP net income, $43.3 million. Ex-TAC gross profit declined approximately 6% year-over-year, which included a drag of almost 5% from foreign currency exchange rate headwinds. Revenues were aided by the addition of approximately $35 million of new digital property partners, but were decreased by approximately $71 million decline in our existing digital property partners. The decline in our existing digital property partners, which is a very unusual occurrence for us was caused by the global macroeconomic weakness and the resulting reductions in advertising budgets by many of our advertising partners.Operating expenses were down around $17 million year-over-year. This decrease was primarily the result of our focus on cost reductions that started with decreased discretionary spending around midyear and continue with our cost restructuring program announced in Q3. We generated adjusted EBITDA of $63.5 million in the quarter and approximately $157 million for the full year, both of which were in line with our expectations. GAAP net income for the quarter of $15.2 million for Q4 and our GAAP net loss of $12 million for the full year included intangibles of $16 million for the quarter and $64 million for the year. Share-based compensation expenses, excluding the holdback related to the Connect acquisition were $13 million for the quarter and $64 million for the full year and restructuring charges of $3 million for the full year, which were excluded from non-GAAP net income. Our non-GAAP net income of approximately $43 million for the quarter and approximately $91 million for the full year were both above the high end of our guidance ranges. In terms of cash generation, we had approximately $20 million in operating cash flow in Q4 and approximately $53 million for the full year, with free cash flow of around $14 million for the quarter and $19 million for the full year. That free cash flow was after net publisher prepayments of $3 million in Q4 and $15 million for the full year as well as $6 million of interest payments on our long-term debt in the quarter and $21 million for the full year. I would also note that the combined balance of our cash and cash equivalents plus our short-term investments declined from approximately $319 million at the end of 2021 to approximately $263 million at the end of 2022. The decline is more than fully explained by our decision to repay approximately $61 million of our long-term debt. We decided to do this in Q4 because of rising interest rates. We have historically kept a relatively large amount of cash on our balance sheet in order to maintain operating flexibility in case certain opportunities came along that required large amounts of cash on short notice. For instance, the acquisition of a distressed asset or a large publisher win that would necessitate a large upfront prepayment. You could think of the upside of this policy as maintaining option value. However, as the cost of maintaining this option has risen with rising interest rates and given the fact that we now have a revolving credit facility to draw upon as well, we decided to pay down some of our long-term debt. We expect to retire $30 million to $40 million more of the debt in 2024. Now let me shift to our forward-looking guidance. I should note that our guidance assumes continued weakness in the macro environment at current levels for the rest of 2023, but not a significant worsening of the macro environment. As I mentioned earlier, the decline in our year-over-year revenues and ex-TAC was the result of macroeconomic softness that started in Europe at the end of Q1 and spread to the U.S. and most of the rest of the world at the end of Q2. We had relatively normal seasonality in Q4, so that softness did not worsen -- but it does mean that we entered 2023 at a much lower run rate than we had starting 2022. The way to see this is to look at our Q3 2022 numbers. Historically, Q3 contributes almost exactly 25% of our ex-TAC in a given calendar year. So if you multiply our Q3 ex TAC by 4, that's a good estimate of our run rate entering the subsequent year. In Q3 2022, we had $129.3 million of ex TAC, which means we entered 2023 with a run rate of around $517 million, over $50 million lower than our 2022 full year numbers. This lower run rate of $517 million was the starting point for our 2023 projections. After applying our expected growth, we are guiding to full year revenues of $1.42 billion to $1.47 billion and ex-TAC of $526 million to $546 million. This guidance does not currently include revenues or ex-TAC from Yahoo. We have chosen not to include Yahoo -- revenues or ex TAC in our guidance because we have not finalized our planning process, and therefore, it is too early to accurately forecast when we should start seeing the revenue from that partnership. We will update as we progress through the year and have better visibility into that. To that point, this year will be a significant investment year for us. We did factor in almost $30 million of costs related to Yahoo into our guidance. These expenditures will be required to support the transition of the Yahoo supply and advertiser relationships onto our platform. In addition, we recently announced an initiative called Taboola Turnkey Commerce with time as our initial partner. We believe this initiative will generate significant returns over time and meaningfully increase the growth rate of our e-commerce initiatives. We will invest $5 million to $10 million in this initiative in 2023. These investments in Yahoo -- and Turnkey commerce are on top of the investments that we are making in our other top company priorities of performance advertising, header bidding and other e-commerce initiatives. After the impact of these investments, we are guiding to $60 million to $80 million of adjusted EBITDA and a non-GAAP net income range of negative $10 million to positive $10 million. Let me finish by saying that we are very confident that all of these investments will begin to pay off in 2024 and will continue to drive growth beyond next year. Adam has said many times internally that we are in a very unique position right now because it is rare for a company to have such a clear picture of what the future looks like, and I agree with them. It is because of that confidence that we are comfortable guiding to adjusted EBITDA in 2024 of over $200 million and free cash flow of over $100 million. It is also important to note that 2024 will still only be a partial year for Yahoo! -- as that business will not be fully transitioned until mid-2024. Please come to our Yahoo Deal information session on March 1 to hear more about what you can expect from that partnership. You can register on our investor website under the Events tab or by sending an e-mail to investors@tabula.com. And with that, let's open it up to questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) -- And our first question coming from the line of Andrew Boone with JMP Securities.Andrew M. BooneI want to touch on the 2023 guide. The Yahoo Deal is closed and they've announced the closure of Gemini. Can you help us understand what Yahoo is doing currently and how we think about the guide for 2023 and the incorporation of the Yahoo and then, Adam, what do you need to do to get advertising demand going again? What are you most excited about that can push yield in 2023? And then just one last clarification question for Steve. Just can you talk about the timing of the pay down of debt? And anything else to highlight there?Adam SingoldaYes. So let me start with the 2023 guide. So I think the way to think about our 2023 guidance is that we're entering the year with a lower run rate than we had even entering 2022. And that's basically the macroeconomic effect and the decrease in yield. So our Q3 and Q4 were softer than they were in 2022. We also had some supply shock in that we added so much supply this year that with the softness of demand on the macro, that also affected our run rate entering the new year. So I think those things basically starts us off at a lower base. We do expect to grow off of that base this year, but it's going to be lower growth overall due to the lower starting point. On the cost side, I would say it's an investment year for us. So we are going to invest in performance advertising, e-commerce and header bidding, which we've been investing in up until this point. We decided to continue investing there because we think those are investments that will pay off in the short term. And then obviously, there's Yahoo, which for now, what we've assumed in our guidance for Yahoo -- is that we will -- we've put the cost in. So we've assumed that we'll have to hire the people that we need to support that, to build the pipes, connect the systems and everything else. But because we don't have good visibility yet into exactly when we'll start migrating advertisers and bringing the supply over, we chose to just exclude the revenue from our guide. So it's about a $30 million cost hit, but with no associated revenue just because we're trying to be conservative and trying to avoid adding guidance for something that we don't have clear visibility to. So that's how to think about our guidance for this year. What we will say is, and it's obviously very unusual that a company would guide for 2024, we're confident enough in these investments that we believe we were confident to guide to 2024 for $200 million plus of adjusted EBITDA and over $100 million of free cash flow. So we expect them to be -- we're not talking about investments that will pay off 5 years from now. These are things that we'll see returns starting in 2024, which is right around the corner.And by the way, thank you for the clarification question on the debt. I realized as I was listening to that, that I said 2020 that we would repay $30 million to $40 million of debt in 2024. I meant 2023. See, I'm already in 2024. So -- but yes, so we'll actually be looking to repay $30 million to $40 million of debt this year, not next year.Stephen WalkerAnd I can jump Andrew, and thanks for the question about smart bed and what excites us on the advertising front. I just had come back from Israel, and I spent a week with an engineering team. We have about 200 people now working on advertiser success, specifically on the performance side. And I came back uniquely excited just to see in all the good work that our people are doing. I would say what -- if I were to summarize 2023 kind of one theme that you should expect and just this last week, we launched something to GA to about 80% of our advertisers. It's about building strategies. So up until now, SmartBid was more of a, we call it, like autonomous car in the sense that advertisers could go to Smart bid to kind of put an initial CPC and smart bit will change the CPC based on conversion. As of now, advertisers can go to Taboola and actually also lean in and say what is the objective to try to achieve as an example with the target CPA. So just this past week, we brought it to market that advertisers can say, or CPI is $50 or $30, that's how much my product is cost. And SmartBid will optimize using AI to that specific CPA. And that's a big deal. That's been a lot of hard work for us. And later this year, you should expect us to roll out things like target throw us, maximize revenue. So advertisers can really work with much closely as it relates to their goals, and we'll use AI to do it for them. So that's going to be a lot of our efforts this year...OperatorAnd our next question coming from the line of James Kopelman with Cowen...James McGee KopelmanCould you provide some additional color on ad market trends into February and particularly what you're seeing on a region-by-region basis? Also, can you talk about how much conservatism is baked into your outlook in case we end up with any soft landing in the economy? And finally, maybe any color you could provide on which ad verticals were weaker versus stronger in 4Q and into 2023. And then I have a quick follow-up for Adam.Adam SingoldaSo let me start with the advertising market trends and the conservatism in the guide. So first of all, in terms of the advertising market, what we saw, and I heard a lot of companies talk about this. So I think what we saw is similar. We saw a relatively normal fourth quarter in terms of seasonality for us, which is, I think, why we were kind of right in the middle of our guidance range, but with a bit of a soft December. So the year, it almost seemed like advertisers kind of made their goals and then they started pairing things back in December. It's actually similar to what we saw last year. Interestingly for us, Connexity was the exception to that. So e-commerce revenues continue to be strong through the end of the year. So that's generally what we saw at the end of last year. Heading into this year, it's kind of -- again, it's been relatively normal seasonality as we've started. So we haven't seen any acceleration of the softness or any sort of significant changes there. Regionally, it's same thing. Like we haven't seen EMEA or Europe or the U.S. or any other particular region be particularly different than the others. Everything is looking kind of like normal seasonality to us. But again, off of a lower base that was set up by cuts in budgets earlier last year. So that's kind of what we're seeing. In terms of our guide and conservatism in the guide, what we're assuming right now is that continued trend. So things don't get significantly worse, but we also don't see a recovery. I think the bull case for us is definitely that a recovery happens. And we believe that because of the great supply that we brought on in 2022 that in a recovery, we'll see an outsized period of growth as we're able to kind of overcome the -- what I referenced earlier as supply shock, bringing on too much supply, not having enough demand for it, we should see a faster than normal growth rate as we -- as the demand catches up with the supply in a recovery. Obviously, the bear case would be -- the macro economy gets significantly worse and advertising budgets are cut again. But I think generally for now, we've assumed that things stay as is, which is still soft, but not what it's been. And I apologize, we kind of missed your third question. Can you repeat that?James McGee KopelmanYes, sure. I was just curious if you had any advertising verticals that you would call out as being either weaker versus stronger in 4Q and into 2023?Stephen WalkerI think one vertical that was stronger was on e-commerce. So I think Stephen mentioned that towards the end of the year and even December specifically, we've seen e-commerce being stronger than usual, specifically with Connexity DCO, which is -- which has been a good momentum throughout the year was retailers that we're able to find success on our core Taboola supply. That means that their products were able to find good conversion on traditional publishers' news and other types of content on a typical network. So that's been a source of strength. -- and then more recent with the launch of turnkey e-commerce as we're rolling out high-intent content and product review for publishers we announced with time.com and Anje.com, which was in my letter, that content actually increases the quality supply that retailers want. So this has been another source of strength. And I expect this to be a growing momentum for Taboola as we continue to grow the content that publishers have that retailers want to be attached to.James McGee KopelmanGreat. And then just a follow-up, if that's all right. I wonder, Adam, if you could just talk about the progress at Taboola News. Will there be any new partners to call out? Is it still growing at 100%? And how should we think about the size of the business 12 to 18 months from now?Adam Singoldaquarterly business reviews in Q4 where publishers showed us that Taboola News is becoming 5% to 10% of their traffic in different regions, which is unbelievable if you think about the power of ASCO and social traffic and how much publishers rely on that. So that was a great synergy between Taboola News to our core business. So that's great news. We have great partnership with Xiaomi and Samsung and others, you should stay tuned for some new formats that we're launching. You can imagine video and commerce and other things that we do on our traditional publishers that we've yet to be doing with OEMs. So I suspect there's a lot of vertical growth with our existing OEMs that we can do more with them and increase the ARPU that we generate for consumer. So I'm excited also, it's still a small business overall, right? We announced that while it's a start-up, organic startup, we started at Taboola, it cost the $50 million in revenue last year, similar margins to our overall business and expect this to be a triple-digit business. We haven't given specific numbers, but I did actually comfortable saying that this will become north of $100 million visits within the foreseen future.OperatorAnd our next question coming from the line of Laura Martin with Neha Company.Laura Anne MartinA couple of things. Could you give us an update on what's going on with your video ad units and revenue? And also you've been trying to move upmarket, like up the page because you talk about high impact ad units and how that's going. And then in terms of spending, I'm just -- Adam, I'm really struck by the fact that we just keep adding sort of new tests and new cost centers. So e-commerce, we had e-commerce, and we're doing news and now we're doing Yahoo -- and now we're adding. So I just feel like we keep adding sort of engineers and costs, and there's just a lot of complexity. Over the last 24 months, I feel like complexity has doubled or tripled in terms of all the things you're trying to accomplish because you talk about managing that all of those various initiatives and how you think about return on invested capital? Because it sort of things it feels like some of these will be better allocated more and maybe cutting off some of these. So can you just talk about that for us?Adam SingoldaLaura, -- these are 2 very good questions. So let me start with the video one. What we've been doing over the last 3 to 6 months as part of kind of like lifetime value approach with publishers to help them drive the maximum amount of value from consumers coming to their site because some consumers love videos, some don't, some like e-commerce, some don't. So more and more, we're trying to think holistically about our publisher partnerships as like in amazon.com, where by different people have different lifetime value and optimize for the long relationships publishers have with users. And video plays a big part in that because some people really like it, but while others don't. So what we've done is we've kind of consolidated our recommendation units to sort of, we call it recommendation reels, which could include videos in them. So many of our publishers now on their homepages and mid-article, especially with the growth of the home pitch for you, which gained a lot of momentum. I mean it's such an amazing product to put AI on your homepage. It comes with video recommendations. So it has been a very good source of strength for us. I think, obviously, with brand advertising being softer in performance advertising in 2022, it's more of a supply opportunity into the future where that's going to come back. But we do see publishers integrate our video units more and more, specifically on homepages, mid-article and our traditional feeds. So I like it. But what I like the most is how we're consolidating all of these formats into a single recommendation unit that could, to some users appear as a video and to other people that appears the e-commerce recommendation. And that's what publishers buy from Taboola. -- they buy sort of a holistic lifetime value personalization engine versus the widget or placement. So video is becoming more and more just a holistic part of our recommendation vision. And we have seen a lot of growth, specifically with HomeBridge for you, which is it comes with a high impact placement like you mentioned. About the second question, when it relates to just our investment policy, let me say a few things. So one, I think now it's healthy for companies and for Taboola to be free cash flow -- positive free cash flow, which is very important to us. So whether that's in a dawmarket or upmarket, it's something we, as a management team and as a Board, pay a lot of attention to. So that's -- as you can see in 2023, while investing significantly in Yahoo -- and other things, which will pay a huge dividend for investor community and ourselves in 2024, we're free cash flow positive with a healthy EBITDA. Now specifically, the way we think about our investments, this is a great opportunity for us. We have an amazing publisher network and a lot of momentum that has grown in 2022. I see an amazing upside. I mean I can't express what I think will happen if we get performance advertising to be stronger or e-commerce to succeed even more or head butting each one of them can turn into hundreds of millions of dollars or over $1 billion in revenue for Taboola and will make us stronger. So I think we're working on the right stuff, 3 things that I mentioned again and again, and obviously, Yahoo!, which is very accretive to investors and going to make us even stronger. So specifically about turnkey, which we're adding this year, I feel that this was the missing piece to make e-commerce everything we wish it is or will become because many publisher partners came to us and said, ""We love to become bigger in retail and e-commerce revenue, but they don't have the content. So they look at the New York Times with (inaudible), they look at USA today with review.com, but they don't have the deter team, they don't have the data and they don't have the ability to get in the business. So there's chasm they want to cross, but they can't do it. So we said, we have the data, let's build the team, create the content for them, enjoy the authority they have with SEO and consumers and make this a big, big business. I can tell you, by the way, from what I'm seeing so far, publishers, I mentioned time.com, that are getting into turnkey e-commerce. The model for that business in e-commerce overall for publishers very relevant for them is 5 to 10x our core to boiler business. So if I look at how I started Taboola, bottom of article feeds and of advertising, and I compare that to publishers who will get into the e-commerce business, we can grow that relationship very, very significantly. And then it's a bigger share of wallet. It will be much harder to fight with Taboola, better margins over time, even better margins. So I think it's worth it. And on the other side of between 24, you saw what we feel comfortable to guide. And I think we're being fairly conservative. So hopefully, we'll be able to bid this and grow it.OperatorAnd our next question coming from the line of Steven Ju with Credit Suisse.Stephen D. JuOkay. So Adam, on your prepared remarks, I think you talked about what sounds like an improved matching algorithm to stick the right ad in front of the right user at the right time. So I guess it's early, but is there any color you can share in terms of the greater accuracy you may be driving in some of the testing there?Stephen WalkerYes. So I mentioned about 4 tracks in my letter. That has been one of them. And I mentioned earlier on this call, our bidding strategy. So we're spending a lot of our time between creative being strategies, matching AI to increase the advertisers' success and make it easier for advertisers to get the first conversion faster around the target that we're trying to achieve. -- specifically with AI, you may have seen also that we've announced generated II, whereby our advertisers are now able -- it's in beta are now able to get creatives that are driven by past performance of our advertisers, and that can help us basically better match consumers with creative, lending pages, images and things that can help consumers see as it are predisposed to what they may try to achieve. So that's what that is all about. And like I mentioned, we have -- it's the biggest investment we have in the company. If I could do one thing in other, that's the one thing I would do, performance advertising because I think if I compare it to Bula, which has about 15,000 advertisers or so to bigger walled gardens that have hundreds of thousands or millions. The upside here is just massive. So here, we're investing a lot in AI, generate to make sure that we have also the right landing pages and storytelling for advertisers. And also, there's a benefit of being the biggest, right? -- poles now, especially with Yahoo, right? When you're looking at around $2.5 billion revenue company side-by-side to companies in revenue to Twitter, Snap, Pinterest and others. At that size, we have so much data that we can really help our advertisers kind of leapfrog the coal start they have with advertising companies, specifically even when you think about smaller companies. So I'm excited about the scale that we're about to have as we launch Yahoo -- and make advertisers even more successful.OperatorOur next question coming from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. â€“Stephen WalkerDid we lose Jason?Operator-- And our next question is coming from the line of Justin Patterson with KeyBanc.Justin Tyler PattersonGreat... We're starting to see more stories of large publishers shutting down internal ad tech divisions or at least materially cutting the headcount there and leaning more on third parties. The Yahoo relationship is a great example of that. How would you characterize the opportunity set to add new publishers and expand with existing ones versus what you've seen in the past? And then secondarily, Adam, you talked a bit about generative AI within the prepared remarks in the letter. I would love to hear how you think about that just impacting the publisher landscape is this more opportunity or threat? And how do we think about that potentially rolling into the business over the next few years?Adam SingoldaSure. Thanks for the question. So I can start. So in terms of publisher shutting down internal units, I think Yahoo is very unique because it's a very big company, and they have a rotor different things that they can do from their perspective. I think as an industry, there's a huge opportunity for publishers to partner with, I think, fewer partners. So I think what you'll see over the next few years is that publishers want to have less vendors and more partners and maybe less partners. -- Right? So they can go deep with them. The opportunity I see is more about diversity of revenue. I'm hearing that a lot from publishers. Publishers want to have some review in e-commerce, some revenue in video, some revenue, native advertising, and some header bidding. They want to have diverse some subscription perhaps, right? So they want to be less exposed in a single bucket of advertising revenue. And I think that's also what Taboola needs to and wants to provide, right? So we -- that's why we invest so much in e-commerce and AI to help job subscription, which is the value we give at no cost to our publishers with home patch for you. So all of those things, I think that's the trend. Publishers will have less companies they work with. They're going to sign longer-term agreements, so they can truly innovate and low each other. And companies that are more single kind of product, I think, will be over time or challenged because it will be very hard for them to kind of fight for the bundle of the different types of advertising mix. So that's the trend I'm seeing. I think we'll see more of that, especially right now when everyone is looking for growth, right? So that's -- I'm excited about that. And I think we're investing in the right stuff also going back to Laura's question, that's why investing in my opinion right now in becoming that partner for publishers is a good thing. The second thing on (inaudible) and GPT and all of those things. One, I think it's going to be fantastic for advertisers because like I said, there's an interesting kind of CASM or a gap for advertisers, a cold start, if you will, whereby they don't know how to begin, if I'm an insurance advertiser, what should be the right title, -- how should I think about my lending pages, -- what should be my buttons. All those questions, over time, that becomes a huge actually kind of IP for advertisers as they know how to advertise. But those who just start, they don't know how to begin. So especially if you're a small advertiser, if you're a self-service advertiser. So I think that's going to be really great for companies who have scale and data to prompt that into a GPT type engine to then come up with new creatives that can help advertisers to be successful. And that's going to be interesting. I think for the publisher side, I suspect we'll see growth in journalism and riders because now publishers will have a chance to see what content is missing that users want to read that can create engagement and subscription and different revenue mix. So they'll in my opinion, they'll invest in high-quality, trusted content driven by AI. So they'll use the kind of the insights of GPT type engines to know what's missing and what's missing not only to engage consumers, but also to drive revenue. So that's -- I think we'll see growth. And of course, as we all know, we'll see growth, I think, in productivity and all that stuff. But for advertising and publishers, I think this is a good thing.OperatorOne on these for our next question -- and our final question coming from the line of Chad Larkin ofâ€¦Unidentified AnalystGuys, its Jason. Can you hear me?Adam SingoldaYes. Yes.Unidentified AnalystI had some cash issues because in, I don't know why. So totally apologize. Okay. So first, I want to understand, you originally thinking Yahoo! -- would have an impact in the second half, and obviously, that's been pushed a little forward. So maybe just talk about kind of why that is? And then can you talk some more about DR, how fast did it grow? What percent of the kind of mix is it on a maybe a revenue post-tax. And then just lastly, the comments about moving away from published prepayments. Just -- obviously, that doesn't affect the income statement because of the prepayment, but just maybe just talk about what that says about the competitive environment.Adam SingoldaSo let me start by addressing the Yahoo and the impact of Yahoo on guidance, and I'll also talk about the publisher prepayments. So I think the Yahoo!, we still expect Yahoo! -- to start to show some revenue in the second half. But the problem is that I don't know how to forecast it yet, so I don't know the degree of the revenue. I don't know exactly when to forecast that it will start because we're kind of deep in the planning stages right now. So for conservative reasons, we just decided to exclude it from our guidance for now, and we'll update on that as we get -- go through the year, and we'll obviously have a much better view of that by the next time we have our next earnings call. So I think it was mostly just the fact that we didn't know how to forecast it is the reason that we excluded it. It's not so much that anything has changed on our time lines. And in a shameless plug, I would invite everyone to come to our Yahoo Deal information session next Wednesday, where we'll talk a little bit more about timing and why we're guiding the way we are, and you'll get some ideas of what we have to do, the work we have to do to get to the point where we're generating the revenue. So that will probably help. On your question about publisher prepayments. So the -- I don't think -- publisher prepayments has been part of our business model for years. So it's not something that's new or different. In fact, I would say, if anything, publisher prepayments are less important to us from a competitive perspective, like just straight up win rate and retention rate of employee of publishers than it was historically. But we do use it very specifically in 2 specific situations. One, we do use it when it's a publisher that we don't have a history with who we kind of need to put our money where our mouth is to make them believe that we can do what we tell them we're going to do. So we do use it in that situation to win new publishers. And that's becoming, frankly, rarer and rarer because not rare and rare in terms of using it in general, but rare and rare to use that tool to prove anything to them because they can now talk to other publishers in their market, and they hear from those publishers what we can do. But we still do use it in that case where it's a sign of confidence. I think where we're starting to use it more is also to get longer duration deals or other things that we want like to get publishers to do more with us faster. So we'll sometimes put an upfront cash to get them to sign a 5-year deal instead of a 3-year deal. -- or to sign a 10-year deal instead of a 5-year deal or to do full feed and mid article from the outset rather than do something more conservative initially and then look to expand later. So we use it to get things we want as well. And it is an advantage that we do have the balance sheet to do that, especially relative to some of our much smaller competitors. So I think that's the way we think about publisher prepayments. Your last question was around -- I think you said DR and whether or not we're seeing progress on that. Can you give us a little bit more about what it is that you're wondering about there?Unidentified AnalystYes. I just want to imagine you're -- the DR-related ads are growing much faster than the brand. So just if you can give us a sense of how much faster? And then what percent of the mix it is on a post revenue post-tax basis today?Adam SingoldaYes. So interestingly, I don't think the overall mix has changed that much. I think, generally speaking, we're doing a good job of growing our brand advertising business because a lot of our new supply, especially upsells with new publishers is placements that actually do well for brand advertisers. So our mid article, high-impact placements, homepage units that we're now getting with homepage for you, these things are actually driving a lot of supply, a lot of inventory that works well for brand. So that's making that part of the business grow faster due to the supply side. I think that our DR our direct response performance advertising business is definitely performing well and growing, but it's really at a more similar rate. I think as Adam said earlier, our optimism with VR and performance advertising is that if you asked us what inning we're on right now in terms of that whole ball game, we're in the second inning, like there's so much more we can do. And some of the things that Adam talked about in terms of the new features we're releasing new targeting technologies, we think that's going to accelerate that business going forward. So as of now, they're growing at similar rates, but I think we feel that performance advertising is still a big part of our future.Stephen WalkerI would just add that in 2024, as we are fully live with Yahoo, the biggest thing that excites me is that advertisers right now find it very frustrating to work with small companies in the open web. It's very fragmented. Every company is a different technology, different dashboard versus easily buying Google, easily buying Facebook. So there needs to be a company that generates billions of dollars in revenue in the Open Web that can make it easy for advertisers to rely on, contextual, safe, not cookie risk, all those things. So we're a year away from getting to the point that the scale is so significant that advertisers to control say we have a Google strategy, Facebook strategy, to brother strategy. And that's going to be, in my opinion, the biggest needle mover for both performance advertisers as well as agencies and brand advertisers.OperatorI will now turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks.Adam SingoldaAll right. So thanks, everyone, for joining us today, and we look forward to spending a lot of time with all of you. So I'm very excited about the momentum and the future of Taboola like I said, I'm excited about winning incredible publishers who choose to and trust us, even ones that have left us and came back. As you know, I have this T-shirt that's always come back, and I'm proud of that. to our growth engines that can double Taboola. On the other side of it, for new launches, and we become $2.5 billion revenue that you mentioned on a full year basis like last year, we have e-commerce performance advertising in the header bidding. Each one of them can double the company because these are huge markets. And it's going to make us also more competitive as we continue to win new supply and new advertising business. I'm very, very excited about Yahoo and becoming a must buy for advertisers like I just mentioned, and working on the Yahoo! -- team for the next 30 years. And like I said, it's uniquely where that management companies have seen the future. We're investing this year and 2024, it feels like just one big care bear shunning light on our journey. So I'm super excited. My team is excited. And please join us, if you can, next Wednesday, New York for Yahoo Information Session. We're going to host Monica, our new Board member and New CFO; Jim Lanzone, Yahoo's CEO and our executive team is going to be great, and thanks again.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.]"

Secrist Middle School in Tucson three years ago, the school was struggling. But with a new principal, Debbee Garcia, at the helm-a principal who had high hopes for the school, Attallah adds-things turned around quickly. Garcia applied for Secrist to become a Verizon Innovative Learning School, a decision that was pivotal to the school's transformation. ""I have seen amazing changes in our school culture and climate,"" Garcia says.Secrist is one of the most recent schools to become a Verizon Innovative Learning School. What started with just eight schools in four districts in 2014 has grown to 561 schools in 94 districts nationwide, providing a lifetime of change for students and educators. Verizon Innovative Learning Schools are part of Verizon Innovative Learning, the transformative education initiative that began more than a decade ago.When Attallah returned to the school this year after working elsewhere, he witnessed a technology explosion that has radically changed the school, thanks to Verizon Innovative Learning. Now, students are equipped with individual devices and data plans; Attallah is working as a Coach, supporting his colleagues and students in adopting new learning styles in the classroom. He coaches, models, and co-teaches, as well as helps educators to better serve their students. ""Having the 1:1 [tablets] in our school helped teachers locate those students who need more support, and provide that support during the lesson, on the spot,"" Attallah says.Plus, Garcia says, students are finding ways to help one another.

194,63eebf61-7fe0-35c9-b7b5-fc46c2b17924,VZ,2023-02-25,Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verizon-communications-inc-vz-trending-140002869.html,1677247202,STORY,['VZ'],"[Verizon Communications (VZ) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this largest U.S. cellphone carrier have returned -4.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's no change. The Zacks Wireless National industry, to which Verizon belongs, has lost 0.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Verizon is expected to post earnings of $1.20 per share, indicating a change of -11.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.7% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $4.74 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -8.5%. This estimate has changed -0.6% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.82 indicates a change of +1.7% from what Verizon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3.3%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Verizon is rated Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for VZ _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Verizon, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $33.94 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +1.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $138.14 billion and $139.92 billion estimates indicate +1% and +1.3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryVerizon reported revenues of $35.25 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.5%. EPS of $1.19 for the same period compares with $1.31 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $35.06 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.55%. The EPS surprise was -0.83%.Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Verizon is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Verizon. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The possibilities of AI are being realized today and the competition is on to see who can build the best AI enabled applications.AI, which requires more computing power than ever before, is going to make for a boon across the technology industry. The creative ways that AI can be used to enhance productivity and creativity are only just beginning to become clear. Furthermore, because of the required computing power necessary it will also boost all the computing industries surrounding it.Industries that are likely to be altered by AI include software, search, semiconductors, mobile, research, music, art, gaming and the list goes on.Of course, there are also some people who warn about the dangers this new wild west of AI can bring. Some people in the field believe there needs to be more oversight of the activities going on, for fear of birthing AI sentience or singularity.I have used some of these apps and although they are impressive, they are still very imperfect. So the singularity talks sounds a bit alarmist to me – at least for now.ChatGPT and OpenAIThe release of ChatGPT, by OpenAI was extremely exciting and very well publicized. Using it for the first time truly felt like technology was entering a new paradigm, and the use of the application exploded. ChatGPT was the fastest growing web application of all time, building a user base of 100 million people less than two months after release.With funding from Microsoft MSFT, OpenAI now functions essentially as another arm of the technology giant, and MSFT hasn’t waited to implement the technology. The AI underlying ChatGPT has been implemented into MSFT’s Bing search engine, as well as Microsoft Teams, and the reception has been very positive.MSFT seems to have the jump on other technology giants, but it is unlikely that Alphabet GOOGL, Apple AAPL, or even Meta META are going to just roll over. It will be exciting to see the creative ways they decide to implement AI into their own ecosystems.Story continuesI am sure smaller start-ups will come out with exciting new technologies as well.Semiconductors“Pick and Shovel” investing is an expression that applies well to the semiconductor industry regarding AI. Pick and shovel refers to the 19th century gold rush, where pioneers traveled west in search of gold. But the people who really got rich during the rush were those selling the tools such as pick axes and shovels.Semiconductors are a logical play to benefit from the explosion in AI. Big tech and new startups will be in ruthless competition to create the best apps and technology, but predicting the winner is very challenging. Start-ups and established companies alike are all going to need to upgrade their computing power though. There is no doubt that more and regular upgrades of microchips are going to be necessary for developing AI enabled tech, as well as consumers, who want to utilize the applications.One semiconductor stock that looks very appealing is Microchip Technology MCHP. Microchip Technology currently boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions. MCHP is also one of the leading stocks in the market today, up 14% YTD.Microchip Technology is well positioned to benefit from the explosion in AI, with an extensive portfolio of microprocessors optimized for AI, and machine learning research and frameworks.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMaking it an even more compelling investment is its very reasonable valuation. MCHP is trading at 14x one-year forward earnings, below its five-year median of 17x, and below the industry average 18x.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhen semiconductors come up many investors will go straight to Nvidia NVDA. After its most recent earnings, which were decent, NVDA highlighted its commitment to the AI industry and became a buzz in the industry. But I think MCHP is a much more appealing investment right now. While NVDA gets all the hype, it comes with a very premium valuation.Nvidia is trading at a one-year forward P/E of 77x, well above its median of 50x, and way higher than the industry average of 18x. There is no doubt NVDA is a phenomenal business, but this valuation is extremely rich, and there are semiconductor stocks with more appealing valuations.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchC3.aiC3.ai AI is an enterprise artificial intelligence software company based in California. C3.ai has created a design and development environment to enable AI developers to build enterprise ready apps for CRM, and data analysis.AI stock has done extremely poorly since its IPO, down -80% off its 2021 high, but that may be a good thing for discerning investors.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchC3.ai is not a profitable company, posting negative earnings for its entire time as a public company. Additionally, trading at 10x one-year forward sales, it is still quite expensive. But AI is putting together an improving financial situation and has been posting earnings beats for the last few reporting periods.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAI has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), indicating a flat trend in earnings revision. AI is a company that has benefitted from the hype of AI, and though its valuation is maybe a bit ahead of itself, it is worth putting on the watchlist. As AI implementation into enterprise applications becomes more popular, C3.ai may be one of the first places businesses go to enhance their AI capabilities.AlphabetAlphabet, with its unfathomably large data sets, is likely to be major benefactors of the AI revolution. It seems that MSFT and GOOGL are currently in an AI arms race, and MSFT is ahead, but maybe it will work in GOOGL’s advantage. Mistakes are likely to be made in the early days, so those who can learn quickly from them and remain flexible should do well.Alphabet also has a long history of being on the cutting edge of big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Though it hasn’t been releasing chat bots, these technologies have been critical in optimizing search and other products. GOOGL likely already has some of the top talent in the industry, allowing the team to quickly build on the innovations of OpenAI.GOOGL’s valuation is as appealing as it has been in a very long time. Trading at 18x one-year forward earnings is well below its five-year median of 26x and is close to its all-time low of 15x. In addition to its future AI potential, GOOGL is a beast of a company, with very strong sales and earnings growth, even as a very large and mature business.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConclusionArtificial intelligence has already begun to shake industries across the spectrum. The potential capabilities of AI are hard to fathom. At the least these tools will upgrade our productivity and enhance our creative abilities. At the most, it may completely alter the way we live, and give rise to intelligent machines.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Yahoo Finance's very own Brian Sozzi here with some of the three big market calls that you might have missed. We've been talking about how busy of a week it's been. What might have flown under the radar here?BRIAN SOZZI: Real quick, I'm down with PCE, Brad. I'm not down--SEANA SMITH: Always!BRIAN SOZZI: I'm not down with DIY. I have no time to do that stuff anymore.BRAD SMITH: He ain't go time.BRIAN SOZZI: But anyway, now on the Yahoo Finance home page, I highlighted three things you probably missed in, really, what has been a busy week for the markets. You should not have missed any of this stuff, but you probably did. I didn't miss it, so I put it in the story.First up, Jeffrey Gundlach spoke exclusively to Yahoo Finance earlier in the week. I found what he said on China potentially invading Taiwan being a Black Swan event, just something that caught my attention. I don't think a lot of investors are positioned for that key risk in the market, hence Gundlach is calling this out as a Black Swan event.What is a Black Swan event? Something that is not-- is unexpected, something not priced into stocks. So that is one.Number two, Nvidia, guys. Nvidia, one of the top tickers on the Yahoo Finance platform this week. Of course, Brad really crushed it in that after the call analysis. Nvidia's stock just exploded. And you have Goldman Sachs saying flat out they were wrong. In hindsight, we acknowledge that our decision to remain on the sidelines in anticipation of a pullback in the company's fundamentals was wrong. They came out upgraded shares of NVIDIA.Now, as a former analyst, I never admitted when I was wrong. And if I was still an analyst today, I still wouldn't.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: It takes a big person to do so.BRIAN SOZZI: It takes a big person. So a hat tip to Goldman Sachs for acknowledging they were wrong on NVIDIA.And last but not least-- and this is a look forward to next week. This is Tesla investor day March 1. Our very own senior auto correspondent Pras Subramanian will be manning the webcast for this one. A lot of interesting things could come from this Tesla investor day next week, notably software upgrades, a new Master Plan 3 from Elon Musk. And given how unpredictable Elon Musk is, he might just come out and lift guidance. Who the hell knows?SEANA SMITH: Yeah, I don't think anything is off the table when it comes to Musk. It certainly has just been incredible, the ride that we have seen for Tesla's stock, not only over the last year or two, but really even what we've seen over the last six or seven weeks since the start of the year, the gains that the stock has already posted. It's incredible.BRIAN SOZZI: Well, a lot of those gains, I would argue, Seana, came on the pullback of yields. Now you see yields rising again. You've seen Tesla's stock come under a little bit of pressure here. I think Elon has to deliver something big here.I would also just like to see-- give me a date on when the Cybertruck is going to hit the market. I see these teaser videos on Twitter. It looks cool. One of these things being--SEANA SMITH: It looks cool? I'm not sold.BRIAN SOZZI: No. When are they going to ship these? When are you starting to make money? And then ultimately, what is coming next from Tesla?SEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly, everyone wants to know a little bit more information about that. Soz, thanks so much for sticking around on Friday for us.BRIAN SOZZI: Thanks for having me on. I appreciate you.]"

The Zacks analyst believes that the company’s near-term prospect looks gloomy due to weakening demand for its chips used in gaming and data center end markets. While the macroeconomic headwinds are impacting gaming and data center chip demand, higher channel inventory levels are hurting chip prices. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war is likely to continue negatively impact NVIDIA’s near-term revenues.Nonetheless, solid uptake of artificial intelligence-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions is likely to aid NVIDIA’s growth. Additionally, collaboration with the likes of Mercedes-Benz and Audi is expected to further strengthen NVIDIA’s presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Visa have outperformed the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry over the past year (+0.9% vs. -6.4%). The Zacks analyst believes that the company’s numerous buyouts and alliances paved the way for long-term growth and consistently drove its revenues. Constant investments in technology are solidifying its position in the payments market. A shift in payments to the digital mode is a boon for Visa.A strong cash position enables it to boost shareholder value. However, high operating expenses stress the margins. Ramped-up client incentives will dent the top line.

The Japanese auto giant is also bearing the brunt of soaring raw material prices. Supply-chain disruptions, logistical challenges, and manufacturing inefficiencies are playing spoilsports.Additionally, high inflation, rising interest rates, and an uncertain macro environment also raise concern for Toyota as the auto industry is highly cyclic.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $1.46 billion.Insulet’s Total Omnipod revenue growth is now expected in the range of 17-22% at CER.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $326.8 million.Total Omnipod revenues are likely to grow 22-25% at CER. However, Drug Delivery revenues are expected to fall in the range of 100-95% at CER.Our TakeInsulet exited the fourth quarter of 2022 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. The company’s performance benefited from record quarterly U.S. and Total Omnipod new customer starts. This was driven mainly by a strong start to the company’s U.S. full market release of the Omnipod 5 automated insulin delivery system. The company recently achieved milestones of 360,000 estimated active global customers using the Omnipod System, including over 100,000 customers in the United States using Omnipod 5.However, the substantial fall in Drug Delivery sales is discouraging. Contraction in margins does not bode well. On a year-over-year basis, the company expects gross margin to be impacted by higher costs associated with the U.S. manufacturing ramp, product line mix due to the ramp-up of Omnipod 5 and lower drug delivery revenues. Supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures continue to challenge business operations.Zacks Rank and Key PicksInsulet currently carries Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Becton, Dickinson and Company BDX, popularly known as BD, McKesson Corporation MCK and Hologic, Inc.

INGN incurred an adjusted loss per share of 57 cents for fourth-quarter 2022, narrower than an adjusted loss per share of 88 cents in the year-ago period.

However, the figure lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.6%.On a constant-currency basis, total revenues for the reported quarter increased 17.7%.Fourth-quarter revenues compare to our estimate of $87.2 million.Per management, the year-over-year uptick in the top line was primarily driven by growth in domestic business-to-business sales and rental revenue. However, this was partially offset by lower direct-to-consumer sales.Full-year revenues were $377.2 million, reflecting a 5.4% improvement from the comparable 2021 period. However, the figure topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.03%.On a constant-currency basis, total revenues for the full year increased 6.9%.Our projection of full-year revenues was $376.4 million.Segmental DetailsInogen derives revenues from two sources — rental and sales.Rental revenues for the reported quarter grossed $14.9 million, up 14.4% from the year-ago period. This figure compares to our Rental revenues’ fourth-quarter projection of $14.5 million.Sales revenues were $73.2 million, up 15.5% from the prior-year quarter. This figure compares to our Sales revenues’ fourth-quarter projection of $72.7 million.Story continuesRevenues by Region &amp; CategoryDomestic business-to-business sales for fourth-quarter 2022 amounted to $27.2 million, up 164.6% on a year-over-year basis.International business-to-business sales for the reported quarter amounted to $20.7 million, up 3.1% year over year on a reported basis. This primarily resulted from Inogen’s ability to commercialize its new product, Rove 6, in select countries in Europe following the receipt of the EU MDR (Medical Devices Regulation) certificate in December 2022.Domestic direct-to-consumer sales decreased 23.4% year over year to $25.3 million for the quarter, primarily due to lower volumes resulting from fewer inside sales representatives and a higher mix of un-tenures sales reps compared to the prior period.These compare to our projections of fourth-quarter revenues of $16.8 million, $18.8 million and $37.1 million, respectively.Inogen, Inc.

Adjusted operating expenses of $35.8 million decreased 20.9% year over year.Adjusted operating loss totaled $6.3 million compared with the prior-year quarter’s adjusted operating loss of $6.7 million.Financial PositionInogen exited full-year 2022 with cash and cash equivalents of $187 million compared with $235.5 million at the end of 2021.The company ended the quarter with no debt on its balance sheet.Cumulative net cash used in operating activities at the end of full-year 2022 was $37.5 million against net cash provided by operating activities of $23.6 million a year ago.GuidanceInogen has not provided any outlook for the first quarter of 2023 or the full year.However, the company expects its total revenues for the full-year 2023 to grow in the low to mid-single digits.Our TakeInogen exited the fourth quarter of 2022 with better-than-expected earnings. The robust year-over-year uptick in the overall top line as well as rental and sales revenues is impressive. Strength in domestic business-to-business and international business-to-business sales are encouraging.On the earnings call, management confirmed that it plans to drive further differentiation for Inogen and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with anticipated new product launches in 2023 in the United States and Europe after securing the necessary regulatory clearances. The company also confirmed that in December 2022, Inogen received the FDA’s clearance for the Rove 4, and the company anticipates the U.S. launch to be in the back half of 2023. These developments look promising for the company. Inogen’s meaningful progress with the new Rove 6 device also raises our optimism.Yet, dismal year-over-year bottom-line performances are worrying. A decline in domestic direct-to-consumer sales for the quarter is concerning as well. The contraction of gross margin is worrying. Inogen continued to incur operating losses for the fourth quarter, which does not bode well. Sustained supply-chain headwinds and cost inflation are other areas of concern.Zacks Rank and Key PicksInogen currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Becton, Dickinson and Company BDX, popularly known as BD, McKesson Corporation MCK and Hologic, Inc.

QuoteMargin AnalysisIn the quarter under review, OPKO Health’s gross profit fell 48.4% to $56 million. However, the gross margin expanded 317 basis points to 30.2%.We had projected a gross margin of 23.3% for the fourth quarter.Selling, general and administrative expenses fell 46.5% to $74 million. Research and development expenses declined 7.1% year over year to $19.5 million. Adjusted operating expenses of $93.5 million decreased 41.3% year over year.Adjusted operating loss totaled $37.5 million compared with the prior-year quarter’s adjusted operating loss of $50.7 million.Financial PositionOPKO Health exited full-year 2022 with cash and cash equivalents of $153.2 million compared with $134.7 million at the end of 2021.GuidanceOPKO Health provided its financial outlook for the first quarter of 2023.For the quarter, it expects its total revenues to be between $165 million and $185 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same currently stands at $170.6 million.OPKO Health expects its revenues from services to be between $130 million and $140 million and revenues from product sales to be in the range of $30 million-$35 million. Other revenues are expected to be between $5 million and $10 million.OPKO Health has also confirmed that it expects its COVID-19 testing volumes to continue to decline throughout 2023. However, management assumes modest growth in core testing volumes with stronger growth in OPKO Health’s higher-margin oncology, women's health and urology specialty lines of testing.Our TakeOPKO Health exited the fourth quarter of 2022 with an in-line loss per share and better-than-expected revenues. The continued sales of OPKO Health’s NGENLA (somatrogon) by Pfizer Inc. in 15 countries, including Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom, looks promising. OPKO Health also confirmed that Pfizer expects to launch in all priority ex-U.S. markets by the year’s end and continues to work with the FDA to obtain approval in the United States. This raises our optimism about OPKO Health.The company’s BRL progress with respect to its cost-cutting initiatives also bodes well for the stock. Robust results from the Pharmaceuticals segment, with solid sales of RAYALDEE, are impressive. The company’s continued strength in its women's health and oncology businesses also augurs well. The expansion of the gross margin bodes well.However, the dismal top-line and bottom-line performances are concerning. Lower Diagnostics revenues and lower BRL testing volumes are also worrying. Management’s expectations of the continued decline of COVID-19 testing volumes throughout 2023 are discouraging from a business perspective. The persistent operating loss for OPKO Health also does not bode well for the company.Zacks Rank and Key PicksOPKO Health currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Becton, Dickinson and Company BDX, popularly known as BD, McKesson Corporation MCK and Hologic, Inc.

(NYSE:APD) shareholders have seen the share price descend 11% over the month. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last five years have been pleasing. Its return of 76% has certainly bested the market return!So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. Check out our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, Air Products and Chemicals achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 16% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 12% over the same period. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Air Products and Chemicals' earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Air Products and Chemicals, it has a TSR of 98% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Air Products and Chemicals shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 20% over one year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 15%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Air Products and Chemicals better, we need to consider many other factors.

The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase Genuine Parts' shares before the 2nd of March to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 3rd of April.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.95 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$3.58 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Genuine Parts stock has a trailing yield of around 2.0% on the current share price of $178.82. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to investigate whether Genuine Parts can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. Check out our latest analysis for Genuine Parts If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Fortunately Genuine Parts's payout ratio is modest, at just 42% of profit. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. It distributed 44% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. For this reason, we're glad to see Genuine Parts's earnings per share have risen 15% per annum over the last five years. The company has managed to grow earnings at a rapid rate, while reinvesting most of the profits within the business. Fast-growing businesses that are reinvesting heavily are enticing from a dividend perspective, especially since they can often increase the payout ratio later.Story continuesThe main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, Genuine Parts has increased its dividend at approximately 6.1% a year on average. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.Final TakeawayHas Genuine Parts got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Genuine Parts has been growing earnings at a rapid rate, and has a conservatively low payout ratio, implying that it is reinvesting heavily in its business; a sterling combination. There's a lot to like about Genuine Parts, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it.With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces. To help with this, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Genuine Parts that you should be aware of before investing in their shares.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this engine maker have returned -0.1%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's no change. During this period, the Zacks Automotive - Internal Combustion Engines industry, which Cummins falls in, has gained 2.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Cummins is expected to post earnings of $4.70 per share, indicating a change of +16.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.4% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $18.95 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +25.3%. This estimate has changed -5.7% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $19.53 indicates a change of +3% from what Cummins is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Cummins is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CMI _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Cummins, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $8 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +25.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $32.06 billion and $32.07 billion estimates indicate +14.2% and +0% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCummins reported revenues of $7.77 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +32.8%. EPS of $4.52 for the same period compares with $2.85 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.36 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.6%. The EPS surprise was -3%.Over the last four quarters, Cummins surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Cummins is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Cummins. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

TC Energy’s bottom line also reduced from a profit of 84 cents per share in the year-ago period.  This underperformance could be attributed to weak results in the Liquids Pipeline segment.TC Energy’s comparable EBITDA of C$2.7 billion in the reported quarter was up from C$2.4 billion in the prior-year period.This North America-based energy infrastructure provider’s quarterly revenues of $3 billion increased approximately 2% year over year due to solid segmental performances.TC Energy’s board of directors announced a quarterly dividend increase of 93 Canadian cents per common share for the quarter ending Mar 31, 2023.TC Energy Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseTC Energy Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseTC Energy Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | TC Energy Corporation QuoteSegmental InformationCanadian Natural Gas Pipelines reported a comparable EBITDA of C$768 million, up about 14% from the year-ago quarter’s level. This increase was primarily due to the impact of increased rate-based earnings on the NGTL System.U.S. Natural Gas Pipelines’ comparable EBITDA of C$1.1 million indicates a 10.5% increase from the prior-year quarter’s level. This upside can be attributed to a stronger U.S. dollar in 2022.Mexico Natural Gas Pipelines’ comparable EBITDA of C$211 million was up 39.8% from the year-ago quarter’s figure of C$151 million. This increase could be attributed to NGTL system’s continued growth as well as contributions from the BDR North and 2 East pipelines.Liquids Pipelines' comparable EBITDA of C$364 million in the reported quarter deteriorated from the year-ago quarter’s level of C$380 million. This downtrend was due to contracted volumes in the Keystone Pipeline System’s U.S. Gulf Coast section as well as lower contributions from liquids marketing activities due to soft margins.Story continuesPower and Storage posted a comparable EBITDA of C$203 million, up 20.9% from the year-ago quarter’s figure of C$168 million. This segment has experienced significant growth due to several factors. Operational excellence, with a strong performance from Cogen operations, resulted in peak power plant availability during high-demand times, such as the coldest days in December. This caused record power pool prices in Alberta, which contributed to higher earnings for the segment.Expenditure and Balance SheetTC Energy’s capital investments for the reported quarter totaled C$3.1 billion.TRP had cash and cash equivalents worth C$620 million and long-term debt of C$39.6 billion, representing a debt-to-capitalization of 57.8%.Key UpdatesTC Energy is expecting to invest between C$11.5 billion and C$12 billion in capital growth projects in 2023.TC Energy plans to continue investing in renewable energy and power generation projects, which will help to diversify its business and support the transition to a low-carbon economy.It also expects to continue growing its business in 2023, particularly in its Natural Gas and Oil Pipelines segments.

That would be enough to create 115,540 apprenticeships* - the equivalent of almost halving the number of 16-24 year olds not in education, employment or training.However, through the levy transfer system businesses who pay the Apprenticeship Levy each year have the ability to transfer this money to other organizations.Sky's work with Multiverse means that its unspent apprenticeship levy expire can go directly to small businesses who are looking to provide crucial skills within their organization.This is part of the Sky's contribution to the UK cultural economy through skills, jobs, and investment, and comes as nine in 10 (88%) UK organizations are facing a shortage of digital skills impacting growth, efficiency and competitiveness.""There's a huge demand from small businesses to upskill their workforce, yet many don't have access to the funding needed to do this.

The ability for small businesses to grow is contingent on having the right skills in place.""Story continues""We know that small businesses are crying out for more apprenticeships. Through the levy transfer system, Sky is supporting the growth of these SMEs by 'donating' these vital digital skills through apprenticeships - which are simply the best way to build capabilities within an organization.""SMEs can request to enroll their colleagues onto Multiverse programs with no cost to the business - this can be requested on the Multiverse website.This announcement follows the recent launch of Sky's Sky Up Tech Grants initiative which is an investment of £220,000 to provide those leaving the care system with equipment and connectivity so they can access the digital world. This initiative is part of the £10 million Sky Up program, created to ensure that groups who are most at risk of digital exclusion - under 25s in under-served communities and over 65s - are provided with the skills they need to succeed.All companies with payroll over £3 million are required to pay 0.5% Apprenticeship Levy - which goes into a pot that can be spent on training costs, or transferred to other organizations through the government's Levy Transfer system.* Based on average apprenticeship cost calculated by IFATEComcast Corporation, Friday, February 24, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Comcast Corporation on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Comcast CorporationWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/comcast-corporationEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Comcast CorporationView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/740668/Sky-Pledges-1-Million-in-Apprenticeship-Funding-to-Small-Businesses]"

Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Devon Energy (DVN).Devon Energy currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 2.00, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 20 brokerage firms. An ABR of 2.00 indicates Buy.Of the 20 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 10 are Strong Buy, representing 50% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for DVNBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for DVNCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Devon Energy here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Devon Energy, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is DVN a Good Investment?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Devon Energy, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 6.8% over the past month to $7.49.Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Devon Energy.

Despite the somewhat rapid downturn, there are pockets of the market and stocks that look poised to thrive in the near term and for years to come.Today we dive into United Rentals (URI) and The TJX Companies (URI) to see why investors might want to buy these stocks as the calendar turns to March amid ongoing market uncertainty.Bullish investors managed to temporarily stop some of the bleeding on Wednesday and Thursday. But the selling ramped up again on Friday following the release of the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge known as the personal consumption expenditures price index or PCE. The data came in hotter than projected, joining a long list of January economic indicators that proved Jay Powell’s inflation fight is far from over.  Wall Street has been forced once again to recalibrate its outlook for interest rates. Wall Street pushed the 2-year U.S. Treasury yield to fresh highs of 4.81% on Friday. This marks a sharp climb from 4.1% on February 1 and tops its November peaks. The short-term yield is now floating around levels it last hit in early 2007 and late 2006.The bulls are now desperately attempting to prevent the Nasdaq from falling back under its 200-day moving average. The tech-heavy index floated right around the key technical level at the end of Friday trading after it dropped 1.7%. The hope now might be that the market chops around over the coming weeks until February’s CPI release on March 14 and the Fed’s March FOMC meeting on March 21-22.Despite all of the worries about the growth trade quickly unraveling again, there are plenty of great stocks for investors to buy heading into March and beyond. It is also always worth remembering that the market-timing game is extremely difficult. Given this backdrop, we dive into two stocks that sit at attractive valuation levels that have also outpaced the market over the past year and look poised to continue doing so.Story continuesUnited Rentals (URI) is one of the world’s largest equipment rental firms. URI’s sales quickly bounced back after a pandemic dip and it posted strong 2022 results in late January. The company is able to easily raise its prices along with inflation and United Rentals completed its acquisition of Ahern Rentals in early December.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchURI’s upward earnings revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. Plus, United Rentals said last month that it plans to restart its share repurchase program and introduce a dividend. These moves highlight URI’s stability and financial firepower amid a period of wider economic uncertainty.URI shares have soared 750% in the last 10 years and 25% so far in 2023 to hit fresh records recently. Yet the stock is far from overheated and trades at a 40% discount to its own decade-long highs at 10.5X forward 12-month earnings.The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX) is an off-price apparel and home décor retailer that operates roughly 4,800 stores in nine countries, including the U.S., Canada, the UK, and Germany. The company’s brands include T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods, and others. TJX has carved out a nice niche within a rapidly evolving retail landscape that has it thriving alongside giants such as Target (TGT).  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTJX’s sales skyrocketed in its FY22 (2021) to blow away its pre-covid total. It then popped 3% in its recently reported FY23. TJX’s year was highlighted by a strong fourth quarter as more consumers looked to save. TJX, which lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at the moment, plans to boost its dividend by 13% and to buy back between $2 billion to $2.5 Billion of stock in FY24. On top of that, 12 of the 15 brokerage recommendations Zacks has are “Strong Buys” and its outlook remains strong.TJX shares have popped 20% in the last six months and 95% in the past five years to blow away the S&amp;P 500’s 45%. A slide from its January peaks has it near oversold RSI levels. In terms of valuation, TJX is trading at a 50% discount to its own 10-year highs at 21.8X forward 12-month earnings to match the Zacks Retail Sector. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company also plans to restart its share repurchase program, with the intention to buyback $1 billion of common stock in 2023.Looking forward, Matthew Flannery, CEO of United Rentals, said, “Our guidance reflects our expectations for another year of strong growth, and our ability to convert this growth into compelling returns. The introduction of our dividend program reflects the strength and resiliency of our operating model and our ability to generate cash across the cycle, while continuing to invest in growth. Combined with the restart of our share repurchase program, we expect to return approximately $1.4 billion of cash to our shareholders this year as we continue to drive long-term value creation.”Inside the HeadlinesAdjusted earnings of $9.74 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.12 by 3.8%.

Additional information regarding these factors can be found in the company's public SEC filings. In addition to the press release distributed yesterday, this morning, we published an investor presentation regarding the unsolicited acquisition proposal received from Public Storage on February 5, 2023. We have also furnished our supplemental package with additional detail on our financial results. These materials have been filed with the SEC and may be found on the Investor Relations section on our website at lifestorage.com. (Operator Instructions) At this time, I'll turn the call over to Joe.Story continuesJoseph V. SaffireThanks, Brent, and good morning, everyone. Following our discussion of our fourth quarter and full year 2020 (sic) [2022] results and financial outlook, I'll spend some time walking you through the presentation we filed with the SEC this morning and the rationale behind our Board's unanimous decision to reject Public Storage's unsolicited acquisition proposal. But first, I'm excited to announce that Life Storage crossed the threshold of $1 billion in total consolidated revenue in 2022. This is an incredible accomplishment as we now have nearly doubled the revenue we reported only 5 years ago in 2017. I am confident in our ability to continue to build on our momentum and deliver outstanding results. I am also pleased to announce that Newsweek has awarded us the Best Customer Service Award in America for storage center category for the sixth year in a row. This award is a testament to the best-in-class brand and team we have here at Life Storage, and to our commitment to delivering exceptional, seamless experience for our customers.  Turning to our quarterly results. I am pleased to report we delivered another quarter of outstanding performance across all segments of our business. While we continue to see a return to more normal seasonal trends, our operating fundamentals and business trends were very strong and remain above pre-pandemic levels. This positions us well for the year ahead. I'd like to highlight a few notable results and trends. For the quarter, we achieved same-store revenue growth of 11.8% versus the prior year period. Our strong performance was broad-based, with 85% of our major markets achieving 7% or greater revenue growth. For the year, 32 of our top 33 markets achieved greater than 10% revenue growth. These results underscore the benefits of our disciplined portfolio strategy to expand in key growth markets that allow us to benefit from regional income and population trends. In addition to this outstanding operating performance, we also completed another strong year on the acquisitions front, completing over $1 billion in wholly owned and JV acquisitions totaling 75 properties. Of this amount, $974 million and 49 stores were wholly owned acquisitions representing nearly 7% growth in our wholly-owned portfolio. We continue to expand in markets such as Dallas, Los Angeles, Phoenix, San Diego, St. Louis and New York City. Today, we own and/or operate nearly 1,200 storage facilities across 37 states and the District of Columbia. With regards to third-party management, we added 40 stores gross, net 39 stores in the fourth quarter and 107 stores for the year for a total of 440 stores at the end of 2022. Our third-party management platform had an excellent year as both our existing relationships and new relationships continue to add more facilities to our platform. During the quarter, we transitioned 29 operating facilities from other REIT platforms, further evidence that more and more owners are choosing the Life Storage brand and platform to manage their assets. This portfolio of managed stores continues to provide a strong pipeline of acquisitions. We acquired 11 managed stores during the year, representing nearly 1/4 of our wholly-owned acquisition volume. Our operating trends thus far in 2023 demonstrate that we are continuing our strong momentum as we achieved January month-end occupancy of 91.2%, which is 150 basis points higher than pre-COVID January 2019. In fact, we had record move-ins in January. Demand remained strong. Our excellent performance in 2022 reflects the strength of our operating model and the significant progress we have made to build our portfolio with high-quality properties in attractive growth markets. In 2023, we will continue to focus on executing on our strategy to expand our portfolio and deliver best-in-class service. By doing so, we will build on our track record of strong profitable growth to continue to enhance value for our Life Storage shareholders. And with that, I will hand the call over to Alex, who will provide additional color on our performance for the quarter and the year, and walk you through our 2023 financial guidance.Alexander GressThanks, Joe. This quarter, we reported adjusted funds from operations of $1.69 per share, an increase of 19.9% over the same quarter last year and well above the high end of our guidance. Fourth quarter same-store revenue increased 11.8% year-over-year driven by realized rates per square foot growth of 14.7% over the fourth quarter of 2021. As Joe mentioned, we continue to see the operating environment normalize. As expected, though asking rates and occupancies remain elevated, they continue to level off from their highs during the pandemic. Same-store occupancy for the quarter averaged 91.5%, or 140 basis points above pre-COVID levels. Demand remained strong through year-end, with move-ins accelerating in the last month of the quarter and through January 2023. Same-store operating expenses, excluding real estate taxes, increased 4.1% for the quarter versus the prior year period. The largest negative variances occurred in utilities, repairs and maintenance and Internet marketing. The 15.7% increase in same-store property taxes as compared to the prior year quarter reflects the impact of large tax rebates received in the fourth quarter of 2021 that reduced the comparable expense in the prior year quarter. For reference, full year property taxes increased 5.2% compared to the prior year. These quarterly increases were partially offset by a 4.3% decrease in payroll and benefits. The net effect of same-store revenue and expense performance was a 100-basis-point expansion in quarterly net operating income margin to 73.7%, resulting in 13.3% year-over-year growth in same-store NOI for the fourth quarter. With this improved performance, we again increased our dividend 11% in January as we continue to focus on increasing capital returns as we grow our business. This increase follows our 8% dividend bump this past July and marks a cumulative quarterly dividend increase of 20% since January 2022. Turning to the balance sheet. Our net debt to recurring EBITDA ratio remained strong at 4.8x at quarter end, and our debt service coverage ratio was a healthy 5.2x at December 31. We had approximately $655 million available on our line of credit at quarter end, with no significant debt maturities until April of 2024, when $175 million becomes due, and our average debt maturity is 5.5 years. In addition, at December 31, nearly 85% of our debt was fixed rate. Turning now to our 2023 guidance. Details of our 2023 earnings guidance and related assumptions were included in our release last night. Our 2023 same-store pool increased by 88 stores, bringing our total 2023 same-store pool count to 664 stabilized stores. We expect same-store revenue to grow between 4% and 5.5%, a majority of which will be driven by existing customer increases. Excluding property taxes, we expect other expenses to increase between 4% and 5%, while property taxes are expected to increase 6.25% to 7.25%. The cumulative effect of these assumptions would result in 3.75% to 5.25% growth in same-store NOI. We expect our wholly owned acquisitions to be between $150 million and $250 million. Based on this outlook, we anticipate adjusted FFO per share for 2023 to be between $6.75 and $6.95, or 5.2% growth over prior year at the midpoint. Additionally, as you will hear in Joe's comments shortly, we felt it was important to share with you our summary outlook for 2024. Based on what we know today, we expect low double-digit FFO per share growth in 2024, with a midpoint of 11%. With that, I'll turn the call back to Joe to discuss the presentation we filed this morning that discusses the factors that led to our Board determining that the proposal from Public Storage significantly undervalued our company and its growth prospects. Joe?Joseph V. SaffireThanks, Alex. Last week, we announced that Life Storage Board of Directors unanimously rejected the unsolicited acquisition proposal publicly announced by Public Storage on February 5, 2023. The Board's decision followed a comprehensive review of the proposal in consultation with independent financial and legal advisers. As Brent noted in his opening, this morning, we filed a presentation that provides a deeper dive into the factors that led to the Board's determination that the proposal significantly undervalues our company. I want to spend some time this morning walking through the presentation, and providing more color on why we are so confident in our future, and why we believe that Public Storage's proposal does not appropriately reflect the value embedded in the upside of Life Storage and our clear line of sight to continued growth and value creation. I'll start on Slide 3 of the new investor presentation we posted this morning. If you haven't seen it yet, the presentation is available in the IR section of our website, and on file with the SEC. The Board's decision was grounded in the significant progress we have made over the past 5 years, creating a differentiated platform and what we believe is truly unique value creation opportunity. In this time, we have grown Life Storage from 706 stores across 28 states to a diversified footprint of nearly 1,200 stores across 37 states, primarily in the key growth markets across the Sunbelt. As we have grown, we have enhanced our operating model, building on our pioneering technology and innovating our platform to provide best-in-class service to our more than 675,000 customers. My focus since 2019 when I was appointed CEO has been to accelerate our progress by focusing on our strategic pillars to deliver profitable growth and industry-leading shareholder returns. Our operational and financial performance over the past several years demonstrates that our strategy is working. We have a robust platform to continue building on this momentum. Turning to Slide 4. The Board unanimously determined that the Public Storage's proposal significantly undervalues Life Storage and the company's prospects. Over the next several slides, I will walk you through the key elements of the Board's decision, including Life Storage's significant outperformance over the past several years, and the reasons we believe we are positioned to extend our industry-leading track record. The unique opportunity we have to drive continued superior growth by scaling our platform faster and more efficiently than our peers. Our margin expansion initiatives, which are leading to enhanced profitability, and the belief that Public Storage's proposal was opportunistically timed and does not reflect the significant continued growth and value creation that Life Storage is poised to realize. I'll begin with the reasons we believe that the proposal does not provide adequate value for Life Storage and the company's prospects for future value creation. As you can see on Slide 6, over the past 5 years, and since March of 2019, we have translated our significant growth and strong financial performance into superior returns for our shareholders. Our team has delivered industry-leading returns of nearly 100% since March of 2019, and nearly 150% over the past 5 years. The strong results and financial outlook that we announced today reflect our confidence in our ability to continue this track record. Slide 7 underscores our proven commitment to exceptional dividend growth. Providing an attractive and growing dividend for our shareholders is not something we have embraced only recently. In fact, we have raised our dividend 6 times since March of 2019 for a total increase of 80% over that period. Growing our dividend is a key focus, and we intend to continue to do so as we drive enhanced FFO growth over the coming quarters and years. The substantial value we have driven for our shareholders over the past several years has been underpinned by our significant financial outperformance. On Slide 8, you can see that Life Storage has beat or met analyst consensus for FFO per share every quarter since the beginning of 2018, with the exception of 1 quarter at the start of COVID in 2020. We have also achieved or exceeded our own guidance for FFO every year over that period, including substantial outperformance in 2021 and 2022. We hold our team to high standards and time and time again our team has delivered. The financial outlook that we have announced today reflects our confidence in our team's ability to build on this substantial momentum in '23, in '24, and for the long-term. In addition to our outperformance expectations, we have outperformed our peer group. On Slide 9, you can see that. Since 2019, we are consistently at or near the top of the list on FFO per share growth. And if you include forecasted [2023 results] Life Storage is the highest FFO per share CAGR in our peer group at 13.3%. This compares to Public Storage at 9.3%. As Alex and I mentioned earlier, we anticipate industry-leading growth in 2024. Slide 10 shows our expectation of low double-digit FFO per share growth in 2024, with a midpoint of 11%. Our growth projections are based on a number of different factors, including continued same-store growth, contributions from recent requisitions, the positive impact of lease-up assets, growth in fee revenue from third-party management and joint ventures and redevelopments. We expect to continue leading the industry in terms of growth. Moving now to our operating strategy and track record of execution, which have allowed us to deliver best-in-class performance across our portfolio. Let's turn to Slide 12. Our best-in-class operating performance is driven by accelerating top and bottom line growth. Over the past 3 years, we have driven leading same-store revenue growth. Through our strong operating fundamentals and disciplined expense control, we have translated this top line growth into same-store NOI outperformance.Our leadership position is bolstered by our footprint in rapidly growing markets, as you can see on Slides 13 and 14. Over the past 3 years, we have reshaped our portfolio to focus on key Sunbelt markets where we benefit from attractive demographics and higher projected growth than our peers. We believe expanding in the right markets is critical to future growth. Between our existing footprint and our relationships through our third-party management and joint ventures, we have a built-in pipeline to continue growing in markets supported by strong demographic tailwinds. Our advantaged geographic footprint is clearly a factor in rejecting the proposal. A key component of our portfolio strategy and our superior value creation has been our focus on expanding in the Sunbelt, which I mentioned on the prior slide, offers compelling demand trends and population demographics. Since 2019, we have acquired 140 new properties in the Sunbelt, totaling approximately 70% of our acquisitions over this period. Though population and employment growth trends in the Sunbelt are projected to continue to drive strong demand, our peers' portfolios remain underexposed to the region. We believe our strong footprint in the Sunbelt represents a significant competitive advantage, particularly relative to companies that have focused on growth in California, where population demographics are trending in the opposite direction. Today, roughly 60% of our total store count is located in the Sunbelt states, excluding California, and we expect to drive continued above-market growth in the region as we benefit from in-migration trends. With approximately 65% of our third-party and joint venture assets also in the Sunbelt, we have considerable opportunities to expand in the region. Thanks to focused planning and outstanding execution, today, Life Storage is in better markets, positioning us for continued superior growth. Turning now to our operating platform. which, together with the size of our asset base, allows us to grow faster and more efficiently than our peers. Let's turn to Slide 16. At Life Storage, we have built a model that allows us to scale our portfolio and drive superior earnings. Our leading third-party management platform and joint ventures provide us with an embedded pool of potential acquisitions in key markets, the vast majority of which are off-market opportunities. We have historically been able to capitalize on these opportunities at attractive rates as we avoid competing bids from an open market process. Further, we have a strong track record of translating these acquisitions into enhanced profitability by identifying and executing on redevelopment activities. I've been talking about our faster growth. Let me show you what that looks like. As you can see on Slide 17, since 2018, we have accelerated our store count growth by leveraging our unique external growth levers, increasing our overall footprint by 55% over that time. We have scaled our third-party management platform and joint venture portfolio at a faster rate than our overall portfolio, creating an increasing number of acquisition opportunities. Today, our portfolio of managed and joint venture asset comprises of about $8 billion in assets, approximately 65% of which are in the Sunbelt. This is a primary driver of our acquisition pipeline which currently stands at $685 million in assets, approximately 95% of which are off-market opportunities. We expect to continue to build out our pipeline as we enhance our third-party and joint venture relationships, allowing us to continue to bolster our portfolio and strengthen on our foundation for continued profitable growth. We expect our store count to increase by approximately 100 over the coming year. Growth is valuable and likely a key reason Public Storage is pursuing Life Storage.Referring now to Slide 18. The relative size of our asset base positions us to scale our portfolio more efficiently than peers, allowing us to deliver higher growth rates through our proven acquisition strategy. Our wholly owned acquisition volume since 2019, as a percentage of our total enterprise value at the year-end in 2022 is 30%. Public Storage cannot match this growth rate because of both the size of their portfolio and the overall lack of larger-scale portfolio deals. For example, Public Storage's acquisition volume over that period is only 12% of their total enterprise value. For public Storage to have achieved our growth over that period, they would have needed to spend approximately $16 billion more on acquisitions. Our smaller base compared to Public Storage means we have significant runway and more upside and can more easily deliver significant growth. That's an exciting and important differentiator for Life Storage. Turning now to Slide 19. We attribute much of our strong growth rate and continued robust acquisition pipeline to our leading third-party management program and establish joint venture relationships. Our third-party management program has seen remarkable growth since 2019, adding 227 new managed stores, including 65 net transfers from other REITs. We also continue to develop our JV portfolio of 141 stores through relationships with leading institutional and private equity partners. These relationships enable us to participate in top markets and quality properties that provide future upside with a moderate capital investment. We've increasingly leaned on our pool of managed and JV assets to fuel our acquisition pipeline in recent years. In fact, 37% of our total acquisition volume since the start of 2020 has come from these properties. These relationships also provide an attractive annual fee stream, delivering approximately $31 million in annual fee income, and reduce our reliance on the public markets as an alternative source of capital. We believe the relationships we have built through these pipelines are valuable assets in and of themselves. Our partners trust Life Storage, and they rely on our leading operating platform and brand. This kind of trust is a differentiator for Life Storage and it's not built overnight. It is something we earned through our hard work every day. We have heard from many of these partners and they have serious reservations about continuing their relationship with Life Storage if the company were to be acquired by Public Storage. In short, our third-party management and joint venture relationships are unique and valuable. We have been able to translate our strong external growth into significant profitability through our redevelopment initiatives to improve the quality of our assets and drive enhanced ROI and enhance margins. We are relentless in our efforts to deliver the best possible experience for our customers through ongoing investments in our owned assets. As you can see on Slide 20, since 2018, we have completed $208 million of redevelopments, which have yielded stable, attractive ROIs of over 10%, and translated to a 390-basis-point increase in our NOI margin. We have a strong pipeline of these initiatives underway across our portfolio, which are positioned to drive future growth and cash flows as they are completed. Importantly, this is all in our control. As we continue to execute on both internal and external growth opportunities, Life Storage has the proven capabilities and dynamic operating platform to drive enhanced profitability and value for shareholders. Speaking of profitability, I will now provide a deeper dive into our margin improvement trajectory and the initiatives we have underway to sustain this momentum. Since the beginning of 2019, one of our key areas of focus has been to improve our margins, and I'm pleased to say we have made substantial progress so far. The chart on 22 speaks volumes. Since 2019, we have delivered sector-leading NOI margin expansion of approximately 630 basis points. We achieved this through disciplined execution of our initiatives to improve rental rates and reduce operating expenses in our stores while maintaining best-in-class service. As we continue to advance these initiatives, we expect to deliver at least 70 basis points of additional margin uplift over the next 2 years. One point that Public Storage has brought up in his discussions around its proposal has been its relative margin differences. However, when you look beneath the surface, the margin gap is not as great as they may suggest. While Public Storage has been able to achieve higher reported NOI margins, a direct comparison of our 2 companies' margins ignores several key variables with meaningful impact on total margin differences. You can see a breakdown of these factors on Slide 23. In particular, the higher regional rent in Public Storage's key markets account for approximately 370 basis points of margin difference. These are noncontrollable factors reflecting the different geographies of the portfolios. Moreover, Public Storage benefits from a lower tax basis than Life Storage, primarily due to Proposition 13 in California. Their margins in California have inherent risk from a potential repeal of Proposition 13, which would eliminate tax rates and could remove approximately 150 basis points from their margins. When you consider the 70 basis points uplift we expect over the next 2 years, the spread between our margins shrink significantly. Given the momentum we have in increasing store profitability through our efficiency initiatives and technology rollout, we are confident that we can continue to close the margin gap as a stand-alone company. The strong growth and profitability trends in our business and our superior geographic exposure and capabilities were key factors in the Board's decision to reject Public Storage's proposal. The Board also determined that the proposal was opportunistic, and fails to account for our compelling outlook and ability to continue to drive leading growth and value creation. So let me explain why we think the proposal was opportunistically timed, which is covered on Slides 25 and 26. First, Life Storage has been undervalued compared to historical averages. Based on recent history, however, we believe that this dislocation in our stock price is temporary. In fact, the proposal currently reflects an implied FFO multiple of only 17.7x, which is well below our 3-year average of 19.4x. In other words, it's a great proposal for Public Storage, but it is clearly inadequate for Life Storage shareholders. Public Storage's proposal, which was made during the quiet period before we announced our '22 results and outlook through 2024, does not account for our company's strong future growth prospects. Let me take a moment to explain the graph you see on Page 26. What we show here is the PEG ratio for us and our peers, which is defined as the price-to-earnings ratio, divided by our earnings growth rate over a period of time. The PEG ratio calculates our 2024 FFO multiple, adjusted for the expected growth in 2024, and dividend yield. While Life Storage is undervalued on a 1-year FFO multiple basis, as we just discussed, it is even more undervalued when looking at our PEG ratio. When our FFO multiple is viewed in the context of our expected growth, we are trading well below our closest peers multiple. We anticipate a significant improvement in our multiple as the markets better understand the superior growth Life Storage is poised to deliver over the next 2 years. Let me repeat that. We anticipate a significant improvement in our multiple as the markets better understand the superior growth Life Storage is poised to deliver over the next 2 years. Public Storage's proposal fails to account for this industry-leading growth and instead seems to be opportunistically timed to transfer Life Storage's upside value to Public Storage. Now turning to Slide 27. The Board conducted a robust evaluation process. Among other things, the Board considered whether Life Storage is better positioned to deliver growth and value stand-alone or with Public Storage's proposals. The conclusion of this evaluation was unanimous. Life Storage is better positioned to continue enhancing value for shareholders by executing its current strategy than it would be through the proposed transaction. In reaching this conclusion, the Board considered a number of factors I reviewed today, our robust growth pipeline, our track record of delivering higher-than-expected total shareholder returns and driving leading revenue, NOI and FFO growth rates, and our strong margin improvement. Further, the Board determined that our portfolio of newer, higher-quality assets in attractive markets is primed for growth that we do not believe public storage can match. The Board's evaluation indicated that the Public Storage proposal is inadequate, opportunistic and does not reflect Life Storage's best-in-class performance and value potential. I want to briefly mention in closing the independence of the Life Storage Board. This is a diverse, regularly refreshed board that is clearly committed to acting in shareholders' best interests. Board members bring significant experience and expertise relevant to our business objectives and are ultimately focused on value creation for shareholders. We are proud to have a strong record of engaging with shareholders and taking action in response to their feedback. Turning to the final slide. We believe Life Storage is uniquely valuable, growing at a faster rate in higher-growth properties than peers and delivering sector-leading margin improvement. Public Storage's proposal is opportunistically timed to take advantage of a temporary dislocation in the stock price, and does not reflect Life Storage's recent performance and bright prospects for continued superior value creation. The Life Storage Board is open-minded and will continue to review opportunities to further enhance value as we execute on our proven plan to drive continued growth and shareholder value. Thank you all for joining us today. I hope you share in our excitement for the bright future we see ahead for Life Storage. As we turn to the Q&amp;A, I'd ask that you keep all questions focused on our strong performance, our business and the outlook we provided today. We shared quite a bit of detail around the Board's decision to reject the Public Storage's proposal, and I'm sure you can appreciate that we do not intend to comment further on that matter. And with that, operator, we will now open the call for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Your first question for today is coming from Juan Sanabria at BMO.Juan Carlos SanabriaThanks for the time and for that thorough presentation this morning. Joe, I was just curious if you could maybe shed some light as to the drivers behind the 2024 earnings growth you laid out, in particular, what you guys would expect from a same-store revenue perspective just to kind of think about how that stacks up relative to your guidance that you laid out last night for '23.Joseph V. SaffireSure, Juan, be happy to. So obviously, we feel really strong about the guidance we gave for '23. That's embedded in our outlook for '24. There's multiple drivers. I just kind of went through some of them in the presentation. But again, much of it is to do what we've been doing over the last few years, in particular, the acquisitions of nearly $5 billion, including JVs over the last few years. So for sure, we see continued growth in the same-store growth, outperformance in some of those acquisitions since underwriting, we're seeing -- we like what we see, to be quite honest. The growth in the third-party management platform has been going extremely well, better than expected. And then obviously, we've got our enhancement program that we've -- is doing quite well and providing double-digit returns on those investments. And obviously, there's the margin improvement we talked about. We do see at least 70 basis points of further improvement.Juan Carlos SanabriaGreat. And then just -- I understand the hesitancy to want to delve deeper into the presentation. But I think there's clearly -- you lay out the multiple difference versus history, which is well and good, but I would argue today is a different environment given the higher interest rate. So just curious on how you think about the difference in cost of capital and absolute values when the Board is thinking about assessing bids out there because clearly, today's world is different from where it was unfortunately 6 months ago.Joseph V. SaffireWell, listen, I'm not going to get into the Board's reasoning behind some of this. But I will say I'm not happy with the multiple right now. It doesn't reflect the opportunity ahead of us. The growth prospects ahead of us is why I felt it was important to talk about '24. It was just last year, we were trading at a premium to the average multiple of our peers, and now we're at a discount. It's definitely market-driven, and I believe temporary.OperatorYour next question for today is coming from Todd Thomas at KeyBanc.Todd Michael ThomasI guess 2 follow-ups on those questions actually. First, just around the '24 growth. Joe, the industry lacks visibility, which you discussed in the slide that outlines the track record the company has of beating versus consensus, but also your own quarterly and annual guidance over the last several years. And so I'm just trying to get a sense around the level of comfort that you have as it pertains to the 2024 FFO growth that you outlined? And maybe how much of that growth is sort of locked in, I guess, in your view and sort of controllable versus what is from maybe the same-store and operations more generally?Joseph V. SaffireRight. Thanks, Todd. What we put in there, we feel very confident about. Obviously, our guidance for future acquisitions, for at least '23, is much smaller given the market conditions than the last 3 years. So actually, there's not a lot in that 9% to 13% FFO growth from future acquisitions. So really, it's what we see, what's controllable. We have very clear visibility in our 3PM pipeline going forward. We have signed contracts of stores that are opening over the next 12 to 18 months. That's in there. We see our expansions program, where they are in the pipeline. There were some supply chain issues that helped some of them back over the last few years. We're catching up. We know when they're going to open, and we have a really good track record of understanding how they're going to lease up. And then obviously, we did $3.3 billion in acquisitions over the last few years in the Sunbelt. We feel very strongly about the demographics of the Sunbelt. And all of that is embedded in the '24. So we feel very confident, Todd.Todd Michael ThomasOkay. And then just, yes, in terms of the process here, can you talk a little bit about how the Board thinks about maximizing shareholder value over time? I think you said the Board conducted a robust review of the company's valuation and value potential. Has the Board engaged with a third party to provide a valuation for the company? Or is there another way that the Board defines value in terms of sort of a target multiple or NAV? And does -- what does the Board view as the current NAV of the company?Joseph V. SaffireTodd, I'm not going to get into what the Board looks at and their process. We talked a lot about in the presentation. I will say that the Board is always open to and will regularly evaluate any opportunities that are put in front of them. What we talked about today was one proposal put in front of them, and I won't say more about it.Todd Michael ThomasOkay. And I guess one last question, if I could. You talked about some of the risk of the third-party management contracts, I guess, may be falling out in the event of an acquisition by PSA, maybe some impact around some of the joint ventures. I mean, are you seeing an impact today on discussions that you're having with potential parties, either for joint ventures, for third-party management. I mean is there a hesitation around them moving forward? Is this having an impact at all on business today?Joseph V. SaffireAbsolutely no impact on our business today. The feedback we got about a potential transaction, that was unsolicited. We've gotten many calls from JV partners and third-party management owners, telling us that they're not going to stay. It's a risk.OperatorYour next question is coming from Steve Sakwa at Evercore ISI.Unidentified AnalystIf I'm doing my math correctly, I think FFO growth is projected at around 5% this year at the midpoint of your guidance. And effectively, Joe, you're saying that you can double FFO growth in '24. I know you've laid out a bunch of drivers. Which ones are the biggest contributors to that accelerating, I guess, earnings growth? Or which ones are creating big headwinds this year that you think may get neutralized or become tailwinds next year?Joseph V. SaffireSteve, I'll let Alex jump in a little bit here.Alexander GressSteve, when you think about 2024, I want to go back and just quickly say, to put in context, we are a relatively young company with a smaller base. As we've talked about in our meetings, we're very much continuing on our journey to grow and expand, and we've shown that. Since 2019, we've driven same-store margins up by 630 basis points than most of our peer group. So we recognize that. We recognize we have more work ahead. I think in terms of 2024 and specificity around the weight of each factor, while we are confident in that outlook, we're not going to give specific weightings to the individual growth drivers. But I would really go back and reiterate a couple of points that Joe made. It's a couple of different things from different factors, the growth of our same-store pool, the strong performance of our acquisitions, $5.5 billion of wholly owned and JV over the last few years, growth of 3PM and JVs and contribution from our lease-ups. We've talked about margin initiatives and improvements of at least 70 basis points in that outlook, and that comes from an investment in process and technologies. So it's continuing that journey of the 630 basis points that we've done to date.Unidentified AnalystOkay. And either Joe or maybe Alex, employee costs at the site have certainly been a big focus for everybody as people have tried to streamline kind of operations and improve margin. Maybe just talk about some of the things that you've done technologically, and what else is left to be done on the on-site personnel side? And how much of that factors into the 70-basis-point margin improvement over the next 2 years?Joseph V. SaffireSteve, I'll take that. Listen, thanks for acknowledging and talking about technology. Many may forget, we led the sector with the Rent Now program. When everyone else kind of laugh and said, we want to sell at the counter, we prove that technology can improve payroll, improve efficiency and actually improve customer service levels. So obviously, we're still heavily invested in our Rent Now program. We have dynamic pricing. We continue to look ways to increase the utilization of that channel. It continues to go up. But we're not just stopping with that. Obviously, there are other things that we can do to make the stores more efficient and maintain the livable wage that we provide. We invest in our people. We're very proud of our people. There are lot of the reasons why we are growing our 3PM business and our JV business. So we'll continue to invest in our people. But we're just trying to work smarter at the counter. We're trying to reduce the hours. We're using data. We have a ton of data that we're just really learning how to utilize. We've been hiring data scientists, and that data is helping us decide hours of stores, traffic, which stores do we need more people? Which stores can we pull back, but still keep them open? So there's a lot involved in that. Obviously, there's been talk of kiosks in the industry. We're looking at kiosks, a different type of kiosk, virtual management, a live agent at a kiosk. These are the types of things we're looking at, and we're excited about what they're going to do for us going forward.OperatorYour next question for today is coming from Smedes Rose at Citi.Smedes RoseI guess just with this year's guidance and next year's guidance, maybe you could just talk a little bit about what you're seeing kind of on the wages and benefits line? What you're thinking about for this year's growth in '23, and how you think that will grow in '24?Joseph V. SaffireSmedes, I'll let Alex talk a little bit about '23 in the payroll that we expect. But for '24, probably won't get that granular, but go ahead, Alex.Alexander GressSure. Yes. In '23, just specifically on the payroll and benefits line, obviously, very good coming off of 2022, coming in lower year-over-year. But as Joe alluded, we really invest in our people, and we really pride ourselves in customer service. So in '23, payroll is up, but nominally, certainly well below the pace of inflation. But it's probably between that -- around that 2.5% to 3.5% level. But if you look at '24, we see that continuing to normalize, if not come down more for the exact reasons Joe outlined. It's the continued investment in technology and specifically part of that is the continued rollout of our kiosk program that enables us to optimize hours at stores with lower physical count in the store and leveraging our call center operations.Smedes RoseOkay. And then, Joe, I just wanted to go back. When you said you had managed -- owners of managed properties calling and saying that they would drop out if PSA took over, -- what -- I'm just -- what's the version? I mean, is it because they're newer in that space? Or is it they don't like the brand? Or what -- like why would they do that?Joseph V. SaffireSmedes, I can't comment as to why they choose decisions. I know that when we're trying to win business, brand, people at the store, and really your performance in their region, they want to choose an operator that is outperforming the others. That's how their stores are going to perform. We invested in our people. We invested in our properties and they see how our stores are managed and they like that about us. I think there's many options in the third-party business. It's a very difficult business to win. We kind of got into it late in the game. But I think we're really punching above our weight right now. We're doing very well, and we're excited about the prospects going forward.OperatorYour next question for today is coming from Mike Mueller at JPMorgan.Michael William MuellerIn terms of the redevelopments that you talked about completing over the past few years, the returns, can you talk about the size of that pipeline because there's really nothing in the supplemental about it today. And what the pipeline could grow to over the next few years and just kind of marginal returns?Joseph V. SaffireSure. I mean, obviously, with our acquisitions, Michael, we kind of continue to build up a pipeline. Every acquisition we do, we look at opportunities to expand or enhance, do a knockdown. But the pipeline -- we have been targeting $60 million to [$70 million] a year in investment. We could do more. We could do $100 million. Sometimes there are constraints with municipalities and getting the appropriate approvals. Supply chain issue has been an issue, but we think that's getting a little bit better. So we -- our guidance kind of includes $60 million to $70 million, '23, '24 million, but we will do more if we can. We can get up to $100 million, $110 million. We have the capacity. We have our own construction team that just focuses on that. So a lot of it is in our control, but some of it isn't in our control, and that's supply chain and municipality speed. So our guidance, $60 million to $70 million a year, but I think we'll do better.Michael William MuellerAnd what is the typical redevelopment or enhancement? And is it -- and what portion of those tend to, I guess, have expansions tacked on to them as well?Joseph V. SaffireSo every year, it's kind of a constant building of our pipeline, our area managers, our store managers, and we kind of like bring up ideas and we have a whole committee around it, we looking for opportunities. And it can be everything from just knocking down an old drive-up facility and building up 3 stories climate control. It could be just changing the front of an office. It could be all sorts of things, Michael. It really depends on the project. We've had complete knockdowns. We had a store in the Sunbelt that just kind of kept flooding over a few years. And we ended up knocking the whole thing down and building a next-gen 3- or 4-story climate control building. And when you do that, obviously, climate control, you get better rates per square foot and so forth. So it really depends on the project, but it's a great program for us. It's a great use of our capital.Michael William MuellerOkay. And then just lastly on the view that margins are expanding about 70 basis points over the next, I forget if it was a year 2, is that more driven on the expense side? Or is that more driven on the revenue side? Just any color you can shine on that.Alexander GressMichael, it's Alex. I reiterate what we said a few moments ago. When you think -- when you look forward in the next couple of years, 70 basis points at least of margin initiatives, predominantly on the expense side. And so that's a reflection of what we said, the investment in technology and then the benefit of our scaling coming through our numbers. And so we would see benefits on payroll, Internet marketing and also continued rationalization of other expenses.OperatorYour next question for today is coming from Michael Goldsmith at UBS.Michael GoldsmithIn your presentation, you talked a lot about the Sunbelt and the continued growth there. Can you talk a bit about the performance of the Sunbelt relative to the rest of the portfolio in '22? And what are the expectations for that region and its impact on your '23 and '24 guidance?Alexander GressYes, Michael, it's Alex. And I think you can -- when you look at 2022 in our markets in the Sunbelt, really good production coming out of some of the key states in the area. I'd specifically call out obviously, Florida, Georgia as kind of the prime ones. So that's a good setup -- that's part of the good setup into 2023.Joseph V. SaffireYes. I mean it's just -- it continues to be -- if you go to Florida, I was just down there a couple of weeks ago, no one's talking about recession, it's incredible. So I mean, the demographics, the job growth speaks for themselves. And obviously, Florida has been just on fire for us the last couple of years, and we expect that to continue, Michael.Michael GoldsmithAnd you had a big acquisition year in 2021. So I guess I would expect that there would be a large contribution from some of the lease-up properties impacting your FFO growth in '22 and '23. But you're looking at like 5% growth. So I'm just wondering, and there's an acceleration in your '24 guidance. So just trying to better understand the dynamics from the lease-up properties and the acquisitions on the earnings growth over the next couple of years.Alexander GressMichael it's Alex again. Yes. I mean, go back to what we talked about in '24. It's really coming from a number of factors. And so we're not going to comment on the weighting. But definitely, it's continued growth of our same-store pool. Yes, it's the strong performance of acquisitions that we've done to date. $5.5 billion that's wholly owned, and of course, there's a JV number in there as well. So while we're not going to go into specific weightings, it's couple of different factors. And certainly the continued performance of our lease-up pool as part of it.Michael GoldsmithGot it. And just one more for me. You did a really nice job outlining your thoughts on the proposed acquisition and your case here. Have you received any approaches from any other interested parties?Joseph V. SaffireMichael, I can't comment on that.OperatorWe will take one more question, and your question is coming from Jon Petersen at Jefferies.Jonathan Michael PetersenWe just made the cut. Question on the margin. So I know some of your peers, I guess, Public Storage specifically breaks out direct and indirect expenses as part of their operating expenses. Can you just help us definitionally what do you guys put in OpEx? What do you put in G&amp;A? And any commentary on how that differs from your peers would be helpful?Alexander GressWell, I won't -- it's Alex. I won't comment, obviously, on the peer definitions. For us, in our same-store NOI margin, it's really direct operating expenses at the store level. Obviously, the payroll, property tax benefits, internet marketing, those utilities, those are the obvious line items. We don't include in their supervisory costs. So our regional managers, our AVPs, our RVPs, centralized costs come out into our G&amp;A.Jonathan Michael PetersenOkay. And then maybe if I could just ask one more question on -- since it's the last one, on where we're at, kind of in the process? Are you -- are you -- I know you hired bankers? Are you running a process? Are you actively considering all sorts of opportunities? Or it almost seems like the way you presented it you got this bid from PSA, not good enough, you're just moving forward business as usual. Like how should we think about how you guys and the Board are evaluating maximizing shareholder value right now? Does it go beyond just operating the business?Joseph V. SaffireWell, as CEO, I'm executing on our strategy, to be quite honest. But as we've said a few times now, the Board is always open to and will regularly evaluate opportunities to enhance shareholder value as and when they come. I can't really say more than that.OperatorI will now turn the call over to Joseph Sapphire for closing remarks.Joseph V. SaffireOkay. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to continuing to engage with our shareholders as we focus on driving strong shareholder value. Please follow up with Brent, if you have any additional questions related to the unsolicited proposal.OperatorThis concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.]"

While things have gotten a little messier since the January rally that kicked off the year, the tech-laden Nasdaq index remains up 10% in 2023. Tech stocks are rebounding following a brutal selloff in 2022 that dragged the Nasdaq lower by more than 30%. Many tech stocks have surged greater than 40% in a matter of weeks as investors’ appetite for risk improves and they rotate out of cyclical stocks and back into high-growth securities. While the bear market that has gripped Wall Street since November 2021 may not be over just yet, there are signs that technology is back on the radar of investors and that the worst might be behind us. With that in mind, here are seven high-growth tech stocks to keep your eyes on in the coming weeks and months.BABAAlibaba$94.78QCOMQualcomm$123.95MUMicron$56.98METAMeta Platforms$171.12NVDANvidia$207.54CRMSalesforce$163.36RBLXRoblox$37.55Alibaba (BABA)Alibaba Group headquarters sign located in Hangzhou China BABA stock.Source: Kevin Chen Photography / Shutterstock.comChinese tech stocks have been on the rise this year as the country’s economy finally recovers from Covid-19 and as Chinese authorities let up on their crackdown of  publicly traded technology firms. One of the chief beneficiaries of the reversal of China-based tech stocks has been Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), arguably China’s leading and best-known tech firm. Between the end of October and the end of January, BABA stock rose 90% to a peak of $120 a share.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBABA stock has pulled back in recent weeks, presenting a decent entry point for investors. With Alibaba, shareholders get one of China’s most advanced tech companies that is a global leader in everything from e-commerce and the Internet of Things to artificial intelligence.Moreover, in recent  quarters, the company’s earnings have surpassed analysts’ average estimates. Alibaba’s stock got a vote of confidence recently when it was revealed that it was one of the few securities bought by a notorious  bear, Michael Burry, during the fourth quarter of last year.Story continuesQualcomm (QCOM)Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on the side of a building in San Jose, CA.Source: jejim / Shutterstock.comAnother tech stock that has been marching higher and seems poised for more gains is Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). The San Diego-based company manufactures the semiconductors that are critical for 5G networks and the mobile phones that run on them. The demand for the company’s products is sky-high right now as 5G networks expand and become widely used within the industry. The red-hot demand explains why QCOM stock has risen 13% in 2023.A mature company that has been around since 1985, QCOM today trades at a moderate price-earnings ratio of 12, which is low for a technology firm of its size.The stock also pays a robust quarterly dividend that yields 2.4%. It’s also unusual for a tech stock to pay a significant dividend. But Qualcomm is facing a slowdown in mobile phone sales, which led the company to report subpar earnings.In its latest reported quarter, its revenue sank 12% year-over-year to $9.46 billion, and its net income fell 27% to $2.68 billion or $2.37 per share.But don’t count out QCOM stock over the long-term because it remains a leader of the 5G internet boom.Micron (MU)Micron (MU) logo on a mobile phone that's on a tableSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.comMicron Technology’s (NASDAQ:MU) fortunes have also improved during the first few months of 2023. So far this year, MU stock is up 14%. It’s a welcome change for the company that makes computer memory and data storage technology such as USB flash drives. Even with this year’s gains, Micron Technology’s share price remains down 35% over the last 12 months. With a P/E ratio of 10.3, the stock looks undervalued at its current levels.This year’s gains come as the company undertakes aggressive cost-cutting measures that have included layoffs of 10% of its workforce, a 40% reduction of its capital expenditures, and a suspension of the bonuses for its executives.Like many technology companies, Micron has struggled due to a a slowdown of computer sales and manufacturing disruptions in China over the past year. However, the company expects its supply-demand imbalance to be fixed later this year and is forecasting that its revenue will grow 43% year-over-year in 2024 as it returns to profitability.Meta Platforms (META)Meta Written On The Googles - Man Wearing Virtual Reality Goggles Inside A Metaverse. FTC investigating META.Source: Aleem Zahid Khan / Shutterstock.comMeta Platforms’ (NASDAQ:META) plans for a “year of efficiency” seem to have won over both analysts and investors. Since the social network released its fourth-quarter results, boosted its stock-buyback program, and announced plans to achieve efficiencies while dialing back spending, the company’s share price has been ripping higher. So far in 2023, META stock has gained 42%. The stock bottomed in early November at $88 per share.Meta’s plans to scale back its previous “growth-at-all costs” strategy and behave more like a mature company seems to be what Wall Street wanted to hear. The company’s stock was also driven higher by its plans to lay off 11,000 workers and plow less money into the Reality Labs unit that is developing virtual-reality technology to develop the metaverse.In 2022, Meta lost nearly $14 billion on Reality Labs. Many investors are hoping the company will return its focus to its bread-and-butter, online-ad business moving forward.Nvidia (NVDA)Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of nvidia corporation on computer keyboard. NVDA stock.Source: ShutterstockThe news keeps getting better for semiconductor company Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Hot on the heels of several  upgrades by analysts, Nvidia is being touted as a leader in artificial intelligence, with its chips expected to power the most advanced AI on the planet. And news just broke that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has signed a decade-long deal to bring Xbox PC games to Nvidia’s GeForce Now game-streaming service, in what amounts to a major boost for Nvidia’s games business.The spate of good news has dramatically improved the sentiment of investors towards Nvidia and its stock. So far this year, NVDA stock has gained 42%.The stock had been as high as $230 a share in February. After the company reported better-than-expected Q4 results, propelled by its gaming business, it appears that NVDA has put the demand and supply chain problems of the past year behind itself and can now focus more on the advanced semiconductors and microchips it makes that power everything from data centers to supercomputers.Salesforce (CRM)lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco. Salesforce layoffsSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comIt’s been a tumultuous time at cloud-computing giant Salesforce (NYSE:CRM). The San Francisco-based company has struggled to meet earnings expectations, its co-CEO abruptly quit last November, and it has been targeted by multiple activist investors who want to see major structural changes and a turnaround of its business. Its current CEO, Marc Benioff, has had a lot on his plate since last summer. However, all the tumult seems to have been good for CRM stock, which has risen 23% so far this year.Investors seem to be betting that sunnier days are ahead for Salesforce and that the ship will be righted in due course. Getting there won’t be easy, as the company announced that it is eliminating 8,000 staff or about 10% of its workforce. That’s big news, considering that Salesforce is the largest private-sector employer in San Francisco, while its headquarters is the city’s tallest building.Still, investors have signaled that they approve of the changes that Benioff is making at Salesforce and his initiatives that have made the company leaner.Roblox (RBLX)Roblox sign logo at headquarters. RBLX stockSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comThe shares of video-game developer Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) have been on an upswing since the California-based company announced fourth-quarter earnings that trounced analysts’ average expectations.Roblox reported a loss per share of 48 cents, above analysts’ average estimate of a per-share loss of 54 cents. The company’s revenue came in at $899.4 million, above the $881.4 million that analysts, on average, had expected, according to Refinitiv.However, what really stood out in the Q4 numbers was that Roblox had 58.8 million average daily active users, up 19% from the same period a year earlier.The Q4 print resulted in RBLX stock rising 26% in a single trading session. In 2023, the share price is up 32%. The company, while still unprofitable, remains in growth mode, announcing that users spent more than 12.8 billion hours engaged with its online video-game platform during Q4, up 18% from the final quarter of 2021. That’s a positive sign for the company’s future.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in MSFT and NVDA.

True, this year has already witnessed a solid performance in the market. Under common investing tactics, now may be a time to unwind certain hot players before they grow cold.Nevertheless, some companies that have already enjoyed upside success this year may still have more room to run. Some of this may come down to the reality that few investors appreciate underlying relevancies. Or in other cases, significant upside catalysts may be lying on the horizon. Either way, investors shouldn’t give up on all ideas just because they outperformed expectations. Below are stocks with more upside potential remaining.ANAutoNation$143.38MUSAMurphy USA$270.65FVRRFiverr$37.77MANManpowerGroup$85.99MCDMcDonald’s$268.55OLLIOllie’s Bargain Outlet$58.17GFSGlobalfoundries$63.11InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAutoNation (AN)assortment of cars in a parking lot representing GETR stock.Source: ShutterstockLet’s just get to the most controversial idea first on this list of stocks with more upside potential: car dealership AutoNation (NYSE:AN). Following a solid performance for its fourth-quarter earnings report, AutoNation shares jumped to an all-time high. Indeed, on the Feb. 17 session, AN popped up more than 11% of equity value. Understandably, though, many investors are hesitant about jumping aboard.Fundamentally, interest rates remain elevated compared to historical norms. Naturally, this dynamic translates to higher borrowing costs. And because the overwhelming majority of new car buyers finance their vehicles, the relatively exorbitant interest rates crimp demand for high-ticket items. Therefore, AN seems a risky bet.Nevertheless, it’s really one of the stocks with more upside remaining because the consumer doesn’t decide when to buy; the car does. According to the Wall Street Journal, the average age of vehicles on U.S. roadways hit a record 12.2 years. Invariably, anything mechanical will eventually break down. Thus, AN remains surprisingly relevant despite its massive upswing.Story continuesMurphy USA (MUSA)miniature oil barrel and oil well figures on top of stack of moneySource: ShutterstockFundamentally, Murphy USA (NYSE:MUSA) represents an easy idea for stocks with more upside remaining. To be fair, it’s been up only slightly since the Jan. opener. However, in the trailing year, MUSA enjoyed a blistering performance, gaining nearly 50% of equity value. Therefore, the common assumption may be to trim some exposure. In my opinion, though, it still has legs.Primarily, social normalization trends should bolster MUSA stock. More than a few major enterprises have called an end to remote operations. Naturally, employees who previously benefitted from work-from-home arrangements have cried foul. Aside from the utter foolishness of drawing attention to one’s self during a sensitive economic cycle, employers no longer have to play ball. Thus, the return of the morning commute should cynically bolster MUSA. Also, keep in mind that Wall Street analysts peg MUSA as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target stands at $314.25, implying nearly 15% upside potential.Fiverr (FVRR)A man in a suit pointing to a dollar sign representing SONX Stock.Source: NicoElNino / Shutterstock.comOn a related note to the bullish thesis for Murphy USA above, Fiverr (NYSE:FVRR) should be an intriguing idea. Basically, Fiverr may see an influx of independent professionals from two categories: the first involves those who got laid off. The second may stem from those who voluntarily quit because their employers asked them to come back to the office.Even if Fiverr doesn’t directly benefit from the rumblings in the workforce, it plies its trade in an incredibly relevant sector. According to Business Research Insights, the global gig economy reached a valuation of $355 billion in 2021. According to experts of the research firm, the segment may jump to $873 billion by 2028. This would represent a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2022 to the forecasted period of 16.18%.Presently, Wall Street analysts peg FVRR as a consensus moderate buy. To be fair, their average price target is $41.40, implying only 5.21% upside potential. Still, because workers really want the gig lifestyle, FVRR may jump even higher, making it one of the stocks with more upside potential.ManpowerGroup (MAN)two women working on laptops in office space with black PPE face masks onSource: Halfpoint/shutterstock.comWhile the gig economy should attract a significant amount of interested participants because of workplace normalization trends, the majority of worker bees will probably end up towing the corporate line. Thus, their means of resistance may equate to seeking another job. If so, ManpowerGroup (NYSE:MAN) may be one of the stocks with more upside potential.Since the start of the year, shares of the staffing agency gained nearly 5% of equity value. However, the rash of layoffs that began last year and continues this year should cynically bolster the enterprise. Further, as the layoffs pick up in intensity, workers will be more desperate to secure whatever’s available. In other words, the bravado will be gone as fewer opportunities in for instance the technology space materializes.Further, MAN makes an intriguing idea from a fiscal perspective. Currently, the market prices MAN at a forward multiple of 11.96. As a discount to earnings, Manpower ranks better than 63.82% of the industry. In addition, shares trade at 0.24 times (trailing) sales. For this metric, Manpower ranks better than 90.71% of sector peers. Thus, it’s one of the stocks with more upside potential.McDonald’s (MCD)Source: ShutterstockAs a well-established enterprise, no one expects McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) to deliver the blistering gains of a tech upstart. That said, it performed relatively well recently. In the trailing year, shares of the fast-food giant gained nearly 7%. In contrast, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index slipped more than 5% during the same period. Moreover, MCD gained over 2% since the January opener.That might have some folks considering a trimming of exposure. However, MCD in my view easily ranks among the stocks with more upside potential. As stated earlier, major enterprises have begun recalling their employees. Further, with an uncertain economic backdrop – especially with the mass layoffs – McDonald’s offers an enticing opportunity.Basically, the Golden Arches represents a beneficiary of the trade-down effect. For instance, rather than buying coffee at an overpriced coffee shop, people can go to McDonald’s instead: it’s the same caffeine, only cheaper. Also, Wall Street analysts peg MCD as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target stands at $294.17, implying 9% upside potential. Therefore, it’s one of the stocks with more upside remaining.Ollie’s Bargain Outlet (OLLI)sale signs stock bargainsSource: Champiofoto / Shutterstock.comWith skyrocketing inflation devastating the consumer in 2022, discount retailer Ollie’s Bargain Outlet (NASDAQ:OLLI) made plenty of sense for investors. Unlike discount-dollar stores, Ollie’s specializes in off-price name-brand products. It’s an attractive proposition for households looking for a deal. As a result, OLLI stock gained more than 41% in the trailing year.Since the start of the year, OLLI also skyrocketed to the tune of 24%. Naturally, such a powerful performance has folks wondering if it’s time to sell. For instance, while OLLI garnered a moderate buy consensus view among covering analysts, their average price target of $55.62 implies 4% downside. Despite a less-than-encouraging take on OLLI, it may still be one of the stocks with more upside remaining.Fundamentally, the rising number of layoffs suggests that people are beginning to hurt substantially. Therefore, OLLI should gain relevancy, not loses it. Moreover, while the Fed may be committed to killing inflation, it’s not going to do so overnight. Again, people are still hurting, which invariably lifts OLLI’s upside narrative.GlobalFoundries (GFS)Close-up Presentation of a New Generation Microchip. Gloved Hand Holding Piece of Technological Wonder. Semiconductor stocks are in the news.Source: ShutterstockIf you’ve been following the latest geopolitical headlines, GlobalFoundries (NASDAQ:GFS) makes plenty of sense. A semiconductor contract manufacturing and design company, GlobalFoundries benefits from the push to promote domestic chip manufacturing. Obviously, the coronavirus pandemic exposed the poor decisions behind critical resource dependency in China. Logically, then, GFS ranks among the stocks with more upside remaining.Recently, CNN reported that China would cross a political red line by providing lethal aid to Russia. If so, such an action could lead to a new cold war, this time between the U.S. and China. Further, this deteriorating relationship bodes poorly for tensions involving Taiwan.

Berkshire Hathaway's top five holdings accounted for roughly 75% of the company's entire portfolio value, as of Dec. 31 2022, Apple (AAPL) is the largest holding accounting for 38.9% of the portfolio's value. Bank of America (BAC) represents 11.19% while Chevron (CVX) falls just under 10%. The majority of those purchases were made by Berkshire within the last decade, driving a more than 200% return for shareholders during that time period.Berkshire's fourth and fifth highest holdings are famous Buffett buys. Coca-Cola (KO), which Berkshire bought in 1988, represents 8.51% of the portfolio while American Express (AXP), an equity Buffett began buying in the 1960s, is 7.49% of Berkshire's portfolio value. Buffett bought Coca-Cola and Freddie Mac in 1988, telling investors they'd ideally hold them long term.""We expect to hold these securities for a long time,"" Buffett wrote to shareholders in 1988. ""In fact, when we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever.""Above Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer breaks down Berkshire's top holdings.Key video takeaways:0:15 Berkshire's top holdings1:15 How certain Buffett picks have performed over the yearsVideo Transcript- Warren Buffett's annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholder letter is set to be released on Saturday. Now, the letter digs into Buffett's top holdings, how his investment strategy has played out over the last year, and what could come next for the firm. Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer is here with a breakdown of those top holdings. Josh, on over to you.JOSH SCHAFER: So, like most investors, Warren Buffett's diversified portfolio has consolidated over time. As of December 31, 2022, Berkshire Hathaway's top five holdings made up about 75% of the company's entire portfolio value. Apple is Berkshire's top holding, accounting for about 40% of the company's portfolio. That's about four times the size of the next closest company, Bank of America, which accounts for just more than 11% of Berkshire's holdings.Story continuesUp next is Chevron. The oil giant accounts for just shy of 10% of Berkshire's holdings, while Coca-Cola, one of Buffett's most famous investments, particularly given his insistence on always sipping that soft drink, represents 8 and 1/2% of the portfolio. And American Express a long time holding a Buffett rounds out the top five, accounting for 7 and 1/2% of Berkshire's holdings in this.- So I guess the question is, when the Oracle of Omaha bought these, how have they done? How have these stocks done since he bought them?JOSH SCHAFER: Right. So let's take a look at Apple first. And you would think buying Apple in 2016 might have actually been late, right? I mean, the iPhone came out right around here, and you see a big jump there. But really, when you take a look at where they bought it in 2016, let me just get my pen going here, they bought it in 2016 here. And then it took a big jump after that and then they've sort of benefited from Apple's growth in iPhone services and the services in cloud as a whole.Then when you take a look at Bank of America, they bought Bank of America, if we pull up a 10-year chart, they bought Bank of America in the early part here, back actually in 2011. So they bought Bank of America down here. You can see the ride that Bank of America went on after that. So in some senses there it was about buying Bank of America at the right price, basically buying almost the bottom of Bank of America, even lower than the great financial crisis.And then I want to round it out with Coca-Cola. This is a stock that Warren Buffett has owned for a long time, going back to 1988. That's around the time the Powerade came out, Coca-Cola's Gatorade equivalent. And you can see how they benefited from the long rise of Coke.When you take a look at a Coke Max chart, you can see that stock all time is up over 4,000%. And you can really see the big jump here that happened after Berkshire bought in those early days. Because again, guys, it's about, for Warren Buffett, it's about holding on for a long time and benefiting from those product innovations. Coke Zero didn't even come out until about I think it was 2005 or 2006, so think about how much that company has changed since '88. Over 30 years later, they're still along for the ride- And there's a reason why he's known as such a legend, right? Thank you so much, Josh Schafer.]"

Back then shares were less than $10 and Buffett himself was a mere millionaire. Since then, Berkshire shares have grown massively as Buffett turned Berkshire into the world's largest holding company with shares that sell for more than $400,000.The Oracle of Omaha, as many refer to Buffett, is now worth more than $100 billion according to Bloomberg’s Billionaire index. Recent stock purchases over the last 15 years have helped Buffett’s wealth massively increase. A five-billion purchase of Bank of America (BAC) in 2011, buying Apple (AAPL) in 2016 and more recently piling into oil company’s Chevron (CVX) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY).Above, Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer breaks down Buffett's recent string of investments that boosted his net worth.Key video takeaways:0:30 Buffett's net worth0:45 Buffett's top buys1:28 How BuffettVideo TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Warren Buffett's annual shareholder letter set to be released on Saturday. The letter and what Buffett is buying, of course, is going to be closely watched by Wall Street, given the billionaire's prior investment success, a heck of a lot of it. Our own Josh Schafer is here with a breakdown of how Buffett became a $100 billion man. How did he do it?JOSH SCHAFER: So when you take a look at Bloomberg's index, it says that Warren Buffett is worth $106 billion today. Nearly all of that is tied to Berkshire Hathaway stock, which Buffett started buying at less than 10 bucks a share in the early 1960s. Now today one share of Berkshire Hathaway class A shares costs about $463,000. But as Buffett's bets have grown bigger, some recent buys really stand out.Up first, Bank of America. Buffett famously piled $5 billion into the stock in 2011. And since then, shares have grown over 400%. Some thought Buffett was late to Apple when he started buying in 2016, but Apple shares have also risen more than 400% since he bought. And more recently, Buffett's been an oilman, dumping billions into Chevron and Occidental, which Chevron shares roughly doubling since Buffett significantly increased his position in late 2020, guys.Story continuesBRAD SMITH: OK, so where does Buffett stack up among the billionaires right now?JOSH SCHAFER: So he's not number one. We should start there, right? That's Bernard Arnault. He's number one, and then we've got Elon Musk at number two. And what I want to show you guys here, let's take a look at Elon Musk's net worth. See how that chart kind of moves up and down? It looks a little chaotic, right? Elon's still number two, but you can see, it almost looks like Tesla's chart, right, to some extent. These billionaires, it's very tagged to what their stock does, right? And then when you look at Mark Zuckerberg's, he also shot up very quickly with Meta. But then see how much he fell as Meta's stock fell.Then when you look at Warren Buffett, the slow process, right? Buy and hold, buy and hold. A little bit more of a steady chart there and significantly more than Zuckerberg. So that's sort of my biggest takeaway when you compare him to some of the other billionaires and maybe the modern tech billionaire, is Warren Buffett has been able to sustain, while some of these other billionaires are really pegged to one stock, one tech stock that has been a bit more volatile in recent years, while Buffett has been more consistent.SEANA SMITH: Slow and steady wins the race.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, indeed.SEANA SMITH: And we taught you that.BRAD SMITH: Yahoo Finance's own Josh Schafer breaking down all things the Oracle of Omaha. Buffett the stock market slugger here on the day. Thanks so much, Josh.]"

These five stocks are Apple (AAPL), Bank of America (BAC), Chevron (CVX), Coca-Cola (KO), and American Express (AXP). Apart from these, Berkshire has significant weights in Occidental Petroleum (OXY) and Kraft Heinz (KHC).With this, Buffett’s portfolio is heavy on the below-mentioned sectors and ETFs. Let’s delve a little deeper.FinancialsBuffett’s favorite America Express has exposure to ETFMG Prime Mobile Payments ETFMG Prime Mobile Payments Fund IPAY while Bank of America is heavy on the likes of iShares U.S. Financial Services ETF IYG.Digital payments have been in the front and center of consumer behavior lately. Apart from showing an increased interest in online shopping, customers are resorting to digital payments to clear their bills. Even, merchants and utility providers are increasingly advocating the same. This explains Buffett’s interest in this field.As far as banking stocks are concerned, though flattening yield curve could spell trouble to banking stocks, robust loan growth and rising interest rates are pluses. Backed by improvement in consumer spending, banks’ consumer banking businesses are likely to act as a tailwind. Trading revenues are other positives.EnergyBuffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has bet big on the energy companies over the last two years, scooping up loads of Chevron and Occidental Petroleum shares. But in the fourth quarter of 2022, the company sold 1%, or 2.4 million shares, of its Chevron position. Chevron is heavy on energy ETFs like Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund XLE and iShares U.S. Energy ETF IYE.Story continuesMeanwhile, Berkshire now controls more than 20% of the outstanding shares in Occidental. Occidental Petroleum Corporation has about 6.37% invested in First Trust Nasdaq Oil &amp; Gas ETF (FTXN). Whatever the case be, a small stake selling in Chevron and still a heavy weight in Occidental say that the energy ETFs are still in fine fettle.Operating backdrop for the energy sector is also upbeat. Russia announced 5% oil output cut in the coming month as the West enacted price caps on Russian oil and oil products. OPEC crude output too fell in January as the group wanted to keep global markets in balance. Chances of a recession in several economies in 2023 is also lower (which indicates decent demand for energy), though a soft landing is expected in many geographies.Consumer StaplesThis is a safe sector as it is non-cyclical in nature. The consumer staples sector tends to do well even amid economic growth slowdown and high inflation. Since consumers have to buy staples products even if they cut back on their discretionary spending, big manufacturers of food and beverages normally have the power to pass on the increase in costs to customers.Plus, ‘shrinkflation’ is helping the staples companies. ‘Shrinkflation’ is the term to describe the maintenance of companies’ margins by shrinking consumer products in weight, size or quantity while their prices remain the same or are increased. As companies are striving with high raw materials costs and supply-chain issues, many are cutting their product sizes and weights in response (read: 'Shrinkflation' to Save Consumer Staples ETFs).Buffett’s favorite Coca-Cola has substantial weight in ETFs like Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) iShares U.S. Consumer Staples ETF IYK, Kraft Heinz has a focus on Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) Invesco Dynamic Food &amp; Beverage ETF (PBJ).TechnologyApple recently recorded the biggest annual quarterly revenue drop since September 2016.  However, the company is benefiting from continued momentum in the Services segment, driven by strong App Store sales and the robust adoption of Apple Music and Apple Pay.But Apple’s focus on autonomous vehicles and augmented reality/virtual reality technologies presents a growth opportunity for the long haul.iShares U.S. Technology ETF IYW has aZacks Rank #2.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.54 a share five days away from its upcoming earnings release on March 1, 2023.Jazz Pharmaceuticals' Earnings ESP sits at 13.68%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.54 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.48.JAZZ is one of just a large database of Medical stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Boston Scientific (BSX).Boston Scientific is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on April 26, 2023. BSX's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.44 a share 61 days from its next earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Boston Scientific is $0.44, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 0.55%.Story continuesJAZZ and BSX's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

260,82baa78a-d390-3217-855a-28f30c97ba5a,TXT,2023-02-25,5 Relative Price Strength Plays to Keep for Your Buy List,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-relative-price-strength-plays-140402670.html,1677247442,STORY,"['POST', '^GSPC', 'SUN', 'RE', 'OMC', 'TXT']","[After a brief spell of relative calm, volatility has returned to Wall Street as market participants fret about a higher interest regime for a longer period and the possibility of a recession in 2023. With the January to mid-February welcome rally slowly fading away, it seems that investors’ confidence in risky assets like equities has been dampened to some extent.As it is, fears of higher interest rate hikes flared up following the above-consensus readings of the consumer price index and the producer price index of January. Apart from demonstrating the stickiness with which inflation is present in our current environment, this also indicates that the central bank has to go a long way to tame the price rise.In short, several strong economic data notwithstanding, the Fed’s tighter monetary control and higher interest rate regime is unlikely to terminate any time soon. Add to that the softness in consumer spending and looming signs of a slowdown. Therefore, volatile trading in U.S. markets is expected to continue for some time.In the current jittery market environment, investors who might want to stay exposed to the equity setup should focus on good investment opportunities. One of the ways such potential plays could be identified is to look for signs of relative price strength.Relative Price Strength StrategyWhether a stock has the potential to offer considerable returns is determined primarily by its earnings and valuation ratios. Simultaneously, it is essential to check whether its price performance exceeds its peers or the industry average.Upon such comparison, if we find that a stock is unable to match up to wider sectoral growth despite having impressive earnings momentum or valuation multiples, it may be better to avoid it.However, those outperforming their respective industries or benchmarks should be included in your portfolio since they have a higher chance of securing significant returns. Picking a stock that outperforms its peers ensures that you have a winning option on your hands. Then again, it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength. Stocks delivering better than the S&amp;P 500 for 1 to 3 months at least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy.Finally, it is crucial to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings of these companies. In order to do this, we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter’s (Q1) earnings to our screen. When a stock undergoes an upward revision, it leads to additional price gains.Story continuesScreening ParametersRelative % Price change – 12 weeks greater than 0Relative % Price change – 4 weeks greater than 0Relative % Price change – 1 week greater than 0(We have considered those stocks that have been outperforming the S&amp;P 500 over the last 12 weeks, four weeks and one week.)% Change (Q1) Est. over 4 Weeks greater than 0: Positive current-quarter estimate revisions over the last four weeks.Zacks Rank equal to 1: Only Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks — that have returned more than 26% annually over the last 26 years and surpassed the S&amp;P 500 in 23 of the last 26 years — can get through. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Current Price greater than or equal to $5 and Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50,000: A minimum price of $5 is a good standard to screen low-priced stocks, while a high trading volume would imply adequate liquidity.VGM Score less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy), offer the best upside potential.Here are five of the 14 stocks that made it through the screen:Omnicom Group Inc. OMC: It is one of the largest advertising, marketing and corporate communications companies in the world.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ordered company officials to attend town hall events after executives failed to attend an earlier meeting in East Palestine.The derailment has sparked a political battle and a blame game over railroad safety regulations, with residents voicing deep concern over the long-term health impact of the millions of pounds of carcinogenic chemicals spilled in their town.Some Republicans have criticized the Biden administration over the incident while some Democrats have pointed to regulations rescinded under former President Donald Trump. Trump, who is campaigning for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, visited the area on Wednesday.Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg toured the wreckage on Thursday after the Biden administration was criticized for not sending a cabinet official to the site sooner.The derailment might have been avoided if the railway company's alarm system had given engineers an earlier warning that bearings were overheating, the chair of the National Transportation Safety Board said on Thursday with the release of a preliminary investigation.Story continuesEarlier on Friday, the House of Representatives Oversight Committeelaunched a probeinto the derailment and sought documents from the U.S. Transportation Department on their response to the incident.(Reporting by Nandita Bose; writing by Kanishka Singh; Editing by Leslie Adler, Eric Beech and Diane Craft)]"

Berkshire Hathaway's top five holdings accounted for roughly 75% of the company's entire portfolio value, as of Dec. 31 2022, Apple (AAPL) is the largest holding accounting for 38.9% of the portfolio's value. Bank of America (BAC) represents 11.19% while Chevron (CVX) falls just under 10%. The majority of those purchases were made by Berkshire within the last decade, driving a more than 200% return for shareholders during that time period.Berkshire's fourth and fifth highest holdings are famous Buffett buys. Coca-Cola (KO), which Berkshire bought in 1988, represents 8.51% of the portfolio while American Express (AXP), an equity Buffett began buying in the 1960s, is 7.49% of Berkshire's portfolio value. Buffett bought Coca-Cola and Freddie Mac in 1988, telling investors they'd ideally hold them long term.""We expect to hold these securities for a long time,"" Buffett wrote to shareholders in 1988. ""In fact, when we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever.""Above Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer breaks down Berkshire's top holdings.Key video takeaways:0:15 Berkshire's top holdings1:15 How certain Buffett picks have performed over the yearsVideo Transcript- Warren Buffett's annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholder letter is set to be released on Saturday. Now, the letter digs into Buffett's top holdings, how his investment strategy has played out over the last year, and what could come next for the firm. Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer is here with a breakdown of those top holdings. Josh, on over to you.JOSH SCHAFER: So, like most investors, Warren Buffett's diversified portfolio has consolidated over time. As of December 31, 2022, Berkshire Hathaway's top five holdings made up about 75% of the company's entire portfolio value. Apple is Berkshire's top holding, accounting for about 40% of the company's portfolio. That's about four times the size of the next closest company, Bank of America, which accounts for just more than 11% of Berkshire's holdings.Story continuesUp next is Chevron. The oil giant accounts for just shy of 10% of Berkshire's holdings, while Coca-Cola, one of Buffett's most famous investments, particularly given his insistence on always sipping that soft drink, represents 8 and 1/2% of the portfolio. And American Express a long time holding a Buffett rounds out the top five, accounting for 7 and 1/2% of Berkshire's holdings in this.- So I guess the question is, when the Oracle of Omaha bought these, how have they done? How have these stocks done since he bought them?JOSH SCHAFER: Right. So let's take a look at Apple first. And you would think buying Apple in 2016 might have actually been late, right? I mean, the iPhone came out right around here, and you see a big jump there. But really, when you take a look at where they bought it in 2016, let me just get my pen going here, they bought it in 2016 here. And then it took a big jump after that and then they've sort of benefited from Apple's growth in iPhone services and the services in cloud as a whole.Then when you take a look at Bank of America, they bought Bank of America, if we pull up a 10-year chart, they bought Bank of America in the early part here, back actually in 2011. So they bought Bank of America down here. You can see the ride that Bank of America went on after that. So in some senses there it was about buying Bank of America at the right price, basically buying almost the bottom of Bank of America, even lower than the great financial crisis.And then I want to round it out with Coca-Cola. This is a stock that Warren Buffett has owned for a long time, going back to 1988. That's around the time the Powerade came out, Coca-Cola's Gatorade equivalent. And you can see how they benefited from the long rise of Coke.When you take a look at a Coke Max chart, you can see that stock all time is up over 4,000%. And you can really see the big jump here that happened after Berkshire bought in those early days. Because again, guys, it's about, for Warren Buffett, it's about holding on for a long time and benefiting from those product innovations. Coke Zero didn't even come out until about I think it was 2005 or 2006, so think about how much that company has changed since '88. Over 30 years later, they're still along for the ride- And there's a reason why he's known as such a legend, right? Thank you so much, Josh Schafer.]"

Start your free 7-day trial to get this news first.Beyond Meat surges on better-than-feared Q4 lossBeyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) rose a scorching 14% premarket after the plant-based meat maker lost just $1.05 a share in 4Q, better than the $1.18 consensus estimate. Sales also came in better than expected - $79.9 million vs. the $75.9M consensus - even though it was down 20.6% year over year.The company also posted a revenue guidance range of $375M to $415M, the midpoint of which is slightly better than the average analyst estimate of $391.4M.Bernstein hiked Beyond Meat's price target to $18 per share from the prior $10 and maintained its Market Perform rating on the stock, saying it expects the stock ""will remain range bound at these levels until a clear path to financial viability is clearer.""Piper Sandler is more bearish, reiterating an Underweight rating and a $6 per share price target. The research firm wrote, ""Retail sales declines continue to accelerate, and steady sales from its recently launched jerky are masking a greater acceleration in declines for the rest of its portfolio. Improvement may come in 2H23, consistent with guidance, but we still expect further downside near term, and many fundamental challenges remain that are not quickly fixed.""Shares were lately trading at $17.14 before the bell.Carvana loss steeper than than anticipatedCarvana (NYSE:CVNA) was off more than 4% in the premarket after the online used-car platform said it lost far more in 4Q than Wall Street had expected - $7.61 per share vs. the $2.12 estimate. Revenue, at $2.84B, was also worse than the $3.07B consensus.Looking ahead, the company warned of a further drop in sales, forecasting a “sequential reduction in retail units sold in Q1 2023 compared to Q4 2022.”After the report, BofA Securities and Deutsche Bank both lowered their price targets on the stock to $10 - the former from $12, the latter from $16. Deutsche Bank said, it believes 2023 retail units ""will likely decline vs. 2022,"" given the macro backdrop and Carvana's continued efforts at ""right-sizing its business,"" which means the company ""intentionally keeping its advertising expense and inventory levels lower, which leads to lower retail units sold.""Story continuesThe shares, which lost 98% of their value last year amid a struggling used-car market, were recently trading at $10.08 in premarket.Block delights analysts with solid earnings guidanceBlock (NYSE:SQ) flew more than 7% higher before the bell after the Cash App operator said it expects EBITDA to come in at $1.3B for all of 2023, better than the $1.28B average analyst estimate.Q4 earnings, at $0.22 per share, missed by $0.08. But Wolfe Research analysts hiked their price target by $15 to $95 per share, saying EBITDA visibility is a “welcome sight.”“SQ intends to hold its stated profit targets for 2023, suggesting the ability to flex its spending in the event that growth comes in slower than expected. We believe this may give investors a sense of increased visibility into future profitability, something that some have found to be uncertain at points prior to the print,” they said in a note.KeyBanc analysts reiterated a Key Idea designation on Block after earnings.Shares were recently changing hands at $79.50 premarket.Booking surpasses estimates on travel uptickBooking (NASDAQ:BKNG) said it earned $24.74 per share in the fourth quarter, topping the Street's expectations for $22, and revenue of $4B was just ahead of estimates as well.Q4 gross travel bookings totaled $27.3B, up 44% year over year (or 58% on a constant-currency basis). Room nights booked climbed 39% over last year.JPMorgan reiterated a Top Idea designation on the stock and raised the price target to $2,850 per share on ""solid"" Q4 results.

Guidance for Q3 came in well under consensus - $8.42 to $8.49 per share vs. the $8.92 estimate - but full-year guidance of $13.59 to $13.89 squared with analysts' expectations for $13.68.Mizuho analysts believe Intuit de-risked FY23 after offering conservative guidance.

270,7e72e8a1-1318-3676-b887-3ca9da0301d5,WHR,2023-02-25,Is It Worth Considering Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR) For Its Upcoming Dividend?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/worth-considering-whirlpool-corporation-nyse-124001864.html,1677328801,STORY,['WHR'],"[Readers hoping to buy Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR) for its dividend will need to make their move shortly, as the stock is about to trade ex-dividend. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Therefore, if you purchase Whirlpool's shares on or after the 2nd of March, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 15th of March.The company's upcoming dividend is US$1.75 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$7.00 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Whirlpool stock has a trailing yield of around 5.0% on the current share price of $139.09. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. See our latest analysis for Whirlpool Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Whirlpool's dividend is not well covered by earnings, as the company lost money last year. This is not a sustainable state of affairs, so it would be worth investigating if earnings are expected to recover. With the recent loss, it's important to check if the business generated enough cash to pay its dividend. If cash earnings don't cover the dividend, the company would have to pay dividends out of cash in the bank, or by borrowing money, neither of which is long-term sustainable. It distributed 48% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. Whirlpool was unprofitable last year, but at least the general trend suggests its earnings have been improving over the past five years. Even so, an unprofitable company whose business does not quickly recover is usually not a good candidate for dividend investors.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, Whirlpool has lifted its dividend by approximately 13% a year on average. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it.Remember, you can always get a snapshot of Whirlpool's financial health, by checking our visualisation of its financial health, here.The Bottom LineShould investors buy Whirlpool for the upcoming dividend? First, it's not great to see the company paying a dividend despite being loss-making over the last year. On the plus side, the dividend was covered by free cash flow."" It might be worth researching if the company is reinvesting in growth projects that could grow earnings and dividends in the future, but for now we're not all that optimistic on its dividend prospects.In light of that, while Whirlpool has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. For example, we've found 3 warning signs for Whirlpool (1 is a bit concerning!) that deserve your attention before investing in the shares.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

AIT is benefitting from improving the product line, value-added services, initiatives to drive operational excellence and cost-saving efforts despite raw materials inflation, industrial supply-chain issues and labor headwinds.Its Service Center Based Distribution segment is backed by break-fix MRO activity, sales process initiatives, ongoing pricing actions, secular growth and robust supply-chain investments across the U.S. manufacturing sector. Technical and engineering capabilities, backlog, automation demand, and diverse end-market mix, supporting favorable growth backdrop, are aiding the company’s Engineered Solutions segment.Applied Industrial has been strengthening and expanding its businesses through asset additions for a while. The Automation, Inc. buyout (November 2022) expands Applied Industrial’s footprint across key verticals and geographies, while supplementing its value-added services and cross-selling efforts. AIT’s acquisition of R.R. Floody (August 2021) enhanced its product offerings in the automation technology space. Also, its buyout of Gibson (January 2021) added value to its automation solution offerings. Acquisitions positively impacted its sales by 0.5% in second-quarter fiscal 2023 (ended Dec 31, 2022).AIT’s healthy cash position enables it to reward its shareholders handsomely. In the first six months of fiscal 2023, AIT paid out dividends worth $26.26 million. The company hiked the quarterly dividend rate by 2.9% in January 2023. Also, in August 2022, the company’s board of directors authorized a new share buyback program to repurchase up to 1.5 million shares of its common stock.In light of the above-mentioned positives, we believe, investors should retain Applied Industrial’s stock for now, as suggested by its current Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). In the past six months, the stock has rallied 23.6% compared with the industry’s 10.3% growth. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continues Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked companies from the Industrial Products sector are discussed below:Ingersoll Rand Inc.

273,cb3735f6-31bc-33cb-abb7-f8559f537825,SRE,2023-02-25,Veritiv (VRTV) to Report Q4 Earnings: What's in Store?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/veritiv-vrtv-report-q4-earnings-152703482.html,1677252423,STORY,"['VRTV', 'IGT', 'SRE']","[Veritiv Corporation VRTV is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2022 results, before the opening bell on Feb 28.Q4 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Veritiv’s fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $5.44, indicating growth of 48.2% from the year-ago quarter's reported figure. Earnings estimates have been unchanged over the past 30 days.Q3 PerformanceVeritiv reported year-over-year improvement in both revenues and earnings per share in the third quarter of 2022. Earnings in the quarter beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. VRTV has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 31.3%.Veritiv Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Veritiv Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseVeritiv Corporation price-eps-surprise | Veritiv Corporation QuoteFactors to NoteVeritiv has been witnessing strong organic sales growth, driven by a combination of above-market corrugated volume performance in the U.S. corrugated and flexible Packaging businesses, and the company’s growth-oriented initiatives within key industry verticals. This momentum has helped the company offset the impacts of lost sales from the divestiture of the Veritiv Canada business. This is likely to get reflected in its fourth-quarter results.The company’s pricing actions have helped offset the impacts of inflationary market price increases, primarily in the Packaging and Print Solutions product portfolios. Also, despite ongoing constraints in the broader supply chain, Veritiv has been able to mitigate some of the impacts on its customers by leveraging its portfolio of suppliers and its North America supply-chain network. These efforts, combined with the company’s initiatives to improve commercial and operational efficiency, are expected to have aided its margins in the fourth quarter.The Packaging segment has been benefiting from higher market prices and increased sales volume in all product categories and end-use sectors. Sales to manufacturing, healthcare, and food and beverage customers have shown improvement over the past few quarters. However, the lost volume associated with the divestiture of the Canada business is expected to have offset some of the gains.In the Facility Solutions segment, the loss in net sales due to the divestiture of the Canada business is expected to have been offset by increased sales of towels and tissues, food service products, and can liners in the fourth quarter of 2022. Demand picked up in the entertainment and hospitality end-use sectors in 2022, as the away-from-home activity resumed following the Covid-related closures. This has been partially offset by weak demand for the personal protective equipment product category, which had experienced strong demand in 2021 due to COVID-19. Growth in the broader facility solutions away-from-home sectors is likely to have been offset by lower demand for personal protective equipment products through the fourth quarter of 2022.The Print Solutions segment has seen higher market prices, driven by demand outpacing supply. This is likely to have been offset by decreased sales volume, as well as volume declines associated with the divestiture of the Canada business.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Veritiv this season.

This compares to earnings of $1.31 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 8.80%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this natural gas distributor would post a loss of $0.75 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.56, delivering a surprise of 25.33%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Northwest Natural , which belongs to the Zacks Utility - Gas Distribution industry, posted revenues of $375.25 million for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 28.27%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $294.09 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Northwest Natural shares have added about 1.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.5%.What's Next for Northwest Natural?While Northwest Natural has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Northwest Natural: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future.

This was primarily due to supply-chain disruptions, cost inflation and weakness in the Renewable Energy segment. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Supply-chain disruptions, including labor and material shortages, and high logistics costs, are hurting General Electric’s operations. These, among other headwinds, affected the company’s fourth-quarter performance by about 4 percentage points. While pricing actions are driving the company’s margin performance, raw material cost inflation, especially at shorter cycle businesses, is partly offsetting it. The company expects inflationary pressure to be a major challenge in 2023.Weakness in the Renewable Energy segment has plagued General Electric throughout 2022. Lower US onshore wind volumes and continued pressure from the onshore North America market dynamics are weighing on orders in the Renewable Energy segment. Revenues in the segment fell 17% year over year in 2022, with a 19% decline in orders. Inflationary pressure is weighing on the segment’s margin performance.With the onshore wind unit grappling with weak demand, General Electric has laid off hundreds of workers in North America, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. The company expects to reduce headcount by 20% sequentially at the unit in 2023.Given General Electric’s geographical diversification, adverse foreign currency movement is weighing on its top line. This too, is expected to have dragged on its shares. In 2022, the impact of forex woes on total revenues was $2 billion.Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderGeneral Electric presently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Here are some better-ranked stocks for your consideration:Parker-Hannifin PH currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

That is because the Mar 17, 2023 $35.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for General Electric shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, General Electric is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) in the Diversified Operations industry that ranks in the Top 34% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while five analysts have revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 66 cents per share to 12 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about General Electric right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

The oil terminal was bought by Equinor in 2009 in order to trade oil, especially from the U.S. markets.According to Alex Grant, Senior Vice President for crude, products, and liquids at Equinor, the oil market flow in North America has altered dramatically since the purchase in 2009, and the firm has supplied petroleum to other regions across the world more often. In the light of this information, the company believes that a new owner would be better positioned to advance the terminal. This sale also complements the company’s goal to consolidate its portfolio around key sectors while also enabling reallocation of money in areas where better competitive advantage is foreseen.The South Riding Point port will now resume normal operations under Liwathon's control. The duties pertaining to the South Riding Point staff members will also be taken over by Liwathon. The Bahama’s government has authorized the deal.

However, after a drawdown of nearly 10% in the stock price in the past six months, some investors must wonder if the bears are right about potential headwinds from the court ruling that the federal government can collect overpayments it made to the company due to UnitedHealth's misreporting on its Medicare Advantage plans.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with UNH. Click here to check it out. UNH 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of UNHPeter Lynch Chart of UNHAfter assessing UnitedHealth's operational status and its stock's market-based factors, I believe that despite the headwinds, a tremendous value opportunity exists as UnitedHealth looks underappreciated and oversold. Here's why.UnitedHealth: Operating Prowess and Value in AbundanceOperational reviewAlthough UnitedHealth is a life and health insurer with additional long-term solutions, investors must consider that the company also has another source of growth potential through its Optum business unit.Optum provides long-term health solutions with a digitalization aspect phased into its business model. In addition, Optum's ecosystem includes components such as practitioner consultations, pharmacy services and data analytics.Optum contributes to more than half of UnitedHealth's revenue mix, and its full-year growth of 17% shows just how potent the segment is. Sure, Optum's net profit margin of a little over 8% is not desirable. However, investors must consider two factors: 1) Optum is still in a growth phase with an emphasis on reinvestment, and 2) Optum provides business-wide synergies to UnitedHealth, which enhances its market position and potential future profitability.UnitedHealth: Operating Prowess and Value in AbundanceSource: UnitedHealthFurthermore, UnitedHealth's headline earnings are extremely attractive as both the composition of its earnings and the tangible results are aligned toward further success prospects.Insurers that provide long-term solutions have less lumpy earnings than property and casualty insurers. Thus, UnitedHealth's earnings from premiums will likely grow at a constant year-over-year rate.Story continuesAs displayed by the company's latest quarterly earnings report, UnitedHealth's year-over-year income from premiums skyrocketed. The line item's annual growth is partially due to harder pricing in the insurance industry. However, UnitedHealth's 25.9% life and health insurance market share means it has an advantage over its peers, allowing it to price its offerings more elastically.UnitedHealth: Operating Prowess and Value in AbundanceSource: UnitedHealthAlong with its premiums-based revenue stream, UnitedHealth derives some of its revenue from investments. Although the company does not boast significant income from investments, a year-to-date financial market recovery may mark a portion of UnitedHealth's asset base, consequently marking up its asset base.OutlookWith UnitedHealth's retrospective financial performance covered, the question beckons: What does the future hold for UnitedHealth?UnitedHealth's management affirmed a positive outlook for 2023 in November, stating that the company will likely deliver between $357 to $360 billion in annual revenue coupled with cash from operations worth $27 to $28 billion. In terms of residual value, I estimate that UnitedHealth will deliver up to $23.65 per share, which is favorable in today's macroeconomic environment.Sustained price advantages in the life and health insurance industry support the company's outlook. Although mean reversion is inevitable, insurers will probably continue to benefit from higher premiums in 2023. Additionally, Optum's secular growth is well beyond a conventional level, lending additional support to UnitedHealth's implied profitability.Valuation and dividendsUnitedHealth's asset base is easily quantified as most of its assets are quoted and available to the general public. Although less so than banks, insurance companies are best valued by observing their price-book ratios.At face value, UnitedHealth's price-book ratio is in overvalued territory. However, a closer look shows that the company's book value is growing exponentially, leaving the stock's price-book ratio below its intercept.UnitedHealth: Operating Prowess and Value in AbundanceFurthermore, UnitedHealth's forward price-earnings ratio is lower than its current price-earnings ratio. Additionally, its forward price-earnings ratio is at a 20% peer discount. Thus, a pooled analysis of UnitedHealth's price multiples implies that the stock hosts relative value.UnitedHealth: Operating Prowess and Value in AbundanceLastly, UnitedHealth provides some carry returns with a forward dividend yield of 1.34%. Moreover, UnitedHealth's dividends are sustainable as it hosts a medium-ranged payout ratio of 0.22 and a robust three-year dividend growth rate.UnitedHealth: Operating Prowess and Value in AbundanceNoteworthy risksA noteworthy risk relating to UnitedHealth is the cyclical change in security behavior witnessed since the turn of the year. As the diagram below shows, cyclical and high-beta stocks have outperformed lower-risk stocks due to an improved economic outlook. Thus, UnitedHealth's stock might continue to lack demand if investors resume their risk-on approach.UnitedHealth: Operating Prowess and Value in AbundanceAn additional risk in the pipeline is the aforementioned factor of tapering insurance premiums. Insurance premiums are priced at a multiyear high, and any signs of mean reversion will be seen as unfavorable by UnitedHealth's investors.Final wordI believe UnitedHealth's six-month drawdown could provide a value opportunity for those who are interested in the stock. UnitedHealth's long-term solutions are well supported by renewed growth stemming from its Optum segment. Moreover, sustained multiyear high insurance premiums pricing may lead to additional stock support.UnitedHealth's book value is growing at a rate of knots. More so, the company is undervalued relative to its peers on an earnings basis and provides a decent dividend.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

This included GAAP earnings per share of 81 cents, beating analysts’ estimates by one cent, and total revenue of $931 million, which represented a decrease of 2.1% year-over-year, but still exceeded Wall Street forecasts by an impressive $7.26 million.Story continuesFurthermore, the public utility company reported closing on 26 regulated water and wastewater system acquisitions in 2022.

The company’s policy of expanding via acquisitions could lead to increased from rising interest rates and higher input costs (for chemicals and other inputs).

This was on top of a press release that had to be put out, to refute claims that the company had broken any campaign finance laws in Florida.Sentiment perked up somewhat after NextEra declared a quarterly dividend of $0.4675/share, which is 10% higher than the previous payout of $0.4250.

The company sold 458,000 ounces of gold (up around 16% year over year) and 19 million pounds of molybdenum (stable year over year) during the quarter. Gold sales rose primarily due to increased operating rates and recoveries at the Grasberg minerals district.Consolidated average unit net cash costs per pound of copper were $1.53, up around 19% year over year. The upside was caused by increased energy prices, higher costs for sulfuric acid as well as maintenance and supplies.Average realized price for copper was $3.77 per pound, down roughly 15% year over year.

One approach to counter market fluctuations is to seek out the best mining stocks to buy. Mining companies are generally less vulnerable to economic instability as they provide the raw materials essential to various industries such as construction, technology, and manufacturing.As such, mining stocks can offer stability and growth potential to investors’ portfolios. This article will explore three mining stocks to buy that are poised to perform well in 2023 and beyond, despite market volatility. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThese stocks have shown robust returns relative to a rather volatile market of late. Thus, for those seeking to add defensiveness, these are three great options to consider.Let’s dive in. GOLDBarrick Gold$16.58FCXFreeport-McMoran$42.74AEMAgnico Eagle$46.51Barrick Gold (GOLD)How to Play Barrick Gold Stock Ahead of Today's EarningsSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.comIncluding Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) in a mining portfolio is essential. Under the leadership of CEO Mark Bristow, the company has thrived in recent years due to its effective management. The Canadian company has established a significant market presence with 13 gold and copper mining operations across regions from Nevada to sub-Saharan Africa. As the world’s second-largest gold mining company, Barrick has solidified its position as a dominant force in specific regional markets.The collaboration between Barrick and Newmont through their joint venture in Nevada Gold Mines is considered a transformative opportunity that could yield significant returns for both companies. Barrick has already established a strong market presence, evidenced by its impressive gross profit margin of 39%.Barrick is expected to achieve a net income of $1.6 billion this year, based on its $11.5 billion revenue. The company’s profits have increased annually by 15%, making it one of the mining stocks to buy with a solid runway.Story continuesFreeport-McMoran (FCX)Freeport-McMoRan Stock's Long List of Catalysts Boosts Its Buy StatusSource: 360b / Shutterstock.comOver the past few years, investors in Freeport-McMoran (NYSE:FCX), have experienced a turbulent journey. Following a misguided venture into the oil and gas industry, the company has returned its attention to its primary focus.Freeport-McMoRan is recognized as the biggest copper producer that is publicly traded globally and has also made a noteworthy contribution in producing gold and molybdenum. Although inherent risks are associated with investing in copper, investors who have taken that chance have seen a substantial return. Despite a challenging market, Freeport-McMoRan’s exceptional performance in the past year has set it apart from other listed stocks.Freeport-McMoRan is now rated as a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which investors may consider a favorable bet. This rating upgrade is due to the upward trajectory of earnings estimates, which is one of the most influential factors impacting stock prices.I like the diversification Freeport’s operations provide. Thus, for those looking for a more well-rounded mining stock, this is a top option in my books.Agnico Eagle (AEM)A pile of shining gold bars.Source: ShutterstockAgnico Eagle (NYSE:AEM) has maintained a track record of consistently surpassing the performance of gold and gold equities since 1998, achieving a compound annual growth rate of about +13%.Agnico Eagle Mines is headquartered in Toronto, Canada, and operates as a gold producer in Mexico, Finland, and Canada, with exploration and development activities in the United States. Compared to other gold stocks, Agnico Eagle has a higher risk profile. Since the beginning of January, AEM’s equity value has dropped by nearly 2%.Despite this, Agnico Eagle Mines gained 6.5% in the past year, which has increased optimism among potential investors. According to Gurufocus.com, AEM is currently valued fairly as a business. Although the company’s premium to earnings may be high, objectively speaking, its three-year growth rate of 16.6% is better than 73.42% of its competitors. Agnico’s net margin is also impressive, at 10.36%, which is better than almost 69% of its peers.Looking at the opinions of financial analysts, they consider AEM to be a “strong buy” based on consensus. Additionally, their projected price target for AEM is $63.23, indicating a potential increase of 20%. As a result, investing in AEM would be a wise decision for those interested in purchasing gold stocks to protect against inflation.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald has a position in AEM. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Chris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

I would like to thank all of you on the call and the webcast for joining us today. We appreciate your participation. Joining me on this call, are John Larsen, Chair President and CEO; and Robert Durian, Executive Vice President and CFO. Following prepared remarks by John and Robert, we will have time to take questions from the investment community. We issued a news release last night, announcing Alliant Energy's fourth quarter and year-end 2022 financial results, and affirmed our 2023 earnings guidance. This release as well as an earnings presentation, which will be referenced during today's call, are available on the Investor page of our website at www.alliantenergy.com. Before we begin, I need to remind you the remarks we make on this call and our answers to your questions include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include, among others, matters discussed in Alliant Energy's press release issued last night, and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements. In addition, this presentation contains references to non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP measures are provided in the earnings release, which is available on our website. At this point, I'll turn the call over to John.Story continuesJohn O. LarsenThank you, Susan. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 2022 was another successful year of solid operations and financial performance. This was our 13th straight year of delivering results in our 5% to 7% adjusted EPS growth range, and the 20th year, 2 decades straight of consecutive dividend increases. We had one of our best reliability years on record with top-tier performance. Our wind generation produced the most wind energy in our history, providing approximately $160 million of fuel cost savings for our customers. We continued our progress towards net 0, decreasing carbon dioxide by nearly 40% off of 2005 levels. And we capped off 2022 with very strong economic development, in both Iowa and Wisconsin with over 100 megawatts of announced load that will bring new jobs and new investments. As I reflect on the past year, what makes me most proud of Alliant Energy is the continued dedication and service from our employees. As they strengthen our connection with the customers and communities we proudly serve. In 2023, we will be celebrating Alliant Energy's 25th year. I'm proud to be part of Alliant Energy. I'm proud of our team, and I'm inspired by our purpose to serve customers and build stronger communities. Our employees focus on this purpose has enabled us to once again, deliver the results you have come to expect from Alliant Energy. Our purpose continues to be the source of our strength and guides us through the ever-changing dynamics, within our economy and our industry. I'll highlight a few areas of progress and then turn it over to Robert to recap financial results and provide an update on regulatory proceedings. In 2022, we continue to execute on our Clean Energy Blueprint by adding renewables in the states where our customers live, which allows us to invest in the communities we served, and add skilled union jobs and local revenues. This is another example of how our purpose is at the center of our strategy. We added 250 megawatts of solar at our Bear Creek, North Rock and Wood County Wisconsin sites, positioning us as the largest owner-operator of solar generation in Wisconsin. We are on track to bring into service an additional 850 megawatts of utility-scale solar, by the first half of 2024 in Wisconsin. We continue to progress our Clean Energy Blueprint in Iowa, advancing renewables and our efforts to place electric lines underground, improving the reliability of our system. And while we are not yet at the conclusion of the advanced ratemaking process in Iowa for our solar and storage projects, we continue to follow the well-defined steps within the regulatory and procedural process to demonstrate that these projects are cost-effective and reasonable. We remain confident these projects are in the best interest of our customers and will supply the energy, reliability and resilience, that our customers depend on. Another great success story is the advancement of solar gardens. We are building one near Cedar Rapids, Iowa with Transamerica and Aegon as our main customers, and we're partnering with Mercury Marine in Wisconsin to build a similar solar facility. These projects help advance the sustainability objectives of our customers. And we also use these local investments to advance our focus on the social part of ESG, providing some of the solar energy to partners like Habitat for Humanity. This continued focus on economic development and our customers were contributing factors, in being named a top utility in economic development by Site Selection magazine, for the fourth year in a row. And I'm proud to say that this work also contributed to the recently being awarded the Chairman's Award for Workforce Development leadership, which is the center for energy workforce development's highest honor. While we were proud to receive many recognitions this past year for the work that we do in our communities, the recognition I'm most proud of, focuses on our employee experience. For the fifth year in a row, we were named by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, as the best place to work. And for the fifth year in a row to Forbes list of America's best midsized employers. And speaking with many of you, one of the things I'm reminded of is our strong core investment thesis. That is why you choose to invest in our company. Simply put, we delivered consistent results. Our well-executed forward-thinking and flexible strategy, coupled with constructive regulatory jurisdictions, has been a major part of our success. We not only deliver near-term results, but continue to take steps to help reduce future risks and provide the stability investors have come to expect from our company. A well-executed strategy has positioned us as a leader on the path to a clean, reliable and affordable energy future. We are well positioned to quickly adapt to a dynamic economic environment and weather challenges, while delivering on investor and customer expectations. 2022 was a clear example of this. Our efforts to move lines underground, continue the advancement of solar projects and strong operations in the face of weather events. While delivering solid results for our investors and reliable service for our customers, underscores the flexibility of our strategy and the dedication of the team, I am privileged to lead. And speaking of dedication, I want to pass on my appreciation to our employees that have worked through difficult conditions in the recent weather event to safely restore our power to our customers. As we move forward in 2023, you can have confidence that we will continue to take the required action that is needed to meet our customers' needs. We thank each one of you for continuing to be engaged in our journey and we look forward to connecting with you throughout 2023. At this time, I will now turn the call over to Robert.Robert J. DurianThanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we announced 2022 GAAP earnings of $2.73 per share compared to $2.63 per share in 2021. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of temperatures and nonrecurring adjustments, our earnings per share increased 6% from 2021. Looking year-over-year, the increase in 2022 was driven by higher earnings from capital investments at our Wisconsin utility, and higher electric and gas margins. These favorable drivers were partially offset by higher financing and depreciation expenses. Our diverse retail customer base supported the higher electric and gas margins in 2022. Residential temperature-normalized electric sales increased by almost 1%, largely due to strong customer growth. We also saw higher-than-expected sales from commercial customers with continued recovery from COVID, for several business sectors in our service territory. These were offset by lower industrial sales, primarily due to temporary plant shutdowns at some of our larger customers. In 2022, we also saw better-than-expected temperature normalized natural gas sales, enabled by solid customer growth. The 2022 results, we are sharing today are a result of our consistent efforts to manage through and mitigate ongoing inflationary pressures. We're extremely proud that we kept 2022 utility operating expenses in line with 2021, and we were able to manage through and offset the negative impacts on earnings from rising interest and fuel costs. Our work in 2022 accelerated strategic initiatives that will set us up for many years to come. We invested in economic development and electrification that will enable future sales growth. We updated our resource planning to maximize Inflation Reduction Act benefits, and meet the new MISO seasonal reliability requirements. And we accelerated technology and automation investments to improve efficiency. As we look to 2023, we anticipate operating and maintenance expenses will be lower than 2022, continuing our trend of flat to declining O&amp;M to enable cost savings for our customers. We recorded a few nonrecurring adjustments in 2022. These included $0.03 per share related to the Iowa state income tax rate change, $0.02 per share related to retirement plan settlement losses, at the end of 2022 and $0.02 per share related to a reserve adjustment for American Transmission Companies base ROE changes. Turning to 2023. We are positioned for another year of consistent 5% to 7% earnings per share growth. We are affirming our 2023 earnings guidance range with a midpoint of $2.89 per share, representing a 6% increase over 2022 adjusted earnings. Our 2023 earnings drivers include earnings on customer investments in our core utility business, and our continued efforts to reduce cost to increase customer value. Higher depreciation and financing expenses associated with these investments will partially offset these positive drivers. Our efforts to support customer value through making smart investments in our future support our ability to consistently deliver strong financial results. Other key assumptions for 2023 include growing sales by approximately 0.5% of 1%, led by higher sales to our commercial and industrial customers. And we estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of 1%, with substantial production tax credits generated by our large wind portfolio and growing solar portfolio, helping us maintain low effective tax rates for the upcoming year and several more years to come. The benefits from these production tax credits are passed on to our electric customers to help them manage their bills and therefore, are largely earnings neutral. Our financing plans for 2023 include a mix of new debt, supplemented with modest new common equity to finance our investments in renewable projects and to support refinancing a $400 million debt maturity in 2023. In December, we launched an at-the-market or ATM program, as our intended approach to raising up to $225 million of new common equity throughout 2023, which is in addition to the $25 million of common equity that we expect to raise under our DRIP plan. And in January, we entered into an interest rate swap to help reduce the risk of rising interest rates, related to a portion of our variable rate debt. The 2023 financing plan is driven by robust capital expenditure plans and supports our objective to maintain the capital structures at our 2 utilities, consistent with their most recent regulatory decisions. Next, I'll highlight this year's key regulatory initiatives. Last month, we provided additional testimony and evidence to the Iowa Utilities Board and IPL's advanced remaking proceeding. This testimony and evidence further demonstrates that IPL is taking prudent actions to meet its customers' need for capacity by advancing Iowa-based solar and storage projects that represent cost-effective solutions compared to alternative options available in the market. We also informed the IUB that we have identified our self-developed Creston and Wever projects as the second 200 megawatts of solar products, in addition to the 200 megawatts build transfer solar projects at the Duane Arnold site. To date, we've provided all the information requested by the IUB demonstrating that these projects are in the best interest of our customers. The IUB's decision this week to pause the advanced rate making process is procedural. We are working through both the regulatory and judicial processes in parallel, and following the well-defined process to move these projects forward. Next, we expect the IUB to file a response with the District Court in early March. We are confident these projects will provide considerable customer benefits, including reliability and resiliency and remain committed to executing these projects while we await the IUB's final rule. In Wisconsin, we are awaiting a decision from the PSCW on WEC Energy's purchase of a portion of our West Riverside natural gas generating facility. We are also anticipating decisions from the PSCW in 2023 on WPL's request for 274 megawatts of battery storage. 175 megawatts of these battery projects would complement 2 of WPL solar projects and 99 megawatts of the battery projects will be located by our Edgewater Generating Station to take advantage of the existing infrastructure and transmission rights at that location. Finally, we plan on filing a normal biennial electric and gas rate review in Wisconsin for test years 2024 and 2025 in the second quarter. In both states, we are also anticipating making filings to support additional resources for growing dispatchable generation capacity, needed to improve seasonal reliability and meet customer energy needs. As always, we continue to move forward proposing energy investments that support both sustainability and resiliency, keeping our customers' needs top of mind. I will conclude with a recap of the prominent legislation enacted this past year that has set us up for a solid future financial success, while providing significant customer cost benefits. Alliant Energy is a strong beneficiary of the Inflation Reduction Act. As it directly supports our strategic plans to advance cleaner energy for our customers, while providing significant customer and investor benefits. The IRA enables additional rate base opportunities while also lowering customer costs with a shift from tax equity to full ownership for our planned solar and battery projects. In our November 2022 refreshed capital expenditure plan, we incorporated the benefits of the IRA along with the changes from the MISO seasonal construct, which provides visibility to our planned 8% rate base growth through 2026. Another key element of the IRA improves our cash flows. Through the ability to transfer renewable tax credits, starting with those generated in 2023. With a large portion of wind and solar projects, we anticipate that we'll be able to transfer up to approximately $150 million of 2023 tax credits. As we continue to add more solar and battery projects over the next few years, the amount of annual transferable credits will continue to grow. We expect this to positively impact our credit metrics through acceleration of cash and reduction in future external financing needs, and to lower customer cost by reducing carrying costs on tax credit carryforwards. The IRA will provide significant benefits for our customers and investors with no notable downsides. As we expect to remain exempt from the alternative minimum tax for the foreseeable future. And finally, we also expect to benefit from new state tax legislation enacted in Iowa in 2022, which is lowering state corporate tax rates, enabling us to pass millions of dollars of annual savings on to our customers in Iowa for decades into the future. We appreciate your continued support of our company, and look forward to meeting with many of you in the coming months. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question-and-answer session.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners.Shahriar PourrezaSo just 2 quick ones here. I guess, first one is as we kind of look ahead to the rate case filing in Wisconsin, you guys built up a substantial fuel deferral last year at WPL. How should we be thinking about, I guess, your regulatory pathways to spreading this out and more broadly, I guess, how should we be thinking about the total rate increases you're targeting, i.e., is there a double-digit guardrail here? .Robert J. DurianYes, Shar. This is Robert. So think of those will be separate proceedings. So we'll go through the process with the 2022 fuel costs, validating the prudency of those costs. And then most likely starting maybe even later this year, the recovery process of those costs. Regarding the rate case in Wisconsin, think of that as a separate process. Most likely, we'll file that sometime in early second quarter. And we'll be identifying what those recoveries for really, what I would say is very transparent rate base additions that we've been signaling to the commission for some time. That rate case is largely going be centered around the solar projects, the 1,100 megawatts that they've been talking about, especially moving from tax equity to full ownership. So that on top of the battery projects that I mentioned in my prepared remarks, are going to be the key rate base drivers. And so that is going to be well transparent with the commission and we think that will go over pretty well. As far as the increases for customers' bills, we're targeting single-digit percentages for '24 and '25 when you factor in all of those pieces, including what we see is some nice benefits, as far as fuel cost reductions from those solar projects will be putting into service as well as the tax benefits.Shahriar PourrezaOkay. Perfect. The last point was what I was trying to get at. And then just I guess, maybe a familiar question at this point, but any sort of incremental clarity or thoughts on how we should be thinking about the equity needs post '23, as you work through the cash flow impacts of the IRA? And are you still targeting roughly $100 million to $200 million of cash flow benefits from the ITC PTCs?John O. LarsenYes. I think you've got the number right, Shar, on the IRA benefit. So I think that's -- it really hasn't changed a whole lot. Maybe one thing I'd add is given our continued focus on solar and renewables, we do think we'll be one of the early adopters and beneficiaries of the IRA with the projects we have in flight right now.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithHope you guys are well. Perhaps just picking up where Shar left off, just a little bit further, if I can, the sake of it. On Colombia and the fuel situation there, how are you managing that impact on Wisconsin rate payers and perhaps more specifically, how are you managing coal supplies today considering the backdrop? Just sort of where do we stand today? I mean, are we largely through some of these issues? Or what's the latest, if you will?John O. LarsenYes. Maybe I'll take the coal supply part. We've done a lot of work on a number of fronts in 2022, Shar, and even a bit ahead of that on the coal supply. So we feel in very good shape, as we go forward on the coal supply. And maybe I'll let Robert if you want to talk a little bit about -- more on the fuel part.Robert J. DurianYes, Julien, I think of that we're looking at a bunch of different options right now, as far as spreading those fuel cost recoveries over multiple years, really to help, as I indicated before. Manage the customer bills to reasonable levels as far as increases over the next couple of years.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithGot it. Okay. Fair enough. I appreciate. Just talk to us a little bit about the core challenge, the decision to create kind of a parallel pathway here in pursuing some degree of certainty on that construct, if you will, just the strategy, right? Typically, we see these kinds of more nuanced issues continue to remain within the confines of regulatory processes. Maybe that's the way I'd frame it.Robert J. DurianYes. When we think about how we're approaching that, I'll maybe talk a little bit about the procedures that we've been through since the last time we talked in the third quarter call. So, in December of 2022, the IUB did grant us the authority to move -- basically reconsider the 200 megawatts of solar at the Duane Arnold sites. But they did not allow us to reconsider the second 200 megawatts of solar. Really what they were looking for, there's some more specific details on the location of the projects that haven't been identified yet. .And so when we took the opportunity then in January to do is provide all the information the IUB was requesting, including evidence that now demonstrates a pretty comprehensive record that shows that our projects are the most cost effective and reasonable solutions for the customers, when you compare them to some of the other alternative sources of supply that are available. As part of that process, we really didn't have a pathway forward for the second 200 megawatts of solar or 75 megawatts of battery. So we filed a judicial review to allow us to move that forward, and continue to progress that as far as the opportunity for the advance remaking principles. So as part of kind of the most recent developments with that earlier this week, the IUB issued an order really causing the decision to let the traditional process to move forward, and we expect the IUB -- we'll be making a filing or filing some information with the courts, most likely by the first part of March and after which, then we'll most likely be making some -- also some filings on that. And I kind of think of these, as all procedural steps to really allow us to continue to move forward with the process to be able to get those advanced banking principles. I think it's really important for us to highlight that we remain committed to these projects. We think they're great projects for our customers and they're very cost effective. So we're confident in our ability to move forward with them, but we have to go through these procedural steps to really allow us the opportunity to have those advanced rate purchases.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithAwesome. All right. And then just quickly next rate case in Iowa, just how does it fit in here, if you will, if there's any consideration around it?John O. LarsenYes, Julien, we signaled by the first half of '24. But think of it as the timing with the next rate case is going to be about our next CapEx that we have, and Robert talked about that with solar. Right now, the current schedule of those solar projects are in service by end of 2024. So if you think of those as tied together, but we'll tighten up that time frame as the year progresses.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Nicholas Campanella from Credit Suisse.Nicholas Joseph CampanellaHappy Friday. So can you just -- I just wanted to tie off the calendar here. Can you just give us a sense of how long the judicial process lasts before the advanced ratemaking docket will resume essentially?Robert J. DurianYes. Nick, this is Robert. So there's no definitive time frame regarding the judicial process, but we have asked for expedited review is how I'd characterize it. Largely because as we continue to move forward with these projects, like a lot of the other utilities, we are seeing costs continue to increase. So we have a desire to try and get these in, as soon as possible to make them as cost effective as possible for our customers. But there is no definitive time frame, but we'll be continuing to work closely with both the IUB as well as the judicial process to try and get these done as quickly as possible.Nicholas Joseph CampanellaGot it. And obviously, you have a long history of these RPUs providing solid returns for your renewables investments. I guess just if you were to kind of pursue a plan where you're moving some of these new investments more into that retail base rate and a traditional -- in a more kind of traditional rate filing. Is the midpoint of your long-term guidance, the 6% still achievable on that strategy? Just trying to understand if it's a headwind or not.John O. LarsenYes, Nick, John here, and we're still very confident in our 5% to 7% in midpoint. .Nicholas Joseph CampanellaGreat. And then just one last one for me, is just with all the attention on deferred fuel and as we kind of progress through recovery, have you quantified how much of a drag that is on your credit currently and what the improvement could be?Robert J. DurianYes. Nick, when we look at, I'll say, AEC as an entire company, specifically at the FFO to debt metric, we are slightly below the targeted level for AEC, largely because of the timing of those fuel cost recoveries, as well as some additional solar construction costs. We incurred financing on, in 2022 as a result of pivoting away from a tax equity partnership to full ownership. .We expect those credit metrics to improve materially when you look out about 12 months. As we begin to recover those fuel costs as well as we get to the next rate case in Wisconsin where we'll start recovering those additional solar costs as well. So -- so we feel very confident about the ability, like I said, within the next 12 month window to be able to improve those metrics. We're also cautiously optimistic that as early as 2023, we might be able to start realizing the benefits of our tax credits that have available to be sold now into the market as a result of the IRA. So a lot of positive developments we see over the next 12 months when it comes to those credit metrics.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel from Scotiabank.Andrew Marc WeiselJust (inaudible) on question on the solar capacity in service next year. (inaudible) how does that factor in ROEs (inaudible) market construction or the (inaudible) ratemaking process is done? If so, can the ROE be modified during after construction? Or would the construction not begin until that's resolved?Robert J. DurianYes, Andrew, I would think of it, as we'll continue to work the process with the advanced rate making principles over the next few months. We still have a little bit of time, I would characterize to be able to get through that process, and not need to start those construction projects. But once we get to the second half of this year, I would expect that we'll be starting the construction. And hopefully, we'll have all of the RPU process that's completed, and get an answer from the IUB to support them.Andrew Marc WeiselOkay. I guess what about the part about -- do the ROE need to be locked in, before construction? Or can that -- can the uncertainty continue during construction?Robert J. DurianWe would expect that we'll be locking in the ROE before construction starts. We need to, like I said, follow those procedural steps to make that happen. But I don't think that we'll be starting that construction until we have better clarity on that. .Andrew Marc WeiselOkay. Very good. Then switching to Wisconsin. I know you're going to file in the couple of months, second quarter of this year. Obviously, your neighbors saw some bumps in the road, with their rate case last year. My question is, are you able to share any lessons learned from that or any changes to your approach? And do you think the settlement might still be possible? Or is that off the table?John O. LarsenYes. Andrew, I'd say we're -- we feel well positioned for the filing that we have. So it really isn't a change for us. We've used what we call our Clean Energy Blueprint process to be very transparent on the projects that we'll have. And in fact, many of them have already been in front of the commission or vetted and very strong cost management. So we understand the balance with affordability. As far as settlement, it's certainly always a possibility as we think about filing. We're certainly well positioned, if we'll go through the entire process, but also see the opportunity for potential settlement along the way.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Alex Mortimer from Mizuho.Alexander MortimerSo I know you mentioned the transfer of about $150 million of tax credits in '23, and then eventually having that grow to somewhere around $200 million. I'm just curious what the growth trajectory of that looks like if that's a '24, '25 story? Or if there's sort of a later date that you're looking at the $200 million number for?Robert J. DurianAlex, this is Robert. So think of that $100 million to $200 million was identified as the 2023 number, which we picked the midpoint there of $150 million. As we complete the construction of the 1,100 megawatts of solar in Wisconsin, we continue to add up to 350 megawatts of new battery projects. Those tax credits actually get probably closer to $300 million to $400 million on an annual basis. And think of that over probably once you get to the '25 time frame, you'll see those types of levels. So -- so that's what gives us a lot of optimism about future cash flow opportunities, when it comes to the transferability of these tax credits.Alexander MortimerOkay. Wonderful. And then you mentioned the FFO to debt target. Just what is the amount you're targeting for that? And then sort of -- what's the time line you're looking at, getting there with all the tailwinds provided from the IRA?Robert J. DurianYes, for AEC, our consolidated group, think of that in that 14% to 15% range, and we expect to be at that point, like I said, in the next 12 months in that 2024 time frame. .OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Ashar Khan from Verition.Ashar KhanI think from my question has been answered, but if I can just summarize it. So by the time we come -- and hopefully, I'm sure you'll be able to do it, but if I can just put it in my notebook. So by the time we come to the second quarter call in end of July or early August, you're expecting some kind of resolution by the courts and IUB, on the advanced rate making process because that is when I guess you need to start construction. Is that a fair kind of like, time line by which this issue has to be resolved by?Robert J. DurianI think that's a reasonable estimation of the time line when we think about the second half of 2023 and the start of construction, we're looking for the opportunity to get through all of the IUB and ages are used by that point in time. We don't have complete control over that. But again, we're going to addition, the fact that our expeditious review of this will really help support our customers and bringing in those cost-effective solutions for them quicker. So I think your time frame is, generally speaking, a good one. .Ashar KhanOkay. And then if I'm right, just I know I hope we don't get into the situation, but I think so you have said that, that if in case it doesn't go our way, you can then substitute that CapEx with some things pretty quickly, something else in its place, so the rate base growth and the earnings growth do not get pumped from the delay in the project or the cancellation of the project. Is that the correct assumption as well?Robert J. DurianYes. I mean there is a strong need for capacity when you think about, as we project out and as part of our resource planning with the retirement of our Lansing coal plants, here in the first half of 2023. We know we need additional resources. We think these are the best resource options for us. But if they're not supported by the process that we're going through, we do have other potential avenues for capacity resources that we'll need to put into place. .Ashar KhanOkay. And my last thing, if I may. I might not have heard it properly. So what is the likely timing of the next Iowa rate case?John O. LarsenYes. What I had shared was we've communicated by the first half of 2024. And again, as we noted, that's going to be tied to the final timing of our solar projects within IPO.OperatorThere are no further questions at this time. I would now, turn the call back over to Ms. Susan Gille for closing remarks.Susan Trapp GilleThis concludes Alliant Energy's fourth quarter and year-end earnings call. Thank you for your continued support of Alliant Energy, and feel free to contact me with any follow-up questions. .OperatorThank you.

(NASDAQ:PEP) Before The Ex-Dividend Date",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/four-days-left-buy-pepsico-122615690.html,1677327975,STORY,['PEP'],"[PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in 4 days. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Meaning, you will need to purchase PepsiCo's shares before the 2nd of March to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 31st of March.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.15 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$5.20 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, PepsiCo stock has a trailing yield of around 3.0% on the current share price of $175.96. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. View our latest analysis for PepsiCo Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. PepsiCo is paying out an acceptable 70% of its profit, a common payout level among most companies. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. PepsiCo paid out more free cash flow than it generated - 110%, to be precise - last year, which we think is concerningly high. It's hard to consistently pay out more cash than you generate without either borrowing or using company cash, so we'd wonder how the company justifies this payout level.PepsiCo paid out less in dividends than it reported in profits, but unfortunately it didn't generate enough cash to cover the dividend. Cash is king, as they say, and were PepsiCo to repeatedly pay dividends that aren't well covered by cashflow, we would consider this a warning sign.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. Fortunately for readers, PepsiCo's earnings per share have been growing at 14% a year for the past five years. Earnings have been growing at a decent rate, but we're concerned dividend payments consumed most of the company's cash flow over the past year.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the past 10 years, PepsiCo has increased its dividend at approximately 9.2% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.Final TakeawayHas PepsiCo got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? It's good to see that earnings per share are growing and that the company's payout ratio is within a normal range for most businesses. However we're somewhat concerned that it paid out 110% of its cashflow, which is uncomfortably high. It might be worth researching if the company is reinvesting in growth projects that could grow earnings and dividends in the future, but for now we're not all that optimistic on its dividend prospects.With that being said, if dividends aren't your biggest concern with PepsiCo, you should know about the other risks facing this business.

Many inelastic businesses generate substantial cash and have high payout ratios. Even in the worst-case scenario, cash-rich companies will remain stable and pay dividends while retaining modest upside potential. These stocks are perfect for a retirement portfolio or as defensive securities you can hold during market instability.However, the current climate offers a unique opportunity. Many growth-oriented businesses are changing hands at a compelling value, sometimes even less than defensive stocks. Including some of these growth picks is a good idea, as they will provide proportionately higher gains when the market enters a sustained uptrend. Therefore, this article will mainly focus on a mix of defensive and growth-oriented dividend stocks that will provide more total returns over the long run.The following seven dividend stocks to buy and hold should help you craft an ideal portfolio:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPEPPepsiCo$176.18INTCIntel$26.06BLKBlackRock$695.75LMTLockheed Martin$479.19NEENextEra Energy$73.66CATCaterpillar$240.71UNPUnion Pacific$193.75PepsiCo (PEP)Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.Source: FotograFFF / ShutterstockOne of the top dividend stocks to buy and hold is PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), a well-known dividend king with a diversified business model. It is among the safest stocks to buy and provides a stable upside. Its five-year gain of 60.5% closely resembles the Nasdaq and is 12% more than the S&amp;P 500. That’s nothing unusual, but PEP’s remarkable aspect is its very little downside risk. The stock was among the first to recover during the coronavirus recession, and the late-2021 selloffs had minimal impact on its stock price. Essentially, PEP investors are mirroring gains similar to the Nasdaq but without much downside risk.Story continuesWhat really sweetens the deal here is its 2.61% yield and accelerating growth after the coronavirus pandemic. The company also grew at a double-digit clip in Q4. Moreover, PepsiCo has much room to continue increasing its dividends as it had a $5.1 billion cash buffer at the end of last year.Intel (INTC)a visual representation of the data underlying an artificial intelligence (AI) powered solution. BBAI stockSource: ShutterstockThe selloffs in the last two years have turned Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) into a value stock with very little downside. While growth stocks had a strong rebound in Jan., INTC was the only exception, and it now seems to be bottoming out. The company has a hard time catching up with its 2021 figures, and strong competition from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is causing sales to take a hit. But once monetary policy allows more discretionary spending, it will cause a strong resurgence in demand for Intel products.Moreover, Intel isn’t a pure-play chip company anymore. It has high-growth segments such as data and artificial intelligence that can drive growth in the future. Once margins improve and profits rebound, we will likely see INTC making a comeback. In addition, the 5.6% dividend yield makes the stock a must-buy at its current trough. It’s no dividend king, but I believe its upside potential makes up for the lack of historical increases.BlackRock (BLK)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comBlackRock’s (NYSE:BLK) ever-expanding asset value and diversification make it a compelling pick regardless of short-term headwinds. The company has $671 billion of liquidity across multiple currencies and has $8.6 trillion worth of assets under management. Simply put, it’s a colossal company that’s too big to fail. BlackRock has a tech-centric portfolio with substantial exposure to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). These companies won’t disappoint in the long run, and with BlackRock’s 2.79% yield; investors can bet on significant total returns when they cash out.Of course, I would not recommend BLK stock if you entirely wish to avoid short-term losses. But its current valuation suggests that the trough won’t extend much further from here. The company has a streak of 14 consecutive years of dividend increases.Lockheed Martin (LMT)An F-16 and an F-35 model at the background, at the Lockheed Martin exhibition stand in Thessaloniki International Fair.Source: Giannis Papanikos / Shutterstock.comLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is among the top dividend stocks to buy and hold for investors interested in the defense industry. The company has a strong history of delivering impressive returns to its shareholders, with a 10-year average return of 21.7% without its dividends factored in. It currently yields 2.52%.In addition to strong financial performance, Lockheed Martin is also a critical player in the defense and aerospace industry. Its advanced fighter jets and other aerospace hardware are essential to the security of the U.S. and Europe, and the company is well-positioned to benefit from the increased defense spending by NATO and other allies, including Japan and Australia. As my colleague, Will Ashworth pointed out, the company’s $150 billion backlog will also take several years to fulfill and generate lots of cash. The surge in demand has made the defense industry highly inelastic, putting LMT on solid footing for the years to come.NextEra Energy (NEE)A photo of a young boy wearing sunglasses, jeans, a blazer, a white shirt and suspenders holding money in various denominations in one hand and sitting in a plush chair.Source: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.comNextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is positioned to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of rising government investment in renewable energy and construction. With geopolitical tensions rising and climate change worries accelerating, now is the best time to diversify American energy sources and bring emission-free electricity to the grid. The company’s 2022 earnings report demonstrated a 23% growth in revenue, and it provided guidance about dividends increasing by 10% over the next few years. It currently yields a modest 2.23% with a payout ratio of 81%.Stock analyst Gurufocus.com also notes NEE stock as “modestly undervalued” with a net margin of 19.8%, ranked better than 85.26% of its peers. The company has increased its dividends for 30 years consecutively.Caterpillar (CAT)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockWith massive amounts of spending going into construction projects, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), a global manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, is well positioned to benefit from the $1 trillion infrastructure bill, which allocates funds for investments in transportation, broadband, and water infrastructure, among others. Caterpillar’s equipment will be in high demand as the government ramps up its investment in infrastructure projects.Caterpillar’s financials have been shining recently, and the company’s earnings have consistently exceeded analysts’ estimates. Its dividend yield of around 1.94% and a payout ratio of 37% make it an attractive option for income-seeking investors.In addition, the company’s net margin of 11.28% is among the best in the construction industry, ranked 87.87% better than its peers. And Caterpillar’s return on equity of 41.5% is ranked better than 93.3% of construction companies. As the construction industry scales, this edge in the margin will make it one of the most profitable companies in its space. The company has increased its dividends for 30 years consecutively.Union Pacific (UNP)7 Winning High-Yield Dividend Stocks With Payouts Over 5%Source: ShutterstockUnion Pacific (NYSE:UNP) is a freight giant that will also bank on the infrastructure catalyst and keep growing. This railway business has one of the most robust fundamentals and is a cash-generating machine with significant share buybacks and a sustained uptrend. Last year, it paid $3.16 billion in dividends and targets to keep its payout ratio at 45% of its earnings. The company’s 28.13% net margin is especially robust and ranked better than 87% of companies in the transportation industry.Union Pacific is necessary for the U.S. economy as over a third of American exports use freight transport. Being the second-largest freight pure-play company, it is important for the government to provide subsidies and pave the way for a more efficient rail network. With that in mind, I see more catalysts like the infrastructure bill positively impacting the company, which is why the current value is an entry point investors shouldn’t ignore. UNP stock offers a lot more upside potential, which combined with its 2.58% yield should lead to substantial long-term total returns. The company has increased its dividends for 16 years consecutively.On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

303,5aef3f3a-3576-32c5-a05e-e12f9fed1bb4,PEP,2023-02-25,7 Well-Known Consumer Brands Worth a Spot in Your Portfolio,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-well-known-consumer-brands-222326993.html,1677018206,STORY,"['NKE', 'SBUX', 'BF-B', 'MDLZ', 'PEP', 'DPUKY']","[Fidelity Investments fund manager Peter Lynch popularized the idea of investing in what you know. He believed that people could often find the best opportunities in popular consumer stocks that frequently and consistently deliver value for their customers. Lynch’s track record is one of the best in the history of the mutual fund industry. And his central idea retains much wisdom to this day. After all, popular brands tend to have a lot of sticking power. People are creatures of nostalgia and tradition. Brands from a popular resonance with shoppers can endure, sometimes even across generations.This is particularly useful during times of economic chaos. During these current inflationary times, for example, firms with strong consumer brands have an advantage since they have pricing power. While some of these firms are facing challenges at the moment, all seven of these consumer stocks should come out stronger in the years to come.SBUXStarbucks$104.78NKENike$121.10BF-BBrown-Forman$64.90DPZDomino’s$350.23PEPPepsiCo$176.18MDLZMondelez$66.60CLColgate-Palmolive$74.26Consumer Stocks: Starbucks (SBUX)It's Time to Wake Up and Smell the Coffee on Starbucks StockSource: ShutterstockStarbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) speaks to the power of Lynch’s idea. The brand had just 154 stores in 1992, the year in which Starbucks completed its IPO. Over the decades, it has grown into the current behemoth that it is today. People that appreciated the company’s beverages in the early days could make a life-changing investment in Starbucks while it was still a small firm.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsStarbucks may not have quite the same upside today as it used to. But it has matured into a solid dependable firm selling billions of beverages every year in nearly every corner of the globe. Lately, Starbucks has bet heavily on its expansion efforts in China. This was arguably poor-timed, given the economy’s lingering impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns. However, investors shouldn’t lose sight of the bigger picture. Starbucks has a tremendous brand. A huge chunk of the population has a pattern of going to — or increasingly ordering delivery from — Starbucks and getting a nice pick-me-up during the day. That habit should lead to increased profits for Starbucks going forward.Story continuesConsumer Stocks: Nike (NKE)Source: ShutterstockNike (NYSE:NKE) has struggled with some of the same issues as Starbucks. Namely, Nike has a large footprint in China and thus has been tripped up by prolonged COVID-19 lockdowns and reduced commercial activity in that country. However, investors should look past the short-term slowdown for Nike. Yes, the company is currently working through a backlog of inventory and is dealing with profit margin pressures. However, we’ve seen these sorts of fluctuations before and Nike has always come out stronger.At the end of the day, Nike is the most well-known name in athletic gear. It has continued to prosper even as peers such as Under Armour (NYSE:UA) have seen their fortunes fade. Nike’s various advantages include having the strongest direct-to-consumer sales channel in the industry along with its unmatched list of celebrity athlete endorsements. NKE stock has dropped from a peak of $175 to just $125 now amid the current slide in earnings. However, for longer-term investors, the drop is an opportunity. Nike took some losses in 2022, but its long-term trajectory remains unrivaled.Consumer Stocks: Brown-Forman (BF-B)Person holding cellphone with logo of American spirits company Brown-Forman (BF-B) Corporation on screen in front of webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comBrown-Forman (NYSE:BF-B) might not be a household name. But its leading brand certainly is. Brown-Forman is the maker of Jack Daniels whiskey, along with numerous tequilas and other spirits products. Jack Daniels whiskey has been around for ages. Founded in 1870, the distiller even managed to survive America’s alcohol prohibition period. Since the 1930s, Jack Daniels has seen tremendous growth and is the world’s second-best-selling whiskey brand. In addition, according to Interbrand, Jack Daniels is the most valuable spirits brand out there, with a value of more than $6.5 billion.The brand has tons of built-in cachet with consumers. People ask for a “Jack and Coke” at the bar. Tons of songs reference Jack Daniels whiskey in particular. While other companies can market different whiskeys, it’s hard to displace the market leader given its tremendous cultural presence.All this is great news for its owner Brown-Forman. The family-run company has focused on the long-term, building up Jack Daniels and its other brands for success which spans generations. That’s all played out well for shareholders too; BF-B shares went for $10 each twenty years ago and are now worth $65. That’s not a bad return for a business with such a storied brand of whiskey.Consumer Stocks: Domino’s (DPZ)Domino's (DPZ) sign on a building at nightSource: ShutterstockDomino’s (NYSE:DPZ) is a well-known pizza chain. The interesting thing, however, is that Domino’s wasn’t always so successful. DPZ stock fell from $30/share to less than $5/share during the 2008 financial crisis amid a drastic downturn in the company’s fortunes. By 2009, Domino’s was viewed as having among the worst-tasting pizzas in the industry. Sales were in decline and people feared that the company might not survive.The company’s new management team took responsibility and made major changes. Domino’s came up with a new formula for its pizza, changed its delivery techniques, and invested in technology and digital marketing channels. The results were a tremendous success, and Domino’s shares surged as much as one hundredfold since then.Today, Domino’s is a fast food giant. The company’s franchise model and large international footprint give it diverse revenue streams. Domino’s leadership in its app and delivery platform allowed it to extend its lead over competitors during the pandemic. And with shares down 30% from their 2021 peak, DPZ stock is now selling at a reasonable entry point as well.Pepsico (PEP)Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.Source: FotograFFF / ShutterstockPepsico (NASDAQ:PEP) is the owner of its namesake soft drink. But that’s not the only strong consumer brand under Pepsico’s control. It has other sodas such as Mountain Dew with widespread appeal. In addition, Pepsico has its snack food business, Frito-Lay, which controls popular brands such as Doritos and Cheetos.A lot of investors might look past PEP stock thinking that soda’s best days are behind it. After all, soda sales peaked in the United States in the late 1990s and have declined significantly since then. However, Pepsico has done well to diversify with lower-sugar beverages. And, on the snack food side, the demand for chips keeps on going up. Frito-Lay has been a wonderful asset that has allowed Pepsico more flexibility than other soda companies. Over the past decade, Pepsico grew revenues from $66 billion to $84 billion annually while earnings per share rose from $4.32 to $6.42.Pepsico will never blow you away with tremendous year-over-year growth. But, over time, it steadily continues to gain in size and profitability. It hikes its dividend each and every year as well. With shares now selling for under 25 times forward earnings, Pepsico should be positioned to deliver investors more steady returns in the years ahead.Mondelez (MDLZ)man's hand holding wads of cashSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comMondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ) is a consumer staples company, with heavyweight brands such as Oreos, Cadbury, Chiclets, Triscuit, and Sour Patch Kids. These are the perfect sorts of brands that thrive during economic hard times. The products are tasty, relatively cheap, and tap into tons of nostalgia and cultural heft. Sure, people can buy a cheaper brand of chocolate cookies that imitate Oreos. But the taste and texture aren’t quite the same.Like many consumer companies, Mondelez has faced higher input costs with the recent inflationary conditions in the commodity markets. However, Mondelez should be able to push through price increases that offset these concerns. In the meantime, Mondelez shares have now slipped to just 21 times forward earnings. That’s an attractive entry point for a powerhouse food and snacks company like this one.Colgate-Palmolive (CL)Colgate toothpaste and mouthwash in a cup with a toothbrushSource: monticello / Shutterstock.comColgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) is a household name when it comes to health and wellness products. The company has a 40% global market share in toothpaste and 32% in toothbrushes. In addition, Colgate’s products are particularly popular in numerous emerging markets such as South America and India, which should lead to long-term growth thanks to favorable demographics and income growth.Colgate shares have been roughly flat since 2016 even as the company has grown top-line revenues by roughly 20%. This is likely due to margin compression that we’ve seen over the past year with current inflationary conditions. However, long-term demand for toothpaste and other cleaning products tends to be incredibly stable. Colgate’s profits will reach new highs and should carry the company’s share price there as well.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in BF-A stock.

In December, Intellia completed patient enrollment in part II of a dose-expansion portion of the study.Story continuesNTLA-2001 is part of Intellia’s co-development and co-promotion agreement with Regeneron.

Many inelastic businesses generate substantial cash and have high payout ratios. Even in the worst-case scenario, cash-rich companies will remain stable and pay dividends while retaining modest upside potential. These stocks are perfect for a retirement portfolio or as defensive securities you can hold during market instability.However, the current climate offers a unique opportunity. Many growth-oriented businesses are changing hands at a compelling value, sometimes even less than defensive stocks. Including some of these growth picks is a good idea, as they will provide proportionately higher gains when the market enters a sustained uptrend. Therefore, this article will mainly focus on a mix of defensive and growth-oriented dividend stocks that will provide more total returns over the long run.The following seven dividend stocks to buy and hold should help you craft an ideal portfolio:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPEPPepsiCo$176.18INTCIntel$26.06BLKBlackRock$695.75LMTLockheed Martin$479.19NEENextEra Energy$73.66CATCaterpillar$240.71UNPUnion Pacific$193.75PepsiCo (PEP)Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.Source: FotograFFF / ShutterstockOne of the top dividend stocks to buy and hold is PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), a well-known dividend king with a diversified business model. It is among the safest stocks to buy and provides a stable upside. Its five-year gain of 60.5% closely resembles the Nasdaq and is 12% more than the S&amp;P 500. That’s nothing unusual, but PEP’s remarkable aspect is its very little downside risk. The stock was among the first to recover during the coronavirus recession, and the late-2021 selloffs had minimal impact on its stock price. Essentially, PEP investors are mirroring gains similar to the Nasdaq but without much downside risk.Story continuesWhat really sweetens the deal here is its 2.61% yield and accelerating growth after the coronavirus pandemic. The company also grew at a double-digit clip in Q4. Moreover, PepsiCo has much room to continue increasing its dividends as it had a $5.1 billion cash buffer at the end of last year.Intel (INTC)a visual representation of the data underlying an artificial intelligence (AI) powered solution. BBAI stockSource: ShutterstockThe selloffs in the last two years have turned Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) into a value stock with very little downside. While growth stocks had a strong rebound in Jan., INTC was the only exception, and it now seems to be bottoming out. The company has a hard time catching up with its 2021 figures, and strong competition from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is causing sales to take a hit. But once monetary policy allows more discretionary spending, it will cause a strong resurgence in demand for Intel products.Moreover, Intel isn’t a pure-play chip company anymore. It has high-growth segments such as data and artificial intelligence that can drive growth in the future. Once margins improve and profits rebound, we will likely see INTC making a comeback. In addition, the 5.6% dividend yield makes the stock a must-buy at its current trough. It’s no dividend king, but I believe its upside potential makes up for the lack of historical increases.BlackRock (BLK)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comBlackRock’s (NYSE:BLK) ever-expanding asset value and diversification make it a compelling pick regardless of short-term headwinds. The company has $671 billion of liquidity across multiple currencies and has $8.6 trillion worth of assets under management. Simply put, it’s a colossal company that’s too big to fail. BlackRock has a tech-centric portfolio with substantial exposure to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). These companies won’t disappoint in the long run, and with BlackRock’s 2.79% yield; investors can bet on significant total returns when they cash out.Of course, I would not recommend BLK stock if you entirely wish to avoid short-term losses. But its current valuation suggests that the trough won’t extend much further from here. The company has a streak of 14 consecutive years of dividend increases.Lockheed Martin (LMT)An F-16 and an F-35 model at the background, at the Lockheed Martin exhibition stand in Thessaloniki International Fair.Source: Giannis Papanikos / Shutterstock.comLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is among the top dividend stocks to buy and hold for investors interested in the defense industry. The company has a strong history of delivering impressive returns to its shareholders, with a 10-year average return of 21.7% without its dividends factored in. It currently yields 2.52%.In addition to strong financial performance, Lockheed Martin is also a critical player in the defense and aerospace industry. Its advanced fighter jets and other aerospace hardware are essential to the security of the U.S. and Europe, and the company is well-positioned to benefit from the increased defense spending by NATO and other allies, including Japan and Australia. As my colleague, Will Ashworth pointed out, the company’s $150 billion backlog will also take several years to fulfill and generate lots of cash. The surge in demand has made the defense industry highly inelastic, putting LMT on solid footing for the years to come.NextEra Energy (NEE)A photo of a young boy wearing sunglasses, jeans, a blazer, a white shirt and suspenders holding money in various denominations in one hand and sitting in a plush chair.Source: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.comNextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is positioned to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of rising government investment in renewable energy and construction. With geopolitical tensions rising and climate change worries accelerating, now is the best time to diversify American energy sources and bring emission-free electricity to the grid. The company’s 2022 earnings report demonstrated a 23% growth in revenue, and it provided guidance about dividends increasing by 10% over the next few years. It currently yields a modest 2.23% with a payout ratio of 81%.Stock analyst Gurufocus.com also notes NEE stock as “modestly undervalued” with a net margin of 19.8%, ranked better than 85.26% of its peers. The company has increased its dividends for 30 years consecutively.Caterpillar (CAT)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockWith massive amounts of spending going into construction projects, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), a global manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, is well positioned to benefit from the $1 trillion infrastructure bill, which allocates funds for investments in transportation, broadband, and water infrastructure, among others. Caterpillar’s equipment will be in high demand as the government ramps up its investment in infrastructure projects.Caterpillar’s financials have been shining recently, and the company’s earnings have consistently exceeded analysts’ estimates. Its dividend yield of around 1.94% and a payout ratio of 37% make it an attractive option for income-seeking investors.In addition, the company’s net margin of 11.28% is among the best in the construction industry, ranked 87.87% better than its peers. And Caterpillar’s return on equity of 41.5% is ranked better than 93.3% of construction companies. As the construction industry scales, this edge in the margin will make it one of the most profitable companies in its space. The company has increased its dividends for 30 years consecutively.Union Pacific (UNP)7 Winning High-Yield Dividend Stocks With Payouts Over 5%Source: ShutterstockUnion Pacific (NYSE:UNP) is a freight giant that will also bank on the infrastructure catalyst and keep growing. This railway business has one of the most robust fundamentals and is a cash-generating machine with significant share buybacks and a sustained uptrend. Last year, it paid $3.16 billion in dividends and targets to keep its payout ratio at 45% of its earnings. The company’s 28.13% net margin is especially robust and ranked better than 87% of companies in the transportation industry.Union Pacific is necessary for the U.S. economy as over a third of American exports use freight transport. Being the second-largest freight pure-play company, it is important for the government to provide subsidies and pave the way for a more efficient rail network. With that in mind, I see more catalysts like the infrastructure bill positively impacting the company, which is why the current value is an entry point investors shouldn’t ignore. UNP stock offers a lot more upside potential, which combined with its 2.58% yield should lead to substantial long-term total returns. The company has increased its dividends for 16 years consecutively.On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.
