We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 70% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn)."", 'Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.', ""Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Charles Schwab, beginning with the chart below."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Charles Schwab ', ""Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing."", ""Charles Schwab already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Charles Schwab's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters."", ""Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Charles Schwab. Our data shows that The Toronto-Dominion Bank is the largest shareholder with 12% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 6.8% and 5.2% of the stock."", 'After doing some more digging, we found that the top 19 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.', ""Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too."", 'The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.', 'I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.', 'Our most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in The Charles Schwab Corporation. Insiders own US$1.5b worth of shares (at current prices). Most would say this shows a good alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. ', ""The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 12% stake in Charles Schwab. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run."", ""Our data indicates that Private Companies hold 4.3%, of the company's shares. It's hard to draw any conclusions from this fact alone, so its worth looking into who owns those private companies. Sometimes insiders or other related parties have an interest in shares in a public company through a separate private company."", ""It appears to us that public companies own 12% of Charles Schwab. We can't be certain but it is quite possible this is a strategic stake. The businesses may be similar, or work together."", ""It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Charles Schwab better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted   2 warning signs for Charles Schwab  you should be aware of, and 1 of them is a bit unpleasant."", 'If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

And now I'll turn the call over to Erik."", 'Erik B. Nordstrom', ""Thank you, Jamie, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I'll start with our Q3 performance. For the third quarter, we delivered revenue of $3.3 billion, earnings per share of $0.41 and adjusted earnings per share of $0.25. Our teams executed against our priorities, adapted quickly to shifting sales trends and delivered year-over-year profit growth despite lower sales in a challenging macroeconomic environment. We managed our inventory well as evidenced by the positive sales to inventory spread while leaning into pockets of demand. As we enter the holiday season, our teams worked hard to deliver the right assortment and engaging experiences for our customers. In the third quarter, we continued to make progress on our 3 priorities: improving Nordstrom Rack performance, increasing inventory productivity, and optimizing our supply chain. We will continue to focus on these areas in the quarters ahead in order to drive growth, profitability, and an improved customer experience. Based on our year-to-date results, we remain confident in our outlook, expect to deliver full year results within our updated guide range. Turning now to our priorities. Our brand purpose is to help our customers feel good and look their best. At Nordstrom Rack, we know what works and believe in our strategy, delivering great brands at great prices expanding our reach and convenience with new Rack stores in key markets and driving greater engagement and profitability at nordstromrack.com. Throughout the quarter, our team stayed us on our assortment and move quickly to meet shifting demand, providing a compelling flow of new and relevant products for our customers. In the third quarter, we continued to grow the most desirable brands, which had over a 300 basis point higher sell-through than other brands in our Rack assortment and feel good about our offering as we head into holiday. We also know that Rack customers value convenience, and we believe our stores are underpenetrated. We opened 11 new Rack stores during the third quarter and really in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year total to 19 new stores. We saw a strong customer response at each opening and have received positive feedback from customers. Rack stores continue to be a great investment for us. delivering returns well in excess of their cost of capital with a short payback period. They also continue to be our largest source of new customer acquisition. The scale of our digital off-price business is differentiated and unique, allowing us to serve our customers via omnichannel offerings in a way that other off-price retailers do not. And, while we still have work to do on our digital offering for the Rack, we're making progress as we've reworked the business model to ensure sustained profitability. The Rack digital channel is now profitable on a year-to-date basis, and we expect it to continue to be profitable for the full year. This digital channel plays an important role for the Rack in serving customers across stores and digital.Turning to our next priority. Increasing inventory productivity is critical in providing our customers with a consistent flow of the most relevant merchandise when and where they want it. Total inventory was down 9% in the third quarter and resulted in a positive sales to inventory spread. This lower level of inventory required fewer markdowns than last year and helped to drive expansion in our gross margin by 180 basis points in the third quarter. We're also pleased with the traction that our Nordstrom private brands are gaining. As a retailer of the best brands in the world, we believe our own brands will play a critical role in our overall mix as they have higher margins and lower return rates. Additionally, our investments in RFID technology continued to deliver improvements, enhancing the integrity of our inventory by providing improved stock accuracy and creating operational efficiencies across our stores and supply chain. Thanks to the hard work of our teams all year long, our overall inventory position is healthy heading into the holiday season. We also continue to make good progress on our third priority of optimizing our supply chain capabilities. Following four consecutive quarters of reductions in variable supply chain costs of more than 100 basis points, we were able to drive another 50 basis points reduction in the third quarter. Looking ahead, the absolute level of cost savings will stabilize as we've now been focused on this priority for over a year. However, we'll continue to seek out additional efficiencies and flow and improve productivity through inventory management initiatives. Our efforts to improve our supply chain have also contributed to increased productivity and store fulfillment for online orders at the Nordstrom banner and better inventory positioning and flow across the company. Q3 marked our seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in click to delivery times. We've been able to improve click-to-deliver times by nearly 20% over the last couple of years. All of this translates into a better experience for our customers and cost savings for us through fed delivery, lower cancellation rates and increased accuracy of inventory. During the quarter, we announced some key leadership changes and welcomed a new member to our Board of Directors. Jamie Nordstrom was appointed Chief Merchandising Officer. Jamie has worked across nearly every aspect of our business and has held broad-based leadership roles, including in merchandising, store operations, and across our digital channels. Fanya Chandler was named President, Nordstrom stores. She has held several leadership positions, most recently serving as Senior Vice President and Regional Manager of the Southwest region. Gemma Lionello was appointed the role of President, Nordstrom Rack. She has served in numerous executive positions, including in both merchandising and stores and she spent 11 years in within our Nordstrom Rack business. And Lisa Price rejoined Nordstrom as Chief Human Resources Officer. Having most recently served as a CHRO of a large U.S. consumer company. Lisa understands that the success of our business starts with our people. All 4 have proven track records of leading successful teams while maintaining a relentless focus on our customers, we look forward to what they will accomplish in their new roles. We also welcomed Guy Persaud to our Board of Directors. Guy is a senior leader at Procter & Gamble. In closing, we are well positioned for the holiday season as we navigate near-term macroeconomic headwinds while continuing to advance our long-term strategic priorities and remain focused on improving the customer experience. Before I hand it over to Pete, I'd like to recognize the teams throughout our company that have been instrumental in driving our progress this year despite a challenging environment across the retail landscape. Their focus on and passion for our customer is what makes our success possible. With that, I'll turn it over to Pete."", 'Peter E. Nordstrom', ""Thanks, Erik, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll focus my remarks on category performance and inventory position and provide some highlights of the actions we are taking to drive holiday sales. Starting with category performance. The majority of our categories improved sequentially from the second quarter of year-over-year trends with active, beauty, and accessories leading. Active sales growth was led by footwear, driven by New Balance, HOKA and On Running, and in apparel, Vuori. Beauty was strong at both manners as well, driven by designer brands and fragrance. Beauty has been a consistently solid performing category for us and continues to be a top trip driver. This quarter, the introduction of a new beauty 5x points promotion for our Nordy Club loyalty program members supported category growth in stores and online. In anticipation of holiday, our in-stock rates at Nordstrom are above last year's levels, and we have a strong gift selection in beauty. The accessory category also posted positive growth in the quarter, led by sales at the Rack where handbags as well as jewelry and watches were strong. As Erik mentioned, we are gaining traction with our Nordstrom private brands, which are more profitable with lower return rates, which suggests strong content at a good value. Consistent with trends all year, Designer remains pressured, primarily in shoes and handbags, and we continue to rightsize our inventory to meet that demand. Looking ahead, we expect to end the year with an improved inventory position in this category. Heading into today, we're optimistic and pleased that our offering strikes the right balance of newness and relevance that our customers want. We've launched a number of efforts to drive sales and create memorable experiences. From a merchandise perspective, we're offering more newness than we had at this time last year. And we're investing in hot brands and products. For example, we've set up our investment in holiday favorite Ugg, and we've leaned into beauty gift sets, cashmere sweaters, and affordable stocking stuffers. We've also teamed up with Disney to celebrate its 100th year anniversary. Not only are we offering Disney merchandise from over 80 brands, we're also hosting events and immersive in-store experiences to celebrate. The Disney merchandise is featured in 25 Nordstrom stores and is also available online. We're taking a differentiated approach to connecting with customers this holiday season. Based on customer feedback, we're providing new ways for customers to discover gifts for everyone on their list. Including more than 20 inspirational gifting guides and curated gift categories. We're also leveraging our data and analytics to show more relevant and personalized content on nordstrom.com and on our app, based on shopping paver to further our key differentiator and that is serving customers. We've also positioned the Rack as a holiday destination, and we're prepared to welcome some with an enhanced assortment. We're excited that our teams took a sharp focus around gifting to enhance the customer experience. Ahead of the holiday season, we've announced actions designed to not only drive sales in-store and online, but to also improve the customer experience. We're expanding free 2-day shipping to all Nordstrom.com customers in our top markets as we know that customers are more likely to make additional purchases and remain a Nordstrom customer if they're confident their purchases will arrive quickly. And given the success that we've already seen with the new loyalty beauty promotion, we will continue to offer it throughout the holiday season. Looking ahead, we are excited to serve our customers this holiday season and into '24. Our teams have worked hard all year to provide a curated and diverse assortment of brands and products that balances relevance and inspiration. We've made meaningful improvements to the customer that will help our customers shop seamlessly across both of our banners, both in stores and online. By doing this work, we're fulfilling our brand promise: to help customers feel good and look their best. And with that, I'll hand it over to Cathy to discuss our financial results."", 'Catherine R. Smith', ""Thanks, Pete. I'll start with our third quarter results and then discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year. For the third quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.41 compared to a loss of $0.13 per share in the year ago quarter. After excluding a favorable true-up related to the wind down of our Canadian operations, third quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.25. Last year's adjusted earnings per share was $0.20 after excluding an asset impairment charge. We are pleased with the year-over-year gross margin and EPS increase despite lower net sales. Net sales and gross merchandise value, or GMV, both decreased 7% in Q3. Net sales included a negative impact of 270 basis points from the wind down of Canadian operations. It also reflects a positive impact of approximately 200 basis points from the timing shift of the anniversary sale with about 1 week falling into the third quarter this year. Excluding the impact of these 2 items, net sales would have been down about 6% versus last year. Nordstrom banner sales and GMV is 9% and 10%, respectively, versus last year. The wind down of Canadian operations had a negative impact on Nordstrom banner net sales of 410 basis points. and the anniversary timing shift had a positive impact of approximately 300 basis points. Nordstrom Rack sales decreased 2%. The decision to eliminate store fulfillment of rack digital orders starting in the third quarter of 2022 had a negative impact to this year's Q3 sales of approximately 100 basis points, and we've now lapped that change. As Erik said, new Rack stores continue to be a bright spot. New Rack stores performed well during the quarter. Digital sales decreased 11% in the third quarter. This includes an approximately 100 basis points negative impact from eliminating store fulfillment of Rack digital or last year and an approximately 400 basis points positive impact from the anniversary timing shift. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased 180 basis points, primarily due to lower markdowns, increased inventory productivity and lower buying and occupancy costs. Partially offset by deleverage on lower sales. Ending inventory decreased 9% versus last year compared to a 7% decrease in sales. As Pete said, we are continuing to work through some aged Designer inventory. However, we're pleased with our overall inventory position as we enter the holiday season. Looking ahead, we expect to continue to benefit from improved inventory management routines and disciplines while meeting customer demand. Reported SG&A as a percentage of net sales of 36.3% declined 5 basis points versus Q3 2022. Compared to adjusted SG&A in the year ago quarter, SG&A increased 200 basis points, primarily due to deleverage from lower sales and higher labor costs, partially offset by improvements in variable costs from supply chain efficiency initiatives. Adjusted SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales, up 34.3% in the third quarter last year excluded an impairment charge. We have been pleased with the results that our supply chain initiatives have delivered over the last year. As Erik mentioned, following 4 consecutive quarters in which we were able to deliver over 100 basis points of savings each quarter we were able to drive another 50 basis points reduction in variable supply chain costs in the third quarter. EBIT margin was 3.2% for the third quarter. After excluding the $25 million favorable true-up related to the wind down of Canadian operations in this year's third quarter and the impairment charge in the third quarter a year ago, adjusted EBIT margin improved 25 basis points to 2.4% despite lower sales leverage this quarter. We continue to maintain a solid balance sheet and financial position ending the third quarter with $375 million in cash as well as the full $800 million available on our revolving line of credit. Turning to our outlook for the rest of the year. I'll start by discussing the current environment and related assumptions underlying our guidance. Regardless of external impacts, we expect to make continued progress on our key priorities which will help drive sales, improve our profitability and mitigate inflationary cost pressures. We continue to see a cautious consumer, and it remains to be seen how changes in inflation, higher interest rates and the resumption of student loan repayments will affect discretionary consumer spending during the holiday season. Considering these factors and the consistent execution all year long, we are maintaining our full year revenue guide and narrowing our EPS guidance range. I'll highlight a few factors that shape our outlook for the rest of the year, starting with revenue. We continue to expect full year revenue to decline 4% to 6% versus 2022. This outlook includes an approximately 2.5 percentage point negative impact from the wind down of our Canadian operations, which delivered sales of approximately $400 million in 2022. It also includes an approximately 1.3 percentage point positive impact from the 53rd week in fiscal 2023, which we expect will add approximately $200 million in sales to the fourth quarter. Year-to-date credit card revenues have increased 9% versus last year, primarily as a result of our credit card partner agreement. This improvement has come despite credit card losses, which have risen at a slower pace than expected. As we mentioned last quarter, we have seen delinquencies rise gradually, and they are now above pre-pandemic levels. However, delinquencies remain below industry levels and are contemplated in our guidance. Turning to EBIT. We now expect adjusted EBIT margin of 3.8% to 4.1% for the full year versus 3.3% in 2022. Our forecast assumes that adjusted EBIT margin expansion would be driven primarily by gross margin improvements in the fourth quarter from our focus on inventory productivity when compared to the elevated markdowns we took in 2022. We are updating our outlook for adjusted EPS for the full year. Our GAAP earnings per share outlook is now $0.74 to $0.94 for the full year, which includes the Canadian wind-down charges and related tax impact. Excluding the impact of these charges, we now expect adjusted earnings per share of $1.90 to $2.10 for the full year. Shifting to capital allocation, our priorities remain the same. The first is investing in the business to better serve our customers and support long-term growth. We continue to plan for capital expenditures of 3% to 4% of net sales. Our second priority is reducing our leverage. We remain committed to an investment-grade credit rating through a combination of earnings improvement and debt reduction and continue to target a leverage ratio below 2.5x. Our third priority is returning cash to shareholders. Last week, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per share. Our third quarter results along with the progress we've made on our priorities of improving Nordstrom Rack increasing inventory productivity and optimizing our supply chain capabilities, position us well to drive profitable growth in the fourth quarter and over the longer term. We are navigating through near-term uncertainty while remaining laser-focused on delivering shareholder value over the long term. With that, Jamie, we're ready for questions."", 'James Duies', ""Thank you, Cathy. Before we get started with the Q&A, we ask that participants please limit themselves to 1 question and 1 follow-up. We'll now move to the Q&A session."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.', 'Dana Lauren Telsey', ""Good afternoon, everyone. And as we're getting to the end of the year with the fourth quarter and the guidance that you provided, the Rack banner improved the touch in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter. And then taking a look at the Nordstrom batter also improved the touch. What are you seeing in the different categories with some of them remain the same, like Active and like Beauty? Was it a step? Was it a pickup in terms of the categories? What were the components of the same-store sales that drove that improvement? And then as you think about the EBIT margins and the work on the supply chain that you've done, how are you initially thinking about frame in 2024? Thank you."", 'Peter E. Nordstrom', ""Hi, Dana, it's Pete. I think what really drove the improved sales is the continued improvement we have in the balance and the content and quantity of our inventory. We've rightsized our inventory. We definitely got it in the right place in terms of the aging and the categories that matter. As the year has gone and particularly in the last few weeks, as is always the case this time of the year, you're waiting for the weather to change so you can flip the switch to selling more sweaters and boots and coat have you on. It's gotten a little bit better of late. But yes, I think in terms of the stuff that's performing well, generally Beauty is a good example of that, that's kind of working across the board. But I would say, in general, if you're looking for reasons why we've had sequential improvement and actually have had better inflection most recently. It's just the quality and content of our inventory."", 'Catherine R. Smith', ""And then Dana, it's Cathy. Nice to hear you again. With regards to 2024, obviously, we haven't given guidance yet. We do look forward to sharing our 2024 guidance next time we're together. But a couple of things you should expect to see, which is we're going to continue to see the strength of our Rack strategy, great brands at great prices is continuing to work. You'll see us continue to lean into those trends that Pete just noted, like Active and Beauty. Clearly, that's what's resonating with the customer. and we'll continue to refine our inventory productivity to enable us to be agile as we respond to our consumer demand. So more to come in 2024, but that's what we're thinking about."", 'Operator', 'Next is Blake Anderson with Jefferies.', 'Blake Anderson', ""I wanted to ask on SG&A initiatives. You've obviously done a good job of improving the supply chain there as you have marching towards your medium-term margin goals for EBIT, what are the other drivers that you can deploy to improve SG&A? And on top of that, how much sales leverage do you feel like you need to also maybe improve leverage there?"", 'Catherine R. Smith', ""Good afternoon, Blake, it's Cathy. So with regards to SG&A, as you noted, what we seen great progress this year first with -- really driven by our supply chain initiatives, the 4 quarters of 100 basis points improvement. And then back to begin this quarter with another 50 basis points. So seeing great strength there continuing to drive in SG&A. Offsetting some of the other headwinds that we've seen. So the cost of inflation coming through some of the SG&A categories, which we've been offsetting. Each year, though, as we go into planning, we test ourselves with offsetting inflation with productivity improvement. So we would expect to see that same challenge coming into next year pretty much across all of our categories in SG&A. It's an extreme focus of ours right now."", 'Blake Anderson', 'Got it. And then the follow-up would be more of a high-level question, but as you look at the gap between the Nordstrom banner sales decline in Nordstrom Rack, what do you really attribute that to? And as we think about next year, are there any puts and takes or thoughts on if that gap could close or what banner might be positioned better than the other?', 'Erik B. Nordstrom', ""Hi, this is Erik. Along the way, the banners are independent. There's certainly a synergy to our business. Rack stores are our #1 source of new customer acquisition and we get good migration between the brands. But they do -- they have a very separate and distinct business model. And so they're hard-pressed to predict, it depend a lot on the external environment. As far as what's driving the results, how we came into the year, very focused on our Rack business, and we saw opportunities and really goes to last year where the supply chain challenges we had were most acute in our Rack business and it really disrupted our flow, our mix from being what we want it to be. So that's been a big focus of the team this year, and that's what we're seeing our sequential improvement as we've had the quantity right where we can be more aggressive in responding to what we're hearing from the customer, and we can bring in a bigger mix of these strategic brands that we know really make the difference in customers coming to Nordstrom Rack. For the Nordstrom banner business, the stores have been -- I think you're seeing around, there's been a bit of a return to stores this year. Digital business has been a little more pressured in that. For us, we really don't look at the separate channels much. We want to be there for how the customer wants to shop with us. And so our inventories are in great shape, as Pete mentioned, and we're set up well for the holiday business in both banners."", 'Operator', 'Next is Michael Binetti with Evercore.', 'Michael Charles Binetti', ""I want to just, you might have said something to Dana about what you're seeing in the current quarter just because I think the -- there's a little bit of wood to chop through some of the normalizations here for the 53rd week in Canada, but I think it embeds a little bit of an acceleration in the underlying rate. I wanted to see if that was something you're seeing today. You might have mentioned that it was something related to the -- you're feeling better about the content of inventory heading into the holiday. If you don't mind just talk about for a minute, let us know what you're seeing. And then I also want to zero on the SG&A, the 100 basis point run rate kind of rolling off, you said you got another 50 in this quarter. It didn't sound like you were suggesting at that kind of level of 50 basis points would go forward. Is there any reason that wouldn't? The figure that you saw this quarter wouldn't continue for the next few quarters? And maybe just a few comments on what the new 50 basis points from what you guys are actually able to do as you did work on the supply chain."", 'Catherine R. Smith', ""Hi, Michael. On the first one, sales drivers, as we shared, we're pleased first off, to drive more profitability on fewer sales year-over-year. So we'll start there with just the quality of earnings continues to have seen strength. And it's really around all of the initiatives we've been driving. But with regards to the drivers of the sales, it's clear that customers are responding to newness and promotion, as Pete shared in the prepared remarks. And we're seeing it in a couple of things the actions like our 5x Beauty to our Nordic Club members and the free 2-day shipping as we move into the holidays is really resonating, I think, with our customers. So great progress there with newness and promotion. On SG&A, what's the new 50 basis points, I like the way you asked that. So as the supply chain has continued to drive improvements now for a number of quarters. It will just be more challenging to lap those improvements. And so I would expect those to start to moderate over time, we're seeing really good progress across every element of the supply chain, but those will start to moderate. And we'll continue to work to offset the other lines of SG&A with productivity and initiatives."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with TD Cowen.', 'Oliver Chen', ""Hi, Erik, Peter and Cathy. Regarding the 2 banners, as you think about full line as well as Rack, what would you say are key aspects to positive comping and returning to growth just more generally or specifically and also as we think about the e-comm channel. And Cathy, as we look at the credit card income, just what are some key variables you're assuming in terms of the next quarter and also perhaps like the framework from which that may differ if you have any thoughts."", 'Erik B. Nordstrom', ""This is Erik. Let me start on the Rack banner. We definitely see Rack as a growth vehicle for us in a couple of ways. The one just kind of our core strategy that I touched on of great brands, great prices, getting that assortment right. And that's an evergreen subject. We always have opportunities to get that mix better and better. And our teams have done that. I would say when we were really pouring the gas on there is having more and more dedicated roles there. So you saw our announcement of Gemma as Rack President, that follows earlier that we really have built out a separate Rack buying team there. So we think we're better positioned to be more agile and really product mix, right? The second part, Rack growth would be around new stores. We see a lot of opportunity to add profitable new Rack stores. And we've been opening up more this year. We have more planned for next year and we're getting really great returns out of those investments there. And again, we lots of runway there to keep add new stores. The other piece is really around the digital part and omni-channel capabilities that Rack.com affords us. And as you know, there's really not many players in the online off-price space. It's a hard business to be profitable at. Our Rack.com business is profitable, and that was really the first step of leveraging that asset is to get to profitability. Now we're there, we've we see more opportunity around profitability. But we see opportunity to leverage that capability to engage with customers more and more. And so we have a path forward of a lot of omni-channel capabilities that we feel good about driving some growth there. In the Nordstrom banner, I really would start with our digital business there. We see opportunities are well underway of having different inventory models that allow us to bring greater selection on the digital journey, whether we own the merchandise or not. So having other models to bring selection to our customers, he's got a step one. Step two is then using the data capabilities we've been building out to curate that larger offer for our customers. In the end, it's about winning on the discovery journey for customers and having a fluent newness is important. But having that selection and being able to offer up the right curated offering for customers on their journey is super important as well."", 'Catherine R. Smith', ""And then Oliver, I'll answer on the credit card revenues. Just remembering that, first and foremost, they're a part of our loyalty program and they're part of our most loyal customers. And as we think about the credit card revenues for Q3, they were up year-over-year, and that really was driven by higher customer balances, higher interest rates, a little bit of benefit from the new relationship with our TD partner and then offset a little bit by increased losses. As we move into Q4, I'd expect them to be around the same level, around that 3% or so of sales, so about the same level as we clear out the rest of the year."", 'Oliver Chen', 'Happy holidays. Nice regards. Nice work on the marketplace model. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Next is Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.', 'Matthew Robert Boss', ""So Erik, maybe could you just elaborate on the continued softness at the full lines? Maybe how much should we attribute it to the macro backdrop relative to company-specific execution? And then Pete, just maybe to tie into that from a category perspective, could you touch on trends in women's apparel relative to the above-average performance that you cited in Active and Beauty?"", 'Erik B. Nordstrom', ""Hi, Matthew. I'll start with, we feel good about our execution. And that starts with having the right inventory levels that allow us to be responsive to the customer and get our mix right. And our merchandising teams have done a great job on that. Really pleased with our inventory levels and the agility that's affording us. We still have some designer inventory to work through. Outside of that, we feel really good about that execution. I think our execution is good. Now that being said, sales is a controllable for us. That is the scoreboard and on how we're serving customers. And we see lots of opportunity to continue to do things within our control, in particular, around traffic. Traffic has been soft. Our average order size has gone up, but traffic has been down a bit. So we've done some things as of late. Like we have a 5x Beauty rewards promotion going on right now through holiday that we're getting good response from and that is driving extra traffic and conversion. And we also have expanded our free 2-day shipping. We've had -- we've built out free 2-day shipping capabilities as part of our loyalty program and it really leverages our closer to you, market strategy capabilities that we've talked about for a while. That's the built out the point that we're able to expand that for the holiday season and get customers faster delivery, which we know is always a good thing, both for conversion and for return rate. So again, in short, I think the execution has been really solid and put us in a good position to respond to the customers with the holiday season."", 'Peter E. Nordstrom', ""And this is Pete. Relative to women's that Erik talked about, look, it's a big and important category for us, and it's got a lot of attention. We've been making improvements, and we're not where we need to be, but it's definitely got momentum moving in the right direction. We've spent a lot of time in the last couple of months in our own stores and actually in the competition. And I think what's been good about this whole process is the real return to the merchant stuff that's super important. That's just being close to what customers are asking for, what their choices are there in the marketplace. And we've got some areas of strength we're going to invest into. One of them is our own label programs. You've heard us talk about that and that it's an opportunity for us to grow, and that is true. Our sell-throughs in our -- in the Nordstrom product, our own label is up 30% year-over-year. We have strong growth and a lot of that's in women's apparel as why's we're bringing this up. We have strong growth planned in '24. And when we can get that right, that's going to have a lot to do with the overall health of our women's apparel business. The other thing I'd say is being out in the stores to call it, we tend to get is about the things that we can bring in that feel special, elevated, and aspirational relatively in every store that we serve. And a lot of that ends up in the kind of advanced contemporary space. And so we're doing a good job of editing down and prioritizing and focusing on brands. I would say one of the things that hurt us in the last couple of years, probably we're a little too wide with the breadth of our selection. Therefore, probably weren't making strong enough statements on the stuff that matter most, and we have an opportunity to improve that, and we've been working on it. So I'm going to have to give us a little bit of an incomplete here, but we'll definitely be circling back with you as time goes on to let you know about our progress, but there's a lot of reason to believe that we have a good improvement to make there in women's apparel."", 'Operator', 'Our last question comes from Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs.', 'Brooke Siler Roach', ""I was hoping we could get a deeper update on what you're seeing in the Designer business. Is that trend starting to stabilize versus the softening trend that you had seen earlier in the year, either on a 1-year or a 4-year stock basis? And then for Cathy, can you elaborate on how you're planning markdowns for the year, particularly what's embedded for promotional recapture in your fourth quarter outlook relative to last year's outsized pressure?"", 'Peter E. Nordstrom', ""Yes, Pete. I'll start on the Designer part. I think relative to what's happening, the trend is normalizing and stabilizing. And if you look at it over that -- the multiple year stack you talked about it, we're still doing more business in Designer now year-to-date in '23 than we did year-to-date in '19, for example. So while it has come back from some of the heights that we had in the last couple of years, I guess, we would view that really more as normalizing. And I think that's natural given the big run-up we had there for a while. It's an important part of our business. We continue to invest in. And I think for us is making sure we get the inventory levels in a good spot, so we can have that flow in newness. I think particularly in that business, it's important that we keep having new things to show customers, and we're getting a healthier position in that regard every month that goes forward."", 'Catherine R. Smith', ""And with regards to markdowns, maybe I'll take it to a little bit bigger perspective, which is gross margin first. And that is we're really pleased with the gross margin improvements we've delivered this year for the whole year. And then that's really been largely driven by our inventory productivity priority. Our Q3 35% gross margin rate is a historically healthy rate for the third quarter. And then so as we think about going into the fourth quarter with regards to the gross margin rate and then obviously, the embedded assumption around markdowns is, given that we're going into the fourth quarter and the holidays with a healthy inventory place, you would expect us to be favorable to last year, really driven by those improved year-over-year markdowns, just given the strength of our inventory. So we're pleased with our performance all year, the inventory productivity has been driving it. Probably always room to continue to improve, but I am really pleased where we're starting at."", 'James Duies', ""All right. Thank you. for joining today's call. A replay, along with the slide presentation and prepared remarks, will be available for 1 year on our website. Thank you for your interest in Nordstrom."", 'Operator', ""This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.""]"

(NYSE:JWN) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in four days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Accordingly, Nordstrom investors that purchase the stock on or after the 27th of November will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 13th of December.', ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.19 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$0.76 to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Nordstrom has a trailing yield of 5.1% on the current share price of $14.9. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Nordstrom's dividend is reliable and sustainable. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Nordstrom ', ""Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Nordstrom paid out a disturbingly high 381% of its profit as dividends last year, which makes us concerned there's something we don't fully understand in the business. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Luckily it paid out just 22% of its free cash flow last year."", ""It's disappointing to see that the dividend was not covered by profits, but cash is more important from a dividend sustainability perspective, and Nordstrom fortunately did generate enough cash to fund its dividend. If executives were to continue paying more in dividends than the company reported in profits, we'd view this as a warning sign. Very few companies are able to sustainably pay dividends larger than their reported earnings."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Companies with falling earnings are riskier for dividend shareholders. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. Nordstrom's earnings have collapsed faster than Wile E Coyote's schemes to trap the Road Runner; down a tremendous 40% a year over the past five years."", ""The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Nordstrom's dividend payments per share have declined at 4.5% per year on average over the past 10 years, which is uninspiring. It's never nice to see earnings and dividends falling, but at least management has cut the dividend rather than potentially risk the company's health in an attempt to maintain it."", ""From a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Nordstrom? It's not a great combination to see a company with earnings in decline and paying out 381% of its profits, which could imply the dividend may be at risk of being cut in the future. However, the cash payout ratio was much lower - good news from a dividend perspective - which makes us wonder why there is such a mis-match between income and cashflow. It's not the most attractive proposition from a dividend perspective, and we'd probably give this one a miss for now."", ""Although, if you're still interested in Nordstrom and want to know more, you'll find it very useful to know what risks this stock faces. To help with this, we've discovered 5 warning signs for Nordstrom that you should be aware of before investing in their shares."", ""Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

Only the small-cap Russell 2000 dropped -1.23% for the session. It is the only index currently down over the past five trading days, but is still +7% over the past month.The market was beset by two pieces of bad news today which held the potential to do more damage than they did: Fed minutes released this afternoon reflected no appetite for the monetary policy body to lower interest rates (though neither was there any indication of any future rate hikes evident), and Binance faced federal money laundering charges, and its CEO Changpeng Zhao (“CZ”) has pled guilty and agreed to step down from the company. Remember it was CZ pursuing the ownership of FTX that began to unwind that company, whose conviction has a sentencing date of late March next year.There were also a bevy of earnings reports out this morning, mostly from specialty retailers such as Best Buy BBY, Dick’s Sporting Goods DKS, Lowe’s LOW, etc. But the real marquee name reporting for Q3 today is out this afternoon after the closing bell: graphics chips giant NVIDIA NVDA. The Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy)-rated company was up roughly +240% year to date ahead of this report.Good news for NVIDIA owners: the company was able to outdo even its extraordinary expectations in the quarter: earnings of $4.02 per share easily surpassed the $3.36 expected, and represented a whopping +693% earnings growth year over year. Revenues of $18.12 billion left estimates of $16.19 billion in the dust, beating the +173% sales growth expected by nearly $2 billion. Further, revenue guidance for Q4 was cranked up to $20 billion from $17.85 billion anticipated.Even more impressive for these eye-popping numbers: they did so without the help of positive guidance for its China-based sales, which are now expected to decline in Q4. However, the company expects revenues will be offset by gains in other regions, as demonstrated by the raised sales guidance. Data Center revenues in Q3 — a very important metric for NVIDIA — blew past the $13 billion expected to $14.5 billion. Gross Margins (GM) came in +75% (guidance for Q4 GM is almost as good: +74.5%). These are the sorts of grand-slam numbers only a company like Apple in its prime were able to print.Elsewhere, Nordstrom JWN nearly doubled earnings expectations in its Q3 report this afternoon to 25 cents per share (13 cents expected), but revenues missed estimates by nearly -3%, coming in -7% year over year. Flagship store sales were down, with Nordstrom Rack sales falling by a slimmer -1.8%. Gross Margins, however, stayed positive year over year. Also, Urban Outfitters URBN beat on both top and bottom lines — earnings of 88 cents versus 81 expected on $1.28 billion is sales versus $1.26 billion estimated — sent shares up marginally in late trading.Questions or comments about this article and/or author?

They've cut back on some of the kind of expensive online sales to try to make these online sales more profitable."", ""I don't know if that's really generating top-line growth at the moment. It seems based on this report and also last quarter that rack is performing a little bit better than it had been the last couple of years.

It could also be that Nordstrom is just making a lot of mistakes in terms of fashion. And it's not stocking the right merchandise."", ""- And, David, there's been some changes in the C-suite there as well.

They've brought in other executives too, some who have backgrounds in more of the discount apparel space at retailers like TJX."", ""And, you know, I think they're trying to figure out a model that really works for both rack and for the Nordstrom stores. They have made a lot of big moves, for example, pulling out of Canada at the beginning of the year. Then they've really now kind of doubled down on rack. They're opening a lot of rack stores and planning to open many more, you know?"", ""So I think that they are looking for a model that works. They're trying to really capitalize on Nordstrom's strengths, which are in its high fashion and sort of its luxury labels and also fashionable labels that aren't necessarily luxury and also in beauty, where Nordstrom is quite strong, and then at rack."", ""I think that Nordstrom is realizes that it can't be a discount store like the other discount stores. It needs to be more competitive by offering brands that people cannot find at other discount type stores.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to Semiconductor R&D Spending By Company: Top 5.', 'Semiconductors are vital for the majority of technologies around us including automobiles, communications systems, computers, household appliances, and more. These tiny chips witnessed an extreme shortage during the pandemic when consumer demands suddenly shifted. People became more inclined towards consumer electronics and PCs, due to the rise of remote work and education, while vehicle sales dropped. The industry also faced massive supply chain disruption and logistical issues that further fueled the shortage.', 'The semiconductor industry is currently in its recovery phase. Many semiconductor products including smartphones have even come a full circle from being short to having a surplus. One of the most prominent semiconductors that still seem to be struggling are the GPUs used for training and developing AI applications like ChatGPT.\xa0NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) dominates the market and controls almost 80% of the supply.\xa0The reliance on this singular giant in the semiconductor GPU market slowed the progress of many companies developing generative AI products.', 'Generative AI companies have been struggling to meet their needs as the supply is limited to one dominant company. To keep up, generative AI companies have started to explore more options and overcome this shortage. On October 6, Reuters reported that OpenAI is exploring the option of making its own chips instead of relying on external chipmakers. By making its chips, the company will be able to reach its goals for expansion without potential delays caused by the shortage. It will also enable the company to have more control and diversity in its supply.\xa0', 'Governments across the globe have also become more alert to the issue of semiconductor shortages and are making efforts to nurture its growth. Many countries have announced attractive government incentives to encourage companies to set up manufacturing and production in them. The CHIPS and Science Act by the United States government is noteworthy. According to a report\xa0by the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), the earnest implementation of the Act that began at the start of 2023 has gathered $200 billion in private investments. Even in light of the semiconductor market tug-of-war between the US and China, implementing the CHIPS Act can potentially create thousands of jobs and foster the semiconductor ecosystem in the country. The close involvement of the governments could move the semiconductor shortage in the right direction, overcoming the ongoing slump. You can also check out\xa0Semiconductor R&D Spending By Country: Top 12.', 'According to a\xa0report by Precedence Research, the global semiconductor market was valued at $664.2 billion in 2023. The market has been estimated to grow to $1.88 trillion by 2032, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.28%.', ""The Asia Pacific region dominates the semiconductor market. According to the report, the region will uphold its position through the forecast period. In 2022, the Asia Pacific semiconductor market was valued at $230.5 billion, which accounted for 46% of the total market share. The presence of top-notch semiconductor companies in China, South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan contributes to the region's distinct position in the global market. North America and Europe have also been estimated to grow substantially during the forecast period. Increasing investments alongside advanced R&D are predicted to be the main factors in this growth."", 'By application, the networking and communications segment was the most noteworthy. According to the report, in 2022, the segment comprised 34% of the market share. As the popularity of smartphones rises, so does the demand for semiconductors used for its manufacturing. The demand for smartphones is expected to stay strong; therefore, the segment is estimated to grow as well.', 'Some of the biggest players in the semiconductor industry include NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), and Advanced Micro Devices Incorporated (NASDAQ:AMD).', ""NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has emerged as one of the most noteworthy names in the semiconductor industry. The use of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) chips in training generative AI applications substantially boosted the company's popularity. The company constantly introduces innovations to maintain its position in the global market. On October 30, Reuters reported that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has published research on using AI in designing semiconductor chips. The company has combined more than three decades of data with a Large Language Model (LLM), similar to the one used in chatbots, to assist in the chip designing process. Training the chatbot from the experiences of the company would also help train junior designers and engineers as it can answer their queries quickly."", 'Another major player using innovation and advancing R&D to stay ahead of its competitors is QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM). On October 25, Reuters reported that QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) has announced the launch of its Snapdragon Elite X chip that will be available in laptops starting next year. Growing AI features have stirred the demand for laptops with more advanced chips that can perform tasks efficiently. These chips will be used in the Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) laptops and computers, facilitating them to directly compete with the chips used by Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).', ""Advanced Micro Devices Incorporated (NASDAQ:AMD) is also a giant in the semiconductor industry. The company is making strategic acquisitions to nurture innovation. On October 10, Reuters reported that Advanced Micro Devices Incorporated (NASDAQ:AMD) plans to buy Nod.ai, an AI startup. The aim is to build a unified collection of software that will be used to power many semiconductor chips that the company makes. The AI startup will catalyze the company's journey to achieve this goal as it uses AI models suited for the company's chips.\xa0"", 'R&D is pertinent to sustain a reputable position in this highly competitive industry.

His reinstatement comes after a whirlwind few days in which we saw unusual corporate governance lead to an attempt to oust Altman, despite support from both Microsoft and the vast majority of OpenAI's workforce. While the whole process was incredibly messy, the result seems very likely to be a stronger OpenAI, with new clarity around mission and purpose."", ""To be clear, nothing about this felt intentional or strategic. In fact, every twist and turn seemed to come shockingly out of nowhere, from Microsoft's offer to hire Altman and Greg Brockman to the shock drop-in of Twitch co-founder Emmett Shear as interim CEO -- and who could've predicted the Harry Potter fanfic community tie-in."", ""Despite the sheer chaos of how we got here, I think the result will ultimately be a much stronger and more unified OpenAI, which, while it doesn't benefit Microsoft in quite the same way as acquiring the team without acquiring the company, still means Satya Nadella and Redmond probably come out better off than before, too."", ""First, the reformed OpenAI government structure will likely be a lot more friendly toward Microsoft, which offers it predictability and stability from its key partner in the generative AI race. Second, Nadella's guidance and support of Altman and Brockman, and the ultimately victorious team made up of their allies, likely won't be forgotten anytime soon. Nadella wisely secured himself a position as a key ally and confidant to arguably the most powerful person in generative AI today."", 'For OpenAI itself, the entire episode led to a ""rallying of the troops,"" as evidenced by the list of employees who ended up signing the open letter to the board demanding Altman\'s return. In the end, more than 710 of the company\'s 770 employees signed the letter, which also demanded that the existing board resign; it\'s possible the number would\'ve been even higher if some of the employees hadn\'t been reliant on their OpenAI jobs for immigration purposes.', ""While you can't really count that as a pure play approval rating, given the polarized circumstances in which it arose, it is still an extremely significant indication of support for Altman's leadership and philosophy when it comes to OpenAI's business strategy. The letter and its signatory count obviously don't tell the whole story, but moments like this tend to erode small doubts and discrepancies, and temper a new unity of purpose for companies with mission-driven values."", ""Another point in OpenAI's favor: While Altman is the star of the show, Brockman also demonstrated terrific leadership and commitment throughout the ordeal, which has to earn him additional loyalty from the OpenAI employee base. He proudly tweeted about the company shipping product updates in the midst of everything going down — even while he was technically not an employee there — and he reiterated that commitment to shipping shortly after news broke of the resolution."", ""If, as some speculate, the main reason for the rift between the outgoing board and Altman were concerns over the speed at which OpenAI was progressing toward its goal of AGI, then the board's actions have had exactly the opposite effect they intended. OpenAI is now reformed as a more unified whole, with a clear focus on pursuing Altman's goals of ensconcing it as the leader in the emerging generative AI mega-industry."", 'This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/22/openai-will-benefit-from-unity-of-purpose-with-sam-altmans-return/']"

However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Paychex's  ROE today."", 'Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.', ' See our latest analysis for Paychex ', 'The formula for ROE is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Paychex is:', '45% = US$1.6b ÷ US$3.6b (Based on the trailing twelve months to August 2023).', ""The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.45 in profit."", 'Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company\'s future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don\'t have the same features.', ""To begin with, Paychex has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 12% the company's ROE is quite impressive. This likely paved the way for the modest 9.7% net income growth seen by Paychex over the past five years."", ""As a next step, we compared Paychex's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 11% in the same period."", ""Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for PAYX? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. "", ""The high three-year median payout ratio of 76% (or a retention ratio of 24%) for Paychex suggests that the company's growth wasn't really hampered despite it returning most of its income to its shareholders."", ""Moreover, Paychex is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 75%. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 45%."", ""Overall, we are quite pleased with Paychex's performance. Especially the high ROE, Which has contributed to the impressive growth seen in earnings. Despite the company reinvesting only a small portion of its profits, it still has managed to grow its earnings so that is appreciable.

That continues today through our ongoing dialogue with our partners, as well as all of our stakeholders. As the world has emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Board and leadership team have evolved to meet the needs of a new era.

This committee is a continued evolution of the overall governance approach to the company.', 'Over the past three years, we have deepened our commitment to this approach and invested nearly $9 billion to uplift the overall partner and store experience, with more than one third of that investment going directly to the partners through wage increases, training, new innovative equipment and technology. This represents the reinvestment of an average of nearly 20% of Starbucks fiscal year profits back into the partner experience with that level of investment expected to continue in fiscal year 2024. These investments have led to a more consistent partner experience in company-operated stores across the U.S. Coupled with higher wages and the expansion of hours, these investments have not only resulted in lower turnover – which is now below pre-pandemic levels – but we have also increased hourly total cash compensation by nearly 50% since fiscal year 2020.', 'The Board’s Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will review SOC Investment Group’s proposed director nominee[s] in accordance with its normal process, and the Board will present its formal recommendation regarding director nominees in the Company’s proxy statement and other materials to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

This has not only cost untold millions in legal fees and other expenditures, but the constant media, policymaker and regulatory scrutiny have caused potentially irreversible damage to the value of the Company’s previously enviable brand. Regardless of one’s personal views on whether Starbucks should support or continue to resist the unionization of its store employees, the Board’s current approach likely jeopardizes its ability to fulfill its fiduciary duties to investors and has resulted in arguably one of the most glaring and destructive examples of human capital mismanagement corporate America has seen.

Compared to stocks in the mid-cap, small-cap, and micro-cap categories, this may make them better buys for investors targeting steady returns.', 'With more room to run growth-wise compared to the mega-caps (which outside of tech, are typically very large, mature enterprises with limited growth potential), large-cap can have the potential to produce greater returns (from both price appreciation and dividends) compared to the mega-caps.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'According to Finviz, there are 713 large-caps trading on major U.S. exchanges. However, among this large pool of opportunities, take a look at these seven. Each of these large-cap stocks has a solid track record of earnings and dividend growth.', 'Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock', 'Automated Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) has long been one of the best large-cap stocks to buy and hold. Shares in the payroll and outsourced HR services provider have experienced strong price appreciation, rising 220% over the past decade.', 'ADP stock has also been a rewarding investment for dividend-focused investors. As I noted back in August, ADP is a “dividend aristocrat,” with over 25 consecutive years of dividend growth under its belt. The stock currently has a forward dividend yield of 2.43%.', 'Assuming growth trends continue, Automatic Data Processing remains well-positioned to continue producing strong returns. Forecasts call for earnings to rise by between 9%-10% over the next few years. Dividend growth has averaged 13.6% annually over the past five years. Put it all together, and it’s clear to see why ADP remains one of the top large-caps for investors focused on steady gains for their portfolios.', 'Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com', 'Illinois Tool Works (NYSE:ITW) is another of the dividend aristocrats that’s one of the best large-cap stocks to buy. This industrial conglomerate has increased its dividend payouts 27 years in a row. With a forward yield of 2.37%, dividend growth has averaged 9.8% annually over the past five years.', 'Similar to ADP, ITW stock has also experienced an outsized level of price appreciation over the past decade. Consistent earnings growth has sent the stock surging threefold since 2013. ITW’s forward multiple (24.3) may seem steep at first place, when compared to stocks overall.', 'However, given the company’s resilient results (improved earnings despite zero revenue growth) last quarter, and the prospect of growth re-acceleration (based on sell-side earnings forecasts), ITW still appears on track to deliver the level of earnings growth necessarily to sustain its valuation, and keep shares trending upwards over a long time frame.', 'Source: JennLShoots / Shutterstock.com', 'L3 Harris Technologies (NYSE:LHX) isn’t in the dividend aristocrats category just yet, but it’s getting there. This defense firm has raised its payouts for 21 years in a row.', 'LHX’s 2.43% dividend yields provide a solid baseline of returns, and the payout has increased by 13.6% on average over the past five years.', 'Thanks to the company’s strengths in acquiring/realizing cost/growth synergies out of bolt-on acquisitions, LHX stock (up 182.8% over the past 10 years) appears poised to keep rising, in line with expected high single-digit increases in earnings per share.', 'That’s not all. As Raymond James analyst Brian Gesuale recently argued, LHX is undervalued compared to peers in the aerospace and defense technology space. While not for certain, it’s possible that, over time, this valuation gap is bridged. Such multiple expansion could help to further boost future total returns.', 'Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com', 'With shares declining in price over the past five years, at first you may question Medtronic’s (NYSE:MDT) appeal as a long-term buy-and-hold. Yet while the medical device maker hasn’t exactly been a winner for investors in recent years, it could be a different story in the years ahead.', 'As InvestorPlace’s Will Ashworth recently pointed out, Medtronic is in the midst of a restructuring. Once the company completes divesting non-core/underperforming business segments, and becomes focused fully on higher growth/higher margin products, MDT stock (trading for only 14.2 times earnings today) could experience a big re-rating to the upside.', 'Alongside this, the stock’s moderately-high dividend (3.8% forward yield) stands to provide a further boost for total returns. While it may take time for the turnaround to play out, in hindsight buying now (as uncertainty still looms over shares) could prove to be a very profitable move.', 'Source: madamF / Shutterstock.com', 'NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) shares are currently in a slump. There’s no way to sugarcoat it. As I discussed last month, shares took a dive in September, as the prospect of persistently high interest rates and slowing growth for the utility company’s renewables segments weighed on the minds of investors.', 'However, if you’re looking to make NEE stock one of the large-cap stocks to buy and hold in your portfolio, this sharp sell-off works to your advantage. Although shares have started to recover, NextEra remains reasonably-priced, at 18.4 times forward earnings.', 'Despite the walking-back of outlook, analysts still expect NEE to report high single-digit earnings growth in the years to come, which may help to drive shares higher. Combine that with NextEra’s 3.25% (and growing) dividend, and it’s easy to see why NEE, while no longer a high-flier, could still be a long-term winner for slow-and-steady investors.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'With its greater exposure to non-combustible tobacco products, up until recently, Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM) was considered the tobacco company with the brightest future. More recently, though, pessimism about the stock has made a resurgence.', 'Namely, there are concerns that, even for Philip Morris International, non-combustible growth will fail to make up for global declines in cigarette consumption. However, based on the company’s Q3 2023 results, I wouldn’t necessarily jump to this bearish conclusion about PM stock.', 'Even when excluding increased revenue resulting from PM’s acquisition of Swedish Match last year, top-line growth came in at 9.3%. With adjusted earnings per share rising 20.3%, so far it appears that the smokefree transition is working out.

Namely, inflation, along with higher interest rates, have led to softening demand from the company’s main customer base (restaurants). However, while in a rough patch right now, Sysco is likely to get back on track, once economic conditions normalize. This could spark a rebound for SYY stock, which is down 9.24% this year.', 'In terms of SYY’s appeal as one of the large-caps to buy-and-hold, after recovering from present headwinds, the company could get back to reporting prior levels of earnings growth.

If you’re looking for some of the best dividend stocks for income, you can’t go wrong with this label. It refers to S&P 500 companies that have increased their payouts to shareholders for at least 25 years.', 'Fundamentally, the major benefit of dividend aristocrats centers on incentivized performance. No one wants to lead the team that gave up on a run that has gone on for almost three decades. Obviously, it doesn’t look good on one’s resume. Therefore, a clear motivation exists to keep the passive income going, irrespective of outside pressures.', 'On a related note, this rarefied category enjoys both the business model and acumen to survive multiple market conditions. In the past 25 years, the U.S. equities sector absorbed terrorist attacks, natural disasters, financial collapses and a raging pandemic. If companies are still rewarding their stakeholders after all that, you probably can’t find a better place for dividend stocks to buy for income.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'To be sure, every asset category faces risks. Still, if you’re worried about tomorrow, these dividend aristocrats should help you rest easy.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'Based in Dallas, Texas, Atmos Energy (NYSE:ATO) is one of the largest natural gas-only distributors in the nation. Per its public profile, Atmos serves about three million natural gas distribution customers in over 1,400 communities in nine states. While hydrocarbons may face diminishing popularity, they’re still necessary amid rising population figures and subsequently increased consumption.', 'As one of the dividend aristocrats, you’re enjoying relative stability combined with the prospect of steady growth. Right now, the company carries a forward dividend yield of 2.9%. While that’s a bit lower than the utility sector’s average yield of 3.75%, the payout ratio is reasonable at 49.6%. Also, the firm enjoys 40 years of consecutive dividend increases, a status it’s jealously protecting.', 'While not the most attractively priced entity at forward earnings multiple of 17.17x, Atmos prints impressive profit margins. Subsequently, analysts rate ATO a consensus moderate buy with a $122.67 average price target. Further, the high-side target lands at $131, an intriguing idea for dividend stocks to buy for income.', 'Source: JHVEPhoto/Shutterstock.com', 'A multinational corporation specializing in marketing and distributing food products, Sysco (NYSE:SYY) appeals for those seeking dividend stocks to buy for income. To be sure, its business model isn’t the sexiest in the world. In addition to food services, the company also helps distribute small wares, kitchen equipment and tabletop items to restaurants, healthcare and education facilities, among other establishments.', 'However, it’s awfully relevant. No matter what happens in the economy, people will travel, people will get sick and they’ll all get tired of cooking at home every single day. Therefore, SYY should benefit from consistent, predictable demand. Unsurprisingly, Sysco – while it doesn’t carry the greatest financial print – is consistently profitable over the past decade.', 'As one of the most reliable dividend aristocrats, Sysco doesn’t exactly knock it out of the park with its 2.97% forward yield. However, it’s above the consumer staples sector’s average yield of 1.89%. Also, it commands 54 years of consecutive payout increases.', 'Analysts peg SYY a strong buy with an $80.25 target, projecting over 19% upside.', 'Source: monticello / Shutterstock', 'Enjoying prominence as a longstanding idea for dividend stocks to buy for income, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) deserves to be on your radar. Sure, the underlying products aren’t exactly healthy for you. However, as a producer of caffeinated products found in grocery stores, the brand might benefit from the trade-down effect. Basically, economic pressures may force consumers to look for caffeine alternatives to pricey coffeeshops.', 'As society normalizes and more companies recall their employees back to the office, Coca-Cola could represent a necessary pick-me-up. Financially, it’s not particularly exciting. For example, it features a forward earnings multiple of 20.35x, which is a bit overvalued. Still, in exchange for that premium, you get a predictable business and sky-high profit margins.', 'And that of course translates to robust passive income. One of the top dividend aristocrats, the soft-drink giant commands a forward yield of 3.23%. As well, it prints 61 years of consecutive payout increases. Analysts rate KO a moderate buy with a $63.76 target. The high-side target lands at $69.', 'Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com', 'Practically a no-brainer on the topic of dividend aristocrats, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) commands extraordinary relevance. Sure, the company spun off its consumer healthcare products unit. However, the enterprise can now focus on its viable medical technologies and pharmaceutical divisions. In fairness, JNJ hasn’t been a great performer this year, losing about 17%. Nevertheless, this could be a discounted opportunity for patient buyers.', 'Certainly, the immediate circumstances don’t look too hot. Following a generally solid quarterly report, two analysts downgraded their per-share price expectations of JNJ. However, with the sentiment drag, JNJ now trades at a trailing earnings multiple of only 10.96x. For context, the sector median for the drug manufacturing industry comes in at 23.04x.', 'It remains a consistently profitable enterprise, which helps lift the forward yield to 3.23%. Just as well, the payout ratio sits at only 44.1%, while the company commands 61 years of consecutive dividend increases. That’s reliability you can trust.', 'Overall, analysts peg JNJ a moderate buy with a $176.95 target, implying almost 20% upside.', 'Source: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com', 'Moving toward the riskier ideas among dividend aristocrats, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) on paper carries an attractive profile. Per its website, NextEra bills itself as one of the nation’s largest capital investors in renewable infrastructure. Combined with the broader political and ideological push for green energy solutions, NEE would seem compelling. Arguably, it very much is but will require substantial patience.', 'Since the beginning of the year, NEE dropped about 31% of equity value, an obviously steep erosion. Technically speaking, investors must also hope that the rally from early October doesn’t become a dead-cat bounce. As Barron’s pointed out a few days ago, the renewable energy sector has collapsed. Only a few may be ready for a bounce back, adding to the pressure.', 'Still, if you’re focused on dividend stocks to buy for income, NextEra might be difficult to ignore. It features a 3.27% forward yield with a reasonable payout ratio of 55%. Also, it enjoys 29 years of consecutive dividend increases.', 'Analysts rate NEE a moderate buy with a $17 price target, projecting 23% growth.', 'Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com', 'If you want to roll the dice with your dividend aristocrats, big-box retailer Target (NYSE:TGT) might be worth consideration. Granted, the overall high-inflation environment (not withstanding the most recent inflation data) isn’t great for consumer sentiment. So, betting on a retailer carries natural risks. If you don’t think so, just look at the TGT chart. Since the January opener, it fell roughly 27%.', 'Nevertheless, it’s possible that fading spend in other areas can filter down to the retail segment. For example, the revenge travel phenomenon could be in trouble. But that also might help entities like Target under the trade-down effect. Basically, consumers may spend down for to acquire more bang for the buck in terms of entertainment value. In other words, retail revenge could make a comeback.', 'To add to the tempting concoction, Target offers a forward yield of 3.99%. Also, the payout ratio is doable at 49.9%, while the company itself enjoys 52 years of consecutive dividend increases. Analysts peg shares as a moderate buy with a $143.69 target, implying 29% upside.', 'Source: shutterstock.com/LCV', 'From a cursory perspective, IBM (NYSE:IBM) couldn’t get more boring if it tried. Yes, it’s a technology stalwart but it’s also a legacy one. These days, seemingly everyone wants to jump on the hype train involving artificial intelligence or the blockchain.

You can skip our detailed analysis of value dividend stocks and their previous performance, and go directly to read 5 Low PE High Dividend Stocks to Buy Now.\xa0', 'A low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio suggests that the stock is undervalued relative to its earnings. Investors might see this as an opportunity to buy into a company at a lower price compared to its earnings potential. Stocks with low P/E and high dividends often draw attention from investors seeking a balance between value and income. Another rationale behind the effectiveness of these strategies is their proven track record of success over extended periods. These approaches, based on seeking undervalued stocks or prioritizing dividend-paying ones, have consistently demonstrated their ability to deliver positive results over time. Heartland Advisors cited a study that looked at U.S. stock returns from 1802 to 2002. According to this study, dividends and the actual growth in dividends made up 5.8% of the total annualized return of 7.9% over the 200-year span. In a global context, a study by researchers at the London Business School analyzed the subject. Between 1900 and 2005, they discovered that the average real return across 17 countries was around 5%. Meanwhile, the average dividend yield of these countries during that period stood at 4.5%. These discoveries hold significant appeal for investors focused on long-term investment strategies.', 'Like dividend stocks, low P/E stocks also boast a robust historical performance. The same report from Heartland Advisors emphasized that historically, stocks with low P/E ratios have surpassed the overall market performance. Moreover, these stocks have offered investors reduced downside risk compared to other equity investment strategies. In one of our articles, we discussed a report from Oakmark Funds stressing the significance of undervalued stocks over extended periods. The article referenced research conducted by Eugene Fama, a distinguished professor at the University of Chicago, and Kenneth French, a notable professor at Dartmouth College. Their study showcased how stocks with lower price-to-book ratios outperformed the S&P 500 index from 1963 to 1990. This emphasized the potential of undervalued stocks to deliver better returns compared to the broader market index during that timeframe.', ""Investors frequently prioritize high dividend yields, assuming that higher is always better. However, Wellington Management conducted a study that shed light on potential flaws in this approach. Their research revealed that while stocks with the highest dividend payouts and yields did perform well over time, they didn't outperform as strongly as stocks with high, though not the absolute highest, levels of dividend payouts and yields. This study suggests that an excessively high yield might not always correlate with the best performance, highlighting the importance of a nuanced approach rather than solely focusing on the highest yield. According to analysts, dividend yields between 3% to 6% are considered healthy."", 'That said, there are some stocks with higher-than-average dividend yields that not only offer attractive yields but also showcase robust histories of consistently increasing their dividends over time.

(NYSE:EPD) boast dividend yields surpassing 7%, a notably high figure, while impressively maintaining decades-long streaks of consistently growing their dividends.

The document provides a detailed overview of the company's financial performance over the past fiscal year, revealing a decrease in revenues from $5,632.3 million in 2021 to $4,030.4 million in 2023. Despite this downturn, Hologic Inc has maintained a solid gross profit of $2,071.5 million in 2023. The company's net income also saw a decline, from $1,871.5 million in 2021 to $456.0 million in 2023. These figures set the stage for a nuanced SWOT analysis, providing investors with a clearer picture of Hologic Inc's financial health and strategic positioning in the market."", ""Market Leadership in Diagnostics: Hologic Inc has established itself as a market leader in the diagnostics segment, particularly in women's health. The company's molecular diagnostic assays, run on advanced instrumentation systems like Panther and Tigris, have become industry standards. This leadership is underpinned by a strong portfolio of proprietary products, which accounted for 60% of total sales in the latest fiscal year. The acquisition of Gen-Probe further bolstered Hologic Inc's diagnostics capabilities, demonstrating the company's commitment to innovation and growth in this area."", ""Robust Financial Position: Despite a challenging fiscal year, Hologic Inc has maintained a strong balance sheet. The company's gross profit margin remains healthy, and its ability to generate a net income of $456.0 million in a pandemic-affected market is commendable. This financial resilience is a testament to Hologic Inc's operational efficiency and strategic cost management, positioning the company well for future investments and growth opportunities."", ""Revenue Decline: Hologic Inc's revenue has seen a notable decline over the past fiscal year, dropping from $5,632.3 million in 2021 to $4,030.4 million in 2023. This reduction reflects the impact of the pandemic on certain segments, such as breast health, which experienced suppressed sales. The company must address the underlying factors contributing to this decline and explore strategies to revitalize its revenue streams."", ""Dependence on Core Markets: With 69% of its revenue generated from the United States, Hologic Inc's financial performance is heavily reliant on its core domestic market. This concentration poses a risk, as any economic downturn or policy changes in the U.S. healthcare system could disproportionately affect the company's overall performance. Diversifying its market presence could mitigate this vulnerability and provide more stable revenue growth."", 'Expanding Global Footprint: Hologic Inc has the opportunity to expand its international presence, particularly in emerging markets. With only 20% of its revenue coming from Europe and smaller percentages from Asia and other international markets, there is significant potential for growth. By leveraging its strong diagnostics segment and capitalizing on global healthcare trends, Hologic Inc can tap into new customer bases and drive international sales.', 'Technological Advancements: The healthcare industry is rapidly evolving, with technological advancements creating new opportunities for innovation. Hologic Inc can leverage its R&D capabilities to develop cutting-edge products that address emerging health concerns and meet the changing needs of healthcare providers. Investing in telehealth, personalized medicine, and AI-driven diagnostics could position the company at the forefront of healthcare innovation.', 'Competitive Pressure: Hologic Inc operates in a highly competitive industry, with numerous players vying for market share. Companies like Becton, Dickinson and Company offer similar products, and technological advancements could lead to new entrants disrupting the market. Hologic Inc must continuously innovate and differentiate its offerings to maintain its competitive edge and market leadership.', ""Regulatory and Economic Uncertainties: The healthcare industry is subject to stringent regulatory requirements and economic uncertainties. Changes in healthcare policies, reimbursement rates, and regulatory standards can have a significant impact on Hologic Inc's operations and profitability. The company must stay abreast of these changes and adapt its strategies accordingly to mitigate potential risks."", ""In conclusion, Hologic Inc (NASDAQ:HOLX) faces a complex landscape marked by both challenges and opportunities. While the company's financial performance has been affected by the pandemic, its strengths in the diagnostics market and robust financial position provide a solid foundation for growth. However, Hologic Inc must address its weaknesses, such as revenue decline and market concentration, to ensure long-term success. The company's opportunities for expansion and technological innovation are promising, but it must navigate the threats of competition and regulatory changes with strategic foresight. Overall, Hologic Inc's SWOT analysis reveals a company with the potential to strengthen its market position and capitalize on emerging healthcare trends."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO), Bank of America Corporation (BAC) and Netflix, Inc. (NFLX). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>Shares of Novo Nordisk have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+81.2% vs. +11.7%). The company beat earnings and revenue estimates in Q3 due to higher GLP-1 product sales.\xa0 It has one of the broadest diabetes portfolios in the industry. Ozempic and Rybelsus have been performing well in the diabetes market.Obesity drug Wegovy has been enjoying increasing demand. Label expansions of diabetes and obesity care drugs in cardiovascular and other indications will likely boost sales. Novo Nordisk raised its 2023 view due to higher demand for Ozempic and Wegovy. Its diversifying efforts to develop new treatments are encouraging.However, stiffer competition from pharma bigwigs like Pfizer, who are likely to eat away from Novo Nordisk’s Diabetes care market share due to serious supply constraints in international markets. Patent expiry and pricing pressure across the diabetes market also remain a woe.(You can read the full research report on Novo Nordisk here >>>)Shares of Bank of America have gained +7.6% over the past six months against the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry’s gain of +9.9%. The company’s third-quarter 2023 results reflect higher revenues and costs. Because of inflationary pressure, overall costs are expected to remain elevated.The current tough macroeconomic outlook might weigh on the company’s investment banking (IB) business. This, along with the volatile nature of the capital markets, might hurt non-interest income growth.Despite these headwinds, we believe that higher rates and decent loan demand will keep aiding the company’s net interest income (NII) growth, which the Zacks analyst expects to grow 8.5% this year. The opening of financial centers and improving digital capabilities is expected to further aid the top line.(You can read the full research report on Bank of America here >>>)Shares of Netflix have outperformed the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry over the past year (+65.5% vs. +29.3%). The company is benefiting from growing subscriber base thanks to a robust portfolio. Crackdown on password-sharing and the introduction of paid sharing in more than 100 countries, which represents more than 80% of Netflix’s revenue base, is also expected to aid growth.Netflix’s diversified content portfolio, which is attributable to heavy investments in the production and distribution of localized, foreign-language content, has been driving its growth prospects.However, stiff competition in the streaming space from the likes of Apple, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, Peacock and Paramount+ is a headwind. Netflix’s leveraged balance sheet and a higher streaming obligation are concerns.

The company's value proposition of delivering quality, fashionable, brand-name merchandise at discount prices has resonated with a broad consumer base, driving its growth and success in various markets."", ""Insider transactions, particularly those involving high-ranking executives like CEOs, are closely monitored by investors as they can provide insights into the insider's confidence in the company's future prospects. In the case of TJX Companies Inc, the insider, Ernie Herrman, has sold 80,907 shares over the past year without purchasing any shares. This pattern of behavior could be interpreted in several ways."", ""On one hand, insider selling can sometimes be seen as a lack of confidence in the company's future performance or as a signal that the stock may be overvalued. On the other hand, insiders might sell shares for personal reasons that have nothing to do with their outlook on the company, such as diversifying their investment portfolio, tax planning, or personal financial management."", ""It is also important to consider the context of the stock's performance and valuation metrics.

Instead, the insider's transactions might be more reflective of personal financial planning rather than a commentary on the company's valuation."", ""Looking at the insider transaction history for TJX Companies Inc, there have been no insider buys and eight insider sells over the past year. This trend of insider selling could be a point of consideration for investors, as it may suggest that those with the most intimate knowledge of the company's workings are choosing to reduce their positions."", ""While the absence of insider buying could be seen as a negative signal, it is essential to analyze these transactions in the broader context of the company's performance, market conditions, and individual insider circumstances."", ""Ernie Herrman's recent sale of 35,907 shares of TJX Companies Inc is a significant transaction that warrants attention. However, the analysis of insider transactions, the company's valuation, and the stock's performance suggests that the sale may not necessarily be a bearish signal for the stock. Investors should consider the full spectrum of information, including the company's growth prospects, competitive position, and overall market dynamics, before making investment decisions based on insider activity."", ""As always, insider transactions are just one piece of the puzzle when it comes to evaluating a stock's potential.

This spending estimate is a 13% increase from last year's holiday season."", 'More than ever, consumers are on the lookout for value as they try not to break the bank, putting certain retailers in a better position to capitalize on this trend than others. Bernstein Analyst Aneesha Sherman joins Yahoo Finance to discuss one of those retailers, Burlington Stores (BURL), and why she believes they are an ""underdog"" ready to pounce.', '""Burlington is one of the few retailers across the landscape that has seen positive [comparable] store sales, and we\'ve seen a lot of retailers report this morning, a lot of negative comp. store sales and we\'ve seen that for the second quarter in a row now; the third quarter for some retailers,"" Sherman outlines. ""But, Burlington, as well as other off-price retailers — TJX (TJX) and Ross (ROST) — are all seeing positive comps for three or four quarters in a row, which suggests they are gaining share.""', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""- An underappreciated underdog. We certainly are seeing Burlington stores really buck the trend more broadly speaking in retail. How are they doing it? What's giving them the edge?"", ""ANEESHA SHERMAN: The story of Burlington in the last two years has been a story of a retailer that's trying to turn around its business in the midst of a lot of demand side uncertainty and supply side uncertainty. And they've had several different misses and sentiment has been just very low over the past year."", ""So today's numbers were not a huge beat. They came mostly in line. It was a $0.01 beat, and they didn't change guidance. But because they didn't cut the guide, because the quarter to date performance looks pretty good and the expectations were very low. And on the call just now, the CEO was talking about effectively 30% year over year earnings growth for the next few years as this turnaround story starts to play out. So that's what people are banking on and that's what's driving the huge surge this morning."", '- So some of the other thinking would be that a trade down would perhaps benefit Burlington. But is that actually the case right now?', ""ANEESHA SHERMAN: It is benefiting Burlington. Burlington is one of the few retailers across the landscape that is seeing positive comp store sales. And we saw a lot of retailers report this morning a lot of negative comp store sales. And we've seen that for the second quarter in a row now, the third quarter in a row for some retailers."", ""But Burlington as well as other off-price retailers, TJX and Ross, are all seeing positive comps for like, three, four days in a row, which suggests they are gaining share. And they are seeing some of that trade down volume as the middle income consumer that's squeezed is trading out of department stores and into off price."", ""- Initially, when you take a look at these inventory levels here of just about 8% on a year over year basis, what does that then tell us about the promotional activity, maybe the fact that promotional activity won't be as prevalent as we saw just about a year ago?"", ""ANEESHA SHERMAN: I think it will be slightly lower than last year. I mean, if you remember, last year was the peak of promotional activity because everyone, all the brands, all the retailers had effectively over-ordered and gotten way too much supply and were just trying to clear it aggressively. So we had record levels of promotions last year. This is going to be a promotional holiday season. There's no mistaking that. But year over year, it will be slightly better."", 'So I expect demand to be lower this year than last year but margins to be slightly better because it will be slightly less promotional, though still heavily promotional in more than normalized levels.', ""- I mean, we're continuing to see the trend be that consumers are looking for deals. They're looking for discounts and trying to cut costs wherever they may. Is that something that they can expect for an extended period of time? And if so, what are the top companies that are positioned well to benefit from that?"", ""ANEESHA SHERMAN: Yeah, I absolutely think so. I mean, last year, the lower income consumer was really struggling. This year, we've seen that middle income segment which those consumers were doing fairly well last year but inflation has finally caught up caught up to their household budgets, their COVID level spending is down, their credit card delinquencies are up, and they're looking for better deals."", ""So that's what we're seeing in some of these negative department store comps. And the positive off-price comps is we're seeing that gradual trade down. And I think we will see it for a couple more quarters. So in terms of what I would look for is I would look for these off-price names. TJX, Ross, Burlington, they're all going to be beneficiaries."", ""I mean, I call Burlington the underdog because it is doing slightly worse than TJX and Ross. It just has lower awareness. People still think of it as Burlington Coat Factory, which is what it used to be when we were young. But it is now an off-pricer and it's rebranding itself and in this turnaround. So I think it will continue to see trade down benefit.""]"

And will shoppers find bargains this year?,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/explainer-black-friday-shoppers-bargains-192012782.html,1700594412,STORY,['M'],"['(Adds Best Buy forecast in paragraph 34)', 'By Juveria Tabassum, Savyata Mishra', 'Nov 16 (Reuters) - Retailers are preparing for what they hope will be yet another record-setting global shopping spree on Black Friday, the fourth Friday of November, which this year is Nov. 24. Known for crowds lining up at big-box stores to pounce on doorbuster discounts during the early hours after American Thanksgiving, Black Friday normally marks the unofficial start of the Christmas shopping season. Retailers in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere will be trying to cash in on the hoopla. Here is what to expect from Black Friday 2023.', ""WHY IS IT CALLED 'BLACK' FRIDAY?"", 'Starting around the 1960s and early 1970s, police and bus drivers in Philadelphia used the term ""Black Friday"" to refer to the chaos an influx of people to the city created before the Thanksgiving weekend. Visitors would trawl the stores in Philadelphia on Friday with their Christmas lists looking for gifts. Shoplifting and parking violations ensued. Department stores re-branded the term to ""Big Friday"" to put a more positive spin on it. But the name did not stick, and since the 1980s retailers began to describe Black Friday as the day when their retail ledgers are allegedly ""in the black,"" or operating at a profit, as customers start holiday shopping, according to Marcus Collins, a marketing professor with Ross School of Business, University of Michigan.', '""What we know is Black Friday, because it\'s so ceremonial, we get more people participating in it,"" Collins said.', ""WHAT ARE RETAILERS' PLANS THIS YEAR?"", 'Retailers including Best Buy, Macy\'s, H&M and pure e-commerce retailers like Shein and Temu are already touting early Black Friday ""deals"" of up to 30% off on some limited merchandise online and in stores. Such early promotions could help them measure shopper demand and avoid product shortages, which could be a big problem this year. Water levels in a key shipping artery, the Panama Canal, have dropped due to a severe drought, cutting the number of ships carrying merchandise through it. Many retailers in the U.S. intentionally muted their holiday hiring plans. Labor shortages are also a challenge for retailers in Europe, meaning shoppers could find fewer staff to help them.', 'ARE BLACK FRIDAY CROWDS LIKELY THIS YEAR? Around 130.7 million people are planning to shop on Black Friday this year, according to data from the National Retail Federation (NRF). Thanksgiving weekend, which encompasses Black Friday and Cyber Monday - the Monday after Thanksgiving - is typically the busiest shopping period in the United States.', 'But Dana Telsey, CEO of Telsey Advisory Group, said Black Friday itself will not be as important this year. With Christmas falling on a Monday, the ""procrastination factor (is) even greater because shoppers can wait until Saturday or Sunday"" before Christmas to get gifts, she said this week.', 'Throughout the holiday season, in-store traffic is expected to fall slightly this year, dropping by 3.5% compared to last year, according to retail analytics firm Sensormatic Solutions.', 'Wet weather, which deterred in-store traffic in some parts of the U.S. last year on Black Friday morning, is largely not expected this year, according AccuWeather.', 'Although most U.S. stores will be closed on Thanksgiving again this year, opening for shoppers at 5 a.m. or 6 a.m on Friday, some retailers are advertising discounts online that kick in starting at 12:01 a.m. on Thanksgiving.', 'Among them is Kohl\'s, which is promoting what it calls a ""Super Deal"" on Thanksgiving and Black Friday on products including Beats Studio Buds wireless noise cancelling earbuds for $89.99, from the regular price of $149.99.', ""Retailers big and small are touting online ordering and curbside pick-up this year for the convenience of shoppers who want to avoid stores. In the past decade, Americans' Black Friday purchases online have more than tripled, reaching $9.12 billion on the day last year, according to data from Adobe Analytics."", ""WILL SHOPPERS FIND BLACK FRIDAY DEALS THIS YEAR? Several major retailers from Dollar General to Walmart and Macy's could be saddled with too much stock for a second straight year, according to a Reuters analysis. They likely will need to offer discounts in order to drive shoppers to their stores and websites."", ""Even ahead of Black Friday, research firm Jane Hali & Associates said discounts at Kohl's and Macy's were as high as 60%, with foot traffic lower at these two retailers and Nordstrom compared to last year."", 'Adobe said online discounts were expected to be as steep as 35% on toys, 24% on sporting goods and 19% on furniture.', 'HOW MUCH ARE SHOPPERS EXPECTED TO SPEND? Holiday sales online and in U.S. stores are expected to rise between 3% and 4% during November and December, their slowest pace in five years, according to a forecast by the NRF.', 'Spending online during Black Friday is expected to rise 5.7% to roughly $9.6 billion, according to Adobe Analytics.', 'In the United Kingdom, online spending during Black Friday is expected to rise 4.5% to 1.05 billion pounds ($1.30 billion), with total sales over the Cyber Weekend reaching 3.8 billion pounds, according to an Adobe forecast.', 'WHAT ARE RETAILERS DOING TO ATTRACT HOLIDAY SHOPPERS? With student loan payments returning, and costs of housing and essentials pinching household budgets, analysts believe retailers will have to rely on promotions and early offers to stay afloat this holiday season.', 'Consumers were looking to make the most of promotional events and wrap up their shopping in just 5.8 weeks this year, when compared to a 7.4-week window pre-pandemic, according to data from Deloitte.', ""WHAT ITEMS ARE HOT FOR BLACK FRIDAY THIS YEAR? IPhones will be hot again, with the recent launch of the iPhone 15. Last year, shoppers looking for Apple's iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max returned empty handed as the technology company struggled with production snafus in China."", 'Electronics are expected to be the top pick this shopping season, with estimates of a 6% growth, according to a report by Mastercard. Best Buy kicked off its Black Friday deals in late October with offers such as its Play Station 5 for $499.99 bundled with either ""Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III"" or Marvel\'s ""Spider-Man 2"", though the retailer on Tuesday forecast a bigger decline in annual comparable sales and pointed to ""difficult to predict"" consumer demand.', 'Skin and hair care products remain popular, with Ulta Beauty offering up to 40% discount on CoverGirl and Lancome mascaras, Bobbi Brown concealers and select products of its own label.', ""WHAT ARE RETAILERS SAYING ABOUT THIS YEAR'S BLACK FRIDAY?"", 'Macy\'s CEO Jeff Gennette on Thursday said the competitive landscape has shifted to Black Friday deals prior to Black Friday. ""We\'re in the midst of that along with our competitors, customers are taking advantage of that.""', 'Mattel President Steve Totzke told Reuters on Monday that he is expecting a strong Black Friday and run-up to the holidays even as the toymaker warned of slowing demand for the toy industry last month.', '($1 = 0.8048 pounds) (Reporting by Juveria Tabassum and Savyata Mishra in Bengaluru, Richa Naidu in London, additional reporting by Helen Reid in London; Editing by Josie Kao)']"

You can skip our detailed analysis on key trends and players in the naval industry and head over directly to our article titled: 5 Countries Have Aircraft Carriers But Only One Has A $13.3 Billion Warship.', 'Aircraft carriers are critical naval assets that allow planes to land and take off from in the sea. Their history dates back to 1910 when a US pilot named Eugene Ely flew a plane from the deck of an American cruiser in Virginia, and then later in 1911 famously made a landing on the Pennsylvania battleship in San Francisco Bay. Over the decade that followed, several naval powers experimented to develop their aircraft carriers for use during conflicts. ', 'The most notable among these include the HMS Argus which was developed by the British Navy during World War I; and the USS Langley – the first aircraft carrier to join the fleet of the US Navy in 1922. However, it was not until the 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor that truly marked the entrance of aircraft carriers in military conflicts. Since then, even today, they are the most potent platforms for naval warfare.', 'Manufacturers, over the years, have ensured that aircraft carriers evolve with time. Today, these are larger in size and come equipped with armored and angled flight decks, landing signal systems, steam-powered catapults, and latest electromagnetic and gear technology to address challenges faced by older carriers from heavy weights and high landing speeds of aircrafts. There are also various variants of these aircraft carriers now, such as nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, helicopter carriers, amphibious assault ships, and multipurpose carriers.', 'Disputes and conflicts in different parts of the world have propelled navies to procure aircraft carriers. As a result, the global aircraft carrier industry is forecasted to grow at 2% between 2023 and 2028, with the Asia-Pacific region likely to be the fastest growing region during this period when it comes to procurement of these giant war machines.', 'In the United States, Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII) is leading the industry with its expertise in designing and building nuclear-powered carriers for the US Navy, including the much-famed next-generation aircraft carrier class Gerald R. Ford that would enable the American Navy to meet naval operational needs of the 21st century. The American Navy does not only procure these ships from Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII), but also receives service facilities from the company during the life of the aircraft carrier. In 2022, Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII) generated $10.67 billion in revenues.', '2023 has again been a great year for the company, which is reflected in its financial performances in the third quarter of the year. Below is an excerpt from Thomas E. Stiehle, Executive VP and CEO, in Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII) Q3 2023 Earnings Call:', '""Our third quarter revenues of $2.8 billion increased approximately 7.2% compared to the same period last year, and represents a record third quarter result for HII. This increased revenue was largely attributable to growth at Mission Technologies and Ingalls shipbuilding. Operating income of $172 million increased by $41 million or 31% from the third quarter of 2022, and operating margin of 6.1% compared to operating margin of 5% in the same period last year.""', 'Another key contributor to the US Navy’s strength is General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD), which has been designing ships for the US Navy since 1960. In April this year, the company won a seven-year contract worth $847 million for repair, maintenance, and modernization of the aircraft carriers operated by the US. General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) is also currently constructing an ESB 8 expeditionary sea ship and two John Lewis class fleet oilers for the American Navy.', ""Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), which is known for its expertise in aerospace, has also played an active part in enhancing the US military's naval strength by taking part in sea-based tests of aircraft carriers."", 'Gerald R. Ford class aircraft carriers are nuclear-powered carriers being developed by Newport News Shipbuilding, a division of Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII), for the US Navy to replace the Nimitz class aircraft carrier design. The Ford class would be an improved version of the Nimitz, and would include features that would allow the carriers to have more aircraft deployments, higher electrical power for ship systems, fewer sailors, and reduce 50-year operating and support costs for each ship by an estimated $4 billion. The American Navy has plans to have at least four Gerald R. Ford class aircraft carriers – CVN-78, CVN-79, CVN-80, and CVN-81.', 'The CVN-78 carrier was procured in 2008. The overall procurement cost for this warship was estimated to be $13.3 billion then. It was commissioned in 2017 and became operational in December 2021. Between October and November of 2022, the CVN-78 was deployed for its first operational stress test in the Atlantic waters, during which it completed more than 1,250 aircraft flights.', 'The CVN-79 was procured in 2013 for an estimated $12.7 billion dollars and is currently being built with improved processes. By its next maintenance period, it will be capable of deploying Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s F-35C fighter jets. It is scheduled to be delivered to the US Navy in July 2025. The CVN-80 and CVN-81 are likely to join the naval fleet in 2028 and 2032 respectively.', 'Since only one country has a $13.3 billion warship, it is ranked first in our rankings. For the rest, we have listed countries that have aircraft carriers in ascending order of the number of carriers they possess. Navies that have more carriers rank higher.

It has a displacement of 26,000 tonnes and a range of 9,000 nautical miles. Juan Carlos I is equipped with facilities required to launch the Spanish military’s Harrier fighter jets.', 'Aircraft Carriers: 1', 'TCG Anadolu is Turkey’s only aircraft carrier and is equipped with aviation facilities that allow the Turkish military to use the ship to launch and land aircrafts on. Ankara is planning to equip the carrier with Bayraktar TB3 after Turkey’s talks with the US for Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s F-35 jets broke down due to the Turkish government acquiring air defense missiles from Russia. The TCG Anadolu has a displacement of 27,000 tons.', 'Aircraft Carriers: 1', 'France’s nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, FS Charles de Gaulle, is one of the most potent carriers in the world due to the deployment of a fine mix of aircrafts such as Rafale fighters, E-2 Hawkeye aircrafts, and military helicopters.\xa0', 'FS Charles de Gaulle has a tonnage of 45,000.

The former is now old and set to be replaced by Trieste. It was commissioned in 1985 and has taken part in several NATO operations in Libya and Afghanistan.

Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk."", ""Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same."", 'Zoetis clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.30. Its ROE is pretty impressive but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.', 'Return on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.', ""Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company."", 'But note: Zoetis may not be the best stock to buy.

Compared to stocks in the mid-cap, small-cap, and micro-cap categories, this may make them better buys for investors targeting steady returns.', 'With more room to run growth-wise compared to the mega-caps (which outside of tech, are typically very large, mature enterprises with limited growth potential), large-cap can have the potential to produce greater returns (from both price appreciation and dividends) compared to the mega-caps.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'According to Finviz, there are 713 large-caps trading on major U.S. exchanges. However, among this large pool of opportunities, take a look at these seven. Each of these large-cap stocks has a solid track record of earnings and dividend growth.', 'Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock', 'Automated Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) has long been one of the best large-cap stocks to buy and hold. Shares in the payroll and outsourced HR services provider have experienced strong price appreciation, rising 220% over the past decade.', 'ADP stock has also been a rewarding investment for dividend-focused investors. As I noted back in August, ADP is a “dividend aristocrat,” with over 25 consecutive years of dividend growth under its belt. The stock currently has a forward dividend yield of 2.43%.', 'Assuming growth trends continue, Automatic Data Processing remains well-positioned to continue producing strong returns. Forecasts call for earnings to rise by between 9%-10% over the next few years. Dividend growth has averaged 13.6% annually over the past five years. Put it all together, and it’s clear to see why ADP remains one of the top large-caps for investors focused on steady gains for their portfolios.', 'Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com', 'Illinois Tool Works (NYSE:ITW) is another of the dividend aristocrats that’s one of the best large-cap stocks to buy. This industrial conglomerate has increased its dividend payouts 27 years in a row. With a forward yield of 2.37%, dividend growth has averaged 9.8% annually over the past five years.', 'Similar to ADP, ITW stock has also experienced an outsized level of price appreciation over the past decade. Consistent earnings growth has sent the stock surging threefold since 2013. ITW’s forward multiple (24.3) may seem steep at first place, when compared to stocks overall.', 'However, given the company’s resilient results (improved earnings despite zero revenue growth) last quarter, and the prospect of growth re-acceleration (based on sell-side earnings forecasts), ITW still appears on track to deliver the level of earnings growth necessarily to sustain its valuation, and keep shares trending upwards over a long time frame.', 'Source: JennLShoots / Shutterstock.com', 'L3 Harris Technologies (NYSE:LHX) isn’t in the dividend aristocrats category just yet, but it’s getting there. This defense firm has raised its payouts for 21 years in a row.', 'LHX’s 2.43% dividend yields provide a solid baseline of returns, and the payout has increased by 13.6% on average over the past five years.', 'Thanks to the company’s strengths in acquiring/realizing cost/growth synergies out of bolt-on acquisitions, LHX stock (up 182.8% over the past 10 years) appears poised to keep rising, in line with expected high single-digit increases in earnings per share.', 'That’s not all. As Raymond James analyst Brian Gesuale recently argued, LHX is undervalued compared to peers in the aerospace and defense technology space. While not for certain, it’s possible that, over time, this valuation gap is bridged. Such multiple expansion could help to further boost future total returns.', 'Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com', 'With shares declining in price over the past five years, at first you may question Medtronic’s (NYSE:MDT) appeal as a long-term buy-and-hold. Yet while the medical device maker hasn’t exactly been a winner for investors in recent years, it could be a different story in the years ahead.', 'As InvestorPlace’s Will Ashworth recently pointed out, Medtronic is in the midst of a restructuring. Once the company completes divesting non-core/underperforming business segments, and becomes focused fully on higher growth/higher margin products, MDT stock (trading for only 14.2 times earnings today) could experience a big re-rating to the upside.', 'Alongside this, the stock’s moderately-high dividend (3.8% forward yield) stands to provide a further boost for total returns. While it may take time for the turnaround to play out, in hindsight buying now (as uncertainty still looms over shares) could prove to be a very profitable move.', 'Source: madamF / Shutterstock.com', 'NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) shares are currently in a slump. There’s no way to sugarcoat it. As I discussed last month, shares took a dive in September, as the prospect of persistently high interest rates and slowing growth for the utility company’s renewables segments weighed on the minds of investors.', 'However, if you’re looking to make NEE stock one of the large-cap stocks to buy and hold in your portfolio, this sharp sell-off works to your advantage. Although shares have started to recover, NextEra remains reasonably-priced, at 18.4 times forward earnings.', 'Despite the walking-back of outlook, analysts still expect NEE to report high single-digit earnings growth in the years to come, which may help to drive shares higher. Combine that with NextEra’s 3.25% (and growing) dividend, and it’s easy to see why NEE, while no longer a high-flier, could still be a long-term winner for slow-and-steady investors.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'With its greater exposure to non-combustible tobacco products, up until recently, Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM) was considered the tobacco company with the brightest future. More recently, though, pessimism about the stock has made a resurgence.', 'Namely, there are concerns that, even for Philip Morris International, non-combustible growth will fail to make up for global declines in cigarette consumption. However, based on the company’s Q3 2023 results, I wouldn’t necessarily jump to this bearish conclusion about PM stock.', 'Even when excluding increased revenue resulting from PM’s acquisition of Swedish Match last year, top-line growth came in at 9.3%. With adjusted earnings per share rising 20.3%, so far it appears that the smokefree transition is working out.

Namely, inflation, along with higher interest rates, have led to softening demand from the company’s main customer base (restaurants). However, while in a rough patch right now, Sysco is likely to get back on track, once economic conditions normalize. This could spark a rebound for SYY stock, which is down 9.24% this year.', 'In terms of SYY’s appeal as one of the large-caps to buy-and-hold, after recovering from present headwinds, the company could get back to reporting prior levels of earnings growth.

If you’re looking for some of the best dividend stocks for income, you can’t go wrong with this label. It refers to S&P 500 companies that have increased their payouts to shareholders for at least 25 years.', 'Fundamentally, the major benefit of dividend aristocrats centers on incentivized performance. No one wants to lead the team that gave up on a run that has gone on for almost three decades. Obviously, it doesn’t look good on one’s resume. Therefore, a clear motivation exists to keep the passive income going, irrespective of outside pressures.', 'On a related note, this rarefied category enjoys both the business model and acumen to survive multiple market conditions. In the past 25 years, the U.S. equities sector absorbed terrorist attacks, natural disasters, financial collapses and a raging pandemic. If companies are still rewarding their stakeholders after all that, you probably can’t find a better place for dividend stocks to buy for income.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'To be sure, every asset category faces risks. Still, if you’re worried about tomorrow, these dividend aristocrats should help you rest easy.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'Based in Dallas, Texas, Atmos Energy (NYSE:ATO) is one of the largest natural gas-only distributors in the nation. Per its public profile, Atmos serves about three million natural gas distribution customers in over 1,400 communities in nine states. While hydrocarbons may face diminishing popularity, they’re still necessary amid rising population figures and subsequently increased consumption.', 'As one of the dividend aristocrats, you’re enjoying relative stability combined with the prospect of steady growth. Right now, the company carries a forward dividend yield of 2.9%. While that’s a bit lower than the utility sector’s average yield of 3.75%, the payout ratio is reasonable at 49.6%. Also, the firm enjoys 40 years of consecutive dividend increases, a status it’s jealously protecting.', 'While not the most attractively priced entity at forward earnings multiple of 17.17x, Atmos prints impressive profit margins. Subsequently, analysts rate ATO a consensus moderate buy with a $122.67 average price target. Further, the high-side target lands at $131, an intriguing idea for dividend stocks to buy for income.', 'Source: JHVEPhoto/Shutterstock.com', 'A multinational corporation specializing in marketing and distributing food products, Sysco (NYSE:SYY) appeals for those seeking dividend stocks to buy for income. To be sure, its business model isn’t the sexiest in the world. In addition to food services, the company also helps distribute small wares, kitchen equipment and tabletop items to restaurants, healthcare and education facilities, among other establishments.', 'However, it’s awfully relevant. No matter what happens in the economy, people will travel, people will get sick and they’ll all get tired of cooking at home every single day. Therefore, SYY should benefit from consistent, predictable demand. Unsurprisingly, Sysco – while it doesn’t carry the greatest financial print – is consistently profitable over the past decade.', 'As one of the most reliable dividend aristocrats, Sysco doesn’t exactly knock it out of the park with its 2.97% forward yield. However, it’s above the consumer staples sector’s average yield of 1.89%. Also, it commands 54 years of consecutive payout increases.', 'Analysts peg SYY a strong buy with an $80.25 target, projecting over 19% upside.', 'Source: monticello / Shutterstock', 'Enjoying prominence as a longstanding idea for dividend stocks to buy for income, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) deserves to be on your radar. Sure, the underlying products aren’t exactly healthy for you. However, as a producer of caffeinated products found in grocery stores, the brand might benefit from the trade-down effect. Basically, economic pressures may force consumers to look for caffeine alternatives to pricey coffeeshops.', 'As society normalizes and more companies recall their employees back to the office, Coca-Cola could represent a necessary pick-me-up. Financially, it’s not particularly exciting. For example, it features a forward earnings multiple of 20.35x, which is a bit overvalued. Still, in exchange for that premium, you get a predictable business and sky-high profit margins.', 'And that of course translates to robust passive income. One of the top dividend aristocrats, the soft-drink giant commands a forward yield of 3.23%. As well, it prints 61 years of consecutive payout increases. Analysts rate KO a moderate buy with a $63.76 target. The high-side target lands at $69.', 'Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com', 'Practically a no-brainer on the topic of dividend aristocrats, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) commands extraordinary relevance. Sure, the company spun off its consumer healthcare products unit. However, the enterprise can now focus on its viable medical technologies and pharmaceutical divisions. In fairness, JNJ hasn’t been a great performer this year, losing about 17%. Nevertheless, this could be a discounted opportunity for patient buyers.', 'Certainly, the immediate circumstances don’t look too hot. Following a generally solid quarterly report, two analysts downgraded their per-share price expectations of JNJ. However, with the sentiment drag, JNJ now trades at a trailing earnings multiple of only 10.96x. For context, the sector median for the drug manufacturing industry comes in at 23.04x.', 'It remains a consistently profitable enterprise, which helps lift the forward yield to 3.23%. Just as well, the payout ratio sits at only 44.1%, while the company commands 61 years of consecutive dividend increases. That’s reliability you can trust.', 'Overall, analysts peg JNJ a moderate buy with a $176.95 target, implying almost 20% upside.', 'Source: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com', 'Moving toward the riskier ideas among dividend aristocrats, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) on paper carries an attractive profile. Per its website, NextEra bills itself as one of the nation’s largest capital investors in renewable infrastructure. Combined with the broader political and ideological push for green energy solutions, NEE would seem compelling. Arguably, it very much is but will require substantial patience.', 'Since the beginning of the year, NEE dropped about 31% of equity value, an obviously steep erosion. Technically speaking, investors must also hope that the rally from early October doesn’t become a dead-cat bounce. As Barron’s pointed out a few days ago, the renewable energy sector has collapsed. Only a few may be ready for a bounce back, adding to the pressure.', 'Still, if you’re focused on dividend stocks to buy for income, NextEra might be difficult to ignore. It features a 3.27% forward yield with a reasonable payout ratio of 55%. Also, it enjoys 29 years of consecutive dividend increases.', 'Analysts rate NEE a moderate buy with a $17 price target, projecting 23% growth.', 'Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com', 'If you want to roll the dice with your dividend aristocrats, big-box retailer Target (NYSE:TGT) might be worth consideration. Granted, the overall high-inflation environment (not withstanding the most recent inflation data) isn’t great for consumer sentiment. So, betting on a retailer carries natural risks. If you don’t think so, just look at the TGT chart. Since the January opener, it fell roughly 27%.', 'Nevertheless, it’s possible that fading spend in other areas can filter down to the retail segment. For example, the revenge travel phenomenon could be in trouble. But that also might help entities like Target under the trade-down effect. Basically, consumers may spend down for to acquire more bang for the buck in terms of entertainment value. In other words, retail revenge could make a comeback.', 'To add to the tempting concoction, Target offers a forward yield of 3.99%. Also, the payout ratio is doable at 49.9%, while the company itself enjoys 52 years of consecutive dividend increases. Analysts peg shares as a moderate buy with a $143.69 target, implying 29% upside.', 'Source: shutterstock.com/LCV', 'From a cursory perspective, IBM (NYSE:IBM) couldn’t get more boring if it tried. Yes, it’s a technology stalwart but it’s also a legacy one. These days, seemingly everyone wants to jump on the hype train involving artificial intelligence or the blockchain. But that’s also the underappreciated the narrative of “Big Blue.” It’s been involved in AI for longer than perhaps most other entities.', 'At only 6% up since the January opener, IBM stock is nowhere near as attractive as some of the three-baggers we’ve seen in the tech space. That said, in the trailing half-year period, IBM gained 22% of equity value. In the past month, it’s up over 8%. Something seems to be cooking and it may be that investors are finally understanding IBM’s incredible acumen in AI along with a host of other innovations.', 'Also, let’s not forget it’s a top player among dividend aristocrats. Right now, the company offers a forward yield of 4.42%. And while the payout ratio is elevated at 66.79%, it’s not terribly so.', 'Okay, analysts don’t really see much upside from here.

When a halving occurs, the reward for mining new blocks is halved, making it more challenging for miners to earn net Bitcoins. Historically, this event has led to increased scarcity and has driven up the value of Bitcoin due to reduced supply. Because Coinbase's business is deeply intertwined with the world's most popular cryptocurrency, the halving is a potential bullish catalyst for COIN shares."", ""For most of its history, small retail investors have comprised most of the investment in the crypto industry. However, Bitcoin has stood the test of time and is garnering attention from the world's largest asset managers.If Bitcoin ETFs are to be approved (I expect them to be), Coinbase will benefit dramatically because it is the listed exchange for most of the Bitcoin ETF filings. Furthermore, COIN CEO Brian Armstrong divulged in an interview that deep-pocketed sovereign wealth funds have already begun to allocate assets to crypto. While adoption is already in motion, the floodgates will swing open if the crypto industry gets long-awaited regulatory clarity from regulators."", 'Value investing legend Seth Klarman shocked Wall Street when he invested in Coinbase. Though Klarman is far from a crypto proponent, he explained that he bought shares because ""Coinbase is sitting on $5 billion in cash, has less than that in debt, and is doing some smart things.""

For months, TSN has exhibited relative weakness. Relative weakness in the stock market refers to the underperformance of a particular stock versus the general market. When an asset displays relative weakness, its price tends to decline at a faster rate or rise more slowly than the overall market or its peers. Investors often analyze relative strength and weakness to make informed decisions about their portfolio allocation, identifying opportunities to capitalize on stronger-performing assets or to manage risk by avoiding or reducing exposure to weaker ones.

Hear from our most active subject matter experts on the dynamic, ever-expanding subject of AI.', ""Learn more about on-device generative AI by exploring our AI on the Edge posts. If there's a related topic you'd like us to cover, simply send us a note."", 'The rapid adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has opened a new world promising explosive creativity, convenience and productivity. With large language models (LLMs), as well as language-vision models (also known as LVMs), creating a wide variety of content like more precise search results, beautiful pieces of art, personalized advertising campaigns and new software code, generative AI is already delivering on these promises.', 'However, must it come at a cost to privacy and security?', 'Are AI and privacy at odds with one another?', 'Not necessarily. With on-device generative AI, where the generative AI model runs on your personal device, like a smartphone, personal computer (PC) or extended reality headset, you can get the best of both worlds: AI with privacy and security at the same time.', 'When running generative AI models hosted in the cloud, interactions with those models can become public. Information provided to the models - including the query and context surrounding it, or data used to fine-tune the model - can be exposed, creating concerns around AI and privacy.', 'For enterprise use cases, this includes any proprietary data or even source code that is either used as queries for the model or generated by the model - clearly this situation is unacceptable.', 'On-device generative AI can mitigate these AI privacy and security issues.', 'Why on-device AI helps with data privacy and security', ""On-device AI helps protect users' information since queries involving personal data remain on the device. On-device security features (e.g., data and communications encryption, as well as password and biometric protected access) on edge devices, such as smartphones or PCs, are already trusted under certain circumstances to protect sensitive personal and corporate information."", 'Consequently, generative AI models that are hosted on device can rely on those same on-device security features to improve data security and privacy for queries and outputs. In these situations, since inference, and in some cases fine-tuning, utilize on-device memory, storage and processing resources, the models can also utilize the local data to increase personalization and accuracy of both the input and output of the model with a similar level of trust.', 'Travel convenience with on-device generative AI', ""Consider the following example: A user is traveling and looking for good dinner options. Even with a non-generative AI solution, devices already utilize the user's current location to search the Internet and provide nearby dining options. With a generative AI-based solution however, the user might want the chat assistant to not only look for good dinner options but also utilize personal data like food and restaurant rating preferences, food allergies, meal plan data, budget and calendar information to select a nearby four-star restaurant that has nutritional options compatible with the user's meal plan."", ""Once a suitable option is found, the user might then want the assistant to reserve a table at a time that is open in the user's calendar. In this situation, the assistant only reaches out to the cloud for the list of possible restaurants from which to choose as well as making the actual reservation while keeping the queries and all personal information secure and private."", 'Software development assistant with on-device generative AI', ""Another example showing the benefit of on-device generative AI is a software developer who needs to create new source code for a product. In order to accomplish this, proprietary company data, as well as existing code, will be required as input to the generative AI model. Again, it is easy to see how a coding assistant running solely on the developer's laptop would help ensure that the proprietary intellectual property is not exposed to risks outside of the company's cybersecurity tolerance."", 'Retirement planning assistant with on-device generative AI', ""Another wide-reaching example of the need for AI privacy is in retirement planning. In the United States alone, it is predicted that by 2030 all members of the baby boomer generation will be at least 65 years old - a portion of the population that is estimated to be about 73 million people.1 Immediately following that wave of retirees are multiple generations who have come to understand the importance of a well-funded retirement portfolio. As more and more people approach retirement age globally and as retirees' life expectancy continues to increase, the cost to retire is likewise increasing. Personal portfolio management will be critical in maximizing returns on investment and given this growing need, qualified financial advisors are likely to be inundated. On-device AI could help alleviate this by putting a retirement planning assistant in the palm of an investor's hand to educate and provide at least the first few levels of support which would help streamline the process once the qualified financial advisor becomes involved."", 'Using a conversational interface, the investor could provide the assistant with their current personal financial position in terms of age, savings, current investments, real estate, income, expenses, risk tolerance and investment goals. Based on this information, the assistant could come back with questions to further refine the input parameters. Given these parameters, the assistant could then provide educational information, investment strategies, recommended funds and other investment vehicles to consider. The assistant could also provide scenario analysis using both conversational and graphical outputs based on questions from the investor such as ""What if I live into my 90s?"" or ""I just got a new job, how does this affect my current plan?""', ""The assistant could then use the investor's location, level of investment and risk tolerance to provide a list of nearby financial professionals to help the investor take these preliminary strategies, refine them and ultimately implement them."", 'Security and privacy in a generative AI world is key for building consumer trust', 'In all of these examples, it is easy to see how the user might not want a cloud-hosted chatbot to access such private information but would be comfortable with an on-device generative AI model to make decisions based on local information available. Running the generative AI models on device can allow the user to take advantage of the benefits of the models without exposing personal or proprietary information.', 'Users may prefer that not only the results, but even the data contained in the prompts that initiate the queries is protected. As such, on-device inference provides users an opportunity to enjoy AI without exposing their data to cloud-hosted models.', 'When running generative AI models on device, existing technological protections are leveraged to allow for the use of on-device personal and corporate information as inputs to these models without the security and privacy concerns associated with cloud-hosted models. By enabling on-device generative AI, not only is the promise of increased creativity, convenience and productivity realized, but it also improves upon what generative AI models running solely on the cloud can deliver.', 'Up next', 'This begs the question, how do we as an industry enable on-device generative AI?

You can skip our detailed analysis on key trends and players in the naval industry and head over directly to our article titled: 5 Countries Have Aircraft Carriers But Only One Has A $13.3 Billion Warship.', 'Aircraft carriers are critical naval assets that allow planes to land and take off from in the sea. Their history dates back to 1910 when a US pilot named Eugene Ely flew a plane from the deck of an American cruiser in Virginia, and then later in 1911 famously made a landing on the Pennsylvania battleship in San Francisco Bay. Over the decade that followed, several naval powers experimented to develop their aircraft carriers for use during conflicts. ', 'The most notable among these include the HMS Argus which was developed by the British Navy during World War I; and the USS Langley – the first aircraft carrier to join the fleet of the US Navy in 1922. However, it was not until the 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor that truly marked the entrance of aircraft carriers in military conflicts. Since then, even today, they are the most potent platforms for naval warfare.', 'Manufacturers, over the years, have ensured that aircraft carriers evolve with time. Today, these are larger in size and come equipped with armored and angled flight decks, landing signal systems, steam-powered catapults, and latest electromagnetic and gear technology to address challenges faced by older carriers from heavy weights and high landing speeds of aircrafts. There are also various variants of these aircraft carriers now, such as nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, helicopter carriers, amphibious assault ships, and multipurpose carriers.', 'Disputes and conflicts in different parts of the world have propelled navies to procure aircraft carriers. As a result, the global aircraft carrier industry is forecasted to grow at 2% between 2023 and 2028, with the Asia-Pacific region likely to be the fastest growing region during this period when it comes to procurement of these giant war machines.', 'In the United States, Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII) is leading the industry with its expertise in designing and building nuclear-powered carriers for the US Navy, including the much-famed next-generation aircraft carrier class Gerald R. Ford that would enable the American Navy to meet naval operational needs of the 21st century. The American Navy does not only procure these ships from Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII), but also receives service facilities from the company during the life of the aircraft carrier. In 2022, Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII) generated $10.67 billion in revenues.', '2023 has again been a great year for the company, which is reflected in its financial performances in the third quarter of the year. Below is an excerpt from Thomas E. Stiehle, Executive VP and CEO, in Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII) Q3 2023 Earnings Call:', '""Our third quarter revenues of $2.8 billion increased approximately 7.2% compared to the same period last year, and represents a record third quarter result for HII. This increased revenue was largely attributable to growth at Mission Technologies and Ingalls shipbuilding. Operating income of $172 million increased by $41 million or 31% from the third quarter of 2022, and operating margin of 6.1% compared to operating margin of 5% in the same period last year.""', 'Another key contributor to the US Navy’s strength is General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD), which has been designing ships for the US Navy since 1960. In April this year, the company won a seven-year contract worth $847 million for repair, maintenance, and modernization of the aircraft carriers operated by the US. General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) is also currently constructing an ESB 8 expeditionary sea ship and two John Lewis class fleet oilers for the American Navy.', ""Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), which is known for its expertise in aerospace, has also played an active part in enhancing the US military's naval strength by taking part in sea-based tests of aircraft carriers."", 'Gerald R. Ford class aircraft carriers are nuclear-powered carriers being developed by Newport News Shipbuilding, a division of Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (NYSE:HII), for the US Navy to replace the Nimitz class aircraft carrier design. The Ford class would be an improved version of the Nimitz, and would include features that would allow the carriers to have more aircraft deployments, higher electrical power for ship systems, fewer sailors, and reduce 50-year operating and support costs for each ship by an estimated $4 billion. The American Navy has plans to have at least four Gerald R. Ford class aircraft carriers – CVN-78, CVN-79, CVN-80, and CVN-81.', 'The CVN-78 carrier was procured in 2008. The overall procurement cost for this warship was estimated to be $13.3 billion then. It was commissioned in 2017 and became operational in December 2021. Between October and November of 2022, the CVN-78 was deployed for its first operational stress test in the Atlantic waters, during which it completed more than 1,250 aircraft flights.', 'The CVN-79 was procured in 2013 for an estimated $12.7 billion dollars and is currently being built with improved processes. By its next maintenance period, it will be capable of deploying Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s F-35C fighter jets. It is scheduled to be delivered to the US Navy in July 2025. The CVN-80 and CVN-81 are likely to join the naval fleet in 2028 and 2032 respectively.', 'Since only one country has a $13.3 billion warship, it is ranked first in our rankings. For the rest, we have listed countries that have aircraft carriers in ascending order of the number of carriers they possess. Navies that have more carriers rank higher.

It has a displacement of 26,000 tonnes and a range of 9,000 nautical miles. Juan Carlos I is equipped with facilities required to launch the Spanish military’s Harrier fighter jets.', 'Aircraft Carriers: 1', 'TCG Anadolu is Turkey’s only aircraft carrier and is equipped with aviation facilities that allow the Turkish military to use the ship to launch and land aircrafts on. Ankara is planning to equip the carrier with Bayraktar TB3 after Turkey’s talks with the US for Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s F-35 jets broke down due to the Turkish government acquiring air defense missiles from Russia. The TCG Anadolu has a displacement of 27,000 tons.', 'Aircraft Carriers: 1', 'France’s nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, FS Charles de Gaulle, is one of the most potent carriers in the world due to the deployment of a fine mix of aircrafts such as Rafale fighters, E-2 Hawkeye aircrafts, and military helicopters.\xa0', 'FS Charles de Gaulle has a tonnage of 45,000.

The former is now old and set to be replaced by Trieste. It was commissioned in 1985 and has taken part in several NATO operations in Libya and Afghanistan.

His net worth stands at about $120 billion as of November 21, 2023, according to Forbes’ real-time billionaires list. The Oracle of Omaha is one of the very few individuals on the Forbes' billionaire list who made this wealth purely by investing in the stock market. But Buffett did not become the master of the game overnight. He inherited investing wisdom from his father who was a US Congressman and later a stock broker. While strong family connections did give Buffett an opportunity to raise funds in early stages of his career, he made his way up to the ranks of success by pure ability and sticking to value investing principles propended by the Benjamin Graham school of investing."", 'Every year Warren Buffett reiterates the basic principles of his investing philosophy in his letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. This philosophy is dramatically simple and eventually boils down to this: Buffett likes to invest in businesses that he believes will keep growing and because of their growth and performance the Oracle of Omaha loves to own a stake in them and hold it forever. In his 2022 letter to investors Buffett said:', 'Over the years, I have made many mistakes. Consequently, our extensive collection of businesses currently consists of a few enterprises that have truly extraordinary economics, many that enjoy very good economic characteristics, and a large group that are marginal. Along the way, other businesses in which I have invested have died, their products unwanted by the public. Capitalism has two sides: The system creates an ever-growing pile of losers while concurrently delivering a gusher of improved goods and services. Schumpeter called this phenomenon “creative destruction.” One advantage of our publicly-traded segment is that – episodically – it becomes easy to buy pieces of wonderful businesses at wonderful prices. It’s crucial to understand that stocks often trade at truly foolish prices, both high and low. “Efficient” markets exist only in textbooks. In truth, marketable stocks and bonds are baffling, their behavior usually understandable only in retrospect.""', 'Warren Buffett, who had already achieved the status of a millionaire by 1962, took control of Berkshire Hathaway back in 1965 which was at that time a textile company.

Moreover, we believe the company is on the path toward increasing its revenue from new products that rely on in‐game transactions and advertising, as well as through further leveraging its intellectual property from consoles and PCs into mobile games. At the time of purchase, there was heightened uncertainty regarding whether regulators would approve the pending acquisition of the company by Microsoft, a current Value Equity holding. This, we believe, provided an opportunity for us to own Activision Blizzard at an attractive discount to our estimates of intrinsic value should the company remain independent. Conversely, if the transaction commenced and Activision Blizzard was indeed acquired, we would still benefit through our investment in Microsoft.

In this article, we decided to focus on Medtronic's  ROE."", ""Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Medtronic ', 'Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Medtronic is:', '8.0% = US$4.1b ÷ US$52b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2023).', ""The 'return' is the yearly profit.

However, its ROE is similar to the industry average of 9.5%, so we won't completely dismiss the company. Still, Medtronic has seen a flat net income growth over the past five years.

Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 51% over the next three years. As a result, the expected drop in Medtronic's payout ratio explains the anticipated rise in the company's future ROE to 14%, over the same period."", ""In total, we would have a hard think before deciding on any investment action concerning Medtronic.

UNH, The Cigna Group CI, Humana Inc. HUM, Centene Corp. CNC and Molina Healthcare, Inc. MOH.', 'Link: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2186490/5-hmo-stocks-set-to-gain-from-growing-membership-tech-advancements', ""The U.S. health insurance industry, commonly referred to as the Health Maintenance Organization (HMO), is likely to be aided by rising premiums that result from a growing membership base. Contract wins from federal or state authorities also contribute to membership and premium growth. An aging population will continue to keep demand for health insurers' Medicare plans high in the future. Industry players resort to a merger and acquisition (M&A) strategy and technology advancements to enhance capabilities. Companies like UnitedHealth Group Inc., The Cigna Group, Humana Inc., Centene Corp. and Molina Healthcare, Inc. are well-placed to gain from the industry's favorable growth prospects."", ""The Zacks HMO industry consists of entities (either private or public) that take care of subscribers' basic and supplemental health services. Companies in this space primarily assume risks and assign health and medical insurance policy premiums. Industry participants also provide administrative and managed-care services for self-funded insurance. Services are generally offered by a network of approved care providers (called in-network), which include primary care physicians, clinical facilities, hospitals and specialists. However, out-of-network exceptions are made during emergencies or when it is medically necessary. Health insurance plans can be availed through private purchases, social insurance or social welfare programs."", 'A Growing Premium Base: The industry participants devise affordable health insurance plans and infuse them with some eye-catching features to boost the lucrativeness of such plans and stand out from their peers. By extending such beneficial plans across several U.S. communities, the health insurers enjoy a growing membership base. This, in turn, fetches them with a steady flow of premiums — the most significant contributor to revenues of any health insurer. The strength of these plans fetches numerous contract wins and renewed agreements from federal or state authorities. However, the resumption of elective procedures, which were deferred to keep beds open for a humongous number of COVID patients, in full swing poses a concern for health insurers. An uptick in elective surgeries implies the need to address a higher number of claims from plan members. This would elevate costs, but the financial strength and diversified operations are expected to provide a shield to the industry participants from such headwinds.', 'A Rising Greying Population: The Medicare plans are intended to cater to people aged 65 or above. An aging U.S. population is likely to sustain the solid demand for the plans in the days ahead. Per the leading market and consumer data provider, Statista, around 17.3% of Americans were 65 years or above in 2020. The percentage is anticipated to reach 22% by 2050. Industry participants can, therefore, make use of the Medicare plans to welcome more members of the rapidly growing senior population and grow its customer base. They contract with an extensive network of healthcare providers, which can be physician groups, hospitals, ancillary providers, and pharmacies, to deliver quality care services to the medically vulnerable population.', 'Technological Advancements: The industry continues to undertake significant investments in developing virtual healthcare solutions (more commonly referred to as telehealth services) in order to embrace the digitization trend being infused across every sphere of life. These services enable patients to receive care from the comfort of their homes and thereby reduce the mounting burden on the U.S. healthcare system arising from frequent patient admissions. Such technologies, therefore, boost operational efficiencies and reduce costs for the industry participants. Though tech investments might result in escalating costs for health insurers, virtual services continue to fetch regular revenues and enable them to achieve a competitive edge over their peers.', ""An Active M&A Strategy: The health insurers resort to an M&A strategy for upgrading their product and services portfolio that will fetch them a growing number of members. Such initiatives are also meant to expand the global presence and bring diversification benefits to health insurers, which are crucial to strengthening one's market position. However, continued rate hikes by the Fed in order to tame inflation may have thrown a roadblock to health insurers' pursuit of an M&A strategy, considering the rising borrowing costs that make people reluctant to opt for loans for financing M&A deals."", ""The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all-member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. The Zacks Medical-HMOs industry, which is housed within the broader Zacks Medical sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #61, which places it in the top 24% of more than 250 Zacks industries."", ""Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. The industry's positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

For those of you following along on the slides, I'm on the slide 3, entitled Overview. We're very pleased to report a strong financial and operating performance for the third quarter of fiscal '24. Our team did an outstanding job of consistent execution of our strategy as we continue to win market share.While the retail environment remains challenging as consumers are being more selective in their discretionary spending, we worked very hard to offer compelling product mix that meets this demand. Additionally, our superior customer service a best-in-class omnichannel shopping experience, strong vendor relationships, and store placements in underserved markets, are the state competitive advantages that allowed us to continue to gain market share.Our sales were supported by a strong back to school season, which occurred the first month of the third quarter. Footwear sales continue to be the key driver of our sales, especially for our premium brands. We are fortunate to have strong vendor relationships that support our ability to deliver the latest products that appeal to our fashion-conscious consumers. During the quarter we benefited from a more regular schedule of new product launches, which received a very positive response from our brand loyal customers.As announced earlier in the quarter, we launched our Nike connected partnership, which connects Hibbett and Nike's royalty programs. We're very excited about this new benefit for our customers and what it means for our joint businesses, Bill will provide some additional detail in his remarks. In addition to our solid sales performance, we're pleased with the progress we have made with respect to improved expense management and disciplined inventory controls, Bob will cover this in greater detail in his remarks. We also continue to make the necessary investments in our business to enhance the customer experience, both in our stores and our expanding omnichannel platform.I believe our store expansion strategy will be a key driver to our continued growth. And we are still on track to meet our goal of adding approximately 40 net new stores this year. And we're pleased with the trends in our business and look forward to the fourth quarter and a successful holiday sale season in line with our expectations. We're excited about additional new product launches around the holidays, which will boost sales. And we're confident we have sufficient inventory to support these events and our premium footwear sales. I would like to emphasize in short, we're investing in our business model for the long term and continue to take market share.Before turning the call over to Jared, I would like to thank our 11,000 team members across the organization for their dedication and hard work and support to our customers in a relatively challenging environment. We have a passionate and dedicated workforce operating more than 1,150 stores, our omnichannel platform, our logistics facilities, and our store support center. They distinguish our brand in the marketplace with outstanding support that continues to drive customer loyalty and extends our market reach. Thank you.I'll now turn the call over to Jared."", 'Jared Briskin', ""Thank you, Mike. Good morning. Please turn to slide 4, entitled merchandising. The third quarter opened with a strong conclusion to the back-to-school season. Footwear remained our strongest category during the quarter with a low single digit comp sales increase. Results in footwear were driven by strength in basketball, lifestyle, and running silhouettes; a favorable launch calendar also enabled these positive results. Apparel and team sports were both negative for the quarter, down in the low teens. Seasonal categories were strong during the back-to-school season, but cold in the latter part of the quarter due to the warm and dry weather patterns.Apparel also continues to be affected by promotional activity due to elevated inventory levels in the market. While apparel was a challenge, overall, socks and backpacks were strong performers in the back-to-school period. Specific to footwear and apparel, the men's and kids' business was down low single digits, while women's was positive mid-single digits. Men's and kids were both down low single digits, driven by a low teen decrease in apparel, footwear results in both men's and kids were positive low-single digits. Women's was up mid-single digits, driven by a mid-teens increase in footwear, offset by weak apparel results.We continue to make progress in reducing our inventory. Inventory levels declined slightly in the third quarter versus the second quarter as well as year over year. We continue to expect the promotional environment through the fourth quarter, our targeted promotional efforts as well as support from our key brand partners will help us achieve our goals for inventory reduction. Expectations remain unchanged, and we are on track to deliver a mid-teens year over year inventory decline at year end.And I'll hand the call over to Bob to cover our financial results."", 'Robert Volke', ""Thank you, Jared, and good morning. Please refer to slide 5, entitled Q3 fiscal '24 results. As a reminder, all financial results are reported on a consolidated basis. That includes both the Hibbett and City Gear brands.Total net sales for the third quarter of fiscal '24 decreased 0.3% to $431.9 million from $433.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal '23. Overall comp sales decreased 2.7% versus the prior year third quarter. Brick and mortar comp sales declined 5.4% compared to the prior year's third quarter, while e-commerce sales increased 12.6% compared to the same period of fiscal '23. E-commerce sales accounted for 17% of net sales during the current quarter compared to 15% in the prior year third quarter.Gross margin was 33.9% of net sales for the third quarter of fiscal '24, compared to 34.3% in the third quarter of last year. This approximate 40 basis point decline was driven primarily by lower average product margin, which was approximately 130 basis points below the same period last year. This unfavorable product margin performance is attributed to higher promotional activity across both footwear and apparel categories.Higher store occupancy costs mainly due to deleverage from the slightly lower sales volume accounted for approximately 40 basis points of the overall decline in gross margin versus the prior year period. Partially offsetting the unfavorable product margin, occupancy impacts was an improvement in freight, shipping, shrink, and logistics costs as a percent of sales.SG&A expenses were 23% of net sales for the third quarter of fiscal '24, compared to 23.9% of net sales for the third quarter of last year. This approximate 90 basis point decrease is primarily the result of our continued focus on expense management, including improved efficiency of store labor and strategic reductions in discretionary expense categories such as professional fees and advertising. These initiatives have more than offset the impacts of inflation on wages, goods, and services and deleverage from slightly lower sales volume.Depreciation and amortization in the current quarter, fiscal '24 increased approximately $1.4 million in comparison to the same period last year, reflecting increased capital investment on store development, technology initiatives and various infrastructure projects over the last three fiscal years. We generated $34.5 million of operating income or 8% of net sales in the third quarter this year compared to $34.2 million or 7.9% of net sales in the prior year's third quarter.Diluted earnings per share were $2.5 for this year's third quarter, compared to $1.94 per share in the comparable period of fiscal '23. We ended the third quarter of fiscal '24 with $29.6 million of available cash and cash equivalents on our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet and $96.9 million of debt outstanding on our $160 million unsecured line of credit.Net inventory at the end of the third quarter was $398.1 million, a 1.7% decrease from the prior year's third quarter and down 5.4% from the beginning of the fiscal year. Capital expenditures during the third quarter were $11.5 million with approximately 75% attributed to store development projects, including new stores, remodels, relocations, and new signage. We opened 10 net new stores in the third quarter, bringing the store base to 1,158 in 36 states. We repurchased just over 700,000 shares under our share repurchase plan in the third quarter at a total cost of $32 million. We also paid a recurring quarterly dividend during the quarter in the amount of $0.25 per eligible common share for a total outflow of approximately $3.1 million.Now turn to slide 6, year to date results. Total net sales for the first nine months of fiscal '24 increased 1% to $1.26 billion, while year to date comparable sales have decreased 1.9% versus the first nine months of last year. Brick and mortar comp sales declined 2.7% and e-commerce comp sales increased 2.9% compared to the prior year.Year to date gross margin was 33.5% of net sales versus 35.3% of net sales last year. This is an approximate 180 basis point decline. Please note the unfavorable gross margin varies on a year-over-year basis has improved since the end of the second quarter.We closed Q2 trailing prior year gross margin by 240 basis points. The decline in year-to-date gross margin continues to be driven by lower average product margin of approximately 240 basis points. This was 300 basis points at the end of Q2 and higher store occupancy costs of approximately 40 basis points. On the positive side, we experienced year-over-year improvements in freight, shipping, and logistics costs as a percent of net sales.SG&A expenses were 23% of net sales for the first nine months compared to 23.2% in the same period last year. The approximate decrease of 20 basis points is primarily the result of lower spend in advertising and professional fees.We have generated $96.4 million of operating income or 7.6% of net sales for the third quarter of fiscal '24, compared to $117.7 million or 9.4% of net sales in the prior year's first nine months. Net income for the first nine months of this year was $72.3 million or $5.66 per diluted share, compared with $89.6 million or $6.71 per diluted share in the prior year comparable period. Capital expenditures for the first nine months of fiscal year were $37.2 million, predominantly related to store initiatives, including new store openings, relocations, expansions, remodels, and technology upgrades.I'll now turn the call over to Bill Quinn to discuss consumer insights."", 'William Quinn', ""Thank you, Bob. Starting with our loyalty program, I'm happy to report continued growth.In Q3 our loyalty sales grew single digits. This was primarily driven by more member shopping and average ticket growth. Higher average unit retail drove the growth in average ticket, and increased member shopping was driven by continued engagement from our existing members.We continue to make improvements to our loyalty program. We are especially excited to announce the launch of our connected partnership, connecting Hibbett to Nike's loyalty program. This transformative partnership will further distinguish the Hibbett retail experience. Customers can now sign up to be a connected member, either in-store or online.Also, both new and existing customers can sign up to be a connected member. Benefits of the program include exclusive shopping experiences, personalized content, and early access to Nike and Jordan member products. Integrating Hibbett rewards and Nike membership will improve the ways we engage and delight our members across all omnichannel touch points.We heavily marketed to launch the program, and we also have a variety of ongoing digital and in-store marketing campaign. Customers have been very receptive to the program, and we are pleased with the results we are seeing.Turning to our e-commerce business. In Q3, sales increased 12.6% versus last year. E-commerce represented approximately 17% of total sales for the quarter versus last year's 15%. We have seen a propensity of customers to return to online shopping as indicated by our most recent surveys in Q3 sales data. Traffic conversion and average ticket all increased in Q3, driven primarily by footwear as well as a strong back-to-school sales.Entering Q4, we are continuing to keep a pulse on how our customers are feeling. Customers continue to have elevated concerns around the economic conditions, including inflation. On a positive note, concerns around resuming student loan payments have declined since the summer. Also, our customers intend to purchase more this holiday season than last year.I will now hand the call back to Bob to discuss our guidance."", 'Robert Volke', ""Alright, we're moving forward to slide 8. The business outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal '24 remains challenging to predict. Inflation has continued to have a broad impact, not only on consumer sentiment and spending patterns, but has also contributed to increases in our operating costs in the form of wages and prices we pay for various goods and services. Higher interest rates have driven up the cost of borrowing for us and may also be affecting discretionary purchase decisions for those consumers with variable rate loans or credit card debt. We also expect the heavier promotional environment to continue for the near term. All of these factors contribute to an uncertain retail environment as we enter the traditional holiday shopping period.Despite these headwinds and uncertainties, our strong third quarter results, coupled with a fourth quarter outlook that remains consistent with the assumptions supporting our previous guidance has resulted in adjustment of several elements of our fiscal '24 full year guidance.The most prominent change is in the increase in our diluted EPS range. We are now anticipating diluted EPS for the full year to be between $8 and $8.30. This is up from $7 to $7.75 range that we provided for earlier.Consistent with prior guidance, net sales for the full year, including the impact of the 53rd week, are anticipated to be flat to up approximately 2% compared to our fiscal '23 results. The 53rd week is expected to be approximately 1% of full year sales. Approximately 52% of our total sales will be recognized in the second half of the fiscal year. Total comparable sales are still expected to decline in the low single digit range for the full year.Full year brick and mortar comparable sales are also still anticipated to be in the negative low single digit range. However, we now expect full year e-commerce revenue to be flat to up low single digits. We are anticipating a slight mix shift toward e-commerce that we saw in the third quarter will continue through the holiday season. We expect our net new store count to be approximately 40 units for the year. This is at the low end of the previous range, as delays in external approvals and longer lead times on inspections and permitting have pushed back some of our construction schedules. We anticipate the aggressive promotional environment to continue in the near term.Projected full year gross margin remains unchanged from previous guidance, at approximately 33.9% to 34% of net sales. We have lowered the anticipated SG&A range as a percent of net sales to 23.1% to 23.3%, down from 23.3% to 23.5%, which was provided in our previous guidance. We are actively managing discretionary expenses and continue to focus on identifying efficiencies throughout the organization, which are currently helping us offset inflationary pressures, most loved, notably in labor and benefits.Operating margin for the year is expected to be in the range of 7.6% to 8% of net sales, up from previous guidance of 7.4% to 7.8% of net sales. Operating profit as a percent of net sales in the fourth quarter benefits from higher sales volume, although the 53rd week is not considered a significant driver of incremental operating profit due to the low sales volume projected for that week. We still expect to carry debt throughout the remainder of the year, although we have lowered the interest expense range as a percent of sales. Consistent with previous commentary, we anticipate the borrowings will moderate as inventory levels decline throughout and after the holiday season.As noted previously, diluted earnings per share anticipated to be in the range of $8 to $8.30, up from previous guidance of $7 to $7.75. This range assumes an estimated full year tax rate of approximately 23.1% to 23.3%, down slightly from prior guidance and an estimated year-end weighted average diluted share count of approximately $12.6 million, also down slightly from prior guidance. We continue to project capital expenditures in the range of $60 million to $70 million, with the largest allocation focused on new store growth, remodels, relocations, new store signage, and improving the consumer experience.Our capital allocation strategy will continue to include share repurchases and recurrent quarterly dividends in addition to the capital expenditures noted above.That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the line for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Mitch Kummetz, Seaport Research.', 'Mitch Kummetz', ""Yes, thanks for taking my question on hoping to get a better sense of consumer spending patterns and sounds like you guys had a good back-to-school. I'm guessing everything slowed a bit in September and October. It sounds like from a seasonal standpoint, there were some challenges. And then there was a comment made about the holiday spending outlook that you expect your consumer to spend more for the holiday than last. Can you just maybe elaborate on some of that? I don't know if you can kind of give us the months for the quarter, but just talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of kind of how the consumer's purchasing sort of peak versus non-peak periods in morning, Mr. Jarrett, I'll start and then Bill and Mike, we've been involved in the conversation as well."", 'Jared Briskin', ""But I think what we saw, obviously, the peak of back-to-school was really strong for us, and we saw that at the tail end of the second quarter into the third quarter and the month of August. So really pleased with the back-to-school results really across all categories on. And we're really excited around what the seasonal apparel was showing us during back to school. And unfortunately, as we got outside of back-to-school will be outside of that. And P. things definitely slowed down some with the biggest impact coming in apparel. And we do believe that is a direct result of the weather patterns not being favorable with regard to warmer temperatures year over year on a lack of wet weather. So we saw great some again and back to school a little bit challenges towards the end of the quarter and apparel, as I said. But footwear was fairly consistent through the quarter felt really good about footwear and in particular, the launch cadence throughout the quarter, we saw a really strong way out. So Phil, yes, more than that."", 'William Quinn', 'So to answer your question, around how customers are feeling that they do have elevated financial concerns. But at the same time, they do plan on spending more during the holidays and in particular on footwear as well as online. And when we dig further into our survey results, pretty interesting found that basically the younger, you are the more positive GCL. So Gen Z as well as millennials are definitely coalitions and tend to spend more versus the older population, which is good for us because Gen Z and millennials are core customers. And also for those people that have financial challenges that they are planning to make trade-offs of cutting back and things like eating out, entertainment to find and retail spending.', 'Mitch Kummetz', 'Also some customers plan to lean more to credit during the holidays as they are getting from the field.', 'What are the dynamics obviously geared and our bill summed it up pretty well. We had a really nice strong back-to-school selling season on the only impacts our business in a big way are the seasonal patterns during mentioned to impact some of our outerwear sales, but I feel good about our position of inventory going into the into the holiday season at our peak seasons have been strong and really look forward to seeing what the what the Christmas selling season brings a store.', 'Mitch Kummetz', ""I think I'll go ahead now, Rick here."", 'Michael Longo', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Sam Poser, Williams Trading.', 'Sam Poser', ""Good morning, everybody. Thank you very much. Happy Thanksgiving. Was a question on the inventory. Jerry, you mentioned it would be down mid 10s at the end of the year, which would get it about as clean as from a pure dollar perspective, as we've seen it in some times of the promotional activity that you're seeing that's impacting the gross margin once your inventory gets to that level on regardless of what's going on out in the marketplace. I mean, do you anticipate a significant improvement in your gross margin on your I call it your let's say, your product margin going into fiscal 25?"", 'Jared Briskin', ""Yes. Hi, Maurice, and happy Thanksgiving as well. So yes, it's really it's a two-pronged approach. I mean, obviously, we're hyper-focused on the level of inventory, and we believe we'll get to a more optimal level by the end of the year with regard to the total level of inventory. But we do still have some pressures with regard to content. So we're highly hyper-focused on the content will continue with targeted promotions around the contents train, get that our healthiest level with regard to what we're showing to the consumer as we go forward. So likely there still be a few challenges as we head into next year with regard to the content that we believe will get that resolved pretty quickly as we head into next year."", 'Mitch Kummetz', ""Thanks. And then secondly, on the new Nike core, how much is the new Nike partnership and what sounds like better allocations impacting? Where does that impact more in stores are online? And then secondly, you commented that the launch calendar was very favorable in Q2 three. How does it look going in within Q2? Give us any indication? I know it's early on on sort of what 4Q looks like today. That's a cross your fingers and get an answer question successful."", 'Jared Briskin', ""And so we're not going to answer quarter to date but we do feel good about the launch calendar in the fourth quarter and the support that we have regarding allocations in the fourth quarter, specific to Nike connected. But it's really will affect both channels as we go forward. And Bill will give a little more color here in a moment on what we did across all the channels from a connected membership perspective. But specific to product know there is additional focus around our business with regard to access points that will both impact brick and mortar as well as digital. And we'll certainly have an enhanced profile of Vendor Direct offering that will affect primarily the digital space. And then just a general focus of our business being elevated around additional support of inventory in the most coveted product. So we feel really good about where we stand or our relationship and partnership. It's been incredible on. And this will help to reinforce that as we continue to put forth a great experience for consumers."", 'William Quinn', ""Yes, Sam, to give you a little bit more on connected. So definitely help with acquisition and retention for both channels. So and what we're seeing is definitely some good sign-up rates for the Connected program."", 'Michael Longo', ""It's positive."", 'William Quinn', ""We are we are doing connected member events, driving engagement at our stores as well as member only product and some type of their customers' customers are happy that the basic gist of it is more that the program is more valuable because we're getting more than just hit them and as a result of that, we're starting to see new customer sign-ups increase.Okay, thanks."", 'Mitch Kummetz', ""And just one last thing. Can you give us any variation between what you're seeing out of Hibbett and City Gear pretty consistent?"", 'Jared Briskin', ""Sam, Tom, the I think, obviously, both both of our brands are highly focused on the fashion consumer. So it's been pretty consistent."", 'Mitch Kummetz', 'Thanks very much continued to chat with you.Thank you.', 'Operator', ""Our next question comes from Cristina Fernández from Telsey Advisory Group. Please proceed.Hi, good morning and congratulations from the on. The better result I wanted to ask about the channel mix you're seeing, particularly with the strong performance in e-commerce. Do you think it's more due to the product launches or consumers looking for promotions which have been more, I guess, significant online first sort of year, the trends in e-commerce and then April, I guess. But what initiatives are you taking to drive more traffic in stores, which has been a challenge for a few quarters now."", 'Jared Briskin', ""Thank you soon, but your word interesting as Jared, I'll start.Yes.I think from a channel perspective, obviously, we're hyper-focused on both channels on our ability to gain new additional access and inventory levels. And a lot of the most coveted products is certainly driving additional engagement from a digital perspective, Tom, so we believe a lot of that is due to the strength of our footwear business and less about the promotional activity from a digital perspective.And Bill talked to you, I'm sure you'll have some commentary around this."", 'William Quinn', ""Yes. Yes, absolutely. So the as Jerry said, the strength of the footwear business really drove that e-commerce penetration for the quarter. And we believe that will continue just based on what we're looking at here for Q4. As said, we did raise guidance for digital to flat to single digit positive. And as far as driving store traffic and what we're doing around that. Our biggest acquisition and retention vehicle is our loyalty programs, and we're doubling down on that. And we have a variety of initiatives to continue that improving that program as well as connected. Obviously, we're also doing a lot around launches, particularly in store to drive higher sell-throughs and more traffic around that as well."", 'Operator', 'Next question comes from Justin Kleber from Robert W. Baird.', 'Mitch Kummetz', ""Yes, hey, guys, it's Justin Kleber. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the on the partnership with Nike."", 'Michael Longo', 'So I want to ask a question on margin kind of two parts.', 'Mitch Kummetz', ""Just first on the product margin decline of one 30 in the quarter, can you parse that out maybe a bit at least directionally between apparel and footwear and kind of what's really driving that decline.And then just longer term, your new operating margin outlook for this year is seven, 6% to 8%."", 'Jared Briskin', ""Yes, I guess barring some economic shock, you guys still at this level is kind of the new baseline now for operating margins and we can either hold there or maybe you can expand as we look out into the future. Thank you, adjusted. Gerald, good morning and thank you. I'll start with regard to the product mix. It's really across both footwear and apparel. I mean, as we said, we're we're making great progress. And secondly, the team has done an incredible job on managing the inventory, getting the inventory lower. And as we said, we feel great about where we expect plans in Q4, and we still have some work to do to get to an optimal level of content. So that's across both categories. And I would also say that they are typically the seasonal product early in the season tends to be very margin-rich. So some of the challenges around seasonal apparel in the latter part of the quarter didn't help us as much as we might have expected with regard to margin from a product standpoint, Bob Morning, Justin."", 'Robert Volke', ""As far as obviously, we're not giving any guidance into the future at this point beyond beyond the current fiscal year. But I think, you know, directionally, we're obviously looking to continue to drive to slowly improve performance over time, nothing's a complete linear equation. So we're going to see some ebb and flow and margin. We'll see some ebb and flow in SG&A. But I think, again, we've kind of talked about this before about establish kind of new baseline. We do believe that this is a number we can again be comfortable with probably into the near term. But again, we'll provide more, and we'll guidance obviously into the fiscal 25 after we finish the current year."", 'Mitch Kummetz', 'Our guys thanks and a happy Thanksgiving, everyone.', 'Jared Briskin', 'It takes you indirectly.', 'Operator', ""Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize for the technical difficulties.We'll move on to our next question, which is coming from the line of Alex Paris with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question."", 'Jared Briskin', 'Hi, thanks for taking my questions here.', 'Robert Volke', 'I guess first, I just wanted to ask a little bit more about the guidance and sort of the 4Q implied guidance. It looks like the comp guidance and gross margin guidance remains unchanged. Is that just conservatism or are you talking about the launch calendar being strong or are you seeing more cautious consumer behavior that that led to not raising the guide.', 'Jared Briskin', ""Alex?Good morning, Jared. I'll start, Tom.Yes, I mean, I think all the above, Brian, I think there's still a lot of market uncertainty there certainly the uncertainty around that consumer from there. We still think there's elevated inventory levels in the market, which will likely lead to a pretty heavily promotional environment. The weather at the tail end of the third quarter, obviously didn't help that. So I think all of the above some there's still a lot of uncertainty in the market and even though we're confident in our plans and certainly confident about the investments we've made in the business. There is still a lot of uncertainty in the market.That's really helpful."", 'Robert Volke', 'And then just a follow-up can you really talk a little bit more about some of the secondary brand performance? I know that had been a bit softer earlier in the year. Are there any callouts as strong brands outside of Nike and Jordan are continuing to talk to business.', 'Jared Briskin', ""Yes, I mean, we have a really broad brand portfolio. As you know, we typically don't talk specifically about a lot of brands on this call. But so historically, we tend to have a pretty significant brand churn on there are some of our secondary brands that are doing a nice job from a pipeline perspective of innovation or at least newness. We have an innovation in our business doesn't necessarily mean the technology on that can mean something that hasn't been in the market that's brought back that's brought back and put forth in front of the consumer. So some brands are doing a little better with regard to the innovation pipeline and they're succeeding and others are still unfortunately, very slow with regard to innovation, that's continuing to have challenges. So as brands improve throughout next year and into the future.With regards to that, newness and innovation profile, we'd expect that better performance out of our secondary brands.Perfect. And then just my last one on, could you just talk a little bit more about apparel inventories, are there still some overages that need to be worked through? And I guess on the seasonal product is that, you know, improved a bit now that the weather has turned Yes, payouts, Jared, again, we feel really good about where our apparel inventory is. Obviously, that was the category that we really put it started putting solutions against first. So no real significant challenges with regard to apparel. Obviously, there's a lot of business to be done in the fourth quarter and a lot of uncertainty out there. So we'll see how that all finishes up. But again, we feel good about where the inventory is expected to land and really good about where we expect to have content as we get into next year."", 'Robert Volke', 'Perfect.', 'Jared Briskin', ""That's really helpful."", 'Robert Volke', 'Best of luck this holiday season.', 'Michael Longo', 'Thank you, Sonia.', 'Operator', 'Your next question is coming from John Lawrence with The Benchmark Company. Please proceed with your question.', 'Mitch Kummetz', ""Great. Thank you congrats guys. And Mike, when you talk about a little bit about expenses, I mean, obviously great strides there and I know you're doing a lot."", 'Robert Volke', ""What inning are we in before? You would wonder if you're cutting into muscle on the labor side, whatever, just just some thoughts on how much room you have on the expense cuts?"", 'Michael Longo', ""Yes, good morning. Thanks for the question and then we'll come in after me on this one, I think to set the table on the question. If you'll recall, several quarters ago, we spoke about the fact that sales had accelerated over the past few years and we dropped some costs inadvertently as as is normal, we drive some costs into our current structure. We went a little too far on a handful of things, whether that was a handful of people or a handful of projects or particular systems that we didn't need until we began a systematic process to review those about 12 months ago and that has borne fruit, and we're pretty proud of that. We don't think that we're anywhere near cutting into the muscle. We would term it more. We're taking the savings and reapplying them to the consumer experience, which has the virtuous circle of improving costs, improving our efficiency and effectiveness and speed with which we can serve the customer then?"", ""Yes, Mike, 2% at Johnston like on this a little bit rare in retail, you're able to kind of gain both the efficiency while increasing your effectiveness and to your point, not cutting into the muscle. And our big move here to the mobile platform is kind of enable us to do both of putting those tools in our associates' hands. It's made them even more productive and can enable them to do their job better with the customer. It's kind of elevated that customer experience and the associate experience. I might add to Mike's point and that combined with ourselves culture out there has led to really results improved SG&A for q three specifically, I'm just really proud of and want to state that of all the hard work done from our associates and being able to to do that and really elevating the customer experience in store we're handling."", 'Robert Volke', ""Yes, thanks. And last one for me is just taking that thought going forward, i.e., back to more normal weather patterns, et cetera, the apparel business. And there's no reason with a reasonable with a regional positive comp that you can leverage that even further?"", 'Michael Longo', ""We think so. And so to answer your first question, we think we're in the mid-innings. I just know that we're not going to take all of that to the bottom line. We are, again, we'll reiterate and reinvesting much of those savings into the business model so that we can continue into the future.Having that positive consumer experience online and at retail. But thanks for the question."", 'Robert Volke', 'Great.', 'Mitch Kummetz', 'Thanks, guys. Happy Holidays staying here.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. The next question is coming from Mitch Kummetz with Seaport Research proceed with your question.', 'Mitch Kummetz', ""Yes, I had a quick follow-up on the women's business. I just want to have a better understanding there because it was up in the quarter. I think you said that footwear was up mid 10s. Can you say how much of your business is women's? Can you can you elaborate on the strength of that business, particularly in footwear, like how much of it is that maybe there's just a better underlying product trend in women's or you're better positioned to take market share there? And like what do you see the runway for your women's going forward? Like do you think there is continued opportunity for outperformance of that side of the business?"", 'Jared Briskin', ""Yes, a mix commodity again, dirt.Yes, I think look, if we really go back and look at our history and the history of this industry to women's really haven't even focused on, we took a significant approach in 2020, when we went through our merchandising reorganization that put a focus on each gender, we felt like women's have the broadest opportunity followed by kids. Since that point, we've more than tripled the women's business. So feel great about what we're doing in women's, our we have a hyper focus teams specifically on women's that we've added resources to, and we're getting great focus from our brand partners on the women's business, the women's business sense very, very fast and trended forward for us. And our team has done an exceptional exceptional job on following those trends and getting the right levels of inventory and getting support from the vendors, we still see it as a big growth vehicle for us."", 'Mitch Kummetz', 'All right.Thanks again.', 'Robert Volke', 'Thank you.', 'Michael Longo', 'Like you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our final question is coming from the line of Sam Poser with Williams Trading. Please proceed with your question.', 'Mitch Kummetz', ""And then last one, I got a handful of the US, the inventory cleanup that you're doing that you talked about, Jared, to get the quality better. Is this something where you're sort of being more aggressive during the holiday that sort of thing to take care of it while the ducks are flying kind of situation?"", 'Jared Briskin', ""Yes, I think the answer, it's really the approach is to remain targeted with regard to promotions. And we don't we're not in a position where we need to do this mass firesale with regards to inventory, where we're targeting the promotions in the right places and we'll do our best to move through as much as we can. You'll hear in the fourth quarter put us in the best position as we go forward. But there certainly will be a balance around how much we want to do versus how much will hold over into next year and then how much other support we can get from our partners with regard to really fund inventory. So multi-pronged approach, again, I feel like the team is executing really well against that and we've made major strides."", 'Mitch Kummetz', ""Thanks. And then secondly, you called out Nike as doing quite well on the footwear side, can you is there a positive call out on the apparel side of the business you'd say, you know, this or a category brand or whatever that is doing well in a very difficult situation."", 'Jared Briskin', ""Yes, I'd say right now, our biggest driving category apparel side is denim. Denim has been a significant focus for us for a number of years. We continue to expand our presence in denim. Along with that, we are adding additional additional products within the woven category. So both of those have been exceptional, continue to be a focus for us and we believe continue to be a differentiator in our business."", 'Robert Volke', 'Thanks.', 'Mitch Kummetz', 'And then from Bob, on the share count, the currently the fourth quarter share count, what number should we be using? And then I just wanted to know about where use of where everybody is sort of the loyalty program as well as far as new members and percent of percent of business.', 'Robert Volke', 'I might have missed that earlier the end at the end of the year share count approximately 12.6 million diluted shares so I understand that Q4 is going to be significantly lower than that.', 'Mitch Kummetz', ""Is that like 11.9? Is that a I mean that's to get you to just under 12.6 is that we don't that you don't give the specific guidance for the quarters."", 'Robert Volke', 'You can do the math on the difference.', 'Mitch Kummetz', 'Thank you. And then on the loyalty and loyalty.', 'William Quinn', ""We saw growth in total active members that anyone who's purchased within the last 12 months year over year. So we're continuing to see good growth there. And loyalty is over 60% of sales. And as far as the breakdown, new news to the growth we'll see in the quarter was driven by existing member shopping. When we looked at new customers the number was slightly down, but the sales from new customers was actually up and that's because of an increase in app."", 'Mitch Kummetz', ""Okay.Thank you very much and Happy Holidays again, you're saying.Thank you."", 'Operator', ""Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our question and answer session. I'd like to pass the floor back over to management for any additional closing remarks."", 'Michael Longo', ""We'll thank you so much for your time and attention today. We appreciate it and pretty proud of the quarter more to come and look going into this holiday season. I leave you with the message of you don't have enough sneakers or denim yet. So we'll see you your family friends out in the stores this holiday season."", 'Mitch Kummetz', 'Thank you.']"

These supermodels have graced countless magazine covers and set the standards for beauty and style. Moreover, models bridge the gap between fashion designers and consumers, breathing life into garments and making them desirable. Before we dive into the list of the best cities for modeling in the world, we shall talk about the fashion industry and its latest developments to understand the bigger picture of fashion and modeling.\xa0', 'A recent survey conducted by Vogue Business among more than 600 fashion professionals in June 2023 has revealed major challenges and growing dissatisfaction within the fashion industry. The survey findings depicted fashion workers struggling with demanding work schedules, limited salaries, an overemphasis on personal relationships, and a pervasive burnout culture exacerbated by constant travel and overproduction. Discrimination, which includes issues of sexism, racism, and ableism, also loomed large in the responses.\xa0', 'Notably, over 50% of people of color reported that bigotry against their race or ethnicity had negatively impacted their careers in fashion, in stark contrast to only 6% of white respondents. Thus, the fashion industry now faces the risk of a mass talent exodus as dissatisfaction among its workforce continues to mount.\xa0', 'In an effort to improve accessibility to careers in fashion, Urban Outfitters Inc (NASDAQ:URBN) , in collaboration with Drexel University\'s Antoinette Westphal College of Media Arts & Design, has introduced a two-year apprenticeship program called ""Made to Measure: The URBN x Drexel Apprenticeship Program.""

It aims to make fashion design careers more accessible and imaginative, seeking out creative talent in the evolving fashion industry.\xa0', ""While traditional modeling powerhouses like the USA, Brazil, Russia, and the UK dominate the fashion industry, the per capita model production statistics reveal Central and Northern European nations' greater dominance. Estonia is the country with the most models, with nearly 74 female models per million citizens.

Moreover, in the US, North Dakota is often considered the best state for professional models with an average annual salary of $199,673.\xa0"", 'One of the major trends in the fashion industry is the disruption caused by AI which has the potential to inject $150 to $275 billion into profits over the next three to five years, per Mckinsey. Since 73% of customers expect brands to understand their preferences, AI has become extremely important in delivering tailored styling and recommendations, increasing customer loyalty.

Globally, there is a total of 30,077 hedge funds as reported by the Financial Times. Among this extensive array of investment managers, the majority, comprising 65%, are located in the United States. During the second quarter of 2023 alone, there were 133 new introductions of hedge funds, indicating a significant rise in fixed income-based relative value arbitrage, particularly in the form of credit multi-strategy funds. In the first half of 2023, the hedge fund landscape witnessed a notable upswing, with 226 new launches taking the forefront, particularly dominated by multi-strategy funds poised to navigate the challenges of rising rates and generational inflation, as highlighted by HFR, a prominent global authority in hedge fund industry analysis. Performance metrics have been encouraging, showcasing a 4.5% year-to-date increase in the HFRI fund-weighted composite index through August. This positive momentum was mainly driven by equity hedge and event-driven strategies, with a noteworthy contribution from relative value arbitrage.', ""Hedge funds have different strategies as to how they base their investment decisions. One of the most notable hedge funds with a very rare strategy is Renaissance Technologies. The hedge fund firm is led by mathematicians and scientists rather than market professionals. Renaissance CEO, Peter Brown, explained that this intentional approach stems from the belief that it's simpler to instruct mathematicians about markets than the other way around. The firm heavily relies on its models for trading, with human judgment playing a minimal role. Renaissance has gained a near-legendary status in the hedge-fund sphere, primarily attributed to the remarkable performance of its exclusive Medallion fund, available only to employees. From over a 30-year period from 1988 to 2018, the Medallion fund achieved an impressive 66% gross annual return."", '“We know how to build large mathematical models and that is all we know.

Really great ideas—like hiring on the basis of skills rather than pedigree—might have two.', 'That’s what Ginni Rometty, former CEO of tech giant IBM and current chairman of upskilling initiative OneTen, told Fortune last week. Rometty, aside from being IBM’s first female CEO and a top-10 fixture on Fortune’s annual Most Powerful Women list, might be best-known for driving IBM toward a hiring plan that prioritizes skill level ahead of college education or job experience.', 'A decade ago, Rometty launched what she called the SkillsFirst initiative at IBM: an “overhaul [of] its hiring practices to create on-ramps for people who were previously overlooked—and to build a pipeline of capable non-degreed workers.” At the time, she referred to these jobs as “new-collar jobs.” Today she thinks they’re better described as skills-first—and they’ve never been more front and center. That’s due to many factors, but chief among them are the increasing unaffordability of college, a volatile job market that often left companies scrambling to fill open roles, and a pandemic that gave both workers and executives alike a chance to sit and reconsider their primary needs.', ""We've seen two inflection points since she coined “new collar,” Rometty told Fortune before she took the stage at the World Business Forum in New York. The first inflection point, she said, followed the murder of George Floyd in the summer of 2020, which set off a flurry of activism and renewed corporate commitments to equitable hiring and inclusion."", '“It put the spotlight on systemic racism, and people wanted to do something productive about it,” Rometty recalled. “That would be: Give people better jobs for economic opportunity.” The demands for racial justice and equity in the workplace naturally helped catapult skills-first mentalities to becoming a movement more than just an idea, she added. (The same impetus guides OneTen, a coalition of CEOs whose stated aim is to “upskill, hire, and advance one million Black individuals who do not yet have a four-year degree into family-sustaining jobs with opportunities for advancement over the next 10 years.”)', 'Today, Rometty says, we’re at the second inflection point. Though skills-first hiring has by now decidedly cemented into more of a movement than an abstract idea, the trend is getting a seismic boost, she believes,\xa0thanks to the rapid advancements of generative AI.', 'As machine-based learning and artificial intelligence like ChatGPT, Bard, and DALL-E ramps up at a breakneck speed—some say it’s moving faster than real life—humans need to hustle to keep pace.', ""“Now you're entering a world where everyone's going to have to change their skills, and people are afraid of what their jobs are going to look like,” Rometty said, echoing countless other executives’ predictions. That means skills-first hiring will be more democratizing than ever. “This is a moment when skills-first is not just about underrepresented groups. It’s become about everyone now.”"", ""In Rometty’s ideal world, tech advancements elevate skills-first to being a talent strategy for everyone. “That’s what I saw at IBM. On one hand, I was working on new-collar jobs and I also had this massive workforce to reskill [on tech],” she recalled. “At some point, I went, ‘It’s the same thing. I'm motivating both people, and want to pay them, have transparency, career paths all on skill, not just on what their experience had been, or a credential.’”"", ""That experience—upskilling both traditional white-collar workers as well as new workforce entrants—was a “light bulb” moment for Rometty that skills-first talent strategy is genuinely for everyone. “I want to watch out that it doesn't get recast as just a DEI initiative. It's way more than that.”"", ""Another reason skills-first is reaching a fever pitch today: People have less trust in the stability of any of their jobs or training to begin with (that also stems from the fear of AI taking over, plus the numerous layoffs that have swept the workplace). “You have this view, in my mind, of a very fragile balance with democracy,” Rometty said. “People believe in democracy when they believe it's a system that gives them a better future. And right now, there's a lot of people thinking that may not be true—and it's related to skills.”"", 'If the first inflection point three summers ago made skills-first hiring the “how” for elevating underrepresented groups, she said she hopes the current inflection point makes it the “how” for reframing education. Gen Z may be already there. Millions of them, even those currently enrolled in college, believe degrees are no longer necessary. “People will no longer look at it as one-and-done,” Rometty says. “You and I are going to have to go back and get new skills. Eventually, it will mean a lot of social change.”', 'College degrees certainly still carry value—especially in terms of lifetime earning potential—which Rometty acknowledges. “It’s always good to have more than less,” she said. But she’s “totally” on board with the idea of “the decaying value of a college degree, particularly when it pertains to companies [with] skills-based programs.”', 'When generative AI fully integrates into the workforce, it will put a premium on soft skills like collaboration, judgment, and critical thinking. These are what humans do best, and they’re often skills-built, not degrees-built, Rometty pointed out. “Those are where people can upskill [when] generative AI really redefines what skills are needed for any role—despite where you went to college or what expertise you have going into it.”', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

The pattern agreements the UAW struck with GM, Ford, and Stellantis include a 25% hike in base wages through 2028, including an immediate 11% bump as well as ratification bonuses among other benefits.', 'Nissan’s pay hikes follow similar moves made by Hyundai, Toyota, and Honda in recent weeks for their US workers, none of whom are unionized.', '“Non-union workers can thank the UAW for their recent pay raises,” said automotive manufacturing expert Sam Fiorani of AutoForecast Solutions to Yahoo Finance. “It was entirely expected that wages would go up in the face of recent labor changes. There’s no reason for Toyota, Honda, Nissan, and the rest to raise their workers’ pay except for the pressure put on them from the union.”', 'Labor expert Marick Masters of Wayne State University calls what these foreign automakers are doing the “union substitution” strategy.', '“Clearly, such actions by nonunion companies can be viewed as part and parcel of a ‘union substitution’ strategy, which seeks to deter unionization in specific companies by paying workers sufficiently comparable wages,” Masters said to Yahoo Finance.', 'Masters noted the non-union foreign automakers have “skillfully navigated” union avoidance in their US operations thus far. It also helps that these automakers have placed factories in states that are not generally union friendly, like Alabama (Honda), Georgia (Hyundai), Tennessee (Nissan), and Texas (Toyota).', 'While AutoForecast Solutions’ Fiorani said the foreign automakers needed to “narrow the gap” between the Big Three’s contracts with the UAW and their own workers in order to compete, there’s also the possibility that raising pay at these non-union companies helps them attract new labor from other industries as well.', '“Raising their wages also enables them to recruit better for hourly workers, who compare wage offering not only to the unionized Big Three, but also other non-auto employers in their localities who may offer competitive compensation,” Wayne State’s Masters added. “This latter point is particularly important as wage rates have increased generally in the economy of the past couple of years after a long period of relative stagnation.”', 'For a union leader like Fain, moves by the Nissans and Toyotas of the world are music to his ears, in which the UAW hears a growing chorus of pro-union voices and new members.', '""Even though you\'re not yet members of our union, that pay raise Toyota\'s giving you is the UAW bump,"" Fain said to Toyota workers.

His net worth stands at about $120 billion as of November 21, 2023, according to Forbes’ real-time billionaires list. The Oracle of Omaha is one of the very few individuals on the Forbes' billionaire list who made this wealth purely by investing in the stock market. But Buffett did not become the master of the game overnight. He inherited investing wisdom from his father who was a US Congressman and later a stock broker. While strong family connections did give Buffett an opportunity to raise funds in early stages of his career, he made his way up to the ranks of success by pure ability and sticking to value investing principles propended by the Benjamin Graham school of investing."", 'Every year Warren Buffett reiterates the basic principles of his investing philosophy in his letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. This philosophy is dramatically simple and eventually boils down to this: Buffett likes to invest in businesses that he believes will keep growing and because of their growth and performance the Oracle of Omaha loves to own a stake in them and hold it forever. In his 2022 letter to investors Buffett said:', 'Over the years, I have made many mistakes. Consequently, our extensive collection of businesses currently consists of a few enterprises that have truly extraordinary economics, many that enjoy very good economic characteristics, and a large group that are marginal. Along the way, other businesses in which I have invested have died, their products unwanted by the public. Capitalism has two sides: The system creates an ever-growing pile of losers while concurrently delivering a gusher of improved goods and services. Schumpeter called this phenomenon “creative destruction.” One advantage of our publicly-traded segment is that – episodically – it becomes easy to buy pieces of wonderful businesses at wonderful prices. It’s crucial to understand that stocks often trade at truly foolish prices, both high and low. “Efficient” markets exist only in textbooks. In truth, marketable stocks and bonds are baffling, their behavior usually understandable only in retrospect.""', 'Warren Buffett, who had already achieved the status of a millionaire by 1962, took control of Berkshire Hathaway back in 1965 which was at that time a textile company. Today the company has a market cap of close to $800 billion, spans 40 industries and 60 companies.', 'Warren Buffett is a huge fan of making a few but optimal decisions instead of hyper diversifying and making many decisions. In last year’s letter to shareholders, Buffett said his company’s satisfactory performance was the product of “about a dozen truly good decisions – that would be about one every five years – and a sometimes-forgotten advantage that favors long-term investors such as Berkshire.” Berkshire Hathaway Performance and Returns', ""Berkshire's compounded annual gain from 1965 through 2022 came in at 19.8%, compared with S&P 500’s gain of 9.9% during the same period.

Moreover, we believe the company is on the path toward increasing its revenue from new products that rely on in‐game transactions and advertising, as well as through further leveraging its intellectual property from consoles and PCs into mobile games. At the time of purchase, there was heightened uncertainty regarding whether regulators would approve the pending acquisition of the company by Microsoft, a current Value Equity holding. This, we believe, provided an opportunity for us to own Activision Blizzard at an attractive discount to our estimates of intrinsic value should the company remain independent. Conversely, if the transaction commenced and Activision Blizzard was indeed acquired, we would still benefit through our investment in Microsoft. As such, rather than attempting to predict regulatory approval of the transaction, we instead saw the company as an optimal investment.

For example,\xa0United Parcel Service, Inc.\xa0(NYSE:UPS) renegotiated a wage increase for its union-backed workforce this summer, which weighed on margins that were already being constricted by slowing volumes.

To see more such companies, go directly to the 5 Best EV Battery Stocks To Buy in Late 2023.', 'The momentous shift from the century-long dominance of internal combustion engines to the electric vehicle era is sparking tensions in unexpected sectors of the global economy. This transformative transition is only in its initial stages, promising further developments and challenges ahead. As the global transition to electric vehicles gains momentum, there has been an exponential surge in demand for batteries in significant automotive markets such as Europe and the United States. Automotive and battery manufacturers are grappling with a challenging phase of uncertainty in the battery supply chain, prompting many to consider constructing their battery gigafactories or entering into joint ventures to alleviate the pressures on the supply.', 'The International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts that Electric Vehicles (EVs) will constitute 18% of the global vehicle market in 2023, amounting to 14 million sales—a significant increase from the 14% market share in 2022. The first half of 2023 has already demonstrated the robust performance of EVs, with a 25% year-over-year sales increase in the first quarter. Additionally, a PwC report indicates that Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) sales alone experienced a substantial 52% surge in the second quarter of 2023. Anticipated to rise by approximately 30%, reaching nearly 4,500 gigawatt-hours (GWh) annually worldwide by 2030, McKinsey predicts that the demand for batteries is poised for significant growth. The battery value chain is projected to expand by up to tenfold between 2020 and 2030, potentially generating annual revenue as high as $410 billion. By 2030, it is predicted that 40% of the demand for lithium-ion batteries will emanate from China.', ""On the other side of the globe, amid the swift ascendance of electric vehicles, the United States market has become a focal point of significant developments, challenging the skepticism surrounding the industry's expansion. Despite the notable increase, EVs represented approximately 7.2% of total sales from January through June this year. While this marked a 5.4% year-over-year increase, the relatively small market share indicates substantial growth potential for car companies in the EV sector."", ""In addition, forecasters such as Schmidt Automotive Research (SAR), which had previously indicated a plateau in 2024, anticipate a robust resurgence in sales from 2025 to 2030. Even after acknowledging the slowdown, investment bank UBS maintains a positive European forecast through 2030. Schmidt Automotive suggests that Europeans may find some relief, as the anticipated influx of highly competitive EVs from China is likely to be postponed due to a shortage of shipping capacity. With that said, the global electric-vehicle market maintains robust performance, as evidenced by China's record monthly sales in September and October, even after the cessation of subsidies. In September, the global leader in the EV market race recorded a year-to-date increase of 29%. Concurrently, the global EV market exhibited a 34% growth during the same period."", 'Ultimately, although lithium-ion batteries remain central to the electric vehicle industry because of their elevated energy density, they come with inherent toxicity and potential dangers in certain situations.

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine."", 'Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.', ' See our latest analysis for Pinnacle West Capital ', ""As Pinnacle West Capital operates in the electric utilities sector, we need to calculate the intrinsic value slightly differently. Instead of using free cash flows, which are hard to estimate and often not reported by analysts in this industry, dividends per share (DPS) payments are used. This often underestimates the value of a stock, but it can still be good as a comparison to competitors. The 'Gordon Growth Model' is used, which simply assumes that dividend payments will continue to increase at a sustainable growth rate forever. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a company's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In this case we used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%). The expected dividend per share is then discounted to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.2%. Relative to the current share price of US$71.8, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 20% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out."", 'Value Per Share = Expected Dividend Per Share / (Discount Rate - Perpetual Growth Rate)', '= US$3.6 / (6.2% – 2.2%)', '= US$90.2', ""Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Pinnacle West Capital as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business."", 'Strength', 'No major strengths identified for PNW.', 'Weakness', 'Earnings declined over the past year.', 'Interest payments on debt are not well covered.', 'Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Electric Utilities market.', 'Opportunity', 'Annual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.', 'Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.', 'Threat', 'Debt is not well covered by operating cash flow.', 'Paying a dividend but company has no free cash flows.', 'Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.', 'Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won\'t be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company.

The latest reading suggests that inflation might be moving in the right direction, sparking optimism among investors that the Federal Reserve might not implement further rate hikes in the current cycle."", 'However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell expressed doubts about whether the current level of monetary tightening is adequate to reduce inflation sustainably. This uncertainty places significant attention on the upcoming FOMC meeting on Dec 12-13, with investors eagerly awaiting any signals of future interest rate decisions.', ""Investors and analysts will be closely scrutinizing the minutes from the FOMC's November meeting, to be released today, to gain insights into the committee's perspectives on potential rate adjustments this year."", 'If you wish to unlock portfolio value in the current market dynamics, one of the most effective approaches could be value investing.

While comparing stocks, if other factors are similar, the ones with higher earnings yield are considered undervalued, while those with lower earnings yield are seen as overpriced.', 'While earnings yield is nothing but the reciprocal of the P/E ratio, it is a little more illuminating than the traditional P/E ratio as it also facilitates the comparison of stocks with fixed-income securities.

Bernstein Analyst Aneesha Sherman joins Yahoo Finance to discuss one of those retailers, Burlington Stores (BURL), and why she believes they are an ""underdog"" ready to pounce.', '""Burlington is one of the few retailers across the landscape that has seen positive [comparable] store sales, and we\'ve seen a lot of retailers report this morning, a lot of negative comp. store sales and we\'ve seen that for the second quarter in a row now; the third quarter for some retailers,"" Sherman outlines.

We certainly are seeing Burlington stores really buck the trend more broadly speaking in retail. How are they doing it? What's giving them the edge?"", ""ANEESHA SHERMAN: The story of Burlington in the last two years has been a story of a retailer that's trying to turn around its business in the midst of a lot of demand side uncertainty and supply side uncertainty. And they've had several different misses and sentiment has been just very low over the past year."", ""So today's numbers were not a huge beat. They came mostly in line. It was a $0.01 beat, and they didn't change guidance. But because they didn't cut the guide, because the quarter to date performance looks pretty good and the expectations were very low. And on the call just now, the CEO was talking about effectively 30% year over year earnings growth for the next few years as this turnaround story starts to play out. So that's what people are banking on and that's what's driving the huge surge this morning."", '- So some of the other thinking would be that a trade down would perhaps benefit Burlington. But is that actually the case right now?', ""ANEESHA SHERMAN: It is benefiting Burlington. Burlington is one of the few retailers across the landscape that is seeing positive comp store sales. And we saw a lot of retailers report this morning a lot of negative comp store sales. And we've seen that for the second quarter in a row now, the third quarter in a row for some retailers."", ""But Burlington as well as other off-price retailers, TJX and Ross, are all seeing positive comps for like, three, four days in a row, which suggests they are gaining share. And they are seeing some of that trade down volume as the middle income consumer that's squeezed is trading out of department stores and into off price."", ""- Initially, when you take a look at these inventory levels here of just about 8% on a year over year basis, what does that then tell us about the promotional activity, maybe the fact that promotional activity won't be as prevalent as we saw just about a year ago?"", ""ANEESHA SHERMAN: I think it will be slightly lower than last year. I mean, if you remember, last year was the peak of promotional activity because everyone, all the brands, all the retailers had effectively over-ordered and gotten way too much supply and were just trying to clear it aggressively. So we had record levels of promotions last year. This is going to be a promotional holiday season. There's no mistaking that. But year over year, it will be slightly better."", 'So I expect demand to be lower this year than last year but margins to be slightly better because it will be slightly less promotional, though still heavily promotional in more than normalized levels.', ""- I mean, we're continuing to see the trend be that consumers are looking for deals. They're looking for discounts and trying to cut costs wherever they may. Is that something that they can expect for an extended period of time? And if so, what are the top companies that are positioned well to benefit from that?"", ""ANEESHA SHERMAN: Yeah, I absolutely think so. I mean, last year, the lower income consumer was really struggling. This year, we've seen that middle income segment which those consumers were doing fairly well last year but inflation has finally caught up caught up to their household budgets, their COVID level spending is down, their credit card delinquencies are up, and they're looking for better deals."", ""So that's what we're seeing in some of these negative department store comps. And the positive off-price comps is we're seeing that gradual trade down. And I think we will see it for a couple more quarters. So in terms of what I would look for is I would look for these off-price names. TJX, Ross, Burlington, they're all going to be beneficiaries."", ""I mean, I call Burlington the underdog because it is doing slightly worse than TJX and Ross. It just has lower awareness. People still think of it as Burlington Coat Factory, which is what it used to be when we were young. But it is now an off-pricer and it's rebranding itself and in this turnaround. So I think it will continue to see trade down benefit.""]"

For anyone who missed the release, you can find it relating financial schedules at investor.analog.com.

These changes are reflected on our web schedule in the quarterly results section for the last 3 years. And second, 1 more quick reminder, the first quarter of 2024 is a 14-week quarter. And with that, I'll turn it over to ADI's CEO and Chair, Vincent."", 'Vincent T. Roche', ""Thank you very much, Mike, and a very good morning to you all. Though the industry is obviously moving through a more challenging period of the business cycle, I'm very pleased to share that we're preserving the strength of our financial performance while preparing for the market's recovery.Fourth quarter revenue was $2.7 billion, led by double-digit year-over-year growth in our automotive sector. The combination of careful expense management and our employees' commitment to high standards of execution enabled us to deliver operating margins of 44.7% and EPS of $2.01 for the quarter. For the fiscal year, '23 again set new high watermarks with revenue reaching $12.3 billion, supported by all-time highs in the industrial and automotive sectors. This resulted in EPS of $10.09 up 5% from a year ago. Notably, we returned a record $4.6 billion to shareholders in 2023, exceeding our 100% free cash flow return target. Since the closing of Maxim just over 2 years ago, ADI has returned roughly $12 billion to shareholders or nearly 15% of our market cap. Over the same time, we've reduced our share count by more than 6% and increased our dividend per share by 25%. Now looking to fiscal '24, the near-term dynamics remain uncertain. As you will recall, last quarter, we outlined a broad-based inventory correction across all markets and geographies, reflecting the deteriorating macro conditions and our improving lead times. Consistent with our view 90 days ago, we expect the customer inventory overhang to persist through the first half of the year. Challenging times like these confirm the wisdom and the strength of our business model. The diversification of our business across customers, applications and products helps to limit volatility while preserving profitability. Building upon that foundation, we took actions to better ensure we can deliver operating margins in the low 40s and solid free cash flow despite the revenue decline. Importantly, however, we're not simply battening down the hatches. A resilient financial model enables us to continue making the strategic investments necessary to allow us to capitalize on the upside when the business inflects higher. That longer-term focus and commitment is why our customers have the confidence to increasingly depend on us as a key strategic partner. I've been very heartened by my conversations with customers across many markets and geographies over this past quarter. Despite the near-term challenges, they share our optimism that the intelligent edge is enabling a future replete with opportunity, and they are clear about the expanding role that they expect ADI to play in their success. Our customers' optimism is reflected in the continued expansion of our design win pipeline, which increased by double digits again in 2023. That growth was enhanced by sustained momentum in our Maxim revenue synergies pipeline, which is tracking ahead of our initial expectations. We expect synergy-driven revenue acceleration in 2025 putting us on a path to achieve our goal of more than $1 billion in revenue synergy by 2027. The combination of our strong design win growth with recurring revenue streams from our 75,000 product SKUs, which have average life span of a decade or more creates a business with high barriers to entry that's both resilient and rich with growth opportunities. Now let me share some examples of recent wins with you. In Industrial Automation, we're increasingly delivering more complete solutions. At a top digital factory automation supplier, for example, we recently leveraged our anchor position in software configurable I/O to attach additional solutions value across power, isolation and connectivity. As a result, we captured 3x the bill of materials and secured design wins across their entire platform. In Industrial Instrumentation, we've increased our design wins at SOC and memory test market leaders. Our next-generation solutions, increased channel density and throughput while reducing energy consumption by up to an incredible 30% per system. These are critical parameters for testing complex, high-performance compute GPUs and high-bandwidth memory for artificial intelligence systems. Looking now to automotive. In electrification, momentum continues for our wireless battery management system. This novel solution enables lower weight, greater scalability and improved manufacturing productivity, driving down the total cost of ownership for our customers while increasing ADI's content. Last quarter, we secured our fifth customer, a top 10 EV OEM, we'll begin to deploy our wireless solution in their next-gen EVs in 2026. Now furthermore, during the year, ADI reinforced our industry-leading position in automotive, high-performance functionally save power. To that end, we won next-generation power for ADAS systems at 4 top suppliers this past year. These wins add another growth vector to our automotive franchise, which has benefited from strong momentum across electrification and in-cabin connectivity. This proliferation of ADAS is benefiting our high-speed GMSL connectivity portfolio. GMSL has been 1 of our fastest-growing areas and a major revenue synergy generator for us. In the last year, we were awarded 4 new wins across leading North American, Asian and European OEMs. We're also expanding our opportunity and increasing our ROI, winning multiple design wins in industrial areas in adjacent areas such as autonomous robotic systems. Our cloud infrastructure business is beginning to benefit from the power challenges and connectivity requirements necessary in AI ML systems. Notably, a large hyperscaler designed our high-performance power and protection solutions into their next-generation AI platform. And in connectivity, systems are upgrading now to [1. terabit] per second and require our highest level of precision control solutions to efficiently support the growth in data generation. In consumer, we won multiple power management sockets in a portable application and a key customer. These wins truly show the combinatorial power of our acquisition strategy. We leveraged our industry-leading cell and switcher, Maxim's cost optimized process technology and our customer relationships to secure these wins. And lastly, in Healthcare, Maxim strengthened our comprehensive suite of technology for personal monitoring solutions, adding sensor AFEs, microcontrollers and ultra-low power technologies. We secured a design win at a leading continuous glucose monitoring customer this year. Our solution increases the robustness, accuracy and power efficiency of their glucose center, thereby helping to extend its life from days to weeks. So in summary, we're proud of another year of record revenue and earnings. We continue to demonstrate the power of our business model, which delivers results through all phases of the business cycle. Our continued strong investments in technology and business innovation, customer engagement, and our hybrid manufacturing model positions ADI and our customers to take maximum advantage of the opportunities at the intelligent edge when the business recovery arrives. Now I'd like to pass the call over to Jim. Over the past 35 years, Jim has taken on a number of critical financial leadership roles across ADI, enabling him to develop a breadth and depth of understanding of our business that very, very few possess. So I'm pleased now to have him on my leadership team and to be joined by Jim on today's call. Over to you, Jim."", 'Jim Mollica', ""Thank you for that introduction, Vince, I'm excited to be here today, and let me add my welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Starting with a brief recap of fiscal 2023 results. Revenue increased 2% to $12.3 billion, marking ADI's third consecutive record year. Gross margin of 72.5% moderated from last year's record results of 73.6%. Operating margin of 48.9% decreased 50 basis points, roughly half the decline of gross margin, reflecting strong operating expense control. All told, EPS increased 5% to a record $10.09. Now moving to fourth quarter results. Revenue of $2.72 billion declined 12% sequentially and 16% year-over-year, finishing above the midpoint of our outlook despite the challenging operating environment. Industrial represented 50% of quarterly revenue, declining 19% sequentially and 20% year-over-year. As expected, we experienced broad-based weakness as inventory adjustments continued across our diverse customer base. For the full year, Industrial increased 6%, achieving its third straight record result with strength across instrumentation, test, energy and aerospace and defense. Automotive, which represented 27% of quarterly revenue was down slightly sequentially and up 14% year-over-year, marking 12 straight quarters of double-digit growth. For the year, Automotive also achieved its third straight record result, increasing 19%, with strong growth across our functionally safe power, battery management and in cabin connectivity solutions. Collectively, these were up more than 30%. Communications, which represented 13% of quarterly revenue declined 6% sequentially and 32% versus a record fourth quarter 2022. For the year, Communications decreased 13%, with steeper declines in wireless versus wireline. And lastly, Consumer represented 11% of quarterly revenue, down 6% sequentially and 28% year-over-year. Consumer decreased 20% in fiscal 2023, driven by industry-wide weaker demand and ongoing inventory corrections. Now on to the rest of the P&L. Fourth quarter gross margin was 70.2%, down sequentially and year-over-year driven by unfavorable product mix, lower factory utilizations and lower revenue. OpEx in the quarter was $692 million, down $60 million sequentially. These significant savings were driven by disciplined expense management and lower variable compensation. As a result, operating margin came in at the higher end of our outlook of 44.7%. Non-op expense finished at $65 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 12.5%. All told, EPS was $2.01, slightly above our outlook. Now on to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $1 billion of cash and cash equivalents and a net leverage ratio of 0.9x. Inventory decreased nearly $70 million sequentially, driven by finished goods. Channel inventory also declined as we actively manage sell-in to be less than sell-through. Given lower revenue, inventory days increased to 188 and channel weeks ticked up slightly, ending within our target range of 7 to 8 weeks. Now moving on to our cash flow items. Operating cash for the quarter and the year was $1.2 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively. CapEx for the quarter was $476 million and for fiscal 2023 was $1.3 billion. These CapEx numbers are gross figures, which do not include the benefits of the investment tax credits or grants related to both the U.S. and European Chips Act. Full year free cash flow was $3.6 billion or 29% of revenue. During the year, we returned 130% of free cash flow via roughly $3 billion in share repurchases and $1.7 billion in dividends. Now moving on to the guidance for the first quarter, which will be on a 14-week basis. First quarter revenue is expected to be $2.5 billion, plus or minus $100 million. Once again, we expect sell-through to be higher than sell-in. At the midpoint, we expect all end markets to be down sequentially. Industrial is expected to be down the most, followed by Consumer and Comms with Automotive faring the best. Operating margin is expected to be 41.5%, plus or minus 70 basis points. Our tax rate is expected to be 11% to 13%, and based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.70 plus or minus $0.10. I will conclude my remarks with a brief update on the current operating backdrop. As Vince mentioned, we continue to see broad-based weakness across markets and geographies as customers work to reduce inventory and a stressed macro backdrop. Importantly, our lead times are now back to normal levels with 95% of our products shipping within 13 weeks, given our customers high confidence and timely supply. Encouragingly, during the fourth quarter, we've seen cancellations fall and bookings stabilize. This gives us greater confidence that the ongoing inventory correction will taper through the first half of the fiscal year. As we discussed last time, we've taken actions to preserve the integrity of our income statement, our balance sheet and our cash flow statements. Let me provide an update in these areas. We are once again lowering internal utilizations with a goal of significantly reducing inventory in the first half of the year. Our hybrid manufacturing model and ability to swing in external wafers will help us moderate the decline in factory starts. The unique ability positions us to deliver healthy gross margins despite the significant revenue decline from a year ago. Given the enhancements made to our hybrid manufacturing model over the last 2 years, we now plan to slow the expansion of our internal fabs and back-end facilities. As a result, we expect 2024 CapEx to be between $600 million and $800 million or down about 45% versus 2023. Importantly, this CapEx reduction does not compromise our long-term growth or resiliency efforts that gives customers multiple locations to source ADI supply. And lastly, we took additional steps to structurally reduce our OpEx. These actions, combined with lower variable comp and seasonally lower spend in the first quarter will result in a slight decline in OpEx sequentially even with the extra week. So in closing, our ability to generate operating margins in the low 40s, which were our previous highs in the last cycle demonstrates the durability of this franchise and how we've enhanced our operating model over time. And with that, I'll give it back to Mike for Q&A."", 'Michael C. Lucarelli', ""Thanks, Jim. Welcome to the call. It's great to have you. Now let's get to the Q&A session. We ask that you limit yourself to 1 question in order to allow for additional participants on the call this morning. If you have a follow up question please requeue. We will take your question if time allows. With that, we will have our first question please."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.', 'Ambrish Srivastava', ""Vince, it looks like order has been restored in the diversified Analog world with -- it looks like a very normal cyclical downturn and with you, what you've built is a structurally more profitable company holding to 40% -- low 40% operating margin line. My question is on a bottoming process. And I know we're not there yet, but can you just remind us or help us understand metrics you're following regarding cancellations, pushouts, backlog, you did talk about cancellations, Jim. And then kind of related to that, is if you look at past cycles, does automotive needs to go down double-digit year-over-year decline as industrial has been there? And how should we think about that?"", 'Vincent T. Roche', ""Ambrish, and thank you for the question. So yes, we noted last quarter that we believe the inventory digestion issue would last 2 to 3 quarters. And I'd say, given the new information that we have, our conviction of that has actually grown. We have, through careful analysis and observation, we've seen inventory digestion accelerate at our largest direct customers across the board and across all the various segments that we support. And we're continuing to reduce our channel inventories as well. So I think very encouragingly, even with normalized lead times, as we've said, we're shipping that kind of 95% of customer requests within a quarter, which is very, very normal. We saw against that backdrop, a sharp drop in cancellations, and though the book-to-bill was below unity in the fourth quarter. We did see our bookings improve sequentially. So that gives us a lot of confidence as to what's going on. Regarding Automotive, I'm not sure, by the way. The automotive -- the assumption you're making is that there could be a double-digit drop in Automotive. I'm not sure about that because we know that cars are consuming about 10% more silicon per year. And in fact, we continue to grow in share and ASP in the car. So my own sense is that against what could be a very challenging macro backdrop during 2024, that of all the elements of our portfolio, automotive, we expect will fare best of them all. And we still have pretty strong confidence that we'll grow in 2024."", 'Michael C. Lucarelli', 'Next question please.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities.', 'Vivek Arya', ""Vince, I'm trying to reconcile the comments that were made about some stabilization in bookings. That sounds like a positive. But I think in the prepared remarks, you also said some headwinds that could persist through the first half of the fiscal year, suggesting that April could be a sub-seasonal quarter. So I know you're not guiding specifically out to April, but what is the right way to look at the puts and takes as we think about April? Can it be seasonal, whether it not be seasonal? And also this extra week from January, did that really give you that 7.5% push, so we should be taking that out of April. So any way to help us give us a sense for how the April could shape up would be very helpful."", 'Vincent T. Roche', ""Yes. Well, I think it's -- Vivek, thank you for the question. It's 1 quarter at a time here. What I will say contextually is that we expect the inventory overhang to have been depleted by the start of our third quarter, which is in May of next year. So, we still remain pretty confident about that, given the dynamics that I just outlined. But the other parts of the cycle that we're really -- I think everybody is seeing pressure from is the macroeconomic climate and particularly the decline of semi business in China. So that's the piece. I mean that is the piece that isn't well understood. But all that said, the macro will be the governor on what happens in the second half of the year. And I think another quarter or so will give us a lot more confidence in terms of what is possible in the second half. But I'll let Jim answer as well give you some particular statistics to underpin our assumptions here."", 'Jim Mollica', ""Thanks, Vince. Yes, let me just speak to -- let me unpack lead times a bit first. As we said, lead times are now kind of back to where they were, 95% of our products are shipping within 13 weeks. And we've seen steady improvement in lead times in both 3Q and 4Q. And I guess from the refreshing side of that is from a customer viewpoint, customers have now adjusted to those shorter lead times. And our order rates basically in the fourth quarter basically stabilized in fact, picked up in 4Q versus 3Q. So that's good news for us as the customers have shopped and their signal into us. As Vince said, our book-to-bill will still be low on there, but it is kind of the first lines there. Additionally, cancellations in the fourth quarter were down meaningfully for the first time and probably close to a year. And cancellations on a shorter time fence were also very, very low. So that's good for us. From a channel perspective, we're being cautious. We continue to basically ship into the channel less than our sell-through, which basically will position us well for when the upswing occurs. And from an end market viewpoint, let me just close on that point. All markets in 1Q will be down on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Yes, that's it. Mike, anything else?"", 'Michael C. Lucarelli', ""Yes. And it's very confusing with a 13- to 14-week card, you're right, Vivek. I'll kind of add some commentary around that, how to think about that. Normally, 2Q from 1Q and a 13-week to 13-week basis up about 5%. And given what have been said, inventory overhang and bookings getting better. It still feels like we should probably grow some, but I don't think 5% is likely. Why? There's still an inventory overhang going on. So if you think 13-week to 13-week were about flattish, plus or minus, in 1Q to 2Q, that's probably the way to think about it. That means if you include the extra week, it's probably down about 5% plus or minus sequentially. So I hope that helps back a little bit because it is confusing. And with that we go to our next question, please."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley.', 'Joseph Lawrence Moore', ""Great. I wonder, I mean now that you're in a revenue downturn that looks more severe than we saw the last cycle, what are you seeing in terms of pricing? And are people -- you obviously raised prices during the upturn. Are people asking you to give that back? And is that a different conversation on kind of a like-for-like basis versus approaching kind of new design win activity?"", 'Vincent T. Roche', ""Yes. Thanks, Joe. So look, I think overall, the pricing of our existing portfolio is very, very resilient, very stable. And I think something to note as well is that every new generation of product that we build is capturing more value. And -- so if you look at the legacy, it's very stable. You look at the legacy franchise. We've got tremendous stability. We're capturing more new value per new socket. And I don't see any particular change. And we, as a company, play at the high end of the performance curve, which enables us to get this innovation premium that is a very, very critical part of our gross margin structure and our revenue growth. And our job is to continue to invest to make sure that we stay on the cutting edge and get well rewarded for that. We fight very, very intensely at the inception of new designs. But as I said in the prepared remarks, Joe, we're seeing generally speaking, our pipeline of new product design wins as well as the more established products continue to grow quarter-by-quarter, year-over-year. So I feel confident that the pricing that we have managed to increase over the last couple of years, 2.5 years that they're about to reflect the increased cost of goods. We'll hold those prices. So overall, we're bullish about where we are and what the pricing environment holds in the future."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.', 'Stacy Aaron Rasgon', ""I had a question on OpEx and gross margins into Q1. So you said OpEx was down slightly even with the extra week. So if I assume it's downstate a little bit, it would imply the normalized like 13-week OpEx would be running around, I don't know, 640 maybe, maybe a little lower. Once we get through into Q2 when the ex week rolls off, is that the right sort of like steady-state OpEx run rate to think about as we go through the year and some -- are there some other drivers? And I guess if those numbers are right, it sort of implies gross margins implied in Q1 maybe a little below 70, maybe 69, is that the right kind of level that you're thinking about as the revenue is going to drop here."", 'Jim Mollica', ""Yes, Stacy, it's Jim. Let me take the margin one first, and then I'll talk about the OpEx for the quarter. There's many inputs. There's many levers to the gross margin. There's revenue that's priced, there's mix as factory loading utilization levels. And let me just try to unpack that a bit. Vince mentioned on the pricing side, basically, that's stable. So that's not a drag to gross margins as we move forward. On the revenue side, basically, we're down -- the midpoint of our first quarter guide on a 13-week basis is down, approaching 30% from our previous peak. So basically, revenue is a headwind for us there. Mix basically is unfavorable as well. As you heard in my prepared remarks, Industrial was down 19% and 20% last quarter on a year-over-year and sequential basis, and that will be down again in first quarter. So mix is a headwind for us. When you put all those puts and takes together, we'd expect basically gross margin will fall below 70% in the first half of the year at these trough levels. I think if you think about something in the 68% to 69% range, is probably a good range for this trough revenue range. So that's kind of the gross margin. On the OpEx side, as I mentioned, our 4Q OpEx basically was down about $60 million on a sequential basis. This was the combination of reducing discretionary spend and, of course, a much lower variable comp. Looking into 1Q, we expect that to be down again even with the extra week. And it's fair to say that probably you can think about 1% to 2% there. This reduction relates to the actions that we structurally took to reduce OpEx as well as a lower typical seasonal spend in 1Q as well. We don't guide 2Q, but just to give you a sense there, when you look at 2Q, it's probably best to compare that to the 4Q, which was a like 13- to 13-week comparison. And when you're looking at 4Q '23 versus 2Q '24, given some of the structural modest reductions we had made, we'd expect OpEx in 2Q to be down a few percent from the 4Q operating levels. So I hope that helps."", 'Michael C. Lucarelli', 'Thanks, Stacy. I always appreciate your 2-part one-part question. With that, next question, please.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Chris Danely with Citi.', 'Christopher Brett Danely', ""Just a question on Industrial. Historically, this has been a pretty strong sector for you guys, but it seems like it's -- the revenue decline in Industrial is worse than the overall company. Can you just talk about why that is and maybe broader speaking, are the bookings or the revenue falling more because the macro is worse than expected? Or the inventory situation out there is just worse than you guys thought? Do you think you'll be able to hold that 70% gross margin floor for the fiscal '24?"", 'Vincent T. Roche', ""Yes. Thanks, Chris. So yes, look, we've come off a record year for ADI and for the industrial sector. But I'd say in the second half of '23, we began to see momentum slow on the order side of things. And in the fourth quarter, it's true to say that weakness in the industrial sector broadened and hit all the various market segments with 1 exception, the aerospace and defense area. And I think when we look into 2024, given the weaker macro backdrop, and we expect the inventory digestion to continue through the first half particularly at the broad market customers who are suffering most here. So I think, as Jim said, when we talk about gross margins, the weaker industrial over the first half of the year, that weaker mix, if you like, will impact the gross margins. And for the trough period here, we're thinking kind of 68%, 69% as reasonable assumptions for gross margin in that period of time. So it really is, at this point, it's an adjustment of inventories at our customers and how fast we experience the recovery will determine on the macro. But again, I think it's true to say, during the first half of this year, we do expect to get this overhang of inventory behind us and get back to a more normalized growth pattern in the second half of the year. Jim, do you want to take a comment?"", 'Jim Mollica', ""Yes, Chris, I think just a couple of points there. Vince talked about at the trough revenue, gross margins in the 68% to 69% range. Gross margins at 70% for the year. I think that was the first part of your question as well. A lot of that will depend upon when the demand comes back in terms of -- so we don't really guide for the year, but that's probably dependent upon revenue coming back to a more normal level. Let me just add a few points, though. We are -- utilization levels basically brought them down in 4Q. We're going to bring them down again in 1Q. You see the inventory reduction of $70 million in 4Q, which was a little bit better than I think we guided last quarter, you're going to expect that inventory to be reduced at a similar level in 1Q and again in 2Q. And what we're also doing now is we're activating a hybrid manufacturing strategy. So we're actually swinging wafers from external back in-house, which moderates the factory load, which gives a little bit of a cushion on that gross margin side as well. So just a little bit more color as what you can expect for us in the second quarter here."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel.', 'Tore Egil Svanberg', ""Yes. Thank you and congratulations on the results in this tough environment. I had a question about CapEx. So 1 of your competitors talk about this geopolitical dependable capacity that they're investing in. You're going through the complete all the way, you're reducing CapEx a lot for this year. Help us understand a little bit what your partners are doing -- your founder partners are doing for you to sort of feel comfortable that you don't have to spend as much in CapEx going forward?"", 'Jim Mollica', ""Thanks, Tore. Why don't we take that in, so I'll answer some color. Yes. So let me just -- let me pause and take a step back on CapEx for a second. So at our Investor Day, we outlined basically elevated CapEx in the high single-digit range for 2022 and 2023. And then long term, that would actually trend back down to mid-single digits. As I said, this past year, CapEx was about $1.2 billion on a gross basis, which is about 10% of sales, which was a bit higher basically due to the revenue fall off that we saw in the second half of the year.This year, as I said, we're basically slowing our capacity expansion and our CapEx, given kind of the short-term demand that we're actually seeing there. So from a CapEx viewpoint, we're going to expect that to drop by about $500 million in our FY '24. And as I noted, this figure doesn't reflect any of the benefit from either the U.S. or European Chips Act. From a capacity viewpoint, what does that mean? That basically means that we'll be able to still double our internal capacity footprint by 2025. Originally, we were thinking that was going to take place more in the 2024 time period. But given the macro and the demand outlook, we're comfortable with that. So we don't need basically all that capacity in the short term. From a customer viewpoint, from a swing capacity viewpoint, our goal is to be able to basically swing 70% of our product portfolio from internal to external fabs. That's good for our customers because it gives our customers the ability to dual source, and that really creates a rich and resilient supply chain with multiple options for our customers. And then from a gross margin viewpoint, internally, that allows us to moderate the factories a bit with this additional swing coming in-house as well. So we're comfortable with that strategy? I don't know if Vince?"", 'Vincent T. Roche', ""Yes. Good morning, Tore, let me add a couple of pieces of color to what Jim has just said. So most of ADI's revenue today is built on process technologies that are 118 nanometers and above. Now in digital technology terms, that's a very, very old process technology. That's more than 25 years old in terms of its currency.But in the Analog space, that is still a very contemporary process node. So a little more than 70% of our revenue today is produced on process technologies at 118-nanometers and above. And as Jim said, we've gone through a major internal expansion to give us more flexibility and agility in terms of where and how we manufacture those process technologies. And we're making all these investments that we've made on the internal fabs are 200-millimeter wafers. So the tool chains are less expensive, and we're able to get tremendous return on investment over many, many decades on the investments that we're making. So I think below that, for the, let's say, at the final line geometry nodes, we have very, very good alternatives with our external partners who are in a very, very really important piece of how we make the hybrid manufacturing model work. So anything that is kind of 19-nanometers and below, it's 300-millimeter wafers, and we secure that production with multiple sources across the globe."", 'Operator', 'Our last question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS.', 'Timothy Michael Arcuri', ""I had a question on Inventory. It sounds like you're planning to bring it down quite a bit from here. And you mentioned that the target is 120 days, but of course, it depends on what the base of revenue is. So can you quantify how much more you plan to take out of your inventory? It seems like it could come down maybe a couple of hundred million dollars more from here? And then also maybe if you can also quantify -- and this is kind of a hard question to answer, but how much is selling below sell-through? I know you get some metrics, particularly inside of distribution?"", 'Jim Mollica', ""Timothy, let me take that. Just to be clear, let me kind of step that back what I said. So basically, inventory in fourth quarter was down $70 million, and that was on a quarter-on-quarter compare. That was almost all at the finished goods level. In 1Q, we plan to take inventory down by a similar amount. And then we'll do that again in 2Q. That's on a dollar basis, not on a days basis, just to be clear there. So over the course of 3 quarters, fourth quarter and the first half of '24, we expect inventory to be down in the $200 million plus range for that. In terms of the channel, as I mentioned, our sell-in to the channel is lower than our sell-through. And in fourth quarter, it was in the $50 million range. And I'd probably expect probably a similar number there in first quarter, yes. And with that, thanks Tim."", 'Michael C. Lucarelli', ""Tim and your question on the days of inventory. I would say our pre-COVID target was 120. We're close to 190 today. I think both of them are going to be wrong when all the dust settles, but we'll re-up you on kind of the long-term inventory days model at a future call. And with that, are we good Tim. Thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. A copy of the transcript will be available on our website. Thanks for joining the call.

One of the most prominent semiconductors that still seem to be struggling are the GPUs used for training and developing AI applications like ChatGPT.\xa0NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) dominates the market and controls almost 80% of the supply.\xa0The reliance on this singular giant in the semiconductor GPU market slowed the progress of many companies developing generative AI products.', 'Generative AI companies have been struggling to meet their needs as the supply is limited to one dominant company. To keep up, generative AI companies have started to explore more options and overcome this shortage. On October 6, Reuters reported that OpenAI is exploring the option of making its own chips instead of relying on external chipmakers. By making its chips, the company will be able to reach its goals for expansion without potential delays caused by the shortage. It will also enable the company to have more control and diversity in its supply.\xa0', 'Governments across the globe have also become more alert to the issue of semiconductor shortages and are making efforts to nurture its growth. Many countries have announced attractive government incentives to encourage companies to set up manufacturing and production in them. The CHIPS and Science Act by the United States government is noteworthy.

This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ)."", 'ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.', ' Check out our latest analysis for Verizon Communications ', 'ROE can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Verizon Communications is:', '22% = US$21b ÷ US$99b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.22 in profit."", 'One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Verizon Communications has a higher ROE than the average (7.8%) in the Telecom industry.', ""That's clearly a positive. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk ."", ""Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking."", 'Verizon Communications does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.53. While its ROE is pretty respectable, the amount of debt the company is carrying currently is not ideal. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.', 'Return on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.', 'But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.', 'If you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.', 'Have feedback on this article?

The company, known for its iconic characters and global entertainment dominance, reported total revenues of $88,898 million for the fiscal year 2023, a notable increase from $82,722 million in 2022. Despite higher revenues, net income attributable to Disney decreased to $2,354 million from $3,145 million the previous year, reflecting a complex operating environment. This SWOT analysis delves into Disney's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, providing investors with a nuanced understanding of the company's prospects."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with DIS.', ""Global Brand Recognition and Diverse Portfolio: The Walt Disney Co's brand is unparalleled in the entertainment industry, with a legacy that spans nearly a century. Its diverse portfolio includes theme parks, media networks, and a vast array of beloved characters and stories. In 2023, Disney's services revenue stood at a robust $79,562 million, underscoring the strength of its brand in attracting consumers to its various offerings. The company's ability to leverage its intellectual property across multiple platforms, from blockbuster films to immersive theme park experiences, creates a unique competitive advantage that drives consumer loyalty and revenue growth."", ""Content Creation and Distribution Prowess: Disney's acquisition of studios such as Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm has fortified its position as a content powerhouse. The company's strategy of producing high-quality, franchise-based content has proven successful, with its films and series resonating with global audiences. Furthermore, Disney's strategic shift to a streaming-focused firm, with over 235 million subscribers across its platforms as of September 2022, highlights its commitment to evolving with industry trends and capitalizing on the direct-to-consumer market."", ""Streaming Segment Profitability: Despite the impressive subscriber growth for Disney's streaming services, the segment has yet to reach profitability. The 2023 10-K filing reveals that Disney's DTC offerings have experienced significant losses, indicating the high costs associated with content creation, marketing, and platform development. This weakness is exacerbated by the competitive landscape of the streaming industry, where content acquisition and retention are costly endeavors that can strain financial resources."", 'Operational Costs and Efficiency: The Walt Disney Co faces challenges in managing its operational costs, which have a direct impact on profitability. The total costs and expenses for 2023 amounted to $79,906 million, a substantial figure that includes costs of services, products, and restructuring charges. While investments in the business are necessary for growth, Disney must continually seek ways to optimize its cost structure and improve efficiency to enhance its bottom line.', ""International Expansion and Market Penetration: Disney's global brand appeal presents significant opportunities for international expansion, particularly in emerging markets where demand for entertainment content is growing. With the international success of Disney+ and the potential for further penetration in regions like Asia and Latin America, Disney has the opportunity to diversify its revenue streams and reduce reliance on saturated domestic markets."", 'Technological Innovation and New Business Models: The entertainment industry is rapidly evolving with advancements in technology, such as augmented and virtual reality, and Disney is well-positioned to capitalize on these trends. By embracing new technologies and exploring innovative business models, such as the integration of AI in content creation or the development of immersive experiences, Disney can enhance its offerings and create new revenue opportunities.', 'Intense Competition in the Entertainment Industry: The Walt Disney Co operates in a highly competitive industry, with numerous players vying for consumer attention and spending. The rise of alternative entertainment platforms and the proliferation of content creators have intensified the competitive landscape, putting pressure on Disney to continuously innovate and invest in its content and services to maintain its market position.', 'Changing Consumer Behaviors and Preferences: Consumer behaviors and preferences are constantly evolving, influenced by technological advancements and cultural shifts. Disney must navigate these changes, particularly as younger audiences gravitate towards digital platforms and diverse content offerings. Adapting to these shifts is crucial for Disney to remain relevant and retain its audience base in the face of shifting consumption patterns.', 'In conclusion, The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) exhibits a strong foundation built on its global brand recognition, content creation capabilities, and strategic shift towards streaming. However, the company must address the challenges of streaming profitability and operational efficiency to sustain its growth. Opportunities for international expansion and technological innovation present pathways for Disney to bolster its market position, while threats from competition and changing consumer behaviors necessitate agility and foresight in strategic planning. As Disney continues to navigate the dynamic entertainment landscape, its ability to leverage its strengths and capitalize on opportunities while mitigating weaknesses and threats will be critical to its long-term success.', 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Rather than replacing Shopify, various selling channels, including TikTok, are managed within the platform, which should enable Shopify to maintain its competitive advantage over the long term. During the quarter, Shopify announced an agreement with Amazon that will allow merchants to offer\xa0Buy with Prime\xa0within the Shopify ecosystem, enabling Shopify to act as the payments provider for these transactions and alleviating a key concern. Lastly, the company also reported strong financial results, including 17% year-over-year gross merchandise volume growth, 31% revenue growth, and consensus-beating non-GAAP operating income that outpaced estimates by over $90 million.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to Semiconductor R&D Spending By Company: Top 5.', 'Semiconductors are vital for the majority of technologies around us including automobiles, communications systems, computers, household appliances, and more. These tiny chips witnessed an extreme shortage during the pandemic when consumer demands suddenly shifted. People became more inclined towards consumer electronics and PCs, due to the rise of remote work and education, while vehicle sales dropped. The industry also faced massive supply chain disruption and logistical issues that further fueled the shortage.', 'The semiconductor industry is currently in its recovery phase. Many semiconductor products including smartphones have even come a full circle from being short to having a surplus. One of the most prominent semiconductors that still seem to be struggling are the GPUs used for training and developing AI applications like ChatGPT.\xa0NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) dominates the market and controls almost 80% of the supply.\xa0The reliance on this singular giant in the semiconductor GPU market slowed the progress of many companies developing generative AI products.', 'Generative AI companies have been struggling to meet their needs as the supply is limited to one dominant company. To keep up, generative AI companies have started to explore more options and overcome this shortage. On October 6, Reuters reported that OpenAI is exploring the option of making its own chips instead of relying on external chipmakers. By making its chips, the company will be able to reach its goals for expansion without potential delays caused by the shortage. It will also enable the company to have more control and diversity in its supply.\xa0', 'Governments across the globe have also become more alert to the issue of semiconductor shortages and are making efforts to nurture its growth. Many countries have announced attractive government incentives to encourage companies to set up manufacturing and production in them. The CHIPS and Science Act by the United States government is noteworthy. According to a report\xa0by the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), the earnest implementation of the Act that began at the start of 2023 has gathered $200 billion in private investments. Even in light of the semiconductor market tug-of-war between the US and China, implementing the CHIPS Act can potentially create thousands of jobs and foster the semiconductor ecosystem in the country. The close involvement of the governments could move the semiconductor shortage in the right direction, overcoming the ongoing slump.

According to the report, the region will uphold its position through the forecast period. In 2022, the Asia Pacific semiconductor market was valued at $230.5 billion, which accounted for 46% of the total market share. The presence of top-notch semiconductor companies in China, South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan contributes to the region's distinct position in the global market. North America and Europe have also been estimated to grow substantially during the forecast period. Increasing investments alongside advanced R&D are predicted to be the main factors in this growth."", 'By application, the networking and communications segment was the most noteworthy. According to the report, in 2022, the segment comprised 34% of the market share. As the popularity of smartphones rises, so does the demand for semiconductors used for its manufacturing. The demand for smartphones is expected to stay strong; therefore, the segment is estimated to grow as well.', 'Some of the biggest players in the semiconductor industry include NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), and Advanced Micro Devices Incorporated (NASDAQ:AMD).', ""NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has emerged as one of the most noteworthy names in the semiconductor industry.

Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM) is about to go ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Accordingly, Yum! Brands investors that purchase the stock on or after the 27th of November will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 8th of December."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.60 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$2.42 per share. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Yum! Brands has a trailing yield of 1.9% on the current share price of $128.24. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing."", ' View our latest analysis for Yum! Brands ', ""If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Yum! Brands is paying out just 11% of its profit after tax, which is comfortably low and leaves plenty of breathing room in the case of adverse events. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Yum! Brands generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. Dividends consumed 51% of the company's free cash flow last year, which is within a normal range for most dividend-paying organisations."", ""It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. This is why it's a relief to see Yum! Brands earnings per share are up 6.8% per annum over the last five years. While earnings have been growing at a credible rate, the company is paying out a majority of its earnings to shareholders. Therefore it's unlikely that the company will be able to reinvest heavily in its business, which could presage slower growth in the future."", ""Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, Yum! Brands has increased its dividend at approximately 6.1% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders."", ""Is Yum! Brands worth buying for its dividend? Earnings per share growth has been modest, and it's interesting that Yum! Brands is paying out less than half of its earnings and more than half its cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends. Overall, it's not a bad combination, but we feel that there are likely more attractive dividend prospects out there."", ""With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces.

In 2023, ""attracting and retaining top talent"" ranked fourth globally, after not breaking the top 10 in 2021, demonstrating a shift in how risk managers are viewing human capital today.

Apart from the lost production and revenues amid the strike, high interest rates may prompt consumers to deter the purchase of big-ticket items.

On its latest earnings call, Ford notified that it resulted in the lost production of around 80,000 units, which would reduce 2023 EBIT by $1.3 billion. The strike-induced volatility prompted Ford and General Motors to withdraw their 2023 guidance.', ""Affordability Concerns Loom: Although current high-interest rates haven't dissuaded consumer interest in vehicles, there is a mounting worry about affordability that could impede future growth. Jonathan Smoke, the chief economist at Cox Automotive, envisions a potential constraint on new vehicle demand due to elevated pricing and the impact of high-interest rates. The increased cost of vehicle financing might prompt less affluent buyers to defer their purchases, posing a risk of decelerating vehicle demand that could affect industry players.

Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value.

Per ZBH, procedure recovery continues successfully, aided by no meaningful impact of COVID-19 or staffing challenges. Accordingly, the company is enjoying a tailwind from increased provider capacity, resulting in a backlog pull-through in the recent quarters.In the third quarter, U.S. sales rose 6%, with elective procedure volumes recovering. Further, sales growth in the S.E.T. category, together with strong capital sales, improved the overall performance in this region. International sales grew 2.9% year over year. All regions benefited from the continued recovery of elective procedures, backlog recapture, strong commercial execution and new product uptake.In terms of business category, Global Knees grew 7.3%, driven by the strong execution of the company’s 4-pillars strategy centering on a very strong Persona portfolio, combined with the benefits of the ROSA robotics platform. Further, excluding the unfavorable impacts of tough comps in China and headwinds in Russia, the international Hip business demonstrated growth in the low double digits.', ""Over the recent past, Zimmer Biomet has been working to strengthen its foothold in emerging markets that provide long-term opportunities for growth.

Within emerging markets, we note that strength in the Asia Pacific market has continued to drive strong revenue growth so far. As the COVID-19 severity is over now, banking on a cadence of product launches and strong customer adoptions, Zimmer Biomet is successfully expanding its presence in the emerging market. In the third quarter of 2023, Zimmer Biomet’s international sales grew 2.9%, driven by faster recovery and strength across both developed and emerging markets.', 'Over the past year, shares of Zimmer Biomet have declined 2.5% compared with the industry’s 8% plunge.', 'Meanwhile, although Zimmer Biomet is gradually coming out of the impact of the two-and-a-half-year-long healthcare crisis, the ongoing industry-wide trend of staffing shortages and supply chain-related hazards is denting growth. Deteriorating international trade, with global inflationary pressure leading to a tough situation related to raw material and labor costs, freight charges and rising interest rates, have put the dental treatment space (which is highly elective) in a tight spot.', 'Within the Hip category, headwinds in Russia are disproportionately impacting the outside U.S. business. Further, within the S.E.T. category, Zimmer Biomet is facing challenges in the form of reimbursement headwinds, particularly in the Restorative Therapies business. In addition, the company also noted experiencing acute supply challenges within Sports and Trauma. All these are creating significant pressure on the company’s operating profit.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. So when we looked at Mondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ) and its trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw."", ""For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Mondelez International is:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.12 = US$6.0b ÷ (US$71b - US$19b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""So, Mondelez International has an ROCE of 12%.

The company is doing well in that sense, and it's worth investigating what the management team has planned for long term growth prospects."", 'As discussed above, Mondelez International appears to be getting more proficient at generating returns since capital employed has remained flat but earnings (before interest and tax) are up.

However, this market quickly recovered as people started buying in bulk and piling on groceries when staying home.', ""The chocolate market is also witnessing a steadily increasing demand for high-quality chocolates.

His net worth stands at about $120 billion as of November 21, 2023, according to Forbes’ real-time billionaires list. The Oracle of Omaha is one of the very few individuals on the Forbes' billionaire list who made this wealth purely by investing in the stock market. But Buffett did not become the master of the game overnight. He inherited investing wisdom from his father who was a US Congressman and later a stock broker. While strong family connections did give Buffett an opportunity to raise funds in early stages of his career, he made his way up to the ranks of success by pure ability and sticking to value investing principles propended by the Benjamin Graham school of investing."", 'Every year Warren Buffett reiterates the basic principles of his investing philosophy in his letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. This philosophy is dramatically simple and eventually boils down to this: Buffett likes to invest in businesses that he believes will keep growing and because of their growth and performance the Oracle of Omaha loves to own a stake in them and hold it forever. In his 2022 letter to investors Buffett said:', 'Over the years, I have made many mistakes. Consequently, our extensive collection of businesses currently consists of a few enterprises that have truly extraordinary economics, many that enjoy very good economic characteristics, and a large group that are marginal. Along the way, other businesses in which I have invested have died, their products unwanted by the public. Capitalism has two sides: The system creates an ever-growing pile of losers while concurrently delivering a gusher of improved goods and services. Schumpeter called this phenomenon “creative destruction.” One advantage of our publicly-traded segment is that – episodically – it becomes easy to buy pieces of wonderful businesses at wonderful prices. It’s crucial to understand that stocks often trade at truly foolish prices, both high and low. “Efficient” markets exist only in textbooks.

Welcome to Verisign's third quarter 2023 earnings call. Joining me are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman and CEO; Todd Strubbe, President and COO; and George Kilguss, Executive Vice President and CFO. This call and presentation are being webcast from the Investor Relations website, which is available under About Verisign on verisign.com. There, you will also find our earnings release. At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site, and within a few hours, the replay of the call will be posted.

GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to the slide presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website available after this call. Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks. And afterward, we will open the call for your questions. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim."", ""Jim Bidzos: Thank you, David. Good afternoon to everyone, and thank you for joining us. We delivered another solid quarter by focusing on our mission as a critical Internet infrastructure operator. In addition to delivering on our mission during the third quarter, I'm pleased with the financial results, which show the continued strength of our business model during this uncertain macroeconomic period. For the third quarter, revenues grew 5.4% year-over-year, while EPS grew 15.8% year-over-year. At the end of September, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 173.9 million domain names, up slightly from 173.8 million names at the end of 2022. During the third quarter, the domain name base decreased by 0.5 million domain names."", ""From a new registration perspective, the third quarter ended with 9.9 million new registrations, flat with the same quarter last year. We believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2023 will be approximately 73.4% compared to 73.7% a year ago. While there are many factors that drive demand for domain names, the core value proposition for domain names remain strong, and we're seeing broad-based engagement from our registrar channel. However, even with those fundamentals intact, low demand from China remains the primary source of drag on the overall domain name base growth, excluding registrars based in China, both our domain name base and new registrations are up year-over-year through Q3. With this current trend, we now expect the change in the domain name base for full year 2023 to be between negative 0.4% and positive 0.4%."", ""This updated range reflects continued uncertainty primarily due to the weakness we're seeing from China. Our financial and liquidity position remained stable with $943 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. During the third quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares for $220 million. At quarter end, $1.34 billion remained available and authorized under the current share repurchase program. Regarding web, Today, I can posted Altanovo's IRP complaint and ICANNs answer to its website. I urge anyone interested in this issue to read it as I believe it will help you understand our current and past statements on .web. We think ICANN's answer is informative, and I'd like to read the concluding paragraph from ICANN's document."", 'First, I just want to clarify that the reference to NDC here is a company new .co, which is Verisign\'s partner in the .web application. The conclusion reads as follows: ""after an exhaustive first .web IRP and an extremely thorough evaluation process following that IRP, I can determine that NDC did not violate the guidebook or the auction rules. I can fully comply with its articles, bylaws and internal policies and procedures when it made that determination, and the Board\'s resolution is entitled to difference under the bylaws\' enshrinement of the business judgment rule. Accordingly, Altanovo\'s IRP request should be denied. We agree with ICANN. We continue to believe that this IRP followed by Altanovo and its backers has been filed for the purpose of delay.', ""I will also repeat our intention, which is to bring .web to market by this company that has operated .com and .net with reliability and confidence for nearly 30 years. With its newly available namespace, .web will add more choice of registrations for our global channel of thousands of registrars and there are millions of potential customers in a new generic top level domain. Now I'd like to turn the call over to George. I will return when George has completed his financial report with closing remarks. George?"", 'George Kilguss: Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended September 30, 2023, the Company generated revenue of $376 million, up 5.4% from the same quarter of 2022 and delivered operating income of $254 million, an increase of 7.4% from the same quarter a year ago. Operating expense in the third quarter totaled $122 million compared to $123 million last quarter and $120 million a year earlier. Net income totaled $188 million compared to $169 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.83 for the third quarter of 2023 compared to $1.58 for the same quarter of 2022. Operating cash flow for the third quarter of 2023 was $245 million, and free cash flow was $217 million compared with the $262 million and $255 million, respectively, in the year ago quarter.', ""Operating cash flow and free cash flow for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, totaled $650 million and $609 million, respectively, and were up from $614 million and $595 million for the same nine-month period a year ago. I'll now discuss our updated full year 2023 guidance. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.490 billion to $1.495 billion. Operating income is now expected to be between $995 million and $1 billion. Interest expense and nonoperating income net, which includes interest income estimates, is now expected to be an expense of between $25 million to $35 million. Capital expenditures are still expected to be between $45 million to $55 million. And the GAAP effective tax rate is now expected to be between 21% and 24%."", ""In summary, Verisign continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the third quarter of 2023 and we look forward to continuing to deliver on our mission and our objectives to finish the year. Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."", ""Jim Bidzos: Thank you, George. We strongly believe our strategic focus and disciplined management continue to serve us well, allowing us to deliver another solid quarter in which we provided secure and reliable infrastructure services, managed our business responsibly and efficiently and return value to our shareholders. While there is ongoing turbulence in the economy due to macroeconomic and geopolitical issues and there continues to be low demand from China, the fundamentals of our business remain strong. These strong business fundamentals and our focus on managing items within our control continues to deliver strong financial results, including steady growth in revenue, operating income and EPS.

We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. Specifically, we decided to study LyondellBasell Industries'  ROE in this article."", ""ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits."", ' View our latest analysis for LyondellBasell Industries ', 'The formula for return on equity is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for LyondellBasell Industries is:', '17% = US$2.3b ÷ US$13b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.17 in profit."", 'We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company\'s future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don\'t necessarily bear these characteristics.', ""To start with, LyondellBasell Industries' ROE looks acceptable. Especially when compared to the industry average of 13% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. For this reason, LyondellBasell Industries' five year net income decline of 2.5% raises the question as to why the high ROE didn't translate into earnings growth. We reckon that there could be some other factors at play here that are preventing the company's growth. Such as, the company pays out a huge portion of its earnings as dividends, or is faced with competitive pressures."", ""That being said, we compared LyondellBasell Industries' performance with the industry and were concerned when we found that while the company has shrunk its earnings, the industry has grown its earnings at a rate of 12% in the same 5-year period."", ""Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is LYB fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know."", ""In spite of a normal three-year median payout ratio of 40% (that is, a retention ratio of 60%), the fact that LyondellBasell Industries' earnings have shrunk is quite puzzling. It looks like there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline."", ""In addition, LyondellBasell Industries has been paying dividends over a period of at least ten years suggesting that keeping up dividend payments is way more important to the management even if it comes at the cost of business growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 56% over the next three years. Regardless, the future ROE for LyondellBasell Industries is speculated to rise to 21% despite the anticipated increase in the payout ratio. There could probably be other factors that could be driving the future growth in the ROE."", ""Overall, we feel that LyondellBasell Industries certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Yet, the low earnings growth is a bit concerning, especially given that the company has a high rate of return and is reinvesting ma huge portion of its profits. By the looks of it, there could be some other factors, not necessarily in control of the business, that's preventing growth. That being so, the latest industry analyst forecasts show that the analysts are expecting to see a huge improvement in the company's earnings growth rate.

His role in the company gives him a deep understanding of GE's operations, strategic direction, and financial health. Insider transactions, especially by high-ranking executives like Holston, are closely monitored as they can provide insights into the insider's confidence in the company's future prospects."", ""General Electric Co is a global digital industrial company that operates across various segments, including Aviation, Power, Renewable Energy, and Healthcare. The company's innovative technologies and services are instrumental in transforming industry and driving growth and productivity. GE's commitment to innovation and its diversified portfolio have positioned it as a leader in the industrial sector, catering to a wide range of customer needs across the globe."", ""Insider transactions are often considered a signal of the management's perspective on the company's valuation. A sell-off by an insider like Michael Holston could be interpreted in multiple ways. It might indicate that the insider believes the stock is fully valued or possibly overvalued, and thus, it is an opportune time to realize gains. Alternatively, the sale could be motivated by personal financial planning or diversification reasons, unrelated to their outlook on the company's future."", ""On the day of Holston's sale, General Electric Co's shares were trading at $119.79, giving the company a market cap of $130.49 billion. This price point is significant as it reflects a price-earnings ratio of 14.14, which is lower than both the industry median of 22.07 and the company's historical median price-earnings ratio. This could suggest that, despite the insider sale, the stock might still be undervalued when compared to its peers and historical performance."", ""However, the price-to-GF-Value ratio stands at 1.51, indicating that the stock is Significantly Overvalued based on its GF Value of $79.54. The GF Value is a proprietary metric developed by GuruFocus, taking into account historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future business performance estimates. This discrepancy between the price-earnings ratio and the GF Value could lead to mixed interpretations of the stock's true value."", ""Looking at the insider transaction history for General Electric Co, there have been no insider buys over the past year, which could be a sign that insiders are not seeing compelling buying opportunities at current prices. On the other hand, there have been 5 insider sells in the same timeframe, suggesting a pattern where insiders might be taking advantage of the stock's valuation to liquidate some of their holdings."", ""Michael Holston's recent transaction is part of a larger trend, as he has sold a total of 185,906 shares over the past year without purchasing any shares. This consistent selling activity could be a red flag for investors, as it may imply that insiders are not confident enough in the company's near-term growth prospects to increase their stake."", ""The sale of 15,000 shares by Senior Vice President Michael Holston is a notable event that warrants investor attention. While the reasons behind the sale are not publicly disclosed, the transaction occurs at a time when the stock is deemed Significantly Overvalued by the GF Value metric, despite a lower-than-industry-average price-earnings ratio. Investors should consider the broader insider selling trend at General Electric Co and how it might correlate with the company's valuation and stock performance."", ""As always, insider transactions are just one piece of the puzzle when evaluating a stock's potential. Investors should conduct thorough due diligence, considering a range of factors including company fundamentals, industry trends, and broader market conditions before making investment decisions."", 'For those invested in or considering an investment in General Electric Co, keeping an eye on insider activity, along with other financial metrics and market signals, will be crucial in navigating the investment landscape and making informed decisions.', 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

GE was a multi-year portfolio holding for us that started out rocky but ultimately was a good illustration of owning a “quality” business that was temporarily viewed as “value” (aka, perceived as low quality) before ultimately being weighed properly by the market. CEO Larry Culp was a great partner, creating significant value for shareholders and closing the price-to-value gap. Under his leadership, GE materially improved its operations and is well under way on plans to simplify the business by separating it into three world-class companies. The market has finally caught up with reality versus perception and is pricing GE accordingly.

UNH, The Cigna Group CI, Humana Inc. HUM, Centene Corp. CNC and Molina Healthcare, Inc. MOH.', 'Link: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2186490/5-hmo-stocks-set-to-gain-from-growing-membership-tech-advancements', ""The U.S. health insurance industry, commonly referred to as the Health Maintenance Organization (HMO), is likely to be aided by rising premiums that result from a growing membership base. Contract wins from federal or state authorities also contribute to membership and premium growth. An aging population will continue to keep demand for health insurers' Medicare plans high in the future. Industry players resort to a merger and acquisition (M&A) strategy and technology advancements to enhance capabilities. Companies like UnitedHealth Group Inc., The Cigna Group, Humana Inc., Centene Corp. and Molina Healthcare, Inc. are well-placed to gain from the industry's favorable growth prospects."", ""The Zacks HMO industry consists of entities (either private or public) that take care of subscribers' basic and supplemental health services. Companies in this space primarily assume risks and assign health and medical insurance policy premiums. Industry participants also provide administrative and managed-care services for self-funded insurance. Services are generally offered by a network of approved care providers (called in-network), which include primary care physicians, clinical facilities, hospitals and specialists. However, out-of-network exceptions are made during emergencies or when it is medically necessary. Health insurance plans can be availed through private purchases, social insurance or social welfare programs."", 'A Growing Premium Base: The industry participants devise affordable health insurance plans and infuse them with some eye-catching features to boost the lucrativeness of such plans and stand out from their peers. By extending such beneficial plans across several U.S. communities, the health insurers enjoy a growing membership base. This, in turn, fetches them with a steady flow of premiums — the most significant contributor to revenues of any health insurer. The strength of these plans fetches numerous contract wins and renewed agreements from federal or state authorities. However, the resumption of elective procedures, which were deferred to keep beds open for a humongous number of COVID patients, in full swing poses a concern for health insurers. An uptick in elective surgeries implies the need to address a higher number of claims from plan members. This would elevate costs, but the financial strength and diversified operations are expected to provide a shield to the industry participants from such headwinds.', 'A Rising Greying Population: The Medicare plans are intended to cater to people aged 65 or above. An aging U.S. population is likely to sustain the solid demand for the plans in the days ahead. Per the leading market and consumer data provider, Statista, around 17.3% of Americans were 65 years or above in 2020. The percentage is anticipated to reach 22% by 2050. Industry participants can, therefore, make use of the Medicare plans to welcome more members of the rapidly growing senior population and grow its customer base. They contract with an extensive network of healthcare providers, which can be physician groups, hospitals, ancillary providers, and pharmacies, to deliver quality care services to the medically vulnerable population.', 'Technological Advancements: The industry continues to undertake significant investments in developing virtual healthcare solutions (more commonly referred to as telehealth services) in order to embrace the digitization trend being infused across every sphere of life. These services enable patients to receive care from the comfort of their homes and thereby reduce the mounting burden on the U.S. healthcare system arising from frequent patient admissions. Such technologies, therefore, boost operational efficiencies and reduce costs for the industry participants. Though tech investments might result in escalating costs for health insurers, virtual services continue to fetch regular revenues and enable them to achieve a competitive edge over their peers.', ""An Active M&A Strategy: The health insurers resort to an M&A strategy for upgrading their product and services portfolio that will fetch them a growing number of members. Such initiatives are also meant to expand the global presence and bring diversification benefits to health insurers, which are crucial to strengthening one's market position. However, continued rate hikes by the Fed in order to tame inflation may have thrown a roadblock to health insurers' pursuit of an M&A strategy, considering the rising borrowing costs that make people reluctant to opt for loans for financing M&A deals."", ""The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all-member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. The Zacks Medical-HMOs industry, which is housed within the broader Zacks Medical sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #61, which places it in the top 24% of more than 250 Zacks industries."", ""Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. The industry's positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are upbeat about this group's earnings growth potential. The industry's earnings estimates for 2023 have increased 1.5% from the past year. Given the bright near-term prospects, companies in the space are expected to gain heavily."", ""Before we present a few stocks you may want to buy or retain in your portfolio, let's look at the industry's recent stock-market performance and valuation picture."", 'The Zacks Medical-HMO industry has outperformed the Medical sector but fell short of the Zacks S&P 500 composite in the past year.', ""In the said time frame, the industry has gained 1% against the Medical sector's decline of 8%. The Zacks S&P 500 composite has risen 14.8% in the same time frame."", ""Based on the forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is commonly used for valuing medical stocks, the industry trades at 16.45X compared with the S&P 500's 19.1X and the sector's 21.67X."", 'Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 19.57X and as low as 11.79X, with the median being at 15.91X.', 'We present five stocks from the space, either carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold).

These plans provide the Zacks Rank #2 health insurer with contract wins from time to time. Management is optimistic to achieve long-term premium revenue growth within 13-15%.

Its shares have gained 22.7% in the past six months."", ""Centene: Based in Missouri, the revenues of Centene are aided by strength in its Medicare and Medicaid businesses that fetched several contract wins and led to membership growth for it. An aging U.S. population favors Medicare Advantage plans, which is likely to continue driving solid demand for CNC's plans. This Zacks Rank #2 health insurer follows an inorganic growth route in the form of pursuing acquisitions and provider collaborations, which, in turn, bolsters its capabilities, diversifies its portfolio and solidifies its nationwide presence."", ""The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Centene's 2023 earnings is pegged at $6.64 per share, which suggests a 14.9% rise from the year-ago reported figure.

The UnitedHealthcare unit devises lucrative Medicare and Medicaid plans and upgrades them from time to time. It also receives contract wins or renewed agreements from the federal or state authorities. The Optum unit continues to benefit on the back of numerous buyouts and utilization of advanced technology, market-leading health analytics, modern care delivery and data-driven population health approaches.

While a solid specialty pharmacy services suite drives the growth of the Evernorth platform, the Cigna Healthcare unit benefits from an expansive customer base within its U.S. Government and U.S. Commercial businesses. An aging U.S. population is expected to sustain the solid demand for the Zacks Rank #3 company's Medicare plans in the days ahead. The health insurer resorts to continuous product expansions, acquisitions and collaborations with renowned healthcare systems."", ""The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Cigna's 2023 earnings is pegged at $24.82 per share, suggesting 6.7% growth from the prior-year reported figure. CI's earnings outpaced estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average being 2.52%. Its shares have gained 10.6% in the past six months."", 'Humana: Based in Kentucky, Humana gains on the back of an expanding customer base, which it earns through distributing affordable health insurance plans across different U.S. communities and making efforts to upgrade such plan offerings from time to time. An increase in membership fetches the resultant benefit of improved premiums. In order to cater more effectively to the aging population, HUM has the CenterWell brand in place. An array of acquisitions and collaborations undertaken over the years has upgraded its capabilities, diversified income streams and expanded the global presence of the Zacks Rank #3 health insurer.', ""The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Humana's 2023 earnings is pegged at $28.29 per share, indicating an 12.1% improvement from the year-ago reported figure. HUM's earnings surpassed estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average being 5.47%.

(NASDAQ:ADP). The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$256 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$210. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Automatic Data Processing's current trading price of US$231 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Automatic Data Processing’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change."", ' See our latest analysis for Automatic Data Processing ', 'Good news, investors! Automatic Data Processing is still a bargain right now. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $355.20, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. Another thing to keep in mind is that Automatic Data Processing’s share price may be quite stable relative to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. This means that if you believe the current share price should move towards its intrinsic value over time, a low beta could suggest it is not likely to reach that level anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range again.', 'Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 27% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Automatic Data Processing. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.', 'Are you a shareholder? Since ADP is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.', 'Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on ADP for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy ADP. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.', ""If you'd like to know more about Automatic Data Processing as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

As I noted back in August, ADP is a “dividend aristocrat,” with over 25 consecutive years of dividend growth under its belt. The stock currently has a forward dividend yield of 2.43%.', 'Assuming growth trends continue, Automatic Data Processing remains well-positioned to continue producing strong returns. Forecasts call for earnings to rise by between 9%-10% over the next few years. Dividend growth has averaged 13.6% annually over the past five years. Put it all together, and it’s clear to see why ADP remains one of the top large-caps for investors focused on steady gains for their portfolios.', 'Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com', 'Illinois Tool Works (NYSE:ITW) is another of the dividend aristocrats that’s one of the best large-cap stocks to buy. This industrial conglomerate has increased its dividend payouts 27 years in a row. With a forward yield of 2.37%, dividend growth has averaged 9.8% annually over the past five years.', 'Similar to ADP, ITW stock has also experienced an outsized level of price appreciation over the past decade. Consistent earnings growth has sent the stock surging threefold since 2013. ITW’s forward multiple (24.3) may seem steep at first place, when compared to stocks overall.', 'However, given the company’s resilient results (improved earnings despite zero revenue growth) last quarter, and the prospect of growth re-acceleration (based on sell-side earnings forecasts), ITW still appears on track to deliver the level of earnings growth necessarily to sustain its valuation, and keep shares trending upwards over a long time frame.', 'Source: JennLShoots / Shutterstock.com', 'L3 Harris Technologies (NYSE:LHX) isn’t in the dividend aristocrats category just yet, but it’s getting there. This defense firm has raised its payouts for 21 years in a row.', 'LHX’s 2.43% dividend yields provide a solid baseline of returns, and the payout has increased by 13.6% on average over the past five years.', 'Thanks to the company’s strengths in acquiring/realizing cost/growth synergies out of bolt-on acquisitions, LHX stock (up 182.8% over the past 10 years) appears poised to keep rising, in line with expected high single-digit increases in earnings per share.', 'That’s not all. As Raymond James analyst Brian Gesuale recently argued, LHX is undervalued compared to peers in the aerospace and defense technology space. While not for certain, it’s possible that, over time, this valuation gap is bridged. Such multiple expansion could help to further boost future total returns.', 'Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com', 'With shares declining in price over the past five years, at first you may question Medtronic’s (NYSE:MDT) appeal as a long-term buy-and-hold. Yet while the medical device maker hasn’t exactly been a winner for investors in recent years, it could be a different story in the years ahead.', 'As InvestorPlace’s Will Ashworth recently pointed out, Medtronic is in the midst of a restructuring. Once the company completes divesting non-core/underperforming business segments, and becomes focused fully on higher growth/higher margin products, MDT stock (trading for only 14.2 times earnings today) could experience a big re-rating to the upside.', 'Alongside this, the stock’s moderately-high dividend (3.8% forward yield) stands to provide a further boost for total returns.

There’s no way to sugarcoat it. As I discussed last month, shares took a dive in September, as the prospect of persistently high interest rates and slowing growth for the utility company’s renewables segments weighed on the minds of investors.', 'However, if you’re looking to make NEE stock one of the large-cap stocks to buy and hold in your portfolio, this sharp sell-off works to your advantage. Although shares have started to recover, NextEra remains reasonably-priced, at 18.4 times forward earnings.', 'Despite the walking-back of outlook, analysts still expect NEE to report high single-digit earnings growth in the years to come, which may help to drive shares higher. Combine that with NextEra’s 3.25% (and growing) dividend, and it’s easy to see why NEE, while no longer a high-flier, could still be a long-term winner for slow-and-steady investors.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'With its greater exposure to non-combustible tobacco products, up until recently, Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM) was considered the tobacco company with the brightest future. More recently, though, pessimism about the stock has made a resurgence.', 'Namely, there are concerns that, even for Philip Morris International, non-combustible growth will fail to make up for global declines in cigarette consumption. However, based on the company’s Q3 2023 results, I wouldn’t necessarily jump to this bearish conclusion about PM stock.', 'Even when excluding increased revenue resulting from PM’s acquisition of Swedish Match last year, top-line growth came in at 9.3%. With adjusted earnings per share rising 20.3%, so far it appears that the smokefree transition is working out.

The Oracle of Omaha is one of the very few individuals on the Forbes' billionaire list who made this wealth purely by investing in the stock market. But Buffett did not become the master of the game overnight. He inherited investing wisdom from his father who was a US Congressman and later a stock broker. While strong family connections did give Buffett an opportunity to raise funds in early stages of his career, he made his way up to the ranks of success by pure ability and sticking to value investing principles propended by the Benjamin Graham school of investing."", 'Every year Warren Buffett reiterates the basic principles of his investing philosophy in his letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. This philosophy is dramatically simple and eventually boils down to this: Buffett likes to invest in businesses that he believes will keep growing and because of their growth and performance the Oracle of Omaha loves to own a stake in them and hold it forever. In his 2022 letter to investors Buffett said:', 'Over the years, I have made many mistakes. Consequently, our extensive collection of businesses currently consists of a few enterprises that have truly extraordinary economics, many that enjoy very good economic characteristics, and a large group that are marginal. Along the way, other businesses in which I have invested have died, their products unwanted by the public. Capitalism has two sides: The system creates an ever-growing pile of losers while concurrently delivering a gusher of improved goods and services.

This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.', ""The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system."", 'Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.', 'Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for PepsiCo basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.', 'Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices', ""The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock."", ""For PepsiCo, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business.

Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating.
