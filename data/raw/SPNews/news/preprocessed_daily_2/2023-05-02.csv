A copy of the same can be downloaded here. The fund appreciated 5.34% in the first quarter, trailing the Russell Midcap Growth Index, which returned 9.14%. Stock selection drove the fund to underperform in the quarter. IT, Communication Services, and Consumer Discretionary were the strongest performing sectors, while Energy and Financials were the principal laggards. Furthermore, defensive-oriented sectors, Health Care, Utilities, and Consumer Staples also struggled in the quarter. In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2023.Baron Asset Fund highlighted stocks like The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) in the first quarter 2023 investor letter. Headquartered in Westlake, Texas, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is a savings and loan holding company. On May 1, 2023, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) stock closed at $51.81 per share. One-month return of The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) was 3.62%, and its shares lost 25.41% of their value over the last 52 weeks. The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) has a market capitalization of $94.227 billion.Baron Asset Fund made the following comment about The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:""Shares of online brokerage firm The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) declined during the quarter following the failure of SVB that led to weakness in Financials generally and particularly in regional banks. We do not believe Schwab is at any risk of a potential solvency issue (or run on the bank). Despite running a much different business than SVB, Schwab is facing near-term deposit pressure through cash sorting in the wake of SVB’s collapse. As interest rates rose, Schwab customers continued to move their uninvested cash balances into higher-yielding money market funds. As cash balances at Schwab decrease, the company may need to raise short-term external funding, which is more costly than the customer cash balances being depleted. This trend has pressured its earnings estimates and contributed to the recent share price weakness. Nevertheless, we retain long-term conviction in the value of Schwab’s franchise. Despite dislocation in the financial system, Schwab saw accelerating net inflows year-to-date, gathering over $75 billion in new assets in just the first two months of 2023. We remain encouraged by the firm’s exceptional client loyalty levels, robust organic growth, and industry-leading operating expense per client assets. Schwab remains well positioned to retain client assets and increase long-term earnings growth, in our view.""Story continuesCreative Collage Of Business Team Working On Project And Stock Markets Data On Trasparent Screen, Financial Statistics Layered Over Man Using Laptop For Trading On Forex, PanoramaThe Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is not on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.As per our database, 74 hedge fund portfolios held The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) at the end of the fourth quarter which was 75 in the previous quarter.We discussed The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) in another article and shared the list of best May dividend stocks to buy.

Although the dividend is now higher, the yield is only 1.9%, which is below the industry average.While the dividend yield is important for income investors, it is also important to consider any large share price moves, as this will generally outweigh any gains from distributions. Charles Schwab's stock price has reduced by 31% in the last 3 months, which is not ideal for investors and can explain a sharp increase in the dividend yield. View our latest analysis for Charles Schwab Charles Schwab's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsIf it is predictable over a long period, even low dividend yields can be attractive. Prior to this announcement, Charles Schwab's dividend was only 24% of earnings, however it was paying out 167% of free cash flows. While the business may be attempting to set a balanced dividend policy, a cash payout ratio this high might expose the dividend to being cut if the business ran into some challenges.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 36.8% over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 21% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendCharles Schwab Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $0.24 total annually to $1.00. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 15% over that duration. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. Charles Schwab has impressed us by growing EPS at 16% per year over the past five years. Charles Schwab definitely has the potential to grow its dividend in the future with earnings on an uptrend and a low payout ratio.Story continuesIn SummaryOverall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think Charles Schwab will make a great income stock. While the low payout ratio is a redeeming feature, this is offset by the minimal cash to cover the payments. We would probably look elsewhere for an income investment.Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 2 warning signs for Charles Schwab that investors need to be conscious of moving forward.

The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Thus, you can purchase Texas Instruments' shares before the 5th of May in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 16th of May.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.24 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$4.96 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Texas Instruments has a trailing yield of 3.0% on the current stock price of $166.68. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Texas Instruments's dividend is reliable and sustainable. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. Check out our latest analysis for Texas Instruments Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Texas Instruments paid out more than half (53%) of its earnings last year, which is a regular payout ratio for most companies. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. It paid out 99% of its free cash flow in the form of dividends last year, which is outside the comfort zone for most businesses. Cash flows are usually much more volatile than earnings, so this could be a temporary effect - but we'd generally want to look more closely here.Story continuesTexas Instruments paid out less in dividends than it reported in profits, but unfortunately it didn't generate enough cash to cover the dividend. Cash is king, as they say, and were Texas Instruments to repeatedly pay dividends that aren't well covered by cashflow, we would consider this a warning sign.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. Fortunately for readers, Texas Instruments's earnings per share have been growing at 20% a year for the past five years. Earnings have been growing at a decent rate, but we're concerned dividend payments consumed most of the company's cash flow over the past year.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Texas Instruments has delivered 22% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see.The Bottom LineShould investors buy Texas Instruments for the upcoming dividend? The best dividend stocks typically boast a long history of growing earnings per share (EPS) via a combination of earnings growth and buybacks. That's why we're glad to see Texas Instruments growing its EPS, buying back stock and paying out a reasonable percentage of its earnings as dividends. However, we note with some concern that it paid out 99% of its free cash flow last year, which is uncomfortably high and makes us wonder why the company chose to spend even more cash on buybacks. Overall, it's not a bad combination, but we feel that there are likely more attractive dividend prospects out there.So if you want to do more digging on Texas Instruments, you'll find it worthwhile knowing the risks that this stock faces. For example, we've found 3 warning signs for Texas Instruments (1 can't be ignored!) that deserve your attention before investing in the shares.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

It is projected that the computer hardware market will reach $1,517.99 billion in 2026, growing at a CAGR of 5.3%.

Looking ahead, virtual reality is set to become more accessible and successful in the mainstream computer hardware market, as many of its challenges are being addressed and improved, according to TechNavio. The firm observed that a notable obstacle in the PC gaming peripherals market has been the high cost associated with virtual reality.

However, these delayed upgrades are likely to occur later in the year and act as a catalyst for the growth of the PC market, as stated by the research firms. Canalys analyst Ishan Dutt further suggested that the recovery will be supported by a surge in demand from the education sector in major markets, as the devices deployed during the peak of the pandemic reach the end of their life cycle.Story continuesSome of the best computer hardware stocks to invest in include Apple Inc.

However, an active catastrophe level and inflationary pressure are likely to have weighed on their performance.Improved pricing, solid retention and exposure growth across business lines are likely to have aided premiums.

Per a report by MarketScout, commercial property and casualty insurance rates in the United States increased more than 5% in the to-be-reported quarter.The first quarter of 2023 bore the brunt of March storms.

A stronger mortgage market is likely to have favored mortgage insurance premiums. A low unemployment rate is likely to have aided commercial insurance and group insurance.Insurers, being beneficiaries of an improving rate environment, are likely to witness improved investment results.

The Institutional Investor Holdings Indicator, Institutional Investor Risk Appetite Indicator and the State Street S&amp;P Global Institutional Investor Carbon Indicator, powered by S&amp;P Global Sustainble1, will draw on the aggregated and anonymized dataset underlying the assets State Street services to offer investors, as well as other stakeholders, a rigorous, fact-based alternative to unscientific polls and surveys as a means to gauge institutional investor sentiment.These three new tools will harness the power of State Street’s more than $37 trillion of assets under custody and administration1 to provide a top-down look into the historically opaque perspective of institutional investors. The indicators are highly aggregated and anonymized to protect the confidentiality of investors. As an essential partner to the investors influencing financial markets, these indicators bolster State Street’s leading position as a provider of data-driven market research and flow analytics to its clients and other important stakeholders. The indicators will be made available on Insights [globalmarkets.statestreet.com], the research platform of State Street’s markets business.The Institutional Investor Holdings Indicator tracks the aggregate holdings of institutional investors across three asset classes: stocks, bonds and cash. Shifts in asset allocations convey information about how investors view the economy and their outlook for markets. When investors are bullish on markets, they tend to hold more stocks; when they are bearish, they tend to hold more cash and bonds. The Holdings Indicator is calculated daily and will be released monthly.Institutional Investor Risk Appetite Indicator is based on flows—buying and selling activity—rather than portfolio positions. It reveals whether investors, in aggregate, are buying or selling risky assets. For example, selling less risky bond or stock investments to buy riskier ones would drive up this score. While the Holdings Indicator tells us about current positioning, the Risk Appetite Indicator tells us about the direction of travel. The Risk Appetite Indicator is calculated daily and will be released monthly.The State Street S&amp;P Global Institutional Investor Carbon Indicator tracks the overall exposure of institutional investor portfolio holdings to carbon emissions. Leveraging aggregated and anonymized custody and accounting data from State Street, together carbon emissions data from S&amp;P Global powered by S&amp;P Global Sustainble1, the indicator will show how institutional investors are managing their exposure to carbon risk, and what is driving shifts in these exposures. The Carbon Indicator will be released annually.Story continues""In global markets, understanding how the world’s largest pools of capital are moving can help investors identify headwinds and tailwinds that will impact their portfolios both short and long-term,"" said Anthony Bisegna, head of State Street Global Markets. ""For two decades, our clients have looked to us for data-driven flow research to help them manage assets. Today, we’re pleased to make these three bellwethers available to the media, policymakers and investors at large.""The State Street Institutional Investor Indicators are an essential tool for anyone seeking to understand how some of the world’s largest investors are reacting to market conditions and other macroeconomic considerations.""We have built a market-leading position in macro, quantitative and flow research drawing on our exclusive academic partnerships and data science capabilities,"" said Will Kinlaw, head of Research at State Street Global Markets.

7,d2e35559-e3fd-3336-a33b-679af9fc4367,QRVO,2023-05-02,Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Can the Stock Move Higher?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/skyworks-solutions-swks-expected-beat-140102846.html,1682949662,STORY,"['SWKS', 'QRVO']","[Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 8. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis chipmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.01 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -23.6%.Revenues are expected to be $1.15 billion, down 14% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.05% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Skyworks?For Skyworks, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.45%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Skyworks will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Skyworks would post earnings of $2.59 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.59, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Skyworks appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Semiconductors - Radio Frequency industry, Qorvo (QRVO), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.12 per share for the quarter ended March 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -96.2%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $621.27 million, down 46.7% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Qorvo has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.70%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Qorvo will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:TMO) by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific Crunching The NumbersWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$7.06bUS$8.82bUS$9.73bUS$10.2bUS$10.6bUS$11.0bUS$11.3bUS$11.6bUS$11.9bUS$12.2bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x8Analyst x7Analyst x1Est @ 3.85%Est @ 3.32%Est @ 2.94%Est @ 2.68%Est @ 2.50%Est @ 2.37% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.9% US$6.5kUS$7.6kUS$7.8kUS$7.6kUS$7.3kUS$7.0kUS$6.7kUS$6.3kUS$6.0kUS$5.7k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$68bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$12b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.9%– 2.1%) = US$215bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$215b÷ ( 1 + 7.9%)10= US$101bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$169b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$555, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Thermo Fisher Scientific as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.974. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Thermo Fisher ScientificStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Life Sciences market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.ThreatRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

It had to wait until the middle of the night to get what it wanted.The US government informed JPMorgan after 1 a.m. Monday that it won an auction for the troubled San Francisco lender. The news capped a marathon weekend of back-to-back meetings with people from every JPMorgan business line, fueled by takeout Mexican and lots of coffee. The CFO even pulled an all nighter.In Pittsburgh, the news wasn’t as good. There, PNC Financial Services Group (PNC) knew by roughly 12:30 a.m. that its bid wasn't successful, and it didn't know which bank was the winner. Regulators announced the deal at 3:22 a.m. ET.The decision made just hours before markets opened in the US on Monday ended speculation about the destiny of the nation’s 14th-largest lender after a bidding war managed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation attracted some of the biggest names in banking.Bank of America (BAC), the second-largest US lender, ultimately decided against an offer, as did US Bancorp (USB), the nation’s fifth-largest bank.Citizens Bank (CFG) and Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), sizable regional lenders based in Providence, R.I. and Cincinnati, also participated in the bidding, according to The Wall Street Journal.JPMorgan v. PNCFor those watching the auction unfold, the competition really came down to two heavyweights: JPMorgan and PNC. The nation’s largest and sixth-largest banks.Both had survived the 2008 crisis by getting even bigger via a series of acquisitions encouraged by the US government.In JPMorgan’s case, it picked up New York investment bank Bear Stearns and Seattle thrift Washington Mutual in March and September of 2008, giving it a coast-to-coast empire. PNC got Cleveland rival National City in October of that year and eventually established a foothold in nearly every top metro area.A PNC sign in Pittsburgh. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Both were also involved in a prior attempt in March to stabilize First Republic with uninsured deposits, a rescue attempt that received encouragement from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and other top Washington officials. JPMorgan kicked in $5 billion and PNC kicked in $1 billion. Another nine banks contributed an additional $24 billion.Story continuesThe infusion bought First Republic time but it didn’t solve the bank’s underlying crisis of confidence. A disclosure last Monday that it lost more than $100 billion in deposits during the first quarter sent its stock tumbling again.Working through the weekendSo JPMorgan got another call Wednesday evening fielded by JPMorgan CFO Jeremy Barnum. Would the bank be interested in gathering information for a bid to acquire First Republic after its seizure by the FDIC?To answer that question, the bank convened roughly 800 people. It tapped executives from its investment banking, commercial banking and private banking units as well as tax advisers, mortgage experts, asset and wealth management experts and valuation specialists.The assignment for every business at the bank was to look at First Republic and to report on what it expected a deal to be worth to its particular unit.JPMorgan Chase CEO, here testifying in Congress last year, is once again playing the role of rescuer during a banking crisis. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)On Saturday, each team presented its findings to JPMorgan’s senior managers via a series of meetings from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Many on the executive floors ate at their desks as they worked.The pros of buying First Republic were that it would help restore some stability to the banking system and it would lower the costs JPMorgan might have to pay to the FDIC if First Republic were to fail without a buyer in hand. The FDIC charges banks a special assessment to cover the costs of industry failures.The risks were many, too. There were potential legal headaches, credit challenges and the possibility that First Republic employees could weaken the franchise by leaving.'Up all night'Bids were due Sunday at noon. After the first batch came in, it was clear to JPMorgan that not all bidders wanted the same assets. Some were willing to take First Republic’s jumbo mortgages and some were not, said a person familiar with JPMorgan’s negotiations.The FDIC needed a way to conform the bids so that they could start comparing them, this person said. Regulators began asking JPMorgan to resubmit its bid with additional parameters and refocus it around certain categories.“They started trying to get everyone on the same page,” this person said.JPM submitted four new bids between noon and 9 pm on Sunday. The final call came from the FDIC at roughly 1:15 a.m., this person said, and First Republic was seized at roughly 2 a.m. The bank's CFO didn’t get much sleep Sunday night, this person said.“There were a lot of people up all night,” Mr. Dimon said on a call with reporters Monday.By 5:30 a.m., some of Dimon's top executives, including Marianne Lake and Jennifer Piepszak, were on a plane and flying to California to meet their new colleagues.

The drop was most intense in the Southeast, West and Northeast regions, where volume fell 16.1%, 14.1% and 13.8%, respectively. Shipments fell just 2.4% year-over-year in the Midwest, but the region has experienced contracting volume for 12 straight quarters. Meanwhile, shipments in the Southwest region increased 14%, the region’s largest year-over-year increase since early 2018.""This quarter was a prime example of how important it is to examine regional data when assessing truck freight shipments in the U.S.,"" said Bobby Holland, director of freight data solutions at U.S. Bank. ""Boosted by growing truck-transported trade with Mexico and increased activity at the Port of Houston, truck freight activity in the Southwest region is markedly different than what we’re seeing in other regions.""Nationwide spending on truck freight fell just 0.3% year-over-year driven by an 8% year-over-year spending drop in the Midwest. Spending rose in all other regions, including by 16.7% annually in the Southwest and 7.8% in the Southeast.""It’s clear that capacity is not uniform across the country,"" said Bob Costello, senior vice president and chief economist at the American Trucking Associations.

This compares to earnings of $4.21 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 8.37%.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.87 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.CF shares have lost about 16% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 8.6%.What's Next for CF?While CF has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for CF: unfavorable.

The top line improved 11.8% on a year-over-year basis and 14% at constant currency (cc). Sales were up 13.6% organically, indicating 12.9% growth in unit volume and 0.7% due to higher prices.Revenues by GeographyRevenues in the United States were $3.51 billion, up 13.1% year over year. International sales increased 8.2% to $1.27 billion. International sales were up 16.5%, excluding the negative impact of currency.

Adjusted gross margin was 63.2%, down 90 basis points (bps). The decline reflects higher manufacturing and supply-chain costs.Story continuesTotal operating expenses were $2.28 billion, down 0.3% from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to inflationary pressure.Adjusted operating income totaled $1.01 billion, up 7.7% from that reported in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted operating margin was 21.1%, down 70 bps.Financial UpdateStryker exited the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1.67 billion compared with $1.84 billion in the preceding quarter.Cumulative net cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter was $445 million compared with $203 million in the year-ago period.2023 Guidance RaisedStryker announced its updated guidance for 2023. The company now expects organic growth for total revenues to be 8-9%, up from its previous expectation of 7-8.5%. However, macroeconomic volatility is likely to persist due to alleviating supply-chain disruptions, inflationary risks and currency fluctuations. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues stands at $19.75 billion.SYK now expects adjusted EPS in the band of $10.05-$10.25, implying growth of 8.7% at the midpoint of the range. The previously guided range was $9.85-$10.15. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $10.02 for the same.The company expects unfavorable currency movement to hurt growth modestly in 2023, especially in the first half. It expects the price impact to be relatively neutral compared to its previous expectation of an impact of 0-0.5%.Wrapping UpStryker exited first-quarter 2023 on a strong note, wherein both earnings and revenues beat estimates. The company witnessed strong performance across its segments in the United States. Strong International sales also buoy optimism. It expects the momentum to continue into 2023 on the back of ongoing procedural recovery and a strong order book for capital equipment.Per management, Stryker continues to face supply-chain challenges and inflationary pressures. Moreover, ongoing negative foreign currency values are a concern. The company has taken steps to alleviate the negative price impact, which got reflected in the first quarter results.It is also taking several cost-cutting initiatives, including restructuring plans. Stryker’s prospects in 2023 seem promising on the back of strong customer demand for its existing products as well as new launches. The company’s guidance for earnings and revenues appears encouraging.However, the contraction in both gross and operating margins is disappointing. SYK continues to grapple with pricing pressure. Stiff competition in the MedTech space is a concern.Zacks RankStryker currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other Key PicksSome other stocks in the broader medical space that have announced their quarterly results are Intuitive Surgical ISRG, Chemed CHE and Edwards Lifesciences EW, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 at present.

For more on this, go to 5 Most Acquisitive Public Companies in the US.Through acquisition, companies can bring an effective pool of resources, broaden their market reach, and compete efficiently with their rivals. This article will give investors and stakeholders an insight into the 15 most acquisitive public companies in the US.Market OutlookIn 2021, the US acquisition market had the highest record of $2.9 trillion in transactions, an increase of 55% from $1.9 trillion in 2020. At this time, the U.S. acquisitions market was unparalleled (up from less than 50% in 2020). This represents over 60% of all worldwide agreements based on the stated value.In times of uncertainty or market volatility, M&amp;A tends to slow down, but those can also be the exact times when valuations improve, and opportunities present themselves. Having said that, 2022 was a year of uncertainty due to rising inflation. North America's fourth quarter of 2022 saw a dismal finish to a challenging year as corporations refrained from growing due to rising interest rates and a weakening economy.According to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence statistics, the overall value of mergers and acquisitions in the United States decreased to $1.477 trillion in 2022, down 41.4% from 2021. In 2022, there were 20,965 transactions, a 21.2% decrease from the previous year.Early in 2023, concerns about a global recession and increasing interest rates maintained a shadow over the short-term economic picture as central bankers worked to contain high inflation in several areas. So it's understandable why executives have been pushed back on their heels given the crisis in Ukraine, other geopolitical risks, supply chain interruptions, increased regulatory scrutiny, and the jittery investors still processing 2022's precipitous collapse in global stock market prices.Interest Rate - A Big Concern in 2023 for Acquisitive Public CompaniesSince the start of October 2022, businesses have been developing their budgets and business plans for 2023. Numerous changes have occurred in the economy and financial markets during this time. Two major worries are rising interest rates worldwide and how long they could stay high.Story continuesOn the ten-year bond issued by the US Department of the Treasury, interest rates are approximately the same in 2009 and 2022, ranging between 3 and 4 percent. However, credit was much more accessible back then because governments had opened the floodgates of fiscal support.US ""new money"" leveraged-loan issuance through October 2022 (i.e., not a refinancing) is down roughly a third year to date compared to 2021. A comparable metric for high-yield bonds is down by about 70% year over year, and 2021 was worse than 2020.2023 will be an incredible year for potential US acquisitive public companies. These businesses should be better protected against the hazards of an economic downturn because of their strong and adaptable balance sheets. They should also have reserves to take advantage of the worthwhile growth prospects of a recession's recovery phase.Cross-Border Acquisitions Might Get IncreasedDeal-making across international boundaries was considerably slowed down in 2022 by the COVID-19 epidemic, trade tensions between the U.S. and China, and regionally different economic situations. As a result, from 2012 through 2022, the average annual percentage of worldwide M&amp;A dollar volume is roughly 18%.Although M&amp;A was not exempt from all of this turmoil, cross-border M&amp;A remained alluring to dealmakers. In 2022, cross-border transactions accounted for 32% ($1.1 trillion) of all worldwide M&amp;A, which was in line with the average percentage for the previous ten years (35%). $217 billion in transactions were spent on acquiring American firms by non-American parties in 2022, accounting for 6% of worldwide M&amp;A activity and 19% of cross-border M&amp;A activity. Acquirers from China, India, and other emerging economies accounted for only 8% of the volume of cross-border acquisitions of U.S. targets, compared to 50% from the British, Canadian, Singaporean, Australian, and Japanese acquirers.15 Most Acquisitive Public Companies in the USPhoto by Kai Wenzel on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe have selected the most acquisitive public companies based on factors like the number of deals (acquisitions) made by an organization, the acquiring companies' total buying value, the acquirer's market capitalization, and the quality companies (potential companies) being acquired by the acquirer.

The $16 billion deal with Flipkart enabled Walmart to grow its online retail operations aggressively in India.9. Visa, Inc. (NYSE:V)As a multinational provider of financial services, Visa, Inc.

Here’s a little secret: There’s a hidden clearance at Walmart that only the most in-the-know shoppers take advantage of.See: 10 Aldi Brand Products Worth BuyingLearn: How To Build a Financial Plan From ZeroIf you want in on even more bang for your buck, all you have to do is be on the lookout for Walmart’s yellow clearance stickers and be aware of a few more insider tricks. Here are 10 secret ways to save money with Walmart’s hidden clearance.Make Sure To Follow Walmart on InstagramPull out your phone, open up Instagram, and make sure you are following Walmart’s official account along with 2.9 million other savvy shoppers.If you want in on Walmart’s hidden clearance, go one step further and follow some hashtags as well. The three to keep an eye on are #walmartclearance, #walmartclearancefinds, and #walmarthiddenclearance to get up to date details on Walmart’s hidden clearance tips.Check a Price on the Walmart AppDon’t put your phone away yet. If you haven’t already downloaded the Walmart app, do that and then open it up to get the most from Walmart’s hidden clearance. Go into the app, click on “Services” and then click the “Check a price” tool.From there, James Rochester, CFO at CashBlog, says to “adjust the location settings within the Walmart app so that it displays the Walmart store in which you are currently located. He adds, “This changes from store to store, so before proceeding, you need to determine which store you are in. After that, you may rapidly scan the price of an item using the barcode reader, which will allow you to determine whether or not the price has been reduced.”Take Our Poll: What Are You Worth to Your Company?You can use Walmart’s price scanner on everything, including the yellow stickers on clearance items. The app can oftentimes show you a lower price than what’s listed on the sticker. Now you’re in the Walmart hidden clearance club.Story continuesMark Your CalendarSpecifically, mark the first five days of the month. That’s usually when Walmart’s hidden clearance kicks in at stores. Markdowns, including seasonal inventory, typically happen in this time frame.Know When To GoCertain months are tailored toward marking down clearance items from the previous month. January is the perfect time to get holiday items and discounted winter gear while September is the time to clean up on all the summer products with significantly lower prices.Here’s a few months to keep in mind for specific Walmart hidden clearances:January — holiday items and winter apparelJuly — toysSeptember — summer productsDecember — toys and seasonal items after ChristmasEach Department Has Its Own ClearanceStart your hunt for Walmart’s hidden clearance items each month by knowing which departments to hit up first. These discounted products could be just out of sight, shelved on an endcap, or in hard-to-reach or see parts of the aisle.No matter what, make sure to stop by the “Home” section of Walmart, where lots of items are compiled from other departments, but all have that yellow clearance sticker.‘Best by’ FoodsGetting food products — including produce, meat and bakery items — during Walmart’s hidden clearance is a great way to stock your kitchen. However, it’s worth noting that these items become part of Walmart’s clearance a day before their “best by dates.”While they might be a yummy part of Walmart’s hidden clearance, just make sure you are timing out when you plan to eat them to avoid any spoilage.Dented Cans = SavingsIf you want to save money on food for later, though, go to the canned food aisle and see if there are any dented products that have clearance markdown stickers. Walmart will most likely mark down these items in an effort to empty the shelves quicker.A dent or two in a can might make that item part of Walmart’s hidden clearance, but you can still use Walmart secret promo codes, manufacturer coupons, and rebates — including Ibotta and Checkout 51 — on these products.The Manager Is Your FriendDon’t see the items you are looking for during Walmart’s hidden clearance? Make a new buddy with your local Walmart manager.Rochester says, “While headquarters orders Walmart locations to decrease a price, it is ultimately up to the store manager to decide how much lower to take the price. This indicates that clearance pricing [is] not consistent across the board.”Because Walmart’s hidden clearance sales are based on location, with each store determining which products to markdown, the manager could find more discounts on products they are trying to sell. All you have to do is ask nicely.Shop IRLWhile it might be good to have Walmart’s social media and app on your phone, you won’t find the same deals online. Walmart’s hidden clearance happens in-store, changing from location to location.There is, however, some prep work you can do online. On Walmart’s homepage you can click on “Departments” then click on “Deals” and finally “Clearance.” You can also use the search bar method by just putting in the word “clearance.”From there, you can filter “in store” based on location to find what Walmart hidden clearance items are available at your local store.No Hidden NumbersWhile Walmart’s hidden clearance might be, well, hidden, the numbers on the yellow clearance stickers are not a secret code. Rumors abound that price tags ending with “1” or “.00” have additional discounts, but that doesn’t seem to be quite true.More From GOBankingRatesWhy Stealth Wealth Is the Best Way To Handle Your MoneyGot a Question About Money?

It is worth considering Walmart (WMT), which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Supermarkets industry.This world's largest retailer has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 13.07%.For the most recent quarter, Walmart was expected to post earnings of $1.52 per share, but it reported $1.71 per share instead, representing a surprise of 12.50%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.32 per share, while it actually produced $1.50 per share, a surprise of 13.64%.Price and EPS SurpriseWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Walmart. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Walmart currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.28%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on May 18, 2023.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Booking Holdings (BKNG) holds a Zacks Rank #2 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $12.16 a share three days away from its upcoming earnings release on May 4, 2023.Booking Holdings' Earnings ESP sits at 14.56%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $12.16 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.62.BKNG is one of just a large database of Retail-Wholesale stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Walmart (WMT).Walmart, which is readying to report earnings on May 18, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $1.30 a share, and WMT is 17 days out from its next earnings report.Walmart's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 0.28% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.30.Story continuesBKNG and WMT's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

The call will be archived at http://investors.mgmresorts.com1.""Adjusted EPS"" is diluted earnings or loss per share adjusted to exclude property transactions, net, foreign currency gain/loss related to MGM China's U.S. dollar-denominated debt, net gain/loss related to equity investments for which the Company has elected the fair value option of ASC 825 and equity investments accounted for under ASC 321 for which there is a readily determinable fair value and net gain/loss related to the Company's investments in debt securities, and mark-to-market adjustments related to MGP's unhedged interest rate swaps.Adjusted EPS is a non-GAAP measure and is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported GAAP measures because management believes this measure is useful in providing period-to-period comparisons of the results of the Company's continuing operations to assist investors in reviewing the Company's operating performance over time. Management believes that while certain items excluded from Adjusted EPS may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in evaluating the Company's earnings performance, it is useful to exclude such items when comparing current performance to prior periods because these items can vary significantly depending on specific underlying transactions or events. Also, management believes certain excluded items, and items further discussed in footnote 2 below, may not relate specifically to current operating trends or be indicative of future results. Adjusted EPS should not be construed as an alternative to GAAP earnings per share as an indicator of the Company's performance. In addition, Adjusted EPS may not be defined in the same manner by all companies and, as a result, may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures of other companies. A reconciliation of Adjusted EPS to diluted earnings per share can be found under ""Adjusted EPS"" included in this release.2.""Adjusted EBITDAR"" is earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening and start-up expenses, property transactions, net, rent expense related to triple-net operating leases and ground leases, and income from unconsolidated affiliates related to investments in real estate ventures.""Adjusted Property EBITDAR"" is the Company's reportable segment GAAP measure, which management utilizes as the primary profit measure for its reportable segments and underlying operating segments. Adjusted Property EBITDAR is a measure defined as earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening and start-up expenses, property transactions, net, rent expense related to triple-net operating leases and ground leases, income from unconsolidated affiliates related to investments in real estate ventures, and also excludes corporate expense and stock compensation expense, which are not allocated to each operating segment, and rent expense related to the master lease with MGP that eliminated in consolidation.""Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR"" is Adjusted Property EBITDAR further adjusted to exclude the Adjusted Property EBITDAR of acquired operating segments from the date of acquisition through the end of the reporting period and to exclude the Adjusted Property EBITDAR of disposed operating segments from the beginning of the reporting period through the date of disposition. Accordingly, for Las Vegas Strip Resorts, the Company has excluded the Adjusted Property EBITDAR of The Cosmopolitan for periods subsequent to its acquisition on May 17, 2022 and of The Mirage for the periods prior to its disposition on December 19, 2022, as applicable. For Regional Operations, the Company has excluded the Adjusted Property EBITDAR of Gold Strike Tunica for the periods prior to its disposition on February 15, 2023, as applicable.Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR is a non-GAAP measure and is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported GAAP measures because management believes this measure is useful in providing meaningful period-to-period comparisons of the results of the Company's operations for operating segments that were consolidated for the full period presented to assist users of the financial statements in reviewing operating performance over time. Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR should not be viewed as a measure of overall operating performance, considered in isolation, or as an alternative to the Company's reportable segment GAAP measure or net income, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, because this measure is not presented on a GAAP basis, and is provided for the limited purposes discussed herein. In addition, Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR may not be defined in the same manner by all companies and, as a result, may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures of other companies, and such differences may be material. A reconciliation of the Company's reportable segment Adjusted Property EBITDAR GAAP measure to Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR is included in the financial schedules in this release.Adjusted EBITDAR information is a non-GAAP measure that is a valuation metric, should not be used as an operating metric, and is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported GAAP measures because management believes this measure is widely used by analysts, lenders, financial institutions, and investors as a principal basis for the valuation of gaming companies. Management believes that while items excluded from Adjusted EBITDAR may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in evaluation of the Company's earnings performance, it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trends. Also, management believes excluded items may not relate specifically to current trends or be indicative of future results. For example, preopening and start-up expenses will be significantly different in periods when the Company is developing and constructing a major expansion project and will depend on where the current period lies within the development cycle, as well as the size and scope of the project(s). Property transactions, net includes normal recurring disposals, gains and losses on sales of assets related to specific assets within the Company's resorts, but also includes gains or losses on sales of an entire operating resort or a group of resorts and impairment charges on entire asset groups or investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which may not be comparable period over period. In addition, management excludes rent expense related to triple-net operating leases and ground leases. Management believes excluding rent expense related to triple-net operating leases and ground leases provides useful information to analysts, lenders, financial institutions, and investors when valuing the Company, as well as comparing the Company's results to other gaming companies, without regard to differences in capital structure and leasing arrangements since the operations of other gaming companies may or may not include triple-net operating leases or ground leases. However, as discussed herein, Adjusted EBITDAR should not be viewed as a measure of overall operating performance, an indicator of the Company's performance, considered in isolation, or construed as an alternative to operating income or net income, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, because this measure is not presented on a GAAP basis and excludes certain expenses, including the rent expense related to triple-net operating leases and ground leases, and is provided for the limited purposes discussed herein. In addition, other companies in the gaming and hospitality industries that report Adjusted EBITDAR may calculate Adjusted EBITDAR in a different manner and such differences may be material. The Company has significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, taxes, real estate triple-net lease and ground lease payments, and debt principal repayments, which are not reflected in Adjusted EBITDAR. A reconciliation of GAAP net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDAR is included in the financial schedules in this release.3. ""Free Cash Flow"" is net cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures.Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP measure and is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported GAAP measures because management believes this liquidity measure is useful in evaluating the ability of the Company's operations to generate cash for uses other than capital expenditures, and is used for decision-making purposes related to investments and returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases. Free Cash Flow should not be construed as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity. The Company's definition of Free Cash Flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that it does not deduct payments for debt service or other obligations and does not reflect the total movement of cash as detailed in the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows. In addition, Free Cash Flow may not be defined in the same manner by all companies and, as a result, may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures of other companies. A reconciliation of GAAP net cash provided by operating activities to Free Cash Flow is included in the financial schedules in this release.4.

My name is Paul, and I will be your operator. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder to all participants, this conference is being recorded. I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Jessica John, Vice President of Investor Relations, ESG and Corporate Communications. Ms. John, please proceed.Jessica JohnThank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our First Quarter 2023 Earnings and Business Update Call. I'm joined today by Frank Del Rio, President and Chief Executive Officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings; Harry Sommer, President and CEO elect of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings; and Mark Kempa, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, this conference call is being simultaneously webcast on the company's Investor Relations website at www.nclhltd.com/investors. We will also make reference to a slide presentation during this call, which may also be found on our Investor Relations website. Both the conference call and presentation will be available for replay for 30 days following today's call. Before we begin, I'd like to cover a few items. Our press release with first quarter 2023 results was issued this morning and is available on our Investor Relations website. This call includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from such statements. These statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statement contained in our earnings release. Our comments may also reference non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release and presentation. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Frank Del Rio. Frank?Story continuesFrank J. Del RioThank you, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Today marks a significant milestone for me as it is my 34th and final earnings call as President and CEO of this incredible company before my upcoming retirement, which was announced just over a month ago. In 2015, I was given the opportunity to lead Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings into its next chapter, one where we brought together 3 of the industry's leading brands Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises to form the best cruise operator in the industry. After 8 incredible years, it is now time for me to make way for the next generation of leaders who are ready and energized to take this company on to greater heights. Before getting to the crux of the call, I want to take a moment to thank all of Norwegian's team members around the globe, shipboard and shoreside who are the backbone of this company and who are the main driver of its success. I also want to express my sincere appreciation to our loyal guest, value travel partners, lenders, shipyards, investors, analysts and all of our stakeholders for your continued support and partnership over the years. I'm incredibly proud of what we have been able to collectively achieve especially over the past few extremely challenging years, but I know that the best days for this company still lie ahead, and I look forward to seeing what you all accomplish together. With Harry Sommer at the helm, I leave this company the most capable of hands. As Slide 5 shows, Harry has a broad range and depth of experience that makes him one of the premier executives in the industry. I have worked with Harry in various capacities over the course of 3 decades, and I can assure you that he is a strategic and innovative leader who has the right talent, skill set and energy to lead the company at this pivotal time in its history. As a long-standing cruise industry and company veteran, he brings both continuity and a fresh perspective to this seat. We have been working together along with our Board of Directors and the rest of the senior management team for some time now to ensure a seamless transition, and I am confident that NCLH will not skip a beat as we continue to push forward and capitalize on the momentum we are experiencing today. Now there are times when state makes circumstances and this happens to be one of those times as my departure coincide, not only with the 20th anniversary of the founding of Oceania Cruises, but also the delivery of the seventh ship in the Oceania fleet, the incomparable Vista, which you can see details about on Slide 6. With great pride, we took delivery of this amazing shift just last week, bringing NCLH's total fleet to 30 vessels with over 60,000 births. We are heading over to Europe this week where Vista will be christened in Malta by her Godmother, Emmy award-winning food personality Giada De Laurentiis. At 1,200 guests Vista is the first of 2 Allura Class ship for the line with the second ship named Allura expected in 2025. These ships will further elevate and cement Oceanics Cruises' leading position in the upper premium crew space. I have to thank our partners Fincantieri once again for bringing our vision to life and delivering a truly magnificent ship. What is even more exciting is that Vista is just the first of 3 newbuilds that we have in the pipeline this year with Norwegian Viva and Regent Seven Seas Grandeur joining the fleet later this year. New hardware introductions generate excitement from those new to cruise and new to brand as well as with our loyal pass guests. So 3 ships in 1 year will mean that much more of a halo effect for our company to leverage, given their very efficient financing structures made possible to the unique nature of the industry's interconnected financing ecosystem, new ships are able to contribute immediately and are expected to be meaningful drivers of the company's future earnings growth and margin expansion. So now I'll turn the call over to Harry, who will be tasked with delivering on the significant potential upside we see ahead to provide an update on the current environment and the key catalysts we have on the horizon. Harry?Harry J. SommerThank you, Frank. And before I get started, I have to say that I am honored and grateful to be given the opportunity to lead this iconic company. Growing up to integrate working-class parents in the Bronx I could never have dreamed to be at the helm of such a storied brand. But Frank, you took me under your wings early in my career and it taught me so much over the last 3 decades. I know I speak on behalf of the entire NCLH team when I say thank you, Frank, for your countless contributions not only to our company but also to the broader cruise industry. I look forward to building on this remarkable legacy, and I am committed to doing everything I can to best position this company for continued success. Over the next few months, I will be speaking with travel partners, team members, destination representatives, the investment community and a whole host of constituents while working closely with our executive team to fine tune our plan and vision for the future, and I look forward to sharing details with you. Shifting our attention to the backdrop that makes me so optimistic for what lies ahead. Slide 7 outlines our current positioning and the key catalysts we see now and on the horizon. We cover our leadership transition already, which could not have gone smoother. So I will skip ahead to what continues to be a healthy demand environment. Our target consumer remains resilient with a persistent desire for travel and experiences. Our booking window, which is our best forward-looking indicator remains strong. In fact, we were encouraged to see that even with the banking sector driven financial market volatility in March, we did not experience any unusual booking or cancellation activity across any of our brands. Our onboard revenue generation, which is our best real-time indicator of how consumers are feeling financially is also performing exceptionally well and we are even more pleased with the depth and breadth of the strength across revenue streams, ships and regions. During the quarter, gross onboard revenue per passenger cruise day was nearly 30% higher than the comparable 2019 period. This is driven in part by our focus on attracting the best guests and enhancing our market-leading bundled offering. We are also increasing quality touch points with our guests, starting with the time of booking to capture even more revenue and prepayment prior to cruise. Our presold revenue on a per passenger day basis for the first quarter of 2023 is approximately double the level in 2019, an important contributor to our onboard revenue strength as guests who make pre-cruise purchases tend to spend significantly more than guests who do not pre-book onboard activities. Turning to our next catalyst. We continue to take strategic actions across our business to improve operating efficiencies and rightsize our cost base to rebuild and enhance margins. The results of this initiative are ready to getting to bear fruit as demonstrated by our first quarter adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel per Capacity Day, which was not only 14% below the run rate in the second half of 2022, but also outperformed our guidance by $4 as certain savings were realized earlier than anticipated. We expect this metric to continue to show modest sequential improvement each quarter for the remainder of 2023 as seen on Slide 8. I want to stress that we recognize and acknowledge while this is a great start, we still have more work to do. This initiative is very much ongoing and will continue to be a top priority under my leadership. We are committed to identifying and evaluating incremental opportunities across every area of the business to help accelerate our margin recovery. This does not mean, however, that we will not continue to invest in our product or service offering to enhance our guest experience. But rather that we will be even more strategic and data-driven when making these decisions to ensure we are investing where we see the highest return and most impact. A good example of this is our recent announcement regarding the rollout of the Starlink low-latency broadband Internet system in a phased manner across our fleet. This was a strategic and cost-effective initiative to help address the consistent pain point we hear from guests regarding the reliability and speed of Internet connectivity at sea. This is one example of our focus on finding the right balance, which is critical to keeping our brands value propositions intact, maintain our incredibly loyal pass guest base and continually attract new cruisers to sail on a world-class fleet for what we believe is the best vacation experience in the world. The last catalyst to highlight is our industry-leading newbuild pipeline shown on Slide 9, which Frank already touched on briefly. Capacity growth in 2023 is expected to be just shy of 20% compared to 2019 as we add over 5,000 births to our world-class fleet. And as we look out over the next 5 years, this increases to approximately 50% growth versus 2019. All 3 of our brands are well poised to profitably absorb this elevated capacity growth given our relative size and under penetration in many markets around the world. We are focused on better leveraging our scale as we embark on this period of transformational growth and translating this capacity growth into outside benefits to both the top and bottom line. This makes for an attractive entry point for investors as the newbuild pipeline adds significant potential future earnings power compared to today's levels. When combined with our ongoing efforts to maximize profitability on our existing fleet, including by delivering consistent year-over-year moderate yield growth, we view this as a winning formula. Shifting our discussion now to our booking demand and pricing trends. You can see on Slide 10, we reached load factors of 101.5% in the first quarter, exceeding our guidance and breaking triple-digit levels for the first time in 3 years with some voyages exceeding occupancy of 115%. With this significant achievement, we have also nearly closed the occupancy gap versus 2019 levels. In the second quarter, we expect to average 105% occupancy, a return to normalized levels with cabins fully sold. This average is slightly below 2019 levels as a result of our strategic shift to longer, more immersive itineraries at the Norwegian Cruise Line brand naturally resulting in less thirds and fourths, which is what historically pushes passenger occupancy above the 100% mark, all while enhancing margin over time. Turning to Slide 11. After a very strong wave season, our cumulative book position for the balance of 2023 remains ahead of 2019's record performance and at higher prices. Demand and pricing continues to be strong, not only for 2023, but also as we look further out to sailings in 2024 and beyond. To give you an example, bookings for Regent's 2026 World Cruise were nearly 70% higher than its 2022 World Cruise, which was the last World Cruise launch pre-pandemic at an average price point of over $230,000 per suite. Another strong indicator that our product continues to resonate with our guests is the performance of NHCL's CruiseNext program, an onboard program in which we sell nonrefundable future cruise certificates. In the first quarter, CruiseNext achieved its highest quarterly results in the program's history surpassing the previous record. As we look to the remainder of the year, our substantial book position, coupled with the continued healthy demand metrics we are experiencing gives us confidence in achieving our 2023 Net Per Diem and net yield guidance, which Mark will touch on in more detail momentarily. Before I turn the call over, I'd like to provide an update on our decarbonization efforts as part of our global sustainability program, Sail &amp; Sustain, something that I'm very passionate about and committed to advancing. As shown on Slide 12, coinciding with Earth Day last week, we announced new short- and near-term greenhouse gas emission intensity reduction targets to help guide us on our pursuit of net zero by 2050. We are targeting a 10% reduction in GHG intensity by 2026 and 25% by 2030. The scope of these targets cover our direct emissions as well as the full well to wake impact of our fuel consumption. As we execute on this plan, we expect to see a dual benefit of not only emission reductions, but also cost savings from reduced fuel consumption. We also revamped our climate action strategy, which is now centered on 3 key pillars: efficiency, innovation and collaboration. We are implementing solutions for efficiency today, innovating for future solutions, including with our investments to modify 2 of our future newbuilds to create methanol ready configurations and are committed to collaborating with our stakeholders and partners along the way. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mark for his commentary on our financial position and outlook. Mark?Mark A. KempaThank you, Harry, and good morning, everyone. Before I dive into the financial results and outlook, I want to also thank Frank for all that he has done to propel this company forward as well as his outstanding leadership. I look forward to continuing to partner with Harry in his new role as we work to capitalize on the momentum we are experiencing in order to maximize value for all of our stakeholders. My commentary today will focus on our first quarter 2023 financial results, 2023 guidance and the progress on our financial recovery. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary on Net Per Diem, net yield and adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel per Capacity Day metrics, is on a constant currency basis. Slide 13 highlights our first quarter results in which we are pleased to report that we met or exceeded guidance for all key metrics. Focusing on the top line, total revenue per passenger cruise day in the quarter was up approximately 18% versus 2019. Net Per Diems increased approximately 7.7%, achieving the high end of guidance while net yield of 3.6% was a healthy beat versus our expectations as load factor of 101.5% came in well ahead of projections. With significantly higher participation as a result of enhancements to our bundled offerings today when compared to '19, the accounting allocation between ticket and onboard revenue has also changed, which can skew the comparison. Therefore, we focus on total Net Per Diem and net yield as a better holistic representation of our pricing power. Turning to costs. Adjusted net cruise costs, excluding fuel per Capacity Day averaged $161 in the quarter, better than expected and approximately 14% lower than the run rate in the second half of 2022. This reflects the rapid execution of cost savings initiatives identified and implemented last year, some of which were realized earlier than anticipated. This includes improvements in areas such as supply chain initiatives, back-office optimization as well as crew costs and travel expenses. Adjusted EBITDA was nearly $40 million higher than our guidance at approximately $234 million in the quarter. In addition, adjusted EPS loss of $0.30 also beat our guidance. Shifting our attention to guidance. Our outlook for the second quarter can be found on Slide 14. As we have stated previously, the second quarter will complete our occupancy ramp up. In addition, comparisons to 2019 includes certain premium priced Baltic and Cuba voyages in that year which we did not operate in 2023. As a result, growth is in line with our expectations with Net Per Diem increasing approximately 5.5% to 6.25% net yield expected to increase approximately 2.5% to 3.25%. Pricing and yields are both expected to increase in the second half of the year with the fourth quarter exhibiting the strongest growth versus 2019. This is driven by our organic pricing power and in part by a favorable comp as the second half of 2019 included various headwinds like the rapid exit from Cuba, and the close-in resale of those sailings. Fourth quarter is also expected to benefit from our strategic shift to premium deployments with extended Alaska and European seasons this year as well as a mix shift with more capacity operating for our Regent and Oceania brands. Given our robust book position for the second half of 2023, which is ahead of 2019, we have good visibility into the balance of the year, which gives us confidence that we can achieve the sequential improvement in year-over-year growth. Adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per Capacity Day is expected to be approximately $159 in the second quarter. A further improvement versus the prior quarter as additional savings initiatives are realized. We continue to expect modest sequential improvement each quarter in 2023 as occupancy increases and as a result of initiatives, which have already been identified and implemented. This should result in a lower run rate cost level exiting 2023 than our full year reported results. Taking all of this into account, adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter is expected to be approximately $485 million, which is roughly the same level as EBITDA in the same quarter of 2019. Another stepping stone to closing the gap versus pre-pandemic levels. I am also pleased to report that we expect to achieve another significant milestone in the quarter with adjusted EPS turning positive for the first time since the pandemic at approximately $0.25 per share. Now shifting our focus to our outlook for the full year 2023. Adjusted EBITDA is still expected to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $1.95 billion, with the high end of our targeted range, representing record adjusted EBITDA for the company. This is expected to translate to adjusted EPS of approximately $0.75 or $0.05 above our prior guidance, reflecting the first quarter outperformance partially offset by higher anticipated fuel costs and FX for the remainder of the year. Taking a closer look at the components of the full year outlook, Net Per Diem growth of approximately 9% to 10.5% as compared to 2019 and net yield growth guidance of approximately 5% to 6.5% are unchanged versus our prior guidance. Moving on to costs. Adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel per Capacity Day is expected to average approximately $159 for the full year, slightly better than our prior guidance and reflecting lower-than-expected costs in the first quarter. This represents a 15% decrease as compared to the average of $187 in the second half of 2022. As Harry noted, we continue to evaluate all opportunities to accelerate revenue and improve operating efficiencies and are taking deliberate actions to improve our margins, while maintaining the exceptional guest experience and superior service levels our brands are known for. We look forward to continuing to demonstrate this improvement over the coming quarters. Turning our attention to the balance sheet. Slide 15 provides our debt maturity profile, which includes approximately $800 million of scheduled debt service for the remainder of the year, the vast majority of which is related to our export credit agency-backed ship financing. We've talked previously about the actions taken earlier this year to address a large portion of our 2024 maturities so I won't go into further details today, but a summary is provided on Slide 16 for your reference. Since we last spoke, we also signed agreements to increase our ECA-backed commitments by approximately EUR 1.7 billion. This was primarily to finance improvements and modifications to newbuilds currently on order across our 3 brands. This includes the previously communicated changes to the last 4 Prima Class ships to make them up to 20% larger than the first generation ships as well as the addition of the methanol-ready configuration to the last 2 ships to increase optionality and help future-proof these long-life assets and reach our decarbonization goals. The financing also covers odor supplies associated with preparing certain newbuild center service as well as related financing premiums. While we originally plan to fund this with our organic cash flow generation when the ships were originally ordered, given the very efficient and supportive financing we received from export credit agencies and the continued uncertainty in the macro and financial markets, we felt financing this was a prudent action to minimize cash outflows for the next few years. Turning to liquidity. Our overall liquidity position remains strong at approximately $1.9 billion, as outlined on Slide 17. This consists of approximately $700 million of cash and cash equivalents, nearly $600 million of availability under our revolver and our $650 million undrawn commitment. This does not include the separate $300 million undrawn backstop commitment, which enhances our future liquidity, but is not currently available to drop. I want to reiterate our commitment and relentless focus on delivering value from all of our key stakeholders. We will continually evaluate options to accelerate our recovery, while maintaining adequate financial flexibility to adapt to different macroeconomic backdrops. Overall, we feel optimistic about the direction of our business, and we believe we are taking the right steps today to create a more nimble and resilient organization for the future. With that, I'll turn it back to Frank for closing comments.Frank J. Del RioThank you Mark. Before turning the call over to Q&amp;A, I'd like to leave you with some key takeaways, which you can find on Slide 18. First, we continue to see healthy and resilient demand from our target markets who remain willing and eager to spend on cruise vacation travel. Our brands continue to resonate with consumers as demonstrated by our book position and pricing for the remainder of '23. Our record book position also gives us high visibility into the back half of the year and beyond. Second, we are already starting to see the benefits of our margin enhancement efforts and we'll continue to take strategic measures to best position the company for its next chapter while ensuring that we keep the secret sauce that makes our brand so special fully intact. Third, we are excited to deliver on our industry-leading growth profile, which we are confident we can profitably absorb providing a meaningful boost to our future earnings power. And lastly, we feel comfortable with our liquidity position and are committed to prioritizing restoration of our balance sheet in the coming years. We've covered a lot today, so I'll conclude our commentary here and open up the call for your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions)Jessica JohnBefore we get to the questions on the line, we first want to address the top question from our online shareholder Q&amp;A platform, which provides all of our investors another avenue to submit and ask those questions from management. The top loaded question we received this quarter was what are the 3 main action points the company will take to ensure growth in the year ahead. Harry, do you want to take that one?Harry J. SommerSure, yes. Happy to, and that's a great question. We touched on this already in our prepared remarks, but we are laser-focused on delivering our '23 guidance and financial goals. One of the drivers of growth this year is going to be our robust newbuild platform with us taking delivery of 3 new and I might be biased, but I'm going to add absolutely magnificent ships this year, including the incredible Vista would start sailing tomorrow. Those ships, along with some of our other recent additions, translate to a nearly 20% growth in capacity when compared to 2019. So that's expected to provide a meaningful boost to our current and future earnings power. We're also hard at work at our ongoing margin enhancement initiative and are continuing to identify new and innovative ways to get more efficient while also delivering best-in-class product and service offerings for our guests. We're pleased with the results so far, but we're not stopping there, and we'll continue to leave no stone unturned. And lastly, we're going to continue to capitalize on the robust consumer demand we're experiencing, which is translating into our record book position and strong pricing, including very robust onboard revenue generation. So we feel good about our position over the next year, and we're going to do everything in our power to deliver on all our goals.Jessica JohnOperator, we can take the questions from the line now.OperatorOur first question is from Dan Politzer with Wells Fargo.Daniel Brian PolitzerFirst question on the second quarter, the yields. I mean, I think they were a little bit lower than we were expecting. So just any more detail there between maybe the gross and the net -- was there any noise in the quarter on the Free at Sea program? Also, I guess that would relate to the first quarter, but just trying to zoom in a little bit on first quarter versus second quarter and the change there.Mark A. KempaYes. Dan, this is Mark. So first and foremost, there is no change. Q2 pricing and yields are exactly in line with where we thought they were going to be. Of course, as your occupancy ramps up, you do see a little bit less of pricing power on your lower meta, i.e. inside cabins -- but overall, our NPDs remain very healthy and strong. And then secondly, I think the other piece to look at is when you do the comparison versus a very strong second quarter 2019 we're comping over some difficult comps with Cuba that we had back in 2019 as well as the full benefit of Baltic itinerary. So while on the surface, it may appear that there is -- it is a bit softer than Q1, I assure you it is exactly where we expect it to be. And as I said in my prepared remarks, the second half of 2023 is expected continue -- and we continue to expect very strong pricing and yield growth.Daniel Brian PolitzerGot it. And then on the cost side, the cost guidance, obviously, the first quarter was better. I guess to what extent should we accept that to continue to step down throughout the year? And how much is your guidance reflecting some conservatism there? I know that was a big part of the commentary last quarter just on the uncertain macro.Mark A. KempaYes. Sure. So let's address the cost side first. So we did overachieve in Q1. And as I had communicated and we had communicated on our last call, we were steadfastly going into a lot of our onboard -- our margin enhancement initiatives. And we simply executed some of those initiatives quicker than we had anticipated. So while we did get a benefit in Q1, it doesn't necessarily translate to a benefit in the outer quarters simply because we already had that baked into our guidance. That said, we have not stopped, and we continue to look at opportunities to improve our cost structure. So -- but it's a bit early for us to give additional color on that. All I can tell you is that we are razor-focused on that. And I think we'll continue to have a sequential improvement quarter-over-quarter. And I think I'm very confident. I think quite a bit of you were nervous last quarter, whether or not we could achieve our cost savings. And I think we've demonstrated that in Q1, we've demonstrated that in our full year updated guidance, and we will continue to push hard on that.OperatorOur next question is from Steve Wieczynski with Stifel.Steven Moyer WieczynskiSo I'm going to kind of ask Dan's question maybe a little bit differently. But Mark, if we look at Slide 13, I mean, look, you basically destroyed every guidance target that you laid out back in February for the first quarter. So if we think about that beat and the fact that you didn't really flow that through -- that full beat through to your full year EBITDA guidance. And look, I understand there's a fuel headwind there. But I guess what I'm just getting at here is, if your customer base stays pretty much status quo from here, it would seem to us that it would be tough not to get to the high end of your full year guidance and maybe even exceed the top end of your guidance. So what am I missing there, Mark?Mark A. KempaWell, Steve, first of all, I appreciate the adjective you used of destroyed our guidance, but I would like to say we healthily beat our guidance. Look, Steve, I think, first and foremost, we have to look at the underlying fundamentals of the business. Our NPD and yields continue to be strong, continue to be in line with our expectations. The consumer is still strong. The consumer is buying cruise tickets. The consumer is spending more on board. The consumer is prebuying more before they get on board and we're very pleased with that. So -- but if you just took Q1 in isolation and you said, okay, we beat the quarter by $0.15 and you look at the rest of the year, almost half of that is being eroded by fuel and FX headwinds. So the remainder of it, we are carrying through. So while we're not ready to necessarily change the rest of our guidance metrics, I think we're trending well, and we're trending healthy. And I think our guidance reflects that. So we said last quarter that we wanted to be prudent in terms of our guidance. We want to deliver and hopefully, beat. We'll continue down that path, but things are looking very, very healthy from our perspective in terms of the overall consumer demand for cruise.Steven Moyer WieczynskiAnd then, Mark, probably for you as well. If we go back to your initial guidance back in February, you noted that you turned the year, I think it was around 62% booked, which was in your historical range. And now as we've essentially exited Wave, can you maybe help us think about where you are booked now for '23 and then maybe also kind of give us a look at '24. And if you don't want to give exact numbers, I understand that, but maybe some qualitative commentary would be helpful there.Harry J. SommerSure. I'll take that one. And Steve, thank you for the kind words at the initial start of your question. We've stated before that our goal is to be between 60% and 65% booked at year-end for the following 12 months. I think that range applies to the end of Wave as well that we like to be between 60% to 65% booked for the following 12 months at the end of Wave. And I can say that we are hardly within that range pretty much exactly where we want to be. So we were very happy with the way Wave turned out and our book position both on the basis of itself and compared to 2019 is doing very well.OperatorOur next question is from Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research Company.Vince Charles CiepielI wanted to dig a little bit more into the regional setup. Can you discuss what you're seeing? I think first half of the year, your weighted a little heavier Caribbean, how pricing and close-in demand is looking for the region? And now that you've kind of moved through Wave and have more of Alaska in Europe for this summer filled out, kind of talk about how you're feeling about pricing for the summer?Harry J. SommerSure, Vince. It's Harry. I'll take that one, too. Listen, we were very pleased with the results in Q1. We're trying with our new premium itineraries to be booked a little further in advance so that close-in bookings does not represent such as large a percentage of our overall business as it used to. That being said, we were very pleasantly surprised with flows in demand for Caribbean in Q1. Of course, Caribbean doesn't matter all that much for us in Q2 and beyond as we shift our deployment to Europe and Alaska. So a little less close-in demand there as we are booked further in advance. But we're happy with both occupancy and price especially for the key summer period.Vince Charles CiepielGreat. And any color just on the cadence of bookings that you've seen year-to-date maybe relative to pre-COVID levels, I think that there was kind of the wave of pent-up demand following some change in COVID restrictions at the mid- to late part of last year. Obviously, it sounds like Wave has been healthy, but would you say things are stable, accelerating or decelerating kind of on a core basis when you adjust for those factors?Harry J. SommerLook, we have about a 20% increase in capacity for 2023 versus 2019. So of course, our bookings need to be 20% higher. And we've absolutely seen or exceeded those levels during Q1 booking period compared to Q1 of 2019. So I think the best indicator for us is our advanced passenger ticket sale revenue on our balance sheet is up, I think, 60% compared to the end of Q1 '19, which I think gives you a very robust indicator of how our book position looks.OperatorOur next question is from Brandt Montour with Barclays.Brandt Antoine MontourMy first question is on the cost side. Mark, you sort of gave us a quick update and sort of sequential improvement on a dollar basis throughout the year. And I'm just trying to -- and obviously, if we try and back into what's implied for the full year, it would seem like it's very modest improvement, almost flattish from a pretty high level. And I'm just trying to reconcile that with the seasonality that we used to see in your business with the 3Q costs usually being pretty elevated given more exotic itineraries. Can you kind of help us understand why that's different now?Mark A. KempaYes, Brandt. So I think what you have to think about is look at our newbuild deliveries that we're taking this year as well. So we are taking deliveries of ships obviously now in the second quarter. We'll be taking delivery of a ship in the third quarter and fourth quarter. And what's unique about that in the third and fourth quarter, obviously, we're taking -- we have a higher -- we have the higher operating cost brands of Oceania and Regent. So that does somewhat elevate your unit cost, although we do receive benefit on both the top and bottom lines from that. So I wouldn't skew too much that the premium itineraries are going to be a big driver of cost.Overall, our cost levels tend to remain the same. It's really around our promotions and advertising variable costs that would have a need to sort of influence. So Look, I think bottom line, we continue to sequentially improve our cost structure. I said last quarter, we need to do a better job of leveraging our scale. We're on that journey. We've hopefully demonstrated confidence to the market that we've achieved step 1 of that, and we'll continue to optimize around that. And hopefully, over the next few quarters, we can continue to prove that and further build confidence that we're leveraging our scale to the best of our ability.Brandt Antoine MontourAnd then just as a follow-up, great to hear that you guys are happy with your book for the all-important sort of summer in the Mediterranean. I'm just curious if flight prices broadly is acting as a headwind? And if you think about your book or your strategy this year for the summer, is it -- is flight prices being bundled in for the consumer? Is that sort of more -- is that more of a factor now than it was in '19? And how should we think about that?Mark A. KempaYes. Brandt, I think you've hit it, right? We've all experienced whether it's traveling for business or consumers traveling, flight prices are elevated. And of course, with our bundling strategy that we've embarked on over the last few years, and that's really taking full throttle in 2023, that does have some headwinds to our overall net yield. And that simply is a matter of when we sell the ticket to the consumer, we sell the air at what we believe are going to be the best projected prices. And our consumers are booking very far out in advance, which is a good thing. So there's always going to be some puts and takes until when you actually purchase the flight where you may have some variability in there. But overall, we believe that our air strategy is the right thing to do given our strategic itinerary deployment. And there's always going to be some variability in there, but nothing that overly concerns us.Harry J. SommerYes. I just want to add to Mark's comment that our guests have to fly to get to a cruise. And there's 2 choices. They either make their own air agents or they make our air agents through us -- and of course, as we buy air tickets for over 1 million guests a year, we have some really good systems and efficiencies to leverage the best prices out there. We use all types of tools in terms of automation, even AI to predict when the best time to book a flight is. And with those tools, we think bundling actually provides us in this uncertain future environment, a competitive advantage. So something that absolutely it impacts us. But if we do it right, we can turn it to our benefit.OperatorOur next question is from Conor Cunningham with Melius Research.Conor T. CunninghamJust on the second half, Net Per Diem, it's implied a decent step-up in the second half. Just trying to get comfortable with how you get there. So are you basically booked above that right now? And then as you get closer in the trends kind of softened a little bit? And just any color on how you're expecting onboard trends in the second half would be helpful.Mark A. KempaYes. So regarding our second half NPDs, I think we labeled that on our slide. We're expecting roughly 11% or 12%, if I recall correctly. And number one, that's on the back of very strong just good old-fashioned core growth. It's also on the back of bringing on some of our premium brand vessels. But more importantly, when you look at the comparisons in the back half of 2019 we're rolling over much easier comparisons. It's the inverse of what's happening in the first half versus 2019. Again, we had to rapidly exit Cuba in, I believe, June or July 2019. And we had to sell those voyages close-in for very efficient pricing. And then, of course, as you look at the brand mix, that's also a tailwind. But also in Q4 where we expect quite a substantial amount of our pricing power. We are actually in the Alaska season longer this year as well as in the European season longer this year. And I think -- it's somewhere in the neighborhood of we have 3% more deployment in Q4 of Alaska and I believe, 7% deployment -- more deployment in Europe for Q4. So when you combine all those factors together, that's what gives us good -- great confidence in where our pricing is. And I think the tail end of your question was whether or not we're booked there currently. Look, we're on our book position. Harry touched on it earlier. We're exactly where we need to be to hit our goals and our guidance. So I won't give too much color on that, but other than we're exactly in a position where we need to be.Conor T. CunninghamOkay. That's helpful. And then on the shift to longer cruises and more immersive cruises, the 3-point gap in overall occupancy, is that basically reflective of that change in the second quarter? And then I'm just trying to figure out the limits to a rebuild in occupancy into 2024, assuming no change to your footprint overall?Harry J. SommerSo in terms of 2024, I'll take the second part of your question first. Listen, I think there's still a little rebuilding that can be done in Q1. So I think Q2 to Q4 basically represents what we're going to see in future periods as well. But Q1 finished up at 101.5%. We can do better than that. Going forward, when we have the more advanced lead time we need with some of our exotic itineraries and also have the fully over the -- overhang of the difficult years that we talked about before end. In terms of this gap of 3%, does that reflect what we're going forward pretty much close to that after the Q1 commentary I gave you already. we think this shift to premium itineraries primarily Europe and Alaska, but a little bit in Asia as well, allows us to get the type of customer that we need to get to support our revenue goals and our revenue growth for the future.OperatorOur next question is from Stephen Grambling with Morgan Stanley.Stephen White GramblingFollowing up on the strategic shift to longer, more immersive itineraries, should we be thinking about any other financial ramifications of this shift other than the occupancy. I mean is there any net cruise cost changes or net yield changes that we should be thinking through?Harry J. SommerI just want to comment that when Frank goes on cruises in retirement, he doesn't pay, so he won't be contributing to that cruise number you saw earlier, but I'll turn it over to Mark to talk about financial ramifications.Mark A. KempaSteve. So I would actually rephrase that as financial benefits. Obviously, while there is a slight impact to load factor, the whole reason we're going to more longer premium itinerary intensive destinations is, number one, to get a better guest, to get higher pricing and to maximize the value that we're getting out of each of our assets. So while there's always a both sides of the coin. Overall, the economics on going to those itineraries obviously favors the company or we would not be doing that. But so I wouldn't get caught up too much on the slight impact to occupancy.Stephen White GramblingGot it. That's helpful. And then changing gears a little bit. Can you just remind us of how much of your new ship spend is already financed and locked in as we think about rates? And have you seen any impact to export credit rates given the broader credit crunch?Mark A. KempaSo all of our newbuild orders, I'll remind everybody that we do not execute any newbuild orders without committed financing. That is just a complete no-no in our organization. So we have very efficient fixed rate financing for all of our newbuilds that are on schedule to delivery through 2028 at an average rate of anywhere from 2% to 2.5%. There is no opportunity for the export credit agencies to change those rates. As I said, those are fixed. So we have very efficient financing going forward. And I see no risk around that because there's just simply not an opportunity for the (inaudible) to do that.OperatorOur next question is from Robin Farley with UBS.Robin Margaret FarleyI had a question if we could circle back just for a moment to the occupancy in Q2. A quarter ago, you talked about it returning to historic occupancy levels and you're talking today about some of the shoulder period itineraries are being expanded. And so with the change since last reported, was it just sort of a decision to say, hey, we're happy with the pricing that we're getting? And so we're going to -- occupancy may not be coming in exactly what we thought, but it makes more sense to hold price for those? Just trying to think about because I think the itineraries themselves didn't change since you last reported. So just kind of wondering if it was -- what it was in the yield management that approach has changed?And then my other question is just on the $1.7 billion in additional ECA financing. I know the $1.2 billion are for those ships that are a couple of years out. Is the additional EUR 500 million, is that for 2023 specifically? Or is that spread out over different years?Harry J. SommerSo Robin, this is Harry. I'll take the first half, and I'll let Mark discuss the ECA financing. Listen, in Q2, in all future quarters, our focus now is in having our cabins as close to 100% full as possible. So I can definitively say that in Q2, we will be at or ahead of our Q2 cabin load occupancy across the entire fleet to get the passenger load occupancy is a function of what we talked before, having less third and fourth guests on board. But as Mark just discussed, we believe over time, this actually is going to be EBITDA and margin accretive. So we're very happy with that strategy.Mark A. KempaYes. And Robin, just to add to that, we did try to communicate last quarter and over the course of many investor meetings that when we said historical occupancies, we didn't say that they were going to be exactly the same. We said we expected them to be within a couple of points, especially on the overall year run rate. So I just want to point out that, that's not necessarily a change from last quarter. In terms of the export credit agency financing, yes, so we obtained financing for EUR 1.7 billion. And in our last earnings release, we had called out that we had increased our contractual commitments by EUR 1.2 billion. And the differential simply is, as I said in my prepared remarks, we've now included certain things, financing for owner supply and other related items that are required as part of the ship delivery. And the thought process there was, it is very efficient and very extremely beneficial financing. So in order to preserve cash for the long term at very -- and given the very efficient rates, we simply decided to finance more. So it does not represent a further $0.5 billion increase in the overall ship cost. It is simply a different mechanism for financing some of the existing costs that were already expected. And I think that's why when you look at our capital commitments on our newbuilds for the next 3 years, it's actually decreased overall in terms of cash out of the system.Robin Margaret FarleyOut of the -- it's definitely favorable terms and the fact that they're willing to finance that additional EUR 500 million, absolutely a positive. I was just wondering if that $500 million was for 2023? Or is that for the later deliveries that the $1.2 billion applies to? Or is it spread out over a number of deliveries between the...Mark A. KempaIt's really spread out over the course of the next 3 to 5 -- it's spread out -- I don't want to say ratably, but relatively ratably across all of the remaining newbuilds excluding Norwegian Viva and Vista, which we just took delivery of, of course.Frank J. Del RioPaul, I think we have time for one more question.OperatorOur next question is from Patrick Scholes with Truist Securities.Charles Patrick ScholesMy questions are for Mark. The last time we spoke regarding the debt maturities, the intention was to use cash flow from operations this year to pay off the ECA -- the existing ECA loans? And then secondly, if I had my notes correctly, for the $1.4 billion term loan, it's going to be either pushed out or amend and extended -- is that still the intention? And did I get that correct?Mark A. KempaSo definitely, we are funding all of our existing debt maturities this year from cash on hand and organic cash flow. So you're spot on there. And then the $1.4 billion of term loan and revolver that was extended to January 2025, we will address that -- start addressing that later this year. And whether or not we refinance that on a more holistic approach or we do another amend and extend. Obviously, we'll look at what the markets are doing, what the what the environment looks like, but we'll do the most -- obviously, the most economically feasible option out there. So that's something that you'll see us out in the marketplace in the latter part of this year.Charles Patrick ScholesAnd then just a related follow-up question. Mark, over the past year, you've given some longer-term net debt-to-EBITDA target ratios for various years. Are you still -- do you see yourself still on track to hit those targets?Mark A. KempaYes, Patrick, we're firing on all cylinders. As I've said internally, our target is to turn 2023 with a very high 5 handle on a pro forma run rate leverage basis. Now that's not a necessarily easy task, but that's one of the things we're marching to as a management team and, of course, with our Board of Directors. And that's going to come on the back of, again, strong pricing and yield growth, which we've talked about as well as rightsizing our cost base and leveraging our scale. So we are marching towards that. There's never a guarantee, but that is what we're rallying around. And we hope to deliver on that, and we're feeling good with what the outlook looks like today.Frank J. Del RioWell, ladies and gentlemen, once again, I want to thank everyone on this call, whether you're a travel partner, a vendor, a lender or an analyst you've supported us, you've challenged us, but most of all, you've made us better. Personally, I couldn't have asked for a more fulfilling and more successful career in this incredible industry and everyone here contributed to that. Now for one last time, thank you for your interest and your support. I have full confidence in the management team and their ability to take this company on to its next chapter. Harry, Mark and Jessica and the team will be available to answer any questions you may have once this call is over. Have a great day. Stay safe and all the best. Thank you once again. Bye-bye.OperatorThis concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.]"

Photo Credit: Bryan S/Flickr Bryan S / flickrNorwegian Cruise Line Holdings experienced onboard passenger spending higher than its 2019 level in the first quarter of 2023, executives said during a Monday earnings call.Overall, revenue for the company was $1.8 billion in the first quarter, up from $521.9 million for the same quarter in 2022. Even so, Norwegian still had a GAAP net loss of $159.3 million. Adjusted EBITDA amounted to $23 million.Harry J. Sommer’s, CEO and president of the Norwegian Cruise Line brand, led the earnings call for the first time as he prepares to take over for retiring Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings CEO and president Frank J. Del Rio. Sommer will officially be at the helm on July 31.During the company’s first quarter, gross onboard revenue per passenger cruise day was nearly 30 percent higher than its comparable period in 2019. Sommer attributed this to Norwegian’s focus on attracting more higher-spending guests, enhancing its bundled offering and increased guest touch points, starting at the time of booking to capture more revenue and prepayment prior to cabin selection. Guests who made pre-cruise purchases helped drive onboard spending because this group tends to spend more onboard compared to those who don’t make pre-cruise purchases.Total revenue per passenger cruise day rose 17.5 percent from the similar 2019 period. Advance ticket sales were a record $3.4 billion, up 26 percent from the prior quarter and 60 percent from the first quarter of 2019.The booking window remained strong for the quarter despite the volatility in the banking sector in March, as there was no unusual cancellation levels across Norwegian brands, Norwegian executives said.Bookings for the remainder of 2023 continue to be at record levels and at higher pricing. “Demand and pricing continues to be strong, not only for 2023, but also as we look further out to sailings in 2024 and beyond,” said Sommer.In the quarter, occupancy improved by 101.5 percent over the previous quarter, but was still below the 2019 level.

MET, American International Group Inc. AIG, Prudential Financial Inc. PRU, CNO Financial Group CNO and Kemper Corp. KMPR.Industry: Insurance - MultilineLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2087026/5-stocks-to-watch-from-the-thriving-multiline-insurance-industryProduct diversification helps Zacks Multiline Insurance industry players to lower concentration risk, ensure uninterrupted revenue generation and improve retention ratio. Better pricing, prudent underwriting, increased exposure, faster economic recovery on the receding impact of the pandemic and increased vaccinations should benefit MetLife Inc., American International Group Inc., Prudential Financial Inc., CNO Financial Group and Kemper Corp. Accelerated digitalization will help in the smooth functioning of the industry.The solid capital level of the multiline insurers will fuel merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activities. With one rate hike already this year and more to come in the future, investment income should improve further as insurers are beneficiaries of a rising rate environment.About the IndustryThe Zacks Multiline Insurance industry comprises companies that provide single insurance coverage, bundling automobile, homeowner, long-term care, life and health insurance to individuals and businesses. The insured pays a single premium and is covered for many things through a single contract.These companies cover commercial and personal properties, automobiles, marine, livestock, aviation, personal accident, life, including permanent and term insurance, supplemental accident and health insurance, workers’ compensation, annuity products, private mortgage insurance, et al. The industry participants also provide risk management services. Since the companies offer single insurance coverage for multiple products, customer retention improves. The insured stands to benefit from lower premium payment compared to paying individual premiums for insuring varied products.Story continues3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Multiline Insurance IndustryDiversified portfolio lowers concentration risk: Given the nature of the business, multiline insurers’ product and service portfolios are diversified. This lowers concentration risk. Increased awareness, driving higher demand for protection products, should benefit sales and premiums for life insurance operations. Continued improvement in pricing and an increase in exposure should support premium growth.Also, per Deloitte Insights, the transition to green energy and related insurance products, as well as exposure to intangible assets, offers growth opportunities. Per Deloitte Insights, life insurance premium is estimated to increase 1.9% in 2023 while non-life premiums are expected to increase 2.2%. The report also stated that trends like commercial lines witnessing growth at a faster pace than personal lines and homeowners’ premiums improving at a better rate than personal auto are likely to continue in 2023.Merger and acquisitions: Consolidation in the multi-line insurance industry is expected to continue as players look to diversify their operations into new business lines and geographies. Buying businesses along the same lines is driven by the players’ need to gain a fair market share and grow in their niche areas. However, with high inflation and a rise in interest rate (the Fed has already made one rate hike this year), momentum in the M&amp;A environment is likely to slow down. The first half of 2022 witnessed 427 deals per Deloitte.Increased adoption of technology: Digitalization has increased by leaps and bounds, especially amid pandemic-induced restrictions. The industry is witnessing greater use of technology like blockchain, AI, advanced analytics, telematics, cloud computing and robotic process automation to expedite business operations and save costs.Many life insurers have started selling policies online that appeal to the tech-savvy population. At the same time, the use of real-time data is making premium calculation easier and reducing risk. The P&amp;C industry, in particular, also witnessed the emergence of insurtech — technology-led insurers — sparking competition for incumbent players.Insurers remain focused on ramping up data and analytics capabilities as well as realizing the benefit of the technological infrastructure per Deloitte Insights. Moreover, the adoption of technology has helped in seamless underwriting and claims processing. However, the adoption of technology comes with the risk of cyber threats.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates solid prospects in the near term. The Zacks Multiline Insurance industry, housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #115, which places it in the top 46% of 255 Zacks industries.

Stock selection drove the fund to underperform in the quarter.

One-month return of Gartner, Inc. (NYSE:IT) was -2.06%, and its shares gained 9.42% of their value over the last 52 weeks. Gartner, Inc. (NYSE:IT) has a market capitalization of $24.352 billion.Baron Asset Fund made the following comment about Gartner, Inc. (NYSE:IT) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“After meaningfully increasing last year, shares of Gartner, Inc. (NYSE:IT), a provider of syndicated research primarily on the IT sector, ceded some gains in the quarter. Gartner’s business conditions have likely softened modestly, as the company’s technology vendor customer base has been negatively impacted by layoffs and cost reductions across that sector. Despite this headwind, Gartner is generating attractive double-digit growth in its largely recurring research business. We believe Gartner should benefit from the ongoing ubiquity and complexity of technology facing nearly all types of businesses. We expect sustained revenue growth and renewed focus on cost control to drive margin expansion and enhanced free-cash-flow generation. The company’s balance sheet is in excellent shape and can support ongoing repurchases and potential bolt-on acquisitions, in our view.”Story continuesMajor Retailers and Services That Accept Bitcoin in 2018alphaspirit/Shutterstock.comGartner, Inc.

We provide these measures to enhance the user’s overall understanding of the Company’s current financial performance and the Company’s prospects for the future. Investors are cautioned that these non-GAAP financial measures may not be defined in the same manner by other companies and, as a result, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. Also, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as alternatives, or superior, to other measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures used in this Press Release are defined below.Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin: Represents GAAP net income (loss) adjusted for: (i) interest expense, net; (ii) tax provision (benefit); (iii) gain on event cancellation insurance claims, as applicable; (iv) gain/loss on divestitures, as applicable; (v) other (income) expense, net; (vi) stock-based compensation expense; (vii) depreciation, amortization, and accretion; (viii) loss on impairment of lease related assets, as applicable; and (ix) acquisition and integration charges and certain other non-recurring items. Adjusted EBITDA Margin represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by GAAP Revenue. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are important measures of our recurring operations as they exclude items not representative of our core operating results.Adjusted Net Income: Represents GAAP net income (loss) adjusted for the impact of certain items directly related to acquisitions and other non-recurring items. These adjustments include: (i) the amortization of acquired intangibles; (ii) acquisition and integration charges and other non-recurring items; (iii) gain on event cancellation insurance claims, as applicable; (iv) gain/loss on divestitures, as applicable; (v) loss on impairment of lease related assets, as applicable; (vi) the non-cash (gain) loss on de-designated interest rate swaps, as applicable; and (vii) the related tax effect. We believe Adjusted Net Income is an important measure of our recurring operations as it excludes items that may not be indicative of our core operating results.Adjusted EPS: Represents GAAP diluted EPS adjusted for the impact of certain items directly related to acquisitions and other non-recurring items. These adjustments include on a per share basis: (i) the amortization of acquired intangibles; (ii) acquisition and integration charges and other non-recurring items; (iii) gain on event cancellation insurance claims, as applicable; (iv) gain/loss on divestitures, as applicable; (v) loss on impairment of lease related assets, as applicable; (vi) the non-cash (gain) loss on de-designated interest rate swaps, as applicable; and (vii) the related tax effect. We believe Adjusted EPS is an important measure of our recurring operations as it excludes items that may not be indicative of our core operating results.Free Cash Flow: Represents cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP less payments for capital expenditures. We believe Free Cash Flow is an important measure of the recurring cash generated by the Company’s core operations that may be available to be used to repay debt obligations, repurchase our stock, invest in future growth through new business development activities, or make acquisitions.Foreign Currency Neutral (FX Neutral): We provide foreign currency neutral dollar amounts and percentages for our contract values, revenues, certain expenses, and other metrics. These foreign currency neutral dollar amounts and percentages eliminate the effects of exchange rate fluctuations and thus provide a more accurate and meaningful trend in the underlying data being measured. We calculate foreign currency neutral dollar amounts by converting the underlying amounts in local currency for different periods into U.S. dollars by applying the same foreign exchange rates to all periods presented.SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION - NON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONSThe tables below provide reconciliations of certain Non-GAAP financial measures used in this Press Release with the most directly comparable GAAP measure.

48,160b975c-13d7-36e2-a2c1-43ffdce285b9,O,2023-05-02,16 Biggest Offshore Oil Rig Companies in the U.S.,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/16-biggest-offshore-oil-rig-105011636.html,1683024611,STORY,"['CL=F', 'HAL', 'NBR', 'FLR', 'RIG', 'SLB', 'PXD']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 16 biggest offshore oil rig companies in the U.S. For more companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Offshore Oil Rig Companies in the U.S. The energy industry is one of the biggest sectors in the world and one which came under renewed spotlight last year - both in the U.S. and globally. This was due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine which upended global energy markets and caused prices to skyrocket, leading to inflation and high costs of doing business and living. At the same time, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) also reduced oil output as it feared a crash in prices due to reduced global economic activity.Fast forward to 2023 and there is still some uncertainty in the oil market. A report from the International Energy Agency (IEA) believes that oil demand will rise to a record high of 101.9 million barrels per day by the end of this year - climbing by two million barrels. Fueling this growth will be China, where economic reopening and return to normalcy is expected to contribute to 90% of the demand growth. Oil production as of March 2023 is below this upbeat demand trajectory, though, with OPEC and non-OPEC countries producing 44.17 million barrels per day. Almost one fourth of this output is from Saudi Arabia, with Russia being the second largest producer through its 9.58 million barrels of output. Crucially, Russian oil exports soared in March too, as oil shipments jumped to 8.1 million barrels per day to touch levels seen before the brutal Ukraine invasion. However, Russia is not earning as much from its exports as it previously did, with oil revenues dropping to $12.7 billion, or by 43% from the previous year.At the same time, OPEC's latest supply cuts that were announced in April 2023 have created a new market for U.S. and non OPEC oil. According to the IEA, while global oil production growth is expected to drop by 1.2 million barrels per day this year, non-OPEC+ production, originating largely from the U.S. and Brazil is expected to grow by 1.9 million barrels. However, even as America boosts its oil production, it is unlikely that the output will soar back to cross levels seen before the coronavirus pandemic. According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), U.S. oil production stood at 11.7 million barrels in 2022 and is expected to rise to 12.4 million barrels this year. However, while the government agency believes that this will ""surpass the record high set in 2019"" the chief executive officer of Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) Mr. Scott Sheffield believes that this will not surpass the 2019 record high of 13 million barrels in November of that year. Some reasons behind this, according to the CEO, are an under capacity in the oil refining market and a tendency for oil firms to be cash flow friendly. The executive also believes that it is possible for levels to cross 13 million barrels per day, but it's a slow process that can take years.Story continuesBuilding on this, almost half U.S. oil is produced in Texas, with New Mexico and North Dakota also accounting for large percentages. The largest U.S. oil production site is the Permian Basin, and America has also drilled for oil on the Pacific Coast, the Atlantic Coast, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Great Lakes. However currently, the Gulf of Mexico is the predominant player in U.S. offshore oil production, and according to the EIA, the region accounts for 15.3% of the total American oil output. Offshore drilling is done primarily through oil rigs, with several large firms such as Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) and Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) being not only the biggest offshore oil companies in America but also in the world.In terms of monetary value, the global offshore oil production market is estimated to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.7% between 2023 and 2030, or from $36 billion to $66 billion. Asia Pacific is by far the largest segment of the market, as the growing economies of India and China will boost the demand for locally available oil.  This growth rate is also matched by the estimates for offshore oil rigs, as research from Straits Research points out that the offshore drilling rigs market will grow from $96 billion in 2021 to $176 billion by 2028 at a CAGR of 8.61%. Finally, the Gulf of Mexico oil and gas market should grow at a CAGR 4.5% through 2028 according to Mordor Intelligence. The latest bid for oil and gas leases in the Gulf took place in March 2023 when giants such as Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP) participated in a $264 million bid for drilling rights.Taking stock of the situation on the ground, the management of Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) shared updates during the firm's earnings conference for the fourth quarter of 2022 when they outlined:Second, there is a greater sense of urgency around energy security. This is resulting in new investment in capacity expansion and diversity of supply. You will see this reflected in the number of new projects sanctioned, gas supply agreements signed and the return of offshore exploration, all at a pace unforeseen just 18 months ago. And third, the secular trends of digital and decarbonization are set to accelerate, driven by significant digital technology advancement in cloud and AI, favorable government policy support in New Energy investments and increased spending on low carbon initiatives by operator globally. Underpinning everything, commodity price remained at supportive levels for durable investment. In North America, spending growth is expected to be more restrained after an exceptionally strong year in 2022.Capital spending growth is expected to increase in the high teens as rig counts potentially approach a plateau. Public companies, particularly the majors, are expected to increase short-cycle spending in key U.S. land basins and drilling activity remain strong to build up well inventory and support target production increase. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, where we have a significant presence, we expect the strong spending uplift to continue. Turning to international, markets are poised for strong growth in the Middle East and Latin America geographically, and more broadly, in offshore and in gas. In the Middle East, we expect record levels of upstream investments, with a ramp-up in various capacity expansion projects designed to deliver more gas production and a combined oil increment of 4 million barrels per day through 2030.Offshore activity will continue to strengthen as tiebacks and new development projects mobilize and new FID's are sanctioned, while Russian activity is expected to contract. Excluding Russia, customers' capital spending internationally is expected to increase in the mid-teens. The combination of long-cycle oil capacity expansion projects, offshore deepwater resurgence and strong gas development activity will be a key driver for the multiyear duration of this cycle.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the biggest offshore companies in the U.S., out of which the top picks are Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL), Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB), and Baker Hughes Company (NASDAQ:BKR).16 Biggest Offshore Oil Rig Companies in the U.S.marchello74 / shutterstock.comOur Methodology To compile our list of the biggest offshore companies in America, we first listed all firms with offshore platforms in the world.

During this time, Saudi Arabian oil imports stood at 671,000 bpd, while those from Iraq at 812,000.Sourcing cheap crude oil is of utmost importance to India, particularly since the disruptions caused in the global supply chain by the Ukraine war since last year. The country imports 80% of its oil needs. Cheap supplies from Russia, therefore, helped it to fight energy inflation.In fiscal 2023, Russia became India’s fifth-largest trading partner with $41.5 billion of imports. In 2020-21, the figure stood at $5.4 billion, India’s commerce ministry data show.China is competing with India for Russian crudeIn May, Russia’s overall crude exports are likely to remain steady as China also competes for it, according to Vortexa analyst Serena Huang.Prices of Russian Urals have risen above the $60 price cap set by the G7 nations following the Ukraine invasion. This has led private Indian refiners like Reliance and Nayara Energy to scramble against China for Russia’s light variant ESPO blend, Reuters reported in March.This light variant is still cheaper than the ones from its Gulf suppliers. For instance, Murban crude from the UAE, which has a similar quality to the diesel-rich ESPO blend, is about $9-a-barrel more expensive.India is, therefore, walking the sanctions minefield, even as it seeks the “best deal,” according to finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman. “For us, it (Russian oil) is a very critical input for the economy,” she has said.Story continuesMore from QuartzThe world’s biggest banknote printer said the demand for cash hit a two-decade lowWhat were the world's busiest airports in 2022?Sign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

The OPEC member, which has been under U.S. sanctions since 2018, pumped 2.4 million bpd on average in 2021.The market shrugged off news that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' output fell in April, as sanctioned countries Russia and Iran continued to find outlets for their crude.Meanwhile, U.S. crude stockpiles were forecast to have drawn down for a third week in a row for the first time since December, falling some 1.1 million barrels last week, according to analysts in a Reuters poll.

China’s manufacturing sector - considered a bellwether for the economy - slipped back into contraction territory in April.The weak data, coupled with fears of rising interest rates and worsening economic growth, ramped up concerns that crude demand may not be as strong in 2023 as initially expected. This notion also battered oil markets over the past two weeks.Brent oil futures fell 0.1% to $79.30 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures were flat at $75.65 a barrel by 21:14 ET (01:14 GMT). Both contracts settled lower after a volatile session on Monday.Focus is now squarely on the conclusion of a Fed meeting on Wednesday. While a rate hike is largely priced in, markets are uncertain whether the central bank will signal an end to its rate hike cycle, given that it has offered no indication that it plans to pause.Key indicators on the U.S. labor market, particularly nonfarm payrolls data for April, are also on tap this week, and are largely expected to factor into the Fed’s future decisions on interest rates.Concerns over slowing demand have been a major weight on oil prices in recent weeks, as weak data and renewed ructions in the banking sector fueled increased fears of a global economic slowdown this year. The dollar also firmed ahead of the Fed meeting, further pressuring crude markets.This saw oil prices completely reverse strong gains made on the back of a surprise production cut by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies (OPEC+) in early-April.Story continuesThe European Central Bank is expected to follow the Fed’s example in hiking rates later this week, heralding tighter monetary conditions.Still, crude supply is expected to tighten in the coming weeks, especially as the OPEC+ cut goes into effect, and as U.S. consumption improves amid better weather.Related ArticlesOil moves little as markets await more Fed cuesOil holds steady as economic fears weigh against potential crude drawGold pinned below $2,000 as Fed jitters offset safe haven appeal]"

It reported a record $2.8 billion profit last year and could be valued at $13 billion.A Citgo spokesperson declined to comment.The Treasury, which has blocked transactions involving Venezuela's U.S. assets, ""will not take enforcement action"" to halt the auction or a negotiated settlement, the Justice Department wrote in a letter filed on Friday in U.S. District Court in Delaware. The Treasury would have to issue a license to complete any sale.The decision and a separate Treasury approval recognizing opposition political alliance Unitary Platform is ""handing over the Venezuelan company Citgo to some people from the opposition, from the Unitary Platform,"" Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said on Monday.""We reject and condemn the robbery of Citgo by the United States and the Unitary Platform,"" he said, calling the license ""an unworthy resolution ... a direct message of surrender.""Robert Pincus, a court-appointed official who met with the Justice Department and Treasury, urged the court to move quickly ""to take advantage of CITGO’s recent financial and operational performance and the current state of the refining industry ...""Story continuesCanadian miner Crystallex International has a $970 million claim against PDV Holding that spawned the proposed court auction.A representative for Crystallex declined to comment.Other creditors with at least $2.6 billion in claims against Venezuela have received conditional approvals to join the case.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $821.06 million.

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Flowserve: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future.

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Flowserve The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$219.0mUS$254.1mUS$309.8mUS$323.5mUS$334.6mUS$344.6mUS$354.1mUS$363.0mUS$371.7mUS$380.3mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 3.42%Est @ 3.01%Est @ 2.73%Est @ 2.53%Est @ 2.39%Est @ 2.30% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.9% US$201US$214US$240US$230US$218US$207US$195US$184US$173US$162(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$2.0bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$380m× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.9%– 2.1%) = US$5.7bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$5.7b÷ ( 1 + 8.9%)10= US$2.4bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$4.4b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$33.4, the company appears about fair value at a 1.5% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Flowserve as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.150. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for FlowserveStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Machinery market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Paying a dividend but company has no free cash flows.Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

I want to thank our global team for their tireless efforts serving our customers and driving our performance during these difficult times.We remain confident in driving growth in the second half of 2023 with the addition of Liquibox, reduced destocking and expected market recovery.SEE continues to create value for our customers and shareholders as a world-class market-led company powered by automation, digital and sustainable packaging solutions,"" said Ted Doheny, SEE’s President and CEO.Unless otherwise stated, all results compare first quarter 2023 to first quarter 2022 results from continuing operations. Year-over-year financial discussions present operating results from continuing operations as reported. Year-over-year comparisons are also made on an organic basis and constant dollar basis, which are non-U.S. GAAP measures. Organic refers to changes in unit volume and price performance and excludes acquisitions in the first year after closing, divestiture activity and the impact of currency translation. Constant dollar refers to changes in net sales and earnings, excluding the impact of currency translation.

Please refer to the supplemental information included with this press release for a reconciliation of U.S. GAAP to Non-U.S. GAAP financial measures.Story continuesBusiness Segment HighlightsFirst quarter net sales in Food were $853 million, an increase of 6% as reported. Currency fluctuations had an unfavorable impact of $24 million, or 3%. On a constant dollar basis, net sales increased $70 million, or 9%. The Liquibox acquisition had a favorable impact of $57 million, or 7%, and price realization had a favorable impact of $33 million, or 4%. Volumes decreased by $21 million, or 3%, driven by food retail market declines and the adverse impact from prior supply disruptions. Adjusted EBITDA of $195 million, or 22.8% of net sales, decreased 3% from $200 million, or 24.8% of net sales. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to lower volumes and unfavorable currency, partially offset by the Liquibox acquisition.First quarter net sales in Protective were $496 million, a decrease of 19% as reported. Currency fluctuations had an unfavorable impact of $13 million, or 2%. On a constant dollar basis, net sales decreased $101 million, or 17%. Volumes decreased $111 million, or 18%, resulting from recessionary pressures in the industrial and fulfillment markets and continued inventory destocking throughout the value chain. Price realization had a favorable impact of $10 million, or 2%. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 37% to $80 million, or 16.2% of net sales, as compared to $127 million, or 20.9% of net sales. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to lower volumes.Completes Liquibox AcquisitionOn February 1, 2023, SEE completed the acquisition of Liquibox, a pioneer, innovator and manufacturer of Bag-in-Box sustainable fluids &amp; liquids packaging and dispensing solutions for fresh food, beverage, consumer goods and industrial end-markets. Consideration paid was approximately $1.15 billion, net of cash acquired, subject to customary adjustments.First Quarter 2023 U.S. GAAP SummaryNet sales of $1.3 billion decreased 5% as reported, with APAC decreasing 8%, the Americas decreasing 6%, and EMEA decreasing 1%.Net earnings were $63 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, as compared to net earnings of $150 million, or $1.00 per diluted share. The current year results were unfavorably impacted by costs of $30 million related to the Liquibox acquisition, including transaction and integration expenses and purchase accounting impacts related to the amortization of intangible assets and inventory step-up expense.Income tax expense was $34 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 35.0% in first quarter 2023. This compares to an income tax expense of $59 million in the prior year, or an effective tax rate of 28.4%. The effective tax rate increase in the first quarter 2023 as compared to the prior year is primarily driven by the impact of accruals for uncertain tax positions on lower pre-tax earnings.First Quarter 2023 Non-U.S. GAAP SummaryNet sales decreased $32 million, or 2%, on a constant dollar basis. Volumes decreased by $132 million, or 9%, while the Liquibox acquisition had a favorable impact of $57 million, or 4%, and price realization had a favorable impact of $43 million, or 3%. By region, in constant dollars, EMEA increased 4% while the Americas and APAC decreased 4% and 1%, respectively.Adjusted EBITDA was $267 million, or 19.8% of net sales, as compared to $327 million, or 23.1%. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to lower volumes, partially offset by the Liquibox acquisition. Currency fluctuations had an unfavorable impact of $3 million, or 1%, in first quarter 2023.The Adjusted Tax Rate was 24.0% in first quarter 2023, as compared to 25.2% in the prior year. The reduction in the Adjusted Tax Rate in the first quarter 2023 as compared to the prior year is primarily attributable to the tax impact of share-based compensation vesting on lower adjusted pre-tax earnings.Adjusted earnings per diluted share decreased to $0.74, from $1.12, primarily due to lower Adjusted EBITDA. Currency fluctuations had an unfavorable impact of $0.01 per share, or 1%, in first quarter 2023.Cash Flow and Net DebtCash flow provided by operating activities during the first three months of 2023 was a source of $52 million, as compared to a source of $48 million during the prior year period.Capital expenditures in the first three months of 2023 were $65 million, as compared to $67 million during the prior year period. Free Cash Flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, was a use of $13 million for the first three months of 2023, as compared to a use of $19 million during the prior year period.During the first three months of 2023, the Company repurchased 1.5 million shares, valued at $80 million and paid cash dividends of $31 million.Total debt was $4.8 billion as of March 31, 2023 and $3.7 billion as of December 31, 2022. Net Debt, defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents, was $4.5 billion as of March 31, 2023, as compared to $3.2 billion as of December 31, 2022. As of March 31, 2023, SEE had approximately $1.25 billion of available liquidity comprised of $303 million of cash and $949 million of available and unused under our committed credit facilities.During the first quarter of 2023, SEE completed the offering of $775 million aggregate principal amount of 6.125% senior notes due 2028. The proceeds from this offering, along with the Company’s incremental term loan facility and cash on hand, were used to finance the Liquibox acquisition and to repurchase the Company’s outstanding 4.500% senior notes due 2023 (the ""2023 Euro Notes"") pursuant to the tender offer and satisfy and discharge all of the Company’s outstanding 2023 Euro Notes in accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the 2023 Euro Notes.Updated 2023 Full Year OutlookFor the full year 2023, SEE continues to expect net sales in the range of $5.85 to $6.10 billion, or an increase of 4% to 8%, which includes a favorable impact of the Liquibox acquisition of approximately 6% and unfavorable currency impact of approximately 1%.The Company continues to expect full year Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.25 to $1.30 billion, which includes a favorable impact of the Liquibox acquisition of approximately 8% and unfavorable currency impact of approximately 1%.The Company continues to forecast full year Adjusted EPS to be in the range of $3.50 to $3.80, which is now based on approximately 145 million shares outstanding and an anticipated Adjusted Tax Rate of approximately 26% to 27%.Excluding a $175 million tax deposit related to a tentative agreement to settle with the IRS, the Company expects Free Cash Flow in 2023 would remain in the range of $475 to $525 million, with capital expenditures still expected to be in the range of $260 to $280 million. The $175 million tax deposit to the IRS was made on April 20, 2023. Cash tax payments excluding those associated with the tentative agreement remain in the range of $240 to $250 million.Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EPS and Free Cash Flow are non-U.S. GAAP financial measures. We have not provided guidance for the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, as they are not available without unreasonable effort due to the high variability, complexity, and low visibility with respect to certain Special Items, including adjustments in the valuation of our ""SEE Ventures"" portfolio (which may include debt, equity method, or equity investments), amortization of intangible assets and inventory step-up expense related to the acquisition of Liquibox, gains and losses related to acquisition and divestiture of businesses, the ultimate outcome of certain legal or tax proceedings, and other unusual gains and losses. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could be material to our results computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP.Conference Call InformationSEE will host a conference call and webcast on Tuesday, May 2, 2023 at 10:00 a.m. (ET) to discuss our First Quarter 2023 Results.

Total constant dollar change is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure which excludes the impact of foreign currency translation. Since we are a U.S. domiciled company, we translate our foreign currency denominated financial results into U.S. dollars. Due to changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, translating our financial results from foreign currencies to U.S. dollars may result in a favorable or unfavorable impact. It is important that we take into account the effects of foreign currency translation when we view our results and plan our strategies. Nonetheless, we cannot control changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Consequently, when our management looks at our financial results to measure the core performance of our business, we exclude the impact of foreign currency translation by translating our current period results at prior period foreign currency exchange rates. We also may exclude the impact of foreign currency translation when making incentive compensation determinations. As a result, our management believes that these presentations are useful internally and may be useful to our investors.Sealed Air CorporationSegment InformationReconciliation of Net Earnings to Non-U.S. GAAP Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA(Unaudited)Three Months EndedMarch 31,(In USD millions)20232022Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations:Food$194.8$200.4Adjusted EBITDA Margin22.8 %24.8 %Protective80.4127.4Adjusted EBITDA Margin16.2 %20.9 %Corporate(7.9)(0.9)Non-U.S. GAAP Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA$267.3$326.9Adjusted EBITDA Margin19.8 %23.1 %Three Months EndedMarch 31,(In USD millions)20232022U.S. GAAP Net earnings from continuing operations$62.9$149.6Interest expense, net57.838.9Income tax provision33.859.4Depreciation and amortization, net of adjustments(1)68.963.2Special Items:Liquibox intangible amortization5.0—Liquibox inventory step-up expense8.4—Restructuring charges(1.2)0.5Other restructuring associated costs(0.2)3.1Foreign currency exchange loss due to highly inflationary economies2.61.0Loss on debt redemption and refinancing activities4.90.7Impairment loss on equity investments—15.5Charges related to acquisition and divestiture activity16.9(0.9)Other Special Items7.5(4.1)Pre-tax impact of Special items43.915.8Non-U.S. GAAP Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA$267.3$326.9Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA decline to comparable constant currency decline% decline - Adjusted EBITDA(18) %% currency impact1 %% comparable constant currency(17) %________________(1) Depreciation and amortization by segment are as follows:Three Months EndedMarch 31,(In USD millions)20232022Food$46.7$36.5Protective27.226.7Consolidated depreciation and amortization(i)$73.9$63.2Depreciation and amortization adjustments(5.0)—Depreciation and amortization, net of adjustments$68.9$63.2(i) Includes share-based incentive compensation of $18.0 million and $17.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230502005470/en/ContactsCompany Contacts Investors Brian Sullivanbrian.c.sullivan@sealedair.com 704.503.8841Media Christina Griffinchristina.griffin@sealedair.com 704.430.5742]"

MSI is scheduled to report first-quarter 2023 results on May 4, after the closing bell. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 5%. It pulled off a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 6.9%, on average.The Chicago, IL-based company is expected to have recorded year-over-year higher revenues on the back of growth in both segments — Products and Systems Integration, and Services and Software. It benefits from the increasing demand for its mission-critical technologies in North America and globally.Factors at PlayDuring the quarter, Motorola unveiled the Avigilon physical security suite, a new security solution backed by advanced analytics, to deliver enhanced enterprise protection. Motorola blended its innovation with the expertise provided by Avigilon, Ava Security and Openpath. Powered by artificial intelligence capabilities, the solution significantly improves protection against various threats and enhances the safety of people and property. This is likely to have generated incremental revenues during the quarter.In first-quarter 2023, Motorola secured a contract from Peel Regional Police in Canada to deploy its mission-critical PremierOne computer-aided dispatch software. The software enables real-time collaboration between agencies and offers sensitive critical data to enhance safety for officers and the nearly 1.4 million residents in the region. This helps to secure people, assets and facilities spanning large perimeters of sensitive areas.During the to-be-reported quarter, Motorola deployed a new digital radio solution for NTA Metropolitan Mass Transit System Ltd. to provide safe, secure and reliable communications for Israel’s largest infrastructure project. Based on the mission-critical TETRA standard, the new communications system ensures swift collaboration between train crews and service staff across 34 train stations. It also extended the existing nationwide P25 communications network used by public safety agencies in Israel to help communicate in the underground tunnels and rail lines.Riding on such state-of-the-art products, Motorola expects to record strong demand across video security and services, land mobile radio products and related software while benefiting from a solid foundation. These systems drive the demand for additional device sales and promote software upgrades and infrastructure expansion. The comprehensive suite of services ensures continuity and reduces risks related to critical communications operations. These developments are expected to have positively impacted its performance in the quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Products and Systems Integration segment’s revenues is pegged at $1,216 million. The figure indicates a rise from $1,103 million recorded in the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Services and Software segment’s revenues stands at $911 million, up from $789 million recorded in the year-earlier quarter.For the March quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $2,125 million, which indicates growth from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure of $1,892 million. The consensus estimate for adjusted earnings per share stands at $2.06, which suggests an increase from $1.70 recorded in the prior-year quarter driven by top-line growth.Story continuesEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not predict an earnings beat for Motorola in the first quarter. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.

KlappaThank you very much. Live from the Heartland. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the first quarter of 2023. First, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Scott Lauber, our President and Chief Executive; Xia Liu, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Now as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported first quarter 2023 earnings of $1.61 a share. Weather was a major factor in our lower results for the quarter. We saw one of the mildest winters in the history of the Upper Midwest. For example, it was the second warmest first quarter in Milwaukee since 1891, However, we're confident in our plan for the remainder of the year and we're reaffirming our guidance for 2023. As a reminder, we're guiding to a range of $4.58 to $4.62 a share for the full year. This assumes normal weather going forward. And as always, we remain focused on the fundamentals of our business, financial discipline, operating efficiency and customer satisfaction. Switching gears now. The work on our ESG progress plan continues at a steady pace. It's the largest 5-year investment plan in our history, totaling $28.1 billion for efficiency, sustainability and growth. The plan is based on projects that are low risk and highly executable. And as we look to the future, it's clear that the mega trend of decarbonization and the need for even greater reliability will drive investment plans that are long and strong. Scott will provide you with more detail on several specific projects in a moment. But I'm pleased to report that just since last December, the Wisconsin Commission has approved more than $1 billion of new capital investment by our companies. As we've discussed, we project that our ESG progress plan will drive compound earnings growth of 6.5% to 7% a year from 2023 through 2027. And we fully expect to fund our capital plan without any need for new equity. Now let's take a brief look at the regional economy. We have good news from the latest data in Wisconsin. In March, the unemployment rate came in at 2.5%. That's a record low for the state and well below the national average and we continue to see major developments in the area. Just a few weeks ago, in fact, Microsoft announced that it plans to create a new data center campus in our region with an initial investment of $1 billion. This data center complex will be built south of Milwaukee in the technology park that is also being developed by Foxconn. Microsoft will purchase a 315-acre parcel in Area 3 of the park. Local approvals have been received, and we expect Microsoft to close on the land purchase on or before the 31st of July. In the meantime, Microsoft is moving full speed ahead with planning and design work. The decision by Microsoft underscores the strength and the potential of the Wisconsin economy and positions us very well for more growth in the technology sector. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott for more information on our regulatory developments, our operations and our infrastructure segment. Scott, all yours.Scott J. LauberThank you, Gale. I'd like to start with a few updates on the regulatory front. New rates have been in effect for our Wisconsin utilities since the start of the year. As expected, we're planning to file a limited reopener for 2024 later this quarter. The filing will address the recovery of capital investments for projects going into service this year and in 2024. The return on equity and the equity layer are all set and are not up for consideration, the request will be quite modest, and we expect a decision from the commission by the end of this year. And as you recall, we have rate filings under review in Illinois for Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas. The next step will be for the commission staff and interveners to file their direct testimony on May 9. Hearings are scheduled for early August. After 9 years without a rate case at Peoples Gas, who are making these requests for 2024 to support our investment in key infrastructure and with lower natural gas prices, we project customer bills will be flat with 2022. We also have rate reviews in progress at Minnesota Energy Resources and Michigan Gas Utilities. We filed in Minnesota last November and interim rates went into effect January 1. I'm pleased to announce that we received a settlement with parties that would result in a 7.1% increase in base rates. That's based on a 9.65% return on equity with an equity layer of 53%. This settlement is subject to commission approval, which we expect in the next several months. And in March, we filed for a base rate increase of 9.1% at Michigan Gas Utilities for 2024. This application is primarily driven by our capital investments supporting safety and reliability. Meanwhile, we're making good progress on a number of regulatory capital projects. Red Barn Wind Park went to service last month. The project is providing 82 megawatts of clean energy capacity to our Wisconsin customers. And as Gale noted, we received 3 significant approvals for the Wisconsin Commission since last December for the Dairyland Solar Battery Park, West Riverside Energy Center and Koshkonong Solar Battery Parks. We discussed the Dairyland approval last quarter. And as you recall, the solar park is planned to go in service in 2024. West Riverside is a combined cycle natural gas plant owned by Alliant Energy. In February, we received approval for our purchase of 100 megawatts of Riverside capacity for approximately $102 million. We expect to close this purchase by the end of the month. We have an option to purchase another 100 megawatts of Riverside capacity, and we plan to exercise that option later this year. We also received approval for our purchase of Koshkonong Solar Battery Park with plans for 300 megawatts of solar capacity and 165 megawatts of battery storage. We will own 90% of the project with an expected investment of $585 million. We project the solar portion of this facility to go into service in 2025. We also continue on the Badger Hollow II solar facility and the Paris Solar-Battery Park. While Badger Hollow has received some of the solar panels, the remaining panels for projects are currently in Chicago going through the customs process. Assuming timing release of the panels, we expect these solar parks to go into service late this year or early next year. For the Paris and Koshkonong projects, we're evaluating the timing of the battery investments. Of course, we'll keep you updated on any future developments. Outside of utilities, we continue to make progress on zero carbon projects in our WEC Infrastructure segment. In February, we completed our acquisition of the Sapphire Sky Wind Farm, now in service in Illinois. As a reminder, that project offers 250 megawatts of capacity in total, and we own a 90% share. Also in February, we added an 80% ownership in the Samson 1 Solar Project located in Northeast Texas. The project has a capacity of 250 megawatts. As disclosed previously, Samson 1 suffered storm damage at the beginning of March, but we expect no significant bottom line impact for the property losses. The project is currently producing energy at about 70% level and improving every day as we continue to restore the site. With that, I'll turn things back to Gale.Gale E. KlappaScott, thank you very much. Now as you may recall, our Board of Directors at its January meeting raised our quarterly cash dividend by 7.2%. This marks the 20th consecutive year that our company will reward shareholders with higher dividends. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. We're right in the middle of that range now, so I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in our earnings per share. Next up, Xia will provide you with more details on our financial results and our second quarter guidance. Xia?Xia LiuThank you, Gale. Our 2023 first quarter earnings of $1.61 per share decreased $0.18 per share compared to the first quarter of 2022. Our earnings package include the comparison of first quarter results on Page 12. I'll walk through the significant drivers. Starting with our utility operations, our earnings were $0.09 lower compared to the first quarter of '22. Rate-based growth contributed $0.22 to earnings, driven by continued investment in our ESG progress plan. This includes the base rate increase for our Wisconsin utilities as well as the interim rate increase for Minnesota Energy Resources, both of which were effective January 1, 2023. This favorable margin impact from rate base growth was more than offset by a number of factors. First, as Gale noted, we experienced one of the mildest winters in history which drove a $0.12 decrease in earnings compared to the first quarter of last year. Additionally, timing of fuel expense, depreciation and amortization interest, day-to-day O&amp;M, taxes and other drove a combined $0.19 negative variance. Before I turn to earnings at the other segments, let me briefly discuss our weather-normalized sales. You can find our sales information on Page 9 of the earnings package. I'd like to remind you that weather normalization is not a perfect science, extreme warm weather in the first quarter may not be fully reflected in our weather-normalized data. Having said that, Weather-normal retail natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin, excluding natural gas used for power generation, were down 1%. However, residential usage, again on a weather-normal basis, grew 0.9%. That was ahead of our forecast. Weather-normal retail electric deliveries, excluding the iron ore mine, were 1.9% lower. Residential usage was relatively flat compared to last year. Now at our Energy Infrastructure segment, Earnings were $0.01 lower in the first quarter of '23 compared to the first quarter of '22. Production tax credits were higher by $0.03 quarter-over-quarter resulting from acquisitions of renewable generation projects. This increase was largely offset by a pickup that we recorded in the first quarter last year from the resolution of market settlement in the Southwest Power Pool. Finally, you'll see that earnings at our Corporate and Other segment decreased $0.08 primarily driven by an increase in interest expense and a pickup recorded in the first quarter '22 from our investment in a clean energy fund. These items were partially offset by favorable rabbi buy trust performance and some tax and other items. Remember, rabbi trust performance is largely offset in O&amp;M. Looking now at the cash flow statement on Page 6 of the earnings package. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $281 million. The mild winter and timing of recovery of commodity costs contributed to this decrease. Total capital expenditures and asset acquisitions were $1.3 billion in the first quarter of '23, and $884 million increase from the first quarter of '22. This was primarily driven by the acquisition of the Whitewater Natural Gas Power Generation Facility in our Wisconsin segment, as well as the Sapphire Sky Wind Farm and Samson 1 Solar facility in our Infrastructure segment. In closing, as Gale mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming our 2023 earnings guidance of $4.58 to $4.62 per share, assuming normal weather for the rest of the year. To offset the mild first quarter weather impact, we are implementing a variety of initiatives. As a result, we now expect our day-to-day O&amp;M to be 2% to 3% higher than 2022 versus our previous expectation of 3% to 5% higher. I will also add that largely due to timing of O&amp;M and fuel expense, we expect earnings in the second half of this year to be materially better than the second half of 2022. For the second quarter, we're expecting a range of $0.83 to $0.85 per share. This accounts for April weather and assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. As a reminder, we earned $0.91 per share in the second quarter last year. With that, I'll turn it back to Gale.Gale E. KlappaXia, thank you. Overall, we're on track and focused on providing value for our customers and our stockholders. Operator, we're ready now for the Q&amp;A portion of the call.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.Gale E.

How about you?Shahriar PourrezaGood. Not too bad, not too bad. So Gale, a quick one here. So half a dozen utilities have issued these like hybrid convertible notes at pretty attractive rates. I think in some cases, it's like 200 basis points of interest rate savings. There's obviously no equity credit there. So you've seen it even being utilized by some peers that don't need equity. I just want to get your sense from your shot like whether you see, I guess, any value with these hybrid securities to help fund the 5-year plan? Does it make sense? I mean obviously, we're waiting for your Q to be released to see if there's any kind of language around it, but.Gale E. KlappaYes, good question, Shar. And clearly, there are a number of companies in the sector even 2 today that have announced the use of this cash pay convert product. We've taken a good hard look at it. And let me just say this, if we found -- as we go through the course of the remainder of 2023, if we found that it was really advantageous for us, we would certainly take a hard look. But we're -- we're more than halfway, Shar through our debt issuance plan for 2023 and doing very well against our budget. Xia?Xia LiuYes, not much to add. We're very aware of the transaction. We understand the pros and cons. And at this time, we really have not made any decision as to whether cash pay convertible notes fit those -- fit our criteria. But we've done quite a bit financing so far, and we've done really well, better than the planned rates. So.Shahriar PourrezaAnd then just in short, I know I don't want to front run the queue, but is there -- will there be any language around looking at hybrids potentially as an option to fund the plan or not?Gale E. KlappaShar, are you talking about hybrids? Are you talking about the cash pay converts or both?Shahriar PourrezaThese cash pay converts or hybrids or whatever you want to call them at this point.Gale E. KlappaI don't think there's any language that we're planning in the Q or...Xia LiuNo. We haven't planned that at this point.Shahriar PourrezaOkay. Perfect. I appreciate that. And then just lastly on Illinois, obviously, the cases were filed in January. There's not a lot of data points since then, but gas prices have actually have come off, which I think hopefully will help the case. It's a tailwind. Any thoughts, I guess, Gale at this point on potentially settling, how has the dialogue been going? Do you see anything we should be thinking about?Gale E. KlappaWay, way too early to even think about or contemplate settlement in the process in Illinois. The process is going along very smoothly. I think the next steps as Scott mentioned in his prepared remarks, the next step will be staff and intervenor testimony on May 9. But so far, we are responding to data requests. The process in Illinois is going exactly as historically they've gone. And to your point about commodity costs moving in our favor, and they moved even more in our favor since we filed the case. But long story short, even with the base increase that we're seeking, you combine that with much lower commodity costs, and we expect customer bills to be flat even granting a full base rate increase for 2020 -- for bills in 2024. So again, we think that's very good news. And when you look at just the basic facts of what we're -- of what we filed. This will be, as you may recall, the first base rate increase for Peoples Gas since we acquired the company, first base rate increase actually in 9 years. And our O&amp;M is about $60 million a year lower than when we actually acquired the company in 2015. So a pretty good story.Shahriar PourrezaPerfect. Congrats on great execution so far. I appreciate it.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithListen, let me follow up on where Shar would go with that. So with respect to the Peoples case here and just talking a little bit about the future of gas, but also just the CapEx and just some of the scrutiny on bill pressures. How do you think about moderating bills? I mean, obviously, gas has rolled over any mitigating items, circumstances we should be thinking about on that front? And definitely, how do you think and respond to some of the -- there's been some (inaudible) out there, et cetera. Any thoughts as to how you tackle sort of the longer term versus the here and now of investing without the QIP in place in the traditional sense?Gale E. KlappaYes. Good question, Julien. On the QIP program and the investment in the safety modernization program, the pipe upgrade program that we've been carrying out in Chicago. Let me first say that we really welcome the public debate and the policy decision that the Illinois Commerce Commission will make about the future of the program. And just to put it in perspective, on average, we've invested about $280 million a year in upgrading the pipe network under the city of Chicago, which is, by the way, one of the oldest and now most deteriorated natural gas delivery networks in the country. So long story short, we're almost 36% complete with the pipe upgrade plan and again, investing about $280 million a year. Now, those who think we should do something different are banking on electrification. So the bets you would have to make to not, in some form, continue the program is that Chicago can completely electrify in less than 15 years because the independent study that the Illinois Commerce Commission has ordered and accepted, the independent engineering study shows that more than 80% of the iron pipes and our delivery network under Chicago have a useful life left of 15 years. And then lastly -- or 15 years or less. And then lastly, there are some who say, well, just patch the pipes. Julien, I'm telling you some of those pipes can't be patched. And when you look at the continued O&amp;M that would be required to patch after patch after patch, it would not, in our estimation, save customers any money. So we think there's overwhelming evidence here to continue the program, we would do so under our proposal as an annual base rate increase, if you will, to cover the cost of what we think is a very important program for both the immediate safety of Chicago. And then secondly, to preserve a long-term future, where that delivery network could deliver, say, hydrogen or other no carbon fuels to keep Chicago warm. So I hope that response helps.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithAbsolutely does. I appreciate it. With respect to the process, I want to come back to this super quickly. We've got a new ICC in place, et cetera. I mean to the extent to which that you're looking for direction here, I mean, this rate case should be the right venue to think about the pace and the sort of the new vision on where things are going, right? There's not some other avenue? I'm just trying to think through the -- how the ICC wants to articulate a response to your proposed spending, if you will? It will be through the case.Gale E. KlappaThere are extensive, as you would expect, and we wanted to have this kind of dialogue. We welcome this kind of dialogue, but there are multiple data requests as there are in any rate review but particularly, there are data requests about the program, about the need for the program, about the future of the program, et cetera. So I agree with you, I think this is the proper forum to have that policy decision made and everything is proceeding under the normal schedule, if you will, of data requests. And now, as we said earlier, the next formal step would be May 9 when we expect staff and intervenor testimony.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithRight. Yes. Thank you for confirming that. And we'll look next week. All right. You take care.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan Chase.Gale E. KlappaJeremy, are you moving to -- Jeremy, are you removing the Republic Bank or?Jeremy Bryan TonetNothing to say there. Just wanted to kind of come back, I guess, to the weather impacts as happened in the quarter and the offset there. Should we think about this as just kind of O&amp;M being the main tool for offsets over the balance of the year? I'm just wondering if you could quantify or give any more color there and how that might shape up across the year, I think you said in the back half, it kind of lightens up a bit. So any more color there could be helpful.Gale E. KlappaYes, I'd be happy to do that, and we'll ask Xia to give you some specifics. Let me frame a couple of things for you. First of all, we've got a pretty experienced management team. We've been down this road before. So we have a pretty well-tested playbook and the playbook has been implemented. There are O&amp;M initiatives in every group of the company, every department, every section. They have plans and they have goals. So a big part of it, obviously, is related to day-to-day operation and maintenance costs. Another big positive for us, again, compared to our budget and our forecast is really the interest cost savings that we're seeing. And then we're going to ask Xia and Scott to kind of briefly walk you through the difference that we see in Q3 and Q4 this year compared to Q3 and Q4 of last year when we were deep into our sharing bands with customers. So Xia, why don't we start off with you and some specifics and then we'll let -- I'll ask Scott to talk about the sharing bands that really impacted Q3 and Q4 last year.Xia LiuSure. So Q1 weather was about $0.12 deficit, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks. So we've identified O&amp;M reduction targets that can offset $0.04, $0.05, $0.06 of that. We also built some conservative financing assumptions in the plan. So in terms of issuing debt at rates lower than the plan or continued execution later this year, we expect the financing savings to be $0.05 to $0.06 also. So between those 2 items, we could offset the Q1 weather deficit. But we also have other initiatives we're looking at beyond those 2 items.Scott J. LauberSure. And then when you think about the last half of the year, you have to remember the last several years, we've been very fortunate to actually be into a sharing band where we're sharing with customers. I think last year, we were able to reduce our fuel request about $54 million. So that's quite a bit when you think about charges in the last half of the year. And last half, remember, we had warmer than normal weather, so we were able to accelerate or do some additional spending for our customers. So we incurred additional O&amp;M costs plus the sharing band. So that was meaningful for the last half of the year compared to what you see this year come and shaping up.Gale E. KlappaAnd to Scott's point, we obviously don't see ourselves into the sharing bands with customers this year. So I think in terms of basically $54 million of costs that won't reappear in the third and fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the second half of 2022.Jeremy Bryan TonetGot it. That's very helpful there. And just shifting a bit to solar and I know that you touched on this a bit in the prepared remarks as it relates to the solar supply chain. But just wondering, I guess, thoughts on ongoing progressional efforts to revoke the present 2-year solar tariff suspension. Just wondering if you had any thoughts you could share there or just on the supply chain in general.Gale E. KlappaWell, my understanding is that President Biden said he would veto any effort to undo that particular initiative. So I'm not sure that one's going anywhere. But in the meantime, as Scott indicated in his prepared remarks, for our Badger Hollow II Solar Project in Wisconsin for our regulated utility and for our Paris Solar-Battery Project, again, for our Wisconsin utilities. Scott, we got all the solar panels we need hanging in a warehouse in Chicago.Scott J. LauberThey're in the warehouse in Chicago. We're just working with customs, to get them out of that warehouse. And of course, for the future projects, we're looking at other alternatives, including U.S. potential options available in the future to source those future projects that the commission has approved.Gale E. KlappaJeremy, Scott and I went down to that warehouse one night, but the Doberman wouldn't let us in. So -- but we know all of those panels are there.Jeremy Bryan TonetGot it. That's helpful. And then just one last quick one, if I could, as it relates to transmission and future MISO tranches maybe kind of taking shape in the not-too-distant future here. Just wondering if you had any updated thoughts permitting reform or with the MISO outlook could mean for wet down the road?Gale E. KlappaDon't see much of any progress on permitting reform at this stage of the game. But again, as MISO works its way through all of the stakeholder process, Tranche 2 Phase I, the early indications are quite favorable in terms of the investment opportunity being even greater than what we saw in basically Tranche 1. And then in addition to that, I mentioned the major economic development project that was just announced with Microsoft, any particular upside on transmission or generation needs related to that Microsoft project would be incremental to the plan and not in the current plan. And I'm guessing there may be some additional transmission need coming out of that project, Scott?Scott J. LauberNo, that's correct, Gale. And also a reminder, Tranche 1 was using a lot of existing right of away. So we're very happy using existing right if aways to be able to get that construction started in an earlier time frame in that '25, '26 time frame.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research.Michael P. SullivanMaybe just back to the O&amp;M. So understand it was going to tick up a little bit this year. Now you're kind of pulling that back to help offset the weather. As we think beyond 2023, how should we think about the trajectory? I know you have a track record of bringing it down, and this year was kind of the first time in a while. It was set to step up.Gale E. KlappaYes. I think when you look at the near-term future past 2023, we're going to be seeing another chunk of O&amp;M reduction related to the planned retirements. And just as a reminder, we have 4 older units at our Oak Creek site, units 5, 6, 7 and 8. And units 5 and 6 are scheduled for retirement next year and then units 7 and 8 in 2025. And along with that, the retirement will come a substantial chunk of O&amp;M reduction. Scott?Scott J. LauberNo, you're exactly right. As we put on those retirements, O&amp;M will go down. But remember, the driver for the O&amp;M increases this year as we put in new plants into the system. We added a lot of capital over this last year and to run those new plants, including the new race units that we're putting in service and also the plants in Milwaukee infrastructure, all of that's additional O&amp;M. So really supporting capital investments.Gale E. KlappaAnd one other thought adding on to what Scott is saying, there's another benefit to the investments that we're making that are coming online, particularly the solar investments that we're in the final stages of completion. Those investments when they're online and producing energy actually replace fuel costs. So in addition to O&amp;M, chunks of savings coming forward here from the retirement of older coal-fired units, we're also going to see reductions in fuel costs simply because, obviously, with solar and wind, the fuel is free.Michael P. SullivanOkay. That's very helpful. I appreciate the detail. Just related to that, to the extent that we see any shifting in timing of the solar with supply chain issues and the panels in the warehouse and all that. Does -- how do you kind of react to that? Is there a risk that -- is that -- are you tying that to the coal shutdown retirements in terms of just earning on those assets and rate base? Are there other things you have to move around? Just what are kind of the other implications across the business to the extent that your solar projects get pushed down a little bit?Gale E. KlappaWell, to answer the second part of your question on retirements of the 4 older coal-fired units, we don't see any change in that schedule. That, I believe, will continue to be the 2024 and 2025 retirement dates for each of those 2 units. And then in terms of potential further delays again, we have to get clearance here and we've got a plan B if we can't get clearance to finish the solar projects. But remember, these are regulated projects. The commission is very, very supportive of the need for those projects. And Scott, we're earning AFUDC during the construction period.Scott J. LauberCorrect. And we're continuing the construction. So they are site ready when the solar panels get released. So Paris and Badger Hollow II construction is pretty well done. On Badger Hollow II, we just need the solar panels and Paris is moving along nicely. So those panels already. Won't take long to pop them on.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.Gale E. KlappaWow, you got the Jersey #8 on. Durgesh?Durgesh ChopraI don't know. I don't know about that, Gale.Gale E. KlappaI know. I know. Still die hard Eagle fan, right?Durgesh ChopraIt's still hurts, still hurts.Gale E. KlappaI'm sorry.Durgesh ChopraOkay, yes, we'll be back next year. So just Gale, I wanted to go back to the reopener. We've had a ton of discussion here as you make the filing. I think Scott mentioned in his opening remarks that it's not for ROE for equity layer. Maybe can you just talk about the projects that you will be filing for? Am I right in thinking about that these projects are already approved so you're not necessarily seeking for prudency of those projects? And then to the extent that you can sort of help us frame what CapEx would -- are we looking at as you file -- as you make these filings in the quarter?Gale E. KlappaSure. We'll ask Scott to help out as well. So you are correct. This limited reopener as defined in the rate order, does not -- I mean, the ROE and the equity layer are set and they're not up for reconsideration. There's roughly and yes, you are correct, all of the projects that we will be filing for recovery in this limited reopener have already been approved by the commission. So that is absolutely correct. And Scott, it's about $1 billion of capital that will be coming in, if I recall correctly, into that reopener.Scott J. LauberYes, it's approximately that. I don't have the exact number at my fingertips, but when you think about the reopener, it's projects like we talked about, Riverside was approved now that $102 million, we'll put that into the reopener. The Weston Race Units those are going to be in for a full year. So that will be part of the reopener. So some of these are full year, some of these are actually part of a year capital projects.Gale E. KlappaAnd LNG? One of our LNG's projects.Scott J. LauberThe LNG projects. So it's really across electric and gas and just truing up with the capital additions.Durgesh ChopraGot it. And then you've previously talked about O&amp;M savings to be included as part of that request. Is that also part of this limited reopener filing or could be a part of this limited reopener filing?Scott J. LauberSure that the real -- the O&amp;M piece is really the retirement for the Oak Creek 5 and 6, those older Oak Creek units. Remember, last year, we filed the case and then we extended them and now what we're doing is closing those units at the end of May here of 2024. So that will be the O&amp;M reduction that we put in the actual order for us to factor that into the case.Gale E. KlappaAnd Durgesh, the largest O&amp;M reduction. Scott's exactly right. The largest O&amp;M reduction from the closure of the Oak Creek units really will come all 4 units are retired because we won't be retiring the environmental control operation at that site for those older units until all 4 are off-line.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank.Andrew Marc WeiselFirst, a question on timing of fuel cost. I know a minus $0.07 in the 1Q waterfall. What's your expectation for the full year based on current curves? Do you expect that to fully reverse and if so, when?Xia LiuAndrew, this is Xia. We -- that's purely timing. We expect that to recover in the second quarter and throughout the third and fourth quarter. Remember that last year, like Gale mentioned, we booked quite a bit of fuel expense because of the sharing band, and we don't expect that to happen. So we see a pickup in fuel in terms of impact on earnings.Gale E. KlappaSo purely timing. We'll see a second half turnaround.Andrew Marc WeiselOkay. And then on usage, Xia, if you could elaborate a little bit on the demand trend. I think you said residential gas came in better than expected, adjusting for weather, but on the electric side all customer classes were down. How much of that has just been noise around the extreme weather? Or do you see any notable changes in demand trends?Xia LiuYes, a lot of expected noise around weather normalization, like I said, just to put it in perspective, the weather-normalized residential sales met our forecasted expectations. So those are the higher-margin segment. And on the C&amp;I front, we -- just a reminder, we have a very diverse mix of industries. We call provide essential services like food, paper, plastic processing and many of which had a really good growth in the first quarter and we don't have exposure to lots of automobile or oil and gas industry. So we feel really good about the industry mix and we really haven't seen any trends of any potential recession in our service territory. So we track about a little over 100 large customers regularly. There are 4 that contributed to almost half of the negative variance in the first quarter year-over-year, and 2 of those were down substantially year-over-year because of noneconomic reasons. So one had a fire, the other had an outbreak. So we expect those to return to normal through the rest of the year. So -- and again, whether normal noise played a role in these numbers. So I wouldn't overreact to these numbers right now.Gale E. KlappaYes. Andrew, just to build on to what Xia's saying, when you look at the temperatures across Q1, they were basically 2 standard deviations away from normal. And I can just tell you, not only for our company but for the industry as a whole, and for those of you who followed us a long time, you've heard me say this a gazillion times. I mean the weather normalization techniques are far more precise than accurate. And the further you get away from in terms of standard deviations from the norm, the less reliable the weather normalization techniques are. So again, just as a general caveat, as Xia said, I wouldn't read too much in the Q1 numbers.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho.Gale E. KlappaYou got a dog to name?Anthony Christopher CrowdellI was thinking that warehouse Doberman, that may work for Julien.Gale E. KlappaAnd not a bad idea. I'll take all of your input on naming the dog for Julien, but go Anthony.Anthony Christopher CrowdellAndrew, Xia had just took my question on the recession in C&amp;I sales. If I could just pivot and I think maybe some of your comments earlier on the iron piping in Chicago. I'm just curious, if we think back maybe 10 years ago or 15 years ago, when we talked about nuclear generation, how we're getting rid of it? How we're getting rid of it? And then all of a sudden, we've come to the realization of its importance and zero carbon. Do you think we have a similar moment in gas LDCs? And if we do, do you think that's going to be more dependent on its locations such as you bring up colder Midwest area that, hey, there is this recognition that if we wanted to retire it, we have to do it, electrified within 15 years were that as we get closer to that the parties realize how valuable the asset is?Gale E. KlappaYes. That's a great question, Anthony. And I do think there will be an epiphany moment. Don't know exactly when that epiphany moment will occur, but here are a couple of thoughts. The first is if you think you can electrify completely by, let's say, 15 years from now, you then have to take the next step and say, how are we going to build the generation that would be needed to replace gas heating. And what kind of generation would that be?Well, think about when gas heating is needed the most. It's the heavy cold winter days in January and February, right? So how much solar could you count on particularly in the Midwest in January and February? How much wind could you count on in January and February? And guess what? You end up clicking into the plan a tremendous amount of gas-fired power generation. When people start working through that equation, I think there will be quite an epiphany moment. I think that's part of it. And then the other is, as we continue to see the evolution of hydrogen hubs and as we continue to see more and more cost effectiveness from hydrogen under the IRA. I mean some gas utilities are already beginning to blend hydrogen with natural gas, we're beginning to blend. In fact, this summer, we will begin blending RNG, renewable natural gas into our network. So I think as people begin to think through past the bumper sticker, yes, you're going to see an epiphany moment about how valuable having that resource will be as we transition to a low and no carbon future. I mean, think about it another way. We have got to get this transition right to no-carbon future. And if we sacrifice reliability in that transition, it will delay the transition for many, many, many years. So we're back to all of the above and we're back to -- I think we will have a moment where everybody recognizes the practical approach to this and the safe approach to this.OperatorOur final question will come from the line of [Ashar Khan] with [Parisian].Unidentified AnalystMost of my questions have been answered. I just had a small one. So, why are we down quarter-over-quarter in the second quarter? Could you just help me with the variances which you expect in the second quarter?Xia LiuSure. Be happy to. So financing costs are expected to be higher compared to the Q2 last year. So that's a big driver. There is plus and minuses, but we do have rate base growth that's better than last year, fuel is expected to be better last year, but largely offset by financing costs.Gale E. KlappaTerrific. Well, folks, I think that concludes -- is there more? I'm sorry.OperatorI'll now turn the call back over to you, Mr. Klappa for any concluding remarks.Gale E. KlappaThere we go. I jump the gun. Thank you. Well, that concludes our conference call for today. Thanks so much for participating, as always. If you have additional questions, feel free to contact Beth Straka at (414) 221-4639. Thank you, everybody. Take care.OperatorThank you for joining today's meeting. You may now disconnect.]"

Microsoft said it remained fully committed and would appeal.The regulator's decision reflected a flawed understanding of the market, it said.HOW DOES THE APPEAL PROCESS WORK?Microsoft can appeal to Britain's Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT), an independent judicial body, which will only examine the CMA's decision-making process, not the merits of the merger.Microsoft will not be able to offer new remedies at this stage, such as offering to keep Activision content off its Xbox Game Pass, a subscription service for Xbox users, in Britain, as some analysts suggest.""The CAT will not engage with the merits of the CMA's decision or conduct a wholesale review of the parties' evidence,"" said Edward Lane, senior associate at law firm Harbottle &amp; Lewis, where his particular focus is on creative industries, including film, TV, video games and music.WHAT'S NEXT?Microsoft must appeal by May 24 and a decision may take many months.""The CAT aims to deal with 'straightforward' cases in under nine months – and Microsoft/Activision is anything but straightforward,"" Lane, said.WHAT HAPPENS IF MICROSOFT WINS?The Tribunal will return the case to the regulator for further review. Microsoft can then offer new concessions.""The likelihood is that without a material change in circumstances or new evidence, the CMA is most likely to reach the same conclusion as it did first time around,"" said James Groves, a competition associate at European law firm Fieldfisher.Story continuesWHAT ABOUT OTHER REGULATORS?European regulators will rule on the world's biggest gaming deal by May 22. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint to block the deal, which Microsoft has indicated it will fight.If either of those blocks the deal, it could be game over, Lane said.If the EU goes against it, Microsoft would be fighting an increasingly uphill battle and could decide to cut its losses, even if that would mean paying Activision a hefty $3 billion break fee.WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO OTHER CMA APPEALS?Facebook-owner Meta appealed a 2021 decision by the CMA to block its acquisition of Giphy, seen as a test case for the British regulator's resolve to take on ""Big Tech"".Meta succeeded on a single procedural ground, with the decision otherwise upheld. The CMA considered new submissions, but it came to the same view and Meta had to sell animated images platform Giphy.Global financial services company FNZ appealed a block on its 2019 merger with rival GBST. The regulator then ""identified certain potential errors"" in its investigation chaired by Martin Coleman, who also oversaw the Microsoft-Activision case.The CAT sent the case back to be reconsidered, and the CMA agreed to accept a new remedy whereby FNZ could sell GBST and then buy parts of it back.(Reporting by Paul Sandle; Editing by Josephine Mason and Tomasz Janowski)]"

Talk about zero political appetite for that one as the debt ceiling is shaping up to be another pre-presidential race debacle.Rising interest rates (Fed decision is on May 3) will be top of mind at the conference, too, as the Fed is expected to raise rates by 25 basis points despite the banking troubles.Meanwhile, the U.S. economy is slowing in part because of those rate hikes — Morgan Stanley economist Ellen Zentner is looking for a 0.4% decline in second quarter GDP, for example.And then a U.S. presidential election looms in 2024 as we saw in the Twitter video drop from president Joe Biden last week. The ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine may just be endless, experts have told me recently.All of this will be front and center for power brokers from inside governments around the world and Corporate America at the Milken conference. I can tell you as well there will be a ton of AI talk, which comes after a ton of AI talk last week from Microsoft, Google, Meta and Snap. I suspect Apple will chime in on AI when it reports earnings on May 4.Our job there as Yahoo Finance journalists is rather straightforward: bring investors on our platform inside this world of big ideas and potentially market-moving insights. End goal: help our community growth their wealth.Story continuesWe are pumped to get going over these next three days.Enjoy the coverage on Yahoo Finance Live on our homepage, app and YouTube.

Starbucks is set to report its fiscal second quarter earnings results on Tuesday. Brooke DiPalma following that with us. And Brooke, what can we expect?BROOKE DIPALMA: Yeah, well, this will be Laxman Narasimhan's first earnings call as official CEO. Of course, Narasimhan was set to take the role on April 1st. He joined back in October as incoming CEO, but he joined about two weeks earlier on March 20th. So once again, this will be his first call, Starbucks confirming that to Yahoo Finance that he will be leading the call on Tuesday.Now, running right along to another focus for investors here, sales momentum in the US, lots of investors waiting to see if US consumers still see Starbucks as an affordable luxury in a more difficult macro environment. One analyst saying that he aims to focus and is looking to hear more on the resiliency of US sales momentum in that more difficult macroeconomic environment. Of course, that word resiliency, something that we continue to hear across the board this earnings season.Now, moving once again right along to the third focus of Starbucks investors call, is improvement in China, as China's COVID-19 related recovery may be in the rear view here or here. Wedbush analyst, Nick [? Sadan ?] saying, quote, ""While visibility into the trajectory of a recovery in China remains relatively limited, it is clear that the multi-year headwind has now turned into a tailwind."" Important to note here that Starbucks opened their 6,000th store back in September, so certainly lots of momentum in China as that COVID-19 related recovery seems to be in the past.- All right, so that's we're expected to see in terms of sales growth in the US, but then also some improvement it sounds like maybe over in China. What about pricing? Because pricing pressure, pricing power, where does Starbucks stand?Story continuesBROOKE DIPALMA: Yeah, well certainly, we've seen them increase menu prices in the past year. And specifically in the US, that's one of the things that analysts say that's going to increase same store sales. We're seeing same store sales here in the US expected to be up 8.91%. Elevated pricing is expected to be a driver here in the US, not so much mentioned overseas in China as they continue to push through those headwinds of COVID-19 related recovery. But the average check side is expected to go up here in North America up 6.25%, international, the ticket growth is expected to be up 3.42%.Now, other things that are expected to drive growth here in the US is food attachment, like adding a slice of pumpkin bread to orders, in addition to product innovation. We're looking to hear more on that Oleato coffee line, and of course, overall just looking to hear more on that consumer demand here in the US as inflation continues to take a toll on Americans' wallets.- All right. We will have that earnings report for you after the bell tomorrow. Brooke DiPalma, great set. Thanks so much. And be sure to tune in tomorrow for me, Brad Smith, we are going to be breaking down the Starbucks earnings call, the latest edition of After the Call that gets underway as soon as the earnings call wraps up probably right around 6:00 PM Eastern time.]"

The Zacks analyst believes that the company is benefiting from strong product portfolio and acquisitions including Xilinx and Pensando, which has diversified its business.Robust adoption of EPYC processors by North American hyperscalers has been a tailwind. It is also expected that AMD’s embedded segment will continue to grow in the first-quarter of 2023.However, keeping in with seasonality, the company’s client and gaming segment is expected to decline.

The Zacks analyst believes that acquisitions, superior operating performance and maintenance of a high-quality product portfolio have aided the company in the past few years.Rise in membership on the back of a diversified product portfolio, a wide agent network and superior service also are major positives. Business streamlining by divesting non-core businesses have helped it to focus on core growth areas.Story continuesHowever, high leverage can affect Cigna’s financial flexibility.

Per the Zacks analyst, lower cases of COVID-19 infections have fueled uncertainty regarding demand for vaccinations, resulting in declining product sales. Also, the launch of similar vaccines by competitors like Sanofi and Novavax will likely lead to further loss of product sales.However, since the company is one of the first-ever COVID vaccine developers, the robust product sales has continued to drive its topline.

The company has a stellar earnings surprise history, having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters, the average beat being 9.1%.Let’s see how things have shaped up for Parker-Hannifin’s fiscal third quarter.Parker-Hannifin Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseParker-Hannifin Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseParker-Hannifin Corporation price-eps-surprise | Parker-Hannifin Corporation QuoteFactors to NoteSteady demand across end markets and higher orders are expected to have buoyed Parker-Hannifin’s fiscal third-quarter performance.Broad-based growth in the North American region is expected to have boosted revenues in the Diversified Industrial segment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Diversified Industrial North America revenues indicates an 8.2% rise from the year-ago reported number.The Aerospace Systems segment is expected to generate significantly higher revenues on the back of the Meggitt acquisition (September 2022), which has expanded Parker-Hannifin’s presence in the UK, positioning it well to provide a broader suite of solutions for aircraft and aeroengine components and systems.Robust original equipment manufacturer and Maintenance, Repair and Operations commercial activity is also expected to have aided the Aerospace Systems segment’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter. The consensus mark for Aerospace revenues in the fiscal third quarter shows a 78.6% jump from the year-ago reported number. PH’s unique Win Strategy, which focuses on innovation, strategic positioning, distribution growth and incentive plan changes to drive organic growth, is expected to have supported its margin performance in the fiscal third quarter. Effective pricing actions are also likely to have aided margin performance.However, the escalating cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses are likely to have dented Parker-Hannifin’s bottom line in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. The company’s realignment expenses also might have weighed on its bottom line.Given PH’s substantial overseas business operations, foreign-exchange woes might have impacted its top-line performance.Story continuesEarnings WhispersOur proven model suggests an earnings beat for Parker-Hannifin this time around.

First-quarter 2023 earnings are expected to increase 1.6% year over year for the sector compared with a 15.9% rise recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022. Revenues for the sector are estimated to climb 5.9% year over year compared with a 9.7% increase reported in the fourth quarter of 2022.Out of the 20% of the S&amp;P 500 companies within the Industrial Products sector that have reported earnings numbers, 60% each beat on earnings and revenues, while 40% surpassed both earnings and revenue estimates.Below we have discussed industrial companies like Ingersoll Rand, Johnson Controls International, Parker-Hannifin Corp. and Zebra Technologies that are set to trump earnings estimates this reporting cycle.Key Factors for Q1A low-demand environment, thanks to weakness in the manufacturing sector, is likely to have weighed on the first-quarter performances of sector participants. Per the Institute for Supply Management’s latest report, the Manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index touched 46.3% in March, reflecting a contraction in manufacturing activities for the fifth consecutive month. A figure below 50 indicates a contraction in manufacturing activity. The New Orders Index has remained in contraction territory for the past several months.Story continuesDespite easing, cost inflation remains a major challenge for industrial companies. An anticipated increase in raw material costs is expected to have affected the bottom-line performance of these companies. A stronger U.S. dollar might also have impacted the overseas business performance of these companies.Despite a slowdown in the manufacturing sector, strength across prominent end markets, such as life science, water &amp; wastewater, chemical, agricultural, food and energy industries, is expected to have aided performance. Cost-control measures, effective pricing and operational execution are expected to have driven the top line of industrial companies.Improving supply chains and faster deliveries, and better availability of raw materials are expected to have benefited performance in the to-be-reported quarter.How to Pick Winners?Given the large number of players operating in the transportation space, picking the right stocks is not an easy task.

94,8349e0c3-a771-335a-834a-19d9447903b3,SYY,2023-05-02,An Intrinsic Calculation For Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY) Suggests It's 39% Undervalued,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-sysco-corporation-nyse-130143503.html,1682859703,STORY,['SYY'],"[Key InsightsSysco's estimated fair value is US$126 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityCurrent share price of US$76.74 suggests Sysco is potentially 39% undervaluedOur fair value estimate is 44% higher than Sysco's analyst price target of US$87.36In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Sysco The ModelWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.85bUS$2.38bUS$2.72bUS$3.08bUS$3.27bUS$3.41bUS$3.53bUS$3.65bUS$3.75bUS$3.85bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x5Analyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 4.33%Est @ 3.66%Est @ 3.18%Est @ 2.85%Est @ 2.61% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.8% US$1.7kUS$2.1kUS$2.2kUS$2.4kUS$2.3kUS$2.3kUS$2.2kUS$2.1kUS$2.1kUS$2.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$21bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.8b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.8%– 2.1%) = US$82bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$82b÷ ( 1 + 6.8%)10= US$42bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$64b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$76.7, the company appears quite good value at a 39% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Sysco as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.803. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for SyscoStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Consumer Retailing market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM).

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Beverage Stocks To Buy. According to RSM US, over the next few months, food and beverage companies will encounter difficulties as consumers remain unsure about ongoing inflation, geopolitical problems, and the imminent recession. These obstacles are notably different from the time when people stocked up their pantries during the pandemic. The price increases implemented in 2022 and subsequently felt by consumers have already had an impact on their purchasing behavior. Despite spending more on food and beverage products than in previous years, households in the United States are buying less food for consumption at home compared to pre-COVID estimations.Food Business News reported that a majority of food and beverage industry executives who participated in a survey conducted by Marcum LLP in December 2022 expressed optimism for the upcoming year. The survey, which involved executives from food manufacturers, restaurants, distributors, retailers, and agriculture producers, covered various aspects crucial to the industry's well-being. The findings revealed that 69% of respondents held a positive outlook for the industry in the next year, while 20% expressed a neutral outlook, and 16% expressed a negative outlook. Approximately 70% of participants reported an increase in revenues in 2022 compared to 2021, with 48% indicating a revenue growth of 10% or higher.According to the survey, it is not just revenues that had seen an increase. 45% of food and beverage executives reported expanding their workforce by 5% or more in the last year, while 20% indicated a workforce growth of 10% or more. Additionally, nearly half of the respondents expressed their expectation to expand their workforce in 2023. As per Louis Biscotti, national leader of Marcum’s food and beverage group: “There is much optimism regarding the future of food and beverage companies. Honestly, this was a bit surprising to me considering the many challenges facing the industry.” Story continuesDon’t Miss: 15 Countries That Produce the Most AlcoholOn January 4, Food Processing Magazine cited Danny Edsall, grocery leader for consulting firm Deloitte, who said:“Perception is reality when it comes to consumers. Fair or not, more than half of consumers believe prices are going up more than needed in order to increase company profits. Our research also suggests that when consumers start to feel this way, they pull back on their spending intentions. It’s a matter of eroding trust and creates a tricky situation for food &amp; beverage companies facing pressure of their own from much higher input costs.”The vanishing of grocery promotions such as coupons, special discounts, and package deals has emerged as a highly apparent consequence of inflation. This matter has sparked disagreements between processors and retailers. Julie Oxner, senior vice president for business intelligence at consultancy Acosta, told Food Processing Magazine:“We believe that there is absolutely a sweet spot for processors and retailers to work together to alleviate some of the cost pressures shoppers experience. We’d recommend that the first step is to analyze current promotions to see which are a win-win for both the processor and the retailer.”Some of the best beverage stocks to invest in include PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST), and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO). Our Methodology We scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds and picked the top 10 companies that operate in the beverage sector with the highest number of hedge fund investors. These are the best beverage stocks to buy according to hedge funds.10 Best Beverage Stocks To BuyPhoto by Gio Bartlett on UnsplashBest Beverage Stocks To Buy10. Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 23Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) specializes in the production, marketing, and sale of alcoholic beverages. Their product portfolio includes a wide range of spirits such as scotch, whisky, gin, vodka, rum, tequila, and brandy. Some of their well-known brands include Johnnie Walker, Guinness, Tanqueray, Baileys, Smirnoff, Captain Morgan, and Crown Royal. The company's H1 2022 revenue reached £9.4 billion, showing an increase of 18.4%. This growth can be attributed to strong organic net sales and favorable effects from foreign exchange, mainly due to the strengthening of the US dollar. The reported operating profit also saw a notable growth of 15.2% to £3.2 billion. On April 18, Morgan Stanley analyst Pinar Ergun raised the firm's price target on Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) to 3,700 GBp from 3,600 GBp and maintained an Equal Weight rating on the shares.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 23 hedge funds were bullish on Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO), compared to 20 funds in the last quarter. Tom Gayner’s Markel Gayner Asset Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 1.35 million shares worth $240.6 million. Like PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST), and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) is one of the best beverage stocks to invest in. Here is what ClearBridge Aggressive Growth Strategy has to say about Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Diageo is a leading global distiller and brewer which addresses the large ($500 billion-plus) and fragmented market for spirits. With its portfolio of premium products, we see Diageo as a steady compounder poised for sustained, above industry growth. The company’s margins remain below pre-COVID levels in a number of geographies and should continue to recover as channels reopen, though we also see opportunities for consistent margin expansion beyond this period of rebound. The spirits category is not immune to weaker consumer spending nor inflation; however the majority of Diageo’s profits are from the U.S. market, which has historically been more resilient. Additionally, the company has a number of margin levers to help combat rising input costs.”9. The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (NYSE:SAM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 23The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (NYSE:SAM) is a US-based company that specializes in producing and selling alcoholic beverages. Their most well-known beer is Samuel Adams Boston Lager. They offer a variety of beers, hard ciders, flavored malt beverages, and hard seltzers under different brand names. The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (NYSE:SAM) is one of the best beverage stocks to invest in. On April 25, RBC Capital analyst Nik Modi kept a Sector Perform rating and a $300 price target on The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (NYSE:SAM) ahead of its Q1 results. The analyst noted that there is limited visibility for the company and anticipates significant pressure on shipments, depletions, margins, and earnings. This quarter will also be affected by the comparison to the launch of Truly Margarita a year ago. The analyst's research note indicates that Truly, one of The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (NYSE:SAM)’s brands, continues to struggle, with volumes declining over 30% in the March quarter and a further deceleration in two-year trends.According to Insider Monkey’s database, 23 hedge funds were bullish on The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (NYSE:SAM) at the end of December 2022, compared to 18 funds in the prior quarter. GLG Partners is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 44,365 shares worth $14.6 million. Here is what Artisan Mid-Cap Fund has to say about The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (NYSE:SAM) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“We ended our campaigns in Boston Beer Company. Boston Beer Company sells a focused portfolio of alcoholic beverage brands. In recent years, the company has emerged as one of the leaders in the hard seltzer category, which has grown over 150% in each of the past three years (2018-2020). Boston Beer’s Truly brand, the second-largest seller of hard seltzer, has benefited from this growth and was core to our investment thesis. However, the hard seltzer category’s growth has recently slowed to single digits, falling short of high investor expectations and pressuring Boston Beer’s earnings upside. Truly’s growth was core to our investment thesis, and a recovery is uncertain; thus, we ended our investment campaign.”8. MGP Ingredients, Inc. (NASDAQ:MGPI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25MGP Ingredients, Inc. (NASDAQ:MGPI) specializes in the production and distribution of distilled spirits, branded spirits, and food ingredients. Their operations are divided into three segments – Distillery Solutions, Branded Spirits, and Ingredient Solutions. On February 23, MGP Ingredients, Inc. (NASDAQ:MGPI) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $1.01 and a revenue of $191 million, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.16 and $7.14 million, respectively. In fiscal 2023, sales are projected to be in the range of $815 million to $835 million, versus an $823.95 million consensus. MGP Ingredients, Inc. (NASDAQ:MGPI) expects adjusted basic earnings per common share to be in the $5.05 to $5.20 range, compared to a $5.11 consensus. On February 2, Wells Fargo analyst Marc Torrente reiterated an Overweight rating on MGP Ingredients, Inc. (NASDAQ:MGPI) but lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $118 from $128. Wells Fargo acknowledged that the stock has declined due to concerns about the normalization of the category. However, the firm believes that MGP Ingredients, Inc. (NASDAQ:MGPI) has the potential to be more resilient than it is currently given credit for, thanks to its strategic positioning. Consequently, while Wells Fargo has moderated its price target and sales outlook considering this uncertainty, they still have confidence in MGP's ability to perform well.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 25 hedge funds were bullish on MGP Ingredients, Inc. (NASDAQ:MGPI), compared to 19 funds in the prior quarter. Richard Driehaus’ Driehaus Capital is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 477,203 shares worth $50.7 million. Here is what Harding Loevner specifically said about MGP Ingredients, Inc. (NASDAQ:MGPI) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“By region, our performance was aided by a renewed market preference for higher-quality small caps in the US, where the portfolio had its best stock selection. Shares of discount retailer Ollie’s Bargain Outlet rebounded from their first-quarter decline while shares of MGP Ingredients, Inc. (NASDAQ:MGPI) reached an all-time high. Ollie’s expects to benefit from the excess inventory at other retailers given its focus on closeout merchandise. MGP Ingredients posted record growth and margin expansion on strong demand for its aged whiskey as well as specialty wheat starches and proteins used in food products.”7. Molson Coors Beverage Company (NYSE:TAP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29Molson Coors Beverage Company (NYSE:TAP) is involved in the production, marketing, and distribution of beer and other malt beverage products across different regions such as the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Asia Pacific. In the fourth quarter, there was a significant 59.3% increase in underlying net income, considering constant currency rates. This positive result demonstrates Molson Coors Beverage Company (NYSE:TAP)’s ability to meet its bottom-line guidance for the full year. It is one of the best beverage stocks to invest in. On April 14, Lauren Lieberman, an analyst at Barclays, increased the price target for Molson Coors Beverage Company (NYSE:TAP) from $50 to $52. Despite this adjustment, Lieberman maintained an ""Equal Weight"" rating for the company's shares as they anticipate the release of the Q1 results. When considering the firm's staples universe, the analyst has a preference for companies that have a clearer path to volume growth. This can be achieved either through increased exposure to the relevant market category or through unique and specific factors that positively impact the company's performance.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 29 hedge funds were bullish on Molson Coors Beverage Company (NYSE:TAP), compared to 34 funds in the prior quarter. Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with nearly 2 million shares worth $99 million. Here is what Argosy Investors has to say about Molson Coors Beverage Company (NYSE:TAP) in its Q2 2021 investor letter:“TAP (+52% from August 2020 purchase to sale) was never intended to be a core position. I expected a couple of years of deleveraging and perhaps some excitement around the hard seltzer category, but the stock price increased faster than I expected. I have not fully exited these positions as I rarely do all in one trade, but hopefully this gives some perspective into my thinking on selling so quickly.”6. Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 31Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP) is a beverage company that operates both within the United States and internationally. The company is divided into four distinct segments – Coffee Systems, Packaged Beverages, Beverage Concentrates, and Latin America Beverages. On April 27, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP) reported earnings for the first quarter of 2023. The company announced a Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $0.34 and a revenue of $3.35 billion, topping Wall Street estimates by $0.01 and $60 million, respectively. On April 25, Nik Modi, an analyst at RBC Capital, maintained an Outperform rating and a price target of $42 for Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP) as the company prepares to release its Q1 results. According to the analyst's research note, the analyst expects Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP) to surpass the consensus expectations. The overall narrative for the stock, as per the analyst, remains consistent. The packaged beverages segment is experiencing stable growth, while the coffee segment continues to face challenges due to the ongoing normalization process.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 31 hedge funds were bullish on Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP), compared to 23 funds in the prior quarter. Harris Associates is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 3.17 million shares worth $113.25 million. In addition to PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST), and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP) is one of the top beverage stocks to watch. Oakmark Funds made the following comment about Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“We sold the remainder of our Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP) shares in the quarter. As a consumer staples company, Keurig’s shares have held up very well in a difficult market and, as a result, its relative valuation was no longer as compelling as other investment opportunities. We would be happy to own the company again at the right price.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Beverage Stocks To Buy.  Suggested articles:10 Best Semiconductor Equipment Stocks to Buy15 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold for 3 Years12 Most Popular Retail Investor Stocks in 2023 Disclosure: None. 10 Best Beverage Stocks To Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

(NYSE:PM) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Philip Morris International The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Philip Morris InternationalIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive Chairman of the Board, Andre Calantzopoulos, sold US$8.0m worth of shares at a price of US$100 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$99.35. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.Insiders in Philip Morris International didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.

In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of Philip Morris InternationalFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Philip Morris International insiders own about US$221m worth of shares (which is 0.1% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Philip Morris International Tell Us?Insiders sold Philip Morris International shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company.

106,17d200f7-3e64-3278-bb88-c120b162357b,PM,2023-05-02,UPDATE 2-Australia to ban recreational vaping in e-cigarette crackdown,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-australia-ban-recreational-vaping-041652132.html,1683001012,STORY,['PM'],"[(Updates with comment from Philip Morris, paragraphs 8-10)By Renju JoseSYDNEY, May 2 (Reuters) - Australia said on Tuesday it will ban recreational vaping and tighten other aspects of e-cigarette laws in the biggest crackdown on the tobacco industry in more than a decade to try to stop an alarming rise in teenage vaping.The government aims to ban all disposable vapes, which often comes in fruity flavours, ban the import of non-prescription vapes and limit nicotine levels, aiming for the sale of vapes to be confined to helping smokers quit.""Just like they did with smoking, Big Tobacco has taken another addictive product, wrapped it in shiny packaging and added flavours to create a new generation of nicotine addicts,"" Health Minister Mark Butler said in a speech at the National Press Club.Vaping, widely seen as a safer alternative to smoking cigarettes and useful for helping smokers quit, involves heating a liquid that contains nicotine in what is called an e-cigarette and turning it into a vapour that users inhale.But studies have shown the potential of long-term harm from the addictive e-cigarettes.Under the new rules, vapes will be sold only in pharmacies and require ""pharmaceutical-type"" packaging. Disposable vapes popular with young people will also be banned.Though a prescription is needed to buy nicotine vapes in Australia, lax border enforcement and a thriving illegal market mean they are readily available in convenience stores and other outlets.Major vape manufacturer Philip Morris welcomed the crackdown on such shops.""Nicotine vaping products sold in corner stores have always been illegal,"" a spokesperson for the company said.""We have been urging enforcement against these illegal products for several years and hope this will now happen.""Butler said vaping had become a recreational product in Australia, mostly sold to teenagers and young people, who are three times as likely to take up smoking.Story continues""This is a product targeted at our kids, sold alongside lollies and chocolate bars,"" Butler said. ""Vaping has now become the number one behavioural issue in high schools. And it's becoming widespread in primary schools as well.""TOUGH ON SMOKINGDoctors backed the vaping crackdown but urged the government to do more to limit the number of young people taking it up.""Nicotine vaping products are being sold featuring colourful flavours and we have even seen products featuring the same type of imagery as children's breakfast cereal including cartoon characters,"" said Nicole Higgins, president of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners.About 22% of Australians aged 18-24 have used an e-cigarette or vaping device at least once, data last year showed.The federal budget, due out next week, will include A$234 million ($155 million) for measures to protect against the harm caused by tobacco and vaping.Australia has one of the toughest anti-smoking laws in the world.In 2012, it became the first country to force cigarette producers to abandon distinct, colourful branding and sell their products in uniformly drab packets.Tobacco firms were quick to switch to e-cigarettes that offer different flavours and created designs targeting a new generation of users.Butler said the government had no plan to follow neighbouring New Zealand in banning cigarette sales for future generations but said the tax on tobacco would be raised by 5% a year over the next three years in a bid to curb sales.Some countries have tried to restrict vaping and some see it as a good way to get smokers to kick the habit.Britain said in April up to one million smokers would be encouraged to swap cigarettes for vapes, in what was a world first, offering financial incentives for pregnant women and providing e-cigarette starter kits to help.

These industries are experiencing significant growth due to various factors such as innovation, technological advancements, demographic shifts, and changing consumer preferences.  According to a data collected by Statista, regional banking has the highest profit margin of any American industry as of January 2023, with a profit margin of 30.31%. With a net profit margin of 26.32%, the profitability of non-bank financial services, including insurance services was not too far off. The Evolution Of The Most Profitable Industries In America  Despite the potential for growth and profitability, the most profitable industries in America in 2023 also face several challenges. In recent years, the big players in commercial banking industry have faced several challenges, including increased regulation in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, and the rise of fintech startups offering alternative banking solutions. Commercial banks have had to adapt to these changes by investing in technology and digital platforms to improve efficiency and better serve customers.  Despite these challenges, the commercial banking industry remains a vital part of the US economy, providing access to credit and other financial services that support businesses and individuals. Similarly, the technology Industry in the US has long been recognized for its high growth potential and ability to generate lucrative returns. Many of the world's largest and most profitable companies, such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) are three of the biggest players in the tech industry. The industry has benefited from ongoing technological advancements, innovation, and disruption in various sectors of the economy, including e-commerce, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and mobile technology. Story continuesAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a leading cloud computing platform, that provides computing power, storage, and other services to businesses of all sizes. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s web services has transformed the way companies build and deploy applications, and has had a significant impact on the tech industry. On the other hand, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has been a leader in the development of artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) technologies. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s AI and ML capabilities are used in a variety of applications, from search and advertising to healthcare and self-driving cars. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) also owns DeepMind, a British AI company known for AlphaTensor and AlphaFold.Similarly, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been at the forefront of innovation in the tech industry, with products like the iPhone and iPad, revolutionizing the way people interact with technology. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s focus on innovation has inspired other companies to push the boundaries of what's possible. All these companies have largely contributed in the technological industry, making it one of the leading industries today. However, the tech industry is not immune to market downturns. For example, during the dot-com bubble of the early 2000s, many tech companies experienced significant losses, as investors pulled out of overvalued stocks. Similarly, during the global financial crisis of 2008, the tech industry experienced a significant downturn as consumer spending declined and companies cut back on investment in new technology.  In more recent times, the COVID-19 pandemic has also had a significant impact on the tech industry. While many tech companies initially experienced a surge in demand, as people shifted to remote work and increased online shopping, the industry has since experienced significant volatility due to inflation and the subsequent rate hikes. Recently, the number of layoffs in the tech sector soared by 649% in 2022, reaching levels not seen since the dot-com bubble bust. When it comes to market downturns but industry outperformance, pure-value industries can’t be left behind. Pure value industries that manufacture and supply consumer staples such as food, beverages, household and personal care products, and pharmaceuticals are considered essential and tend to outperform even in tougher market conditions.During market downturns, consumers tend to prioritize their spending on essential goods, such as food and personal care products, over discretionary items. As a result, companies in the consumer staples industry are less affected by economic downturns and tend to experience less volatility in their stock prices. According to Simply Wall,  earnings in the consumer-staples sector is projected to grow 11% annually.15 Most Profitable Industries In America In 2023 Pixabay/Public DomainOur Methodology  Based on the total net margin for 2023, for which the data is publicly available, we have listed the top 15 most profitable industries in America in 2023 in ascending order.

It’s cornered the market on water technology companies, marketing three of the top water exchange-traded funds (ETFs) listed on U.S. stock exchanges: Invesco Water Resources ETF (NASDAQ:PHO), Invesco S&amp;P Global Water Index ETF (NYSEARCA:CGW) and Invesco Global Water ETF (NASDAQ:PIO).According to an Invesco white paper, global water resources fell by 56% between 1962 and 2014. Water scarcity solutions have become one of the world’s biggest priorities. The World Economic Forum estimates that $26.4 trillion will have to be spent on water infrastructure between now and 2030. Investing in the water sector makes sense for those who feel the world can be pulled back from the brink. With that in mind, I’ve selected three water tech stocks from the top 10 holdings of the previously mentioned ETFs. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsROPRoper Technologies$452.98WTRGEssential Utilities$42.85DHRDanaher$231.47Roper Technologies (ROP)the interior of a water utility processing plantSource: ShutterstockRoper Technologies (NYSE:ROP) is the second-largest holding of PHO with an 8.3% weighting. The diversified technology company makes water meters, among myriad other technology-enabled products and software. Its Neptune water meters enable utilities to remotely monitor customers’ water usage. Like many of Roper’s businesses, it acquired Neptune, paying around $482 million for the company in October 2003. Neptune’s data collection systems are used to read more than 72 million meters per month. “Because water meters are a utility’s cash registers, the solution begins with measurement integrity at each water meter,” the company’s website states. Roper just delivered another earnings beat when it reported first-quarter results today. The company earned $3.90 per share versus the $3.85 per share analysts were expecting. Revenue also exceeded estimates, up nearly 15% year over year to $1.47 billion. That is in line with its three-year compound annual growth (CAGR). Adjusted EBITDA, meanwhile, has grown at a compound annual rate of 18% over the past three years.Story continuesWhile shares are down about 9% over the past year, they have rallied 27% since bottoming out in mid-October. Twelve of the 19 analysts covering the stock rate it “overweight” or “buy,” with an average target price of $503.13. That implies upside of 11% from where shares currently trade.Roper is a solid, diversified company and a great way to dip your toe into investing in the water sector. Essential Utilities (WTRG)A zoomed in photo of a drop of water hitting a container of water's surface.Source: Sambulov Yevgeniy/ShutterStock.comEssential Utilities (NYSE:WTRG) is the third-largest holding of CGW with a 5.9% weighting. When I first saw Essential Utilities in the fund’s top 10 holdings, I scratched my head, trying to recall how I knew this water utility. Once upon a time, it went by the name Aqua America. However, it changed its name to Essential Utilities in early 2020 after acquiring  Pittsburgh-based natural gas distribution company Peoples Gas for an estimated $4.3 billion. I wrote about Aqua America in August 2019 as one of 10 mid-cap dividend stocks to buy. My rationale for recommending the stock was that Peoples Gas gave the company another avenue for growth. In 2022, Essential Utilities grew operating revenue by 21.8% to $2.29 billion, while earnings per share of $1.77 were 6% higher than in 2021. Management expects to invest $1.1 billion a year through 2025 on infrastructure so it can continue to grow. And analysts are calling for revenue and earnings growth of 10.8% and 13.2%, respectively, this year. In addition to healthy financial results, WTRG yields 2.7%, making it an excellent, low-risk dividend stock.    Danaher (DHR)image of laptop screen displaying danaher (DHR) websiteSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comDanaher (NYSE:DHR) is the second-largest holding of PIO with a 7.6% weighting. The diversified company makes products in the environmental, life sciences and diagnostics fields. In September, Danaher announced that it plans to spin off its Danaher Water Quality Platform into a separate company, along with its product identification business, by the end of the year.Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Rainer Blair said the new company “will be advantaged as a standalone company with greater opportunities to pursue high-impact organic and inorganic investments.”And as GuruFocus’ Margaret Moran notes: “Danaher’s spinoff looks especially promising because it will become one of the few names on the market that is primarily focused on water quality and water management solutions in a world where water shortages are expected to become commonplace over the next couple of decades.”The stock has underperformed recently, down 13% year to date. This includes a nearly 9% single-day drop following the release of the company’s first-quarter results on April. 25. While it beat on the top and bottom lines, reporting adjusted earnings of $2.36 per share on revenue of $7.2 billion, management lowered its outlook for the full year.“We had a good start to the year in the first quarter,” Blair said. “Our team’s focused execution in a challenging operating environment helped deliver better-than-expected revenue, earnings and cash flow. We are especially pleased with the performance of our base business, which grew 6.0% in the first quarter.”Analysts weren’t as pleased. Bank of America downgraded DHR stock to “neutral” from “buy” on the news. Yet, from where I sit, Danaher is a beast of a company that has outperformed over the long term. It, like Roper, has its hands in a lot of pies. With trailing 12-month free cash flow of $7.32 billion, it has a free cash flow yield of 4.3%, which makes its stock fair value in my book. And the upcoming spinoff could unlock additional shareholder value.On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The potential startup of phase 1 in expected in 2027. The production process at Fort Saskatchewan will convert cracker off-gas into hydrogen as a clean fuel, which will be utilized in the ethylene production process.Under the agreement, Linde will complete the design and engineering for a world-scale air separation and autothermal reformer complex owned and operated by the company. The complex will be integrated with its existing Fort Saskatchewan operations.Dow, which is among the prominent players in the chemical space along with Eastman Chemical Company EMN, PPG Industries, Inc. PPG and Celanese Corporation CE, said that the ethylene cracker and derivatives complex will decarbonize roughly 20% of its global ethylene capacity while increasing its global polyethylene supply by around 15%. It is also expected to support around $1 billion of EBITDA growth across the value chain by 2030.Dow topped earnings and revenue estimates in the first quarter of 2023. However, the company’s revenues declined roughly 22% year over year in the quarter as it saw lower sales across its segments in the quarter due to weaker macroeconomic activity globally. The top line was hurt by lower local pricing, reduced volumes and unfavorable currency translation. Dow witnessed lower demand in industrial, consumer durables, and building and construction applications.The company said that its disciplined execution has enhanced its ability to navigate the impact of higher inflation on consumer demand and weak global economic activity through the balance of 2023.

It will also be Alberta's first commercial-scale hydrogen refueling station.This station is the next stage in Air Products' commitment to Edmonton and the province of Alberta. It will serve as a model that can be developed across Canada to foster the hydrogen economy, reduce emissions and support Canada in achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. The hydrogen refueling station is partially funded by Natural Resources Canada's Zero Emission Vehicle Infrastructure Program.The new station will have two hydrogen refueling lanes with dispensers for heavy-duty vehicles, such as commercial and municipal trucks, alongside Air Products' own truck fleet, with a filling time comparable to conventionally fueled heavy-duty trucks.The station will also feature two spots for light-duty hydrogen fuel cell vehicles to refuel. The advanced, high-capacity, high-efficiency station will be available to retail consumers and is slated to open in early 2025. The station will have a daily capacity of up to six tons of hydrogen using registered compression technology. It will be located in Northeast Edmonton near Air Products' transformative new net-zero hydrogen energy complex.The facility will make use of cutting-edge process technology that makes it possible to effectively capture more than 90% of carbon emissions for permanent sequestration safely underground. Additionally, the project includes a power generation unit that runs entirely on hydrogen to avoid the indirect emissions linked to using grid electricity. This enormous unit powers the manufacturing complex and provides clean energy to the Alberta grid.With the assistance of innovative engineering, the complex will also be connected with Imperial Oil Limited's new facility for producing renewable diesel locally. Using an approach that produces a biogenic renewable off-gas (ROG) by-product, Imperial will produce renewable diesel from locally obtained non-petroleum feedstocks. This ROG can substitute natural gas and improve the overall carbon emissions profile by being utilized as a feedstock in the Air Products hydrogen complex. The remaining 10% required to reach net-zero at the new hydrogen production facility is more than offset by the use of a renewable feedstock and power export.In order to aid customers in the refining and petrochemical industries in lowering the carbon intensity of their operations and products, the net-zero facility will connect to Air Products' current 55-kilometer pipeline network in the Alberta Heartland.Air Products, one of the major players in the chemicals space, along with Eastman Chemical Company EMN, Celanese Corporation CE and PPG Industries, Inc. PPG, currently operates three hydrogen production facilities in Alberta. It also has a hydrogen production facility, a 30-kilometer pipeline network and a liquefaction facility in Sarnia, Ontario.Additionally, Air Products has made plans to establish a new project delivery office in Edmonton. The engineering, product, process gas and air separation unit product line functions will all be housed in the Global Engineering and Manufacturing Technology Equipment office.Air Products, on its fiscal first-quarter call, said that it expects full-year fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $11.20-$11.50, indicating 9-12% year-over-year growth. For the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the company expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $2.50-$2.70, suggesting a rise of 7-15% from the year-ago quarter.Another prominent chemical maker, Eastman Chemical, recently delivered forecast-topping earnings performance in the first quarter. EMN’s adjusted EPS of $1.63 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.22. The company expects adjusted EPS for full-year 2023 to grow between 5% and 15%.PPG Industries’ first-quarter adjusted EPS of $1.82 also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.55, aided by pricing growth across segments, improved manufacturing efficiencies and overall cost discipline. PPG projects adjusted earnings of $6.95-$7.25 per share for 2023.Celanese is slated to report first-quarter earnings on May 9. CE, on its fourth-quarter call, said that it expects adjusted earnings of $1.50-$1.75 per share for the first quarter of 2023.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Welcome to Global Payments First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to your host, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Winnie Smith. Please go ahead, Winnie.Winnie SmithGood morning, and welcome to Global Payments First Quarter 2023 Conference Call. Our earnings release and the slides that accompany this call can be found on the Investor Relations area of our website at www.globalpayments.com. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of the comments made by management during today's conference call contain forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, including the impact of economic conditions on our future operations that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our most recent 10-K and subsequent filings. We caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements. Forward-looking statements during this call speak only as of the date of this call, and we undertake no obligation to update them. We will also be referring to several non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are more reflective of our ongoing performance. For a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this call to the most comparable GAAP measure in accordance with SEC regulations, please see our press release furnished as an exhibit to our Form 8-K filed this morning and our supplemental materials available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Joining me on the call are Jeff Sloan, CEO; Cameron Bready, President and COO; and Josh Whipple, Senior Executive Vice President and CFO. Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff.Story continuesJeffrey S. SloanThanks, Winnie. We are pleased to have delivered our best first quarter in 4 years, exceeding our expectations to start 2023 despite continuing macro uncertainties. Our ongoing businesses produced adjusted net revenue growth, adjusted operating margin expansion and adjusted earnings per share growth, consistent with our cycle guidance once again. This performance reflects the wisdom of our strategies and our consistent focus on execution. We accomplished these results while also turning the page on our strategic initiatives. First, we are delighted to have closed our acquisition of EVO Payments in late March, and we are already off to a strong start. Cameron will provide more details on our integration efforts now underway, so let me preface his comments by saying that we remain as excited about the many opportunities we have together as we were at the time we announced the transaction 9 months ago. I am delighted to officially welcome EVO's valued team members to the Global Payments family. We are pleased to have also recently completed the divestitures of Netspend consumer assets and our Gaming Solutions business. With the successful execution of these transactions, we are focused on managing our go-forward business composition, with Merchant Solutions representing approximately 75% of our adjusted net revenue and Issuer Solutions, including B2B, comprising roughly 25%. This platform provides us the ideal set core capabilities from which to grow for many years to come. Both issuer and merchant posted exceptional results for the first quarter. Starting with Issuer Solutions, our core business again generated substantial sequential financial and operating improvement, achieving high single-digit growth and marking its best quarterly performance in more than 5 years. It is worth highlighting that our core customer base consists of money center and systemically important financial institutions globally. We believe that we've been the beneficiary of incremental depositary flows for larger institutions, combined with several significant implementations during the quarter, which we expect to provide tailwinds for some time to come. Year-over-year, consumer transaction volumes grew into the double digits. Our commercial part business also continued to perform, with transactions growing nearly 25% in the first quarter as cross-border and domestic corporate travel continued its recovery trajectory. Traditional accounts on file increased by roughly 20 million sequentially and double digits from the prior year to a new record due to strong conversion execution of new accounts and growth with existing customers. Our decade-long strategy of aligning with market share winners continues to bear fruit. And I think it's clear at this point that the legacy versus fintech hypothesis from 2021 has now been thoroughly debunked and turned on its head. We're delighted that we successfully converted a significant portion of one of the top 10 commercial banks in the United States in early March. This win was a double competitive takeaway early after the announcement of our merger. We also completed the conversion of the Postbank portfolio in April. And in collaboration with AWS, we successfully deployed our cloud-based data and analytics platform for a leading financial institution partner in the United States. Finally, we are pleased to have signed multiyear extensions with M&amp;T Bank as well as another long-standing U.S.-based FI partner during the quarter. We currently have 9 letters of intent with institutions worldwide, nearly all of which were achieved through a competitive RFP process. Turning to B2B. We continue to drive strong growth with both corporates and financial institutions as we leverage our virtual card, MineralTree AP automation and employer solution capabilities. This quarter, we achieved record supplier enrollments as middle-market companies further digitize their payments. It's worth noting that MineralTree delivered normalized growth of roughly 20% for the period, and we continue to expect near 30% growth for this business in calendar 2023. We are proud of the resiliency of our merchant business, which delivered double-digit growth, excluding dispositions and the 1-week contribution from EVO. This performance was achieved despite incremental macro uncertainties driven by the banking crisis that developed in the latter part of the quarter. Standouts for the period again include our worldwide e-commerce and omnichannel businesses, with growth accelerating to the high teens. Speaking of UCP, we are making great progress in our partnership with Spring by Citi that now spans North America, the U.K. and Continental Europe. We are currently live across 14 countries and run rating at more than 100 million transactions and over $3 billion in volume annually. And based on our pipeline with many of Citi's largest treasury and trade solutions customers, we are on track to more than double our volume together by the end of 2023. We also continue to see strong trends in our integrated business in the U.S., which grew at a mid-teens rate with sustained rates of accelerated growth. We also produced a record quarter for new sales in this channel, demonstrating ongoing strong demand for our solutions. Additionally, vertical markets achieved double-digit growth led by School Solutions, Zego in real estate and Xenial in quick service restaurants and stadiums. After announcing our partnership with the Braves last quarter, we were excited to have gone live with our Xenial cloud point-of-sale solutions on April 6, opening day for Truist Park. And we are pleased to have reached agreement with a leading parks and entertainment company to provide both our Xenial food and beverage solutions as well as our retail solutions at all of its theme park locations across the United States. Our pipeline remains full across our fixed service restaurant and sports and entertainment businesses. Stay tuned. Outside the United States, our Asia-Pacific business produced its best first quarter since 2018 as COVID-related restrictions were lifted at the end of 2022, including in Greater China. We continue to see strong trends in other faster-growth geographies, such as Spain and Central Europe, and we are excited to enhance our scale with EVO in these markets. We also had several successful product launches during the quarter in Europe, including our point-of-sale solution in Central Europe and our tap-on-phone solution in the U.K. These all bode well for the cross-sell opportunities with EVO. Before I turn over to Cameron, I'd like to address the announcement of my departure as CEO of Global Payments effective June 1 and the appointment of Cameron Bready as our next CEO. I've known Cameron personally for 9 years, and he has held the most senior and trusted positions in our company during that time, first, as our CFO and today as our President and COO. Cameron is an outstanding leader and the right person to succeed me. I have every confidence in his and our company's [continued pursuit for] future success and will do everything I can to ensure a smooth transition to Cameron over the coming weeks. Now is the right time for us to execute on our succession plans. We recently closed on all 3 of our strategic transactions, and we produced our best first quarter in 4 years with our first beaten raise in 18 months. Our businesses are exceptionally healthy. We delivered on a heightened cycle guidance in 2022 and are poised to do the same in 2023, excluding, of course, dispositions. While challenges undoubtedly remain, we are on a path to return to normalcy, as I suggested and hoped for on our February call. When we arrived at Global Payments 13 years ago, we had many strengths, but we lacked direct distribution, scale and e-commerce, a B2B strategy, and we have much legacy technology debt to repay. Now roughly 10 years after I became CEO, we have distinctive software assets owned and partnered, a market-leading e-comm and omnichannel presence, enhanced exposure to faster-growth markets and sizable B2B assets. We couple distinctive distribution with a solid technology footprint and unique multiyear collaborations with both AWS and Google. Finally and importantly, over the last 9.5 years since we've been running the company, GPN stock has compounded at nearly 16.5% annually, 650 basis points in excess of the S&amp;P 500 Index and 300 basis points in excess of our peers despite all the turmoil over the last 3 years. Simply put, we've accomplished our goals. I'll now turn the call to Cameron.Cameron M. BreadyThanks, Jeff, and good morning. Let me start by acknowledging what an honor and privilege it is for me to be named the next CEO of Global Payments. I'm grateful for the Board's confidence in me leading the company going forward, and I look forward to working with all of you in this capacity, continuing what has been a long history of outstanding leadership at Global Payments. On behalf of the 27,000 team members of Global Payments, I also want to thank Jeff for his leadership as CEO over the past decade. The transformation under the business -- under his stewardship has been remarkable, and it shaped the company into the payments technology powerhouse it is today. Further, on a more personal note, I want to express my sincere appreciation for his mentorship and friendship during my time here at Global Payments. Jeff and I have worked side by side over my 9 years at the company and, importantly, have been completely aligned on the 4-pillar strategy we articulated at our investor conference roughly 18 months ago. We remain committed to this strategy as we endeavor to build the leading technology-enabled, software-driven payments business worldwide. Having now closed the acquisition of EVO and the divestitures of our Netspend consumer and Gaming Solutions businesses, we have completed our strategic pivot. I'm delighted to be taking over at a time when our business now reflects the simpler model more geared towards our corporate customers we've been foreshadowing since August of last year. Over the next month, Jeff and I will work closely to ensure a smooth and orderly transition. I look forward to continuing the company's rich history of investing strategically to drive differentiated growth and value for our shareholders, customers and team members while fostering a culture that is second to none and enhancing our corporate citizenship in the communities in which we live and work around the globe. With that, I would like to echo Jeff's remarks welcoming EVO team members to Global Payments. While we are still in the early days, we have made substantial progress on our integration and remain enthusiastic about the synergy opportunities available. Since announcing the transaction in August, we have an ample time to formulate integration plans and prepare for day 1, allowing us to truly hit the ground running. We have established a robust leadership and governance structure, as we do with all of our acquisitions, which has resulted in a smooth transition and enabled us to implement early actions that align with our targets. I'm pleased to report that we currently have executable plans to achieve the run rate EBITDA synergy target of at least $125 million within 2 years that we committed to at the time of the announcement. The substantial expense synergy opportunities are expected to come primarily from aligning our business operations and go-to-market strategies, streamlining technology infrastructure, eliminating duplicative corporate and operational support structures and realizing scale efficiencies. As always, we remain focused on sizing expense synergy expectations with an eye towards ensuring that we maintain momentum in the combined business and that it is well positioned to continue to grow and expand in the future. And regarding the potential revenue enhancements, I will start by reiterating that as one company, we are uniquely positioned to deliver an unmatched suite of distinctive software and payment solutions to our combined customer base globally. More specifically, I would highlight 3 broad categories that we believe provide us with ample run rate to drive revenue synergies from the acquisition. First, we see significant opportunity to bring further value to EVO's relationships by leveraging our extensive distribution platforms and product portfolio as well as our unique partner integration capabilities. This includes our point-of-sale technologies, commerce-enablement solutions and vertical market software offerings. As one example, we are bringing our point-of-sale software to key international markets where we overlap with EVO, including the U.K., Spain and Central Europe. We plan to cross sell our point-of-sale software into EVO's customer base in these geographies as well as bring these capabilities to EVO markets where we do not overlap today, including Mexico, Ireland, Poland and Greece. Second, we expect to capitalize on our ability to provide EVO's multinational customers e-commerce and omnichannel solutions across markets and geographies, seamlessly blending their physical and virtual requirements. With our combined physical presence in over 40 countries globally and the ability to transact in over 170 virtually, we can significantly expand EVO's value proposition to its existing customers. We have already initiated a discussion with some of EVO's largest MNC clients to explore opportunities to support them in additional markets around the world. Third, EVO's accounts receivable automation software and B2B payment solutions augment our existing accounts payable automation and other capabilities, rounding out our full suite of B2B offerings. Together with EVO, we are well positioned to further grow and scale our B2B portfolio, particularly on the acceptance side, which includes leveraging EVO's extensive proprietary integrations to some of the most widely used ERP environments in the marketplace through its PayFabric platform. We could not be more excited about the many opportunities we have together with EVO given its alignment with our overarching strategy, further reinforcing our position as the preeminent payments technology company with extensive scale and unmatched global reach. Josh?Joshua J. WhippleThanks, Cameron. We are pleased with our strong financial performance in the first quarter, which exceeded our expectations despite ongoing macro concerns, highlighting the strength and durability of our business. Specifically, we delivered adjusted net revenue of $2.05 billion, an increase of 6.5% from the same period in the prior year on a constant currency basis. Excluding the impact of dispositions and roughly 1 week of contribution from EVO, adjusted net revenue increased 9% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter increased 200 basis points to 43.1%. The net result was adjusted earnings per share of $2.40, an increase of 18% on a constant currency basis compared to the same period in 2022. Taking a closer look at performance by segment. Merchant Solutions achieved adjusted net revenue of $1.46 billion for the first quarter, with constant currency growth of 10%, excluding dispositions and the contribution from EVO. This performance was led by the ongoing strength of our technology-enabled businesses while we benefited from a recovery in Asia Pacific as COVID restrictions eased across Greater China markets. We also saw consistent double-digit growth from our vertical market, POS and payroll businesses. This strength was partially offset by ongoing headwinds from adverse foreign currency exchange rates along with macro softness in limited geographies, including the U.K. We delivered an adjusted operating margin of 47.3% in the segment, consistent with last year. Excluding the impact of EVO's close in March, adjusted operating margin expanded 25 basis points and was in line with our expectations. We are pleased with the fundamental performance of our Issuer Solutions business in the first quarter, which produced adjusted net revenue of $490 million, reflecting growth of 7.2% on a constant currency basis. Notably, core issuer grew high single digits this quarter, excluding the impact of FX, which was over 300-basis point acceleration sequentially. As Jeff highlighted, traditional accounts on file increased by approximately 20 million sequentially, driven by strong account growth from our major consumer portfolio customers as well as several portfolio conversions we successfully completed during the period. Transactions also grew double digits compared to the first quarter of 2022, with strong contributions coming from both commercial and consumer card transactions. Finally, we delivered adjusted operating margins of 43.9% and an increase of 80 basis points from the prior year fueled by our accelerated growth. As for adjusted free cash flow, consistent with the prior period, we converted approximately 80% of adjusted earnings into adjusted free cash flow. We continue to target converting roughly 100% of adjusted earnings for the full year, excluding the impact of the timing change related to recognition of research and development tax credits. We expect our adjusted free cash flow conversion for the year to follow a similar trajectory as 2022. We invested $162 million in capital expenditures during the quarter and continue to expect capital spending to be around $630 million in 2023, consistent with our long-term targets. This quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.1 million of our shares for roughly $200 million, which was executed prior to the closing of our acquisition of EVO Payments on March 24. To help fund the EVO transaction, in early March we successfully priced an EUR 800 million inaugural European debt offering at a fixed rate coupon of 4.875% due in 2031. With this transaction, we continue to evolve our capital structure to align with our global operations and gain access to a broader investor base and new sources of capital. Separately, in January, we established a $2 billion commercial paper program. The CP program is supported by our revolving credit agreement. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $1 billion of commercial paper outstanding. We currently have in excess of $3 billion of available liquidity. Following the aforementioned capital markets transactions and drawing on the revolver to close EVO, our total indebtedness is approximately 90% fixed with a weighted average cost of debt of 3.8%. We are also delighted to have closed both the divestiture of Netspend's consumer assets and the sale of the Gaming Solutions business in April. Following all of these transactions, our balance sheet remains healthy, and our leverage position is roughly 3.8x currently. We continue to expect to return to a similar leverage level to where we ended 2022 by year-end 2023 while maintaining existing investment-grade ratings. We are pleased with how our business is positioned following our first quarter performance, and we are raising our financial outlook for the year. We now expect reported adjusted net revenue to range from $8.635 billion to $8.735 billion, reflecting growth of 7% to 8% over 2022, an increase from 6% to 7% previously. We continue to forecast annual adjusted operating margin to expand by up to 120 basis points for 2023. As a reminder, this is above our cycle guidance for margin expansion of 50 to 75 basis points annually driven by benefits to our business mix from our ongoing shift towards technology enablement and the divestiture of Netspend, partially offset by the lower-margin profile of EVO prior to full synergy realization. To provide color at the segment level, we continue to anticipate our merchant segment to report adjusted net revenue growth of roughly 15% to 16% for the full year but now expect to be toward the higher end of that range. We continue to expect more than 100 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion from the existing Global Payments merchant business excluding dispositions in 2023, which again is ahead of our cycle guide. We expect this expansion will be more than offset beginning in the second quarter with the absorption of the lower-margin profile of EVO Payments. We anticipate this impact to be mitigated by synergy realization as the year progresses. As a result, we are forecasting margin contraction in the second and third quarters and then margin expansion in Q4 as synergies ramp for our merchant business. The net result will be a modest decline in our total merchant business reported adjusted operating margin for the year, consistent with our prior guidance. Moving to Issuer Solutions. We now expect to deliver adjusted net revenue growth in the 5% to 6% range, up from 4.5% to 5.5% previously for the full year compared to 2022. This outlook reflects our better-than-expected performance in the first quarter and the benefit we anticipate from our conversion pipeline. Specifically, we now expect core issuer to grow about 5% and continue to expect MineralTree and Netspend's B2B businesses to grow low double digits. We anticipate adjusted operating margin for the issuer business to expand by up to 60 basis points, consistent with our prior outlook, as we benefit from the natural operating leverage in the business. In terms of quarterly phasing, there are 2 continuing items to note. First, while we expect foreign exchange rates to be roughly neutral for the full year, we still anticipate a currency headwind to adjusted net revenue of up to 100 basis points in the second quarter. Second, we expect the successful closing of the sale of Netspend for the end of April to add roughly $25 million of incremental revenue to the second quarter versus our prior expectation with no change to our expected earnings per share dilution impact for the year. Moving to a couple of nonoperating items. We expect net interest expense to be roughly $550 million, a modest $10 million increase from our prior guide in light of yield curve movements, and for our adjusted effective tax rate to be in the range of 19% to 19.5%, consistent with our prior guidance. For modeling purposes, we continue to assume excess cash is used to pay down indebtedness in 2023 until we return to our targeted leverage levels toward the end of the year with minimal share repurchases until then. Putting it all together, we now expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year to be in the range of $10.32 to $10.44, reflecting growth of 11% to 12% over 2022, up from 10% to 11% previously. Excluding dispositions, adjusted earnings per share growth is expected to be 16% to 17% for 2023. This is consistent with our updated 2021 cycle guidance by incremental adverse changes in the macro environment since then. Our first quarter results represent roughly a $0.05 adjusted earnings per share beat relative to our internal forecast. Our raised guidance for calendar 2023 essentially rolls the beat plus a couple of cents for the year in light of the uncertainties of the current environment. Similar to what you've heard from others, we saw strength across our markets in January and February, which moderated somewhat in a number of our businesses in March. Our issuer business did not experience any discernible moderation as our large money center bank customers benefited from the regional banking crisis that developed in March. Trends in this business continue to remain resilient through April and similar to March levels of activity. Our updated outlook today presumes a worldwide macroeconomic backdrop that is consistent with the current environment throughout the remainder of calendar year 2023. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff.Jeffrey S. SloanThanks, Josh. I couldn't be more proud of what we've achieved as a management team together over the last near decade with more than 27,000 team members across 40-plus countries. I'm also very pleased with our long history of management depth and succession planning. Cameron is only the third CEO of Global Payments in nearly a quarter century. He has my complete confidence, and I look forward to working with him closely to effect a smooth transition over the coming weeks. I personally thank all our team members for what they do for us every day as well as our millions of customers and thousands of partners and shareholders for the trust you put in us and in me over the last 13 years. The future is bright at Global Payments. Winnie?Winnie SmithThanks, Jeff. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Operator, we will now go to questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question today is coming from Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi.Ashwin Vassant ShirvaikarCongratulations on the good quarter. And Jeff, happy for you, it's been a pleasure. And Cameron, congratulations on the promotion.Jeffrey S. SloanThanks, Ashwin.Cameron M. BreadyThanks, Ashwin.Ashwin Vassant ShirvaikarYes, let me start with merchant, if you could kind of provide a more detailed geographical walk through as you consider macro and other factors. U.S. and the Americas now includes a couple of new geographies for you. Europe, including the EVO footprint, how should we think of sort of normalized growth rate and Asia Pac recovery as well? If you could sort of unpack that for us, that would be great.Cameron M. BreadyAshwin, it's Cameron. Why don't I go ahead and start I'll ask Jeff to chime in with any other color he'd like to provide as well. So I think if you look at the overall backdrop for the merchant business, I think we feel pretty good about, obviously, our performance in the first quarter and how we're positioned for the full year as evidenced by, obviously, a reiteration of our guide and an increase, so to speak, up to the high end of our growth expectation for the merchant business for the full year. Starting here at home in the U.S., we continue to see good trends kind of across the business. I think like others who have reported already, January and February were very strong months for us. We obviously saw a little bit of a pullback in March, and we see April kind of looking similar to March right now. So assuming a relatively consistent macro based on where we are today for the balance of the year, I think our U.S. business is really well positioned to grow nicely over the course of the year. And obviously, it's the biggest component of our portfolio. So as it goes, generally the rest of the merchant business goes. So I think we feel very good about where we are in the U.S. Weaving EVO into that conversation really by saying the B2B portfolio that EVO has today, the capabilities they bring us across acceptance with AR automation solutions integrated into the largest enterprise ERP solutions in the U.S. for mid-market-type enterprises is a really powerful addition to the portfolio of assets we have here in the U.S. And obviously, there's a lot that we think we can do with that over the course of time. So more to come on that. I think Europe is overall a good story. Obviously, a mix of various geographies there. We continue to see very strong trends in Central Europe and Spain, obviously, 2 important markets for us. EVO will add to that with the addition of Poland and Greece, both of which, again, are strong secular markets with good long-term growth fundamentals that were very attractive to now be in through the acquisition of EVO.Obviously, the U.K. remains soft. Their GDP was effectively flat for the first quarter, continuing a pretty consistent trend coming off the back half of last year as the implications of Brexit really take hold as well as sky-high inflation in that market. So the U.K. remains a little bit of a headwind for us. But I think as we look at Europe overall, we're obviously pretty excited about the long-term prospects there. And then lastly, in Asia Pacific, as Jeff highlighted in his prepared remarks, we had our best first quarter in Asia since 2018. We saw mid- to high teens growth as we finally got reopenings across really all of the Asia-Pacific markets in which we operate. We're starting to see more intra-Asia cross-border activity, which is good for our business. Yet to see meaningful sort of inter-Asia cross-border, but obviously, that's the next leg of the stool as Asia fully reopens and we get back to full normality in that market. So I think as we step back and look at the merchant business, we accelerated a point sequentially versus the fourth quarter from a top line growth matter before factoring in, obviously, the addition of EVO for roughly 1 week of the quarter. So I feel very good about the trends kind of coming off of the quarter and remain very poised, I think, for the balance of the year to achieve the guidance -- the updated guidance that we provided this morning.Ashwin Vassant ShirvaikarThat's very useful. And then sticking with merchant, the adjusted rev growth was greater than volume growth, I think, probably for the first time in a couple of years. What's driving that? Is that value-add services? Is there sort of a different business model with like more subscription revenue or something like that? Or do you expect that to sustain?Cameron M. BreadyYes, it's really mix, Ashwin, more than anything else. Our vertical market businesses, which are predominantly software-driven, had a strong quarter, which obviously contributes a little bit more to the top line than it does to the volume-related metrics. But you're talking a few tens of basis points difference between the 2, 1 rounded up, 1 rounded down, that's kind of the difference. So I wouldn't put too much weight to the 11 versus the 10. It's going to fluctuate. Sometimes, it will be on top of each other. Sometimes, volume may be a little bit better. Sometimes, revenue growth may be a little bit better. I think what we step back and look at fundamentally is, are those 2 moving in correlation to each other? And is that gap relatively minimal? 10 to 11 is very tight versus others in the marketplace. So I think fundamentally looking at the underlying volume growth of the business, we're very happy with how things are trending and, obviously, the revenue demonstrates that as well.OperatorYour next question is coming from Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research.Darrin David PellerFirst of all, Jeff and Cameron, congrats to both of you on the transition. Jeff, if it's possible to give us a sense of where you -- the timing and why now and maybe a little more in your thought process of what's to come for you as well as what you're most excited about when you look at GPN going forward. Just curious if you can give a little more color on your -- on the change.Jeffrey S. SloanDarrin, it's Jeff. Thanks for saying that. Let me just start by saying Cameron and I have worked closely for 9 years, and probably, in his judgment, it's 9 years too late. Probably where I'd start. But look, I would say, as we said in the press release and our prepared remarks that, look, we just posted the best first quarter since 2019. We talked about it in February hoping that we were back in an environment of normalcy. I think we're there today. We've got our first real beat and raise in 18 months. And then really importantly, Darrin, we've said publicly for 12 months that we're focused on closing EVO, closing Netspend, closing the sale of Gaming Solutions. But not surprising to you, those probably started like 18 months ago, right? And it's like the last 12 to 14 months they really kind of ramped up. So just speaking for me, I mean the Board and I agree that I think with these important strategic transactions behind us, I just would thank Cameron for putting up with me for all this period of time until we got these things done. And then I'd also say it's important. I talked about the return to normalcy, but I want to make sure we have a stable macroeconomic environment. And really, this is the first period since probably 2019 that we've had any kind of real stability, normalcy. Our businesses are operating at very good levels. So I think the timing is right. And I plan to really be sitting on a beach. That's what I like doing . And Darrin, if you're ever in South Florida, just come visit me.Darrin David PellerAll right. Thanks, Jeff. Well, congrats again. I guess my quick follow-up would just be on thinking about pricing in the industry. We've now seen -- I know you talked a lot -- Cameron, you just talked a little more about value-added services and mix and it being pretty tight. But we've seen now between Pfizer and -- just across the industry, Visa as well, selling pricing changes. And so after having seen quite a bit of cost inflation for a couple of years, we would think there could be some opportunity on the price front. Any comment on that or any thoughts?Cameron M. BreadyYes, Darrin, I think our perspective around pricing really hasn't changed, and the philosophy that we have has been pretty consistent for many years now. We try to price our services to reflect the level of value and capability that we're bringing to the market, which we do think, in many ways, is differentiated from our competitors. I think we work very hard to try to optimize our pricing and have for, again, in the past several years, to make sure that we're constantly looking at sort of the price points and how we're packaging a variety of different value-added services and capabilities we can bring along with, obviously, the pure payment acceptance solutions that we offer to the marketplace. So our perspective is, look, I think, overall, more people are being, I'd say, on the more aggressive side perhaps with, for a lack of a better term, with their pricing strategies more recently. I think that bodes well as it relates to the competitive landscape and, particularly, how we try to position our business over a long period of time. So nothing unusual coming from us as a pricing matter. I would say it's more of the same, looking at portfolio optimization and pricing strategies, again, to try to reflect the value and service that we bring to the customer. But obviously, the backdrop with other people doing that makes it a little bit easier for those to stick. It's probably the point I would make in -- of that.Darrin David PellerGreat. All right. Nice job on the quarter, guys. Congrats again.OperatorYour next question is coming from James Faucette from Morgan Stanley.James Eugene FaucetteGreat. I want to add my congratulations to both you, Jeff and Cameron. Wanted to follow up on Darrin's question there about timing. And maybe, Cameron, with a few key things now accomplished and closed, how are you thinking about strategically next steps, especially given you're still in a very good capital position? And is it still time to keep looking at doing other acquisitions? Or does your prioritization change to integration and incorporating everything that the recent acquisitions, including EVO Payments, brings?Cameron M. BreadyYes, James, great question. So I would say, first and foremost, Jeff and I have pretty much been locked at the hip for the last 9 years. So you shouldn't expect a radical deviation in strategy. And quite the contrary, you should expect a continued focus on the 4-pillar strategy we articulated 18 months ago at our investor conference. I'm very much 100% behind that strategy. Jeff and I worked closely to kind of build that strategy together over many years. And I absolutely think it's the right strategy for us as a business matter going forward. So my highest priority will continue to be to execute against that strategy as we move forward. I think from a capital allocation perspective and priority perspective, as Josh highlighted in his prepared remarks, we're very focused on getting back to our targeted leverage ratio by the end of this year. That is a priority of the capital allocation matter as well as make sure that we integrate EVO effectively over that same period of time. We have a saying here that we like to do the things we've already committed to well before we try to take on the next thing. So I think as it relates to the next, call it, 9 months, our focus is clearly going to be on getting leverage back to the targeted level, integrating EVO effectively, making sure that that's off to a good start. And then as a go-forward matter, I think our capital allocation priorities will remain relatively unchanged. We're going to continue to try to strike the right balance between, obviously, investing to grow the business. Our priority is finding ways to invest in the business to grow and expand our footprint, to support the various pillars of the strategy that we're pursuing and find ways to augment that through inorganic activities as well as organic investment in the business. And absent meaningful opportunities to do that in a way that drives value and returns for our shareholders, we'll look to return capital as we have over a long period of time. So I don't think the overall philosophy or approach to capital allocation is going to change dramatically. I think it's going to be more of the same, and I think more of the same will be very good for our shareholders over a long period of time.James Eugene FaucetteGot it. Got it. And then just revisiting a little bit the outlook is that when you came into the year, your planning assumption had been really no slowdown or economic recession. We've seen a little bit of a slowdown in consumer spending, as you mentioned, in late March and through April. And it seemed like at least some of the qualitative commentary was a little more cautious [or later] through the year in spite of the guidance increase. How are you thinking about the macro conditions now versus 3 months ago? And has there been much change there?Joshua J. WhippleYes. So I'll go ahead and take that. So as we thought about the guide, the outlook assumes the macro backdrop, as I said in my prepared remarks, is consistent with the current environment. And really, there's really 2 primary changes to the guide. What I would say is the first change is the outperformance that we saw in Q1, which was approximately $40 million from a revenue perspective and EPS was about $0.05 or $0.06 better relative to our internal forecast. And then secondly, it's the $25 million that we expect to or that we received from Netspend in the month of April. Other than that, nothing has really changed relative to our guide that we went through on the February call and laid out specifically -- very specifically by quarters.Jeffrey S. SloanJames, just to add some color to the math that Josh went through. We're looking at current volumes and transactions in April. So that already reflects, to your point, and I think Josh said this in his prepared remarks, what you've heard from Visa and Mastercard and some of the other folks. So I think that incorporates the current environment. Yet despite that, we've been able to raise our outlook a little bit better than the beat internally, as Josh described. So we're very comfortable with where we are. And as I mentioned a minute ago, too, in my prepared remarks, particularly in the issuer business, we're the beneficiaries of the tailwinds coming from some of the consolidation from regional banks into the money center and SIFIs. So of course, we saw the JPM announcement today with First Republic. I would just say that our issuer business, in particular, hasn't seen any discernable moderation. Obviously, we pointed to acceleration today in our outlook, and that very much reflects current events. As I mentioned a minute ago, our trends through April sitting here today from a KPI point of view [in which we are] are very strong, right? And that's before some of the more recent consolidation. So it may not be great for the broader macroeconomic environment, but certainly, the trend toward larger FIs globally is nothing but good news for our issuer business.OperatorYour next question is coming from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America.Jason Alan KupferbergCongrats to everybody. And just wanted to ask about kind of quarterly revenue and margin cadence for the last 3 quarters of the year. I know last quarter you laid out a pretty detailed outlook by quarter. And just wanted to see if there's any little tweaks there so that we get the quarterly modeling right. For example, I think in merchant, we had talked about organic kind of being in that 9% to 10% range pretty consistent each quarter. But if you can just take us through some of those quarterly pieces, that would be helpful.Joshua J. WhippleYes, absolutely. Look, what I would say is February, we gave you very specific quarterly growth rates on revenue and earnings per share. And I would say Q2 through Q4, nothing has really changed. So if you go back to the earnings presentation that we put out there, we said adjusted net revenue reported 5% to 6% Q2, 8% to 9% in Q3. And 4, we did obviously raise -- we did raise the overall outlook to 7% to 8% based on the performance that we saw in Q1 and which I just outlined. And then from a margin perspective, look, we saw a really good margin expansion in Q1 of 200 basis points, exactly what we said we would do. And from Q2 through Q4, we expect 100 basis points margin expansion, which we laid out on the February call. And then from an EPS perspective, again, we're right in that 9% to 10% range for Q2 through Q4, which we outlined in February. So again, nothing has changed as it relates to Q2 through Q4 relative to what we discussed on the February call.Jason Alan KupferbergGood to hear. Okay. And just as a follow-up. In merchant, I think in the past, you guys have talked about the portfolio, at least on the acquiring side, putting software on the side, roughly half discretionary, half more nondiscretionary spending. Is that still the right breakdown post EVO closing? And if you can just talk about what you're seeing in terms of relative growth rates between the discretionary and the nondiscretionary spending volumes in merchant.Cameron M. BreadyYes, Jason, it's Cameron. I'll jump in there. I would say that overall split holds roughly pretty well post EVO. Obviously, I don't think at this stage we've kind of aggregated all the different geographies around the globe in terms of what the volume mix is across every single vertical that they have exposure to. But given the size of EVO relative to our existing merchant footprint globally, it's not going to move the needle a great deal one way or the other even if their split is slightly different. I would say, and I'll use the U.S. as kind of example, you sort of saw the trend around retail sales in the U.S. which is really food and kind of retail more broadly. In the first quarter, January was very strong. And February slowed down relative to January. And March kind of slowed down relative to February. But I would say, overall, from a spending perspective, we continue to see spending skewed towards more services in experiences and less sort of retail goods and food to some degree. So a little better trends in the nondiscretionary categories that we are heavy in, particularly as it relates to services, health care, et cetera, and a little lighter trends in the traditional kind of retail, food and beverage, et cetera. But overall, the portfolios, I think, came together pretty well. I don't think the trends we're seeing in our business are any different than what you heard from Visa and Mastercard as it relates to March and April activity, more broadly, which we've talked about already. But I like, obviously, the diversification we have across nearly 70 different vertical markets. I like the split and sort of weightings that we have across discretionary, nondiscretionary categories. So I think we're well positioned, obviously, for the macro environment as it continues to evolve through the balance of the year.OperatorYour next question today is coming from Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays.Ramsey Clark El-AssalI will add my congratulations as well to both of you. I wanted to ask if you could provide a little bit more commentary on the timing of the revenue synergies with EVO. When do those start flowing in? Is there any work that needs to be done in order to unlock those? And how long might that take?Cameron M. BreadyYes, Ramsey, it's a great question. I tried in my opening comments to give a little bit of color on the types of revenue synergies that we're pursuing with EVO. Naturally, all of those involve some level of investment. I wish more than anything else we could flip a switch and start distributing our products and capabilities through their distribution pipes overnight or bring some of our capabilities to markets that they operate in today that don't have them. But as you can imagine, there's a significant amount of work to stand those up, to integrate those environments into different platforms that EVO operates under to make sure that we have distribution to support, obviously, the product that we're bringing to market, et cetera. [We've been able to light] EVO multinational customers up in new markets on different platforms takes time as well. So there's a lot of work that goes into driving kind of the revenue synergy potential that we see in the EVO business over a longer period of time. That's why near term, much of the emphasis we talk about as it relates to synergies, is really around the expense side. That's much more actionable in the short to medium term. We have clear line of sight to the $125 million expense synergies that we highlighted earlier today. And obviously, that drives a meaningful amount, obviously, of the accretion that we expect from the EVO deal in years 1, 2 and 3. I think revenue synergies create nice tailwinds kind of as we get into the outer years. We certainly think we can add a point or 2 on top of EVO's existing kind of run rate revenue north of $600 million. So you're talking at least $10 million to probably $15 million of revenue synergies from the EVO business once we're able to get up and running with respect to the various levels of revenue synergy activities that I talked about earlier in my prepared remarks. So we see good potential to drive incremental revenue in that business. I think increasing their revenue growth by a point or 2 on top of what they're already doing is a good target for that business. And obviously, we're very confident over a period of time that we'll deliver on that, if not more, once we're able to light up all those opportunities.Ramsey Clark El-AssalGot it. Okay. And one follow-up for me. Could you give us an update on value-added services and how that part of your business is evolving? I'm just curious how important value-added services have become to things like either new sales or retention and how like attach rates are trending.Cameron M. BreadyYes. I would say it's an incredibly important part of our strategy as we talked about back at our investor conference a little over 1.5 years ago. I think as I look at it, there's clearly an element of attracting new merchants to our portfolio by virtue of the breadth and depth of capabilities that we bring. I think there is a retention element in terms of being able to deliver more product and capability and differentiation to our customers by virtue of the value-added services we're able to offer. And I think thirdly, on the integrated side, we've seen great success in retaining partners and bringing in new partners at what I would consider to be relatively attractive referral rates largely based on the portfolio capability that we can bring to bear on their customer base. So we offer much more than the pure payment experience that a lot of integrated providers are able to offer their customers. I think the breadth of value-added service we can bring is a differentiator in terms of working with our integrated partners, and it's been a big reason we continue to see the strength in that business that we have over the last many quarters. So it's an increasingly important part of the value proposition that we're delivering to our customers. It's an important part of the growth profile over a longer-term period. And again, I think we've done a very good job of utilizing the capabilities we have to drive differentiation and distinction in the market. And it's even more important as we look at markets outside of the U.S. Bringing some of the capabilities that we have in the U.S. to markets like Central Europe to the U.K., Spain, et cetera, drives even greater levels of differentiation relative to what others in those markets can offer today, and they've been a significant tailwind for those businesses as well. So long term, it's an incredibly important part of our strategy. It's why we spent so much time talking about it at the investor conference, and it's something we're going to continue to build on as we move forward in time.OperatorYour next question is coming from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank.Bryan Connell KeaneCongratulations, of course, to both of you guys. Just thinking about the merchant margins. They were up 80 basis points, I think, last year, and they came in more flat in the quarter. Anything to call out in the quarter in particular and even before we integrate EVO just thinking about organic margin expansion opportunities in the merchant segment.Cameron M. BreadyYes, Bryan, it's Cameron. I'll just start at a macro level, and I'll let Josh maybe jump in if he has any additional color to add. I would say we got to look at margin profile in Q1 ex EVO because EVO comes in at a lower-margin profile than our core business. So in Q1, we expanded margins ex EVO by around 25 basis points. That's pretty consistent with where we ended up in Q4. As you can imagine, mix probably impacts that more than anything else, so we've got mix movement. As the vertical market businesses continue to perform well and recover in some of those verticals relative to what they experienced during the pandemic, that tends to come in at a little lower-margin profile, which, from a mix matter, kind of weighs to the overall margin expansion we're seeing in the business. But I would say, for Q1, we delivered margin expansion for the merchant business ex EVO exactly on top of our plans. And I'll remind you, those margins are at sort of north of 47%. So as we think about margin expansion in the business over a longer period of time, when we're already at margins of 47%, 48% in that business, obviously, as we look at margin expansion for the company overall, more of that will be driven through gaining better scale across our corporate functions and obviously continue to see those expenses as a percentage of revenue not grow at the same pace, and then secondly, obviously, in the issuer business that has a little more runway, I think, around margin expansion over the near to medium term. So merchant was exactly what we expected for the quarter. We still expect the same expectation for the full year as Josh articulated in his prepared remarks around merchant margins. As we bring EVO in, it comes in at a lower-margin profile. As we continue to build synergies over time, we'll get back to kind of pre-EVO levels and then, of course, look to expand from there.Joshua J. WhippleYes. The only thing I would add is that as it relates to Q2 and Q3, we'll see some margin contraction, as Cameron mentioned, by bringing in EVO, which is coming in at a lower profile, and then we'll start to see some margin expansion in Q4. And then the net result of this will just be a modest decline in merchant margins for the full year, which is, again, consistent with the guide that we outlined on the February call.Bryan Connell KeaneGot it. No, that's really helpful. And then just as a follow-up, just thinking about the trends in issuer. I know you guys raised the issuer segment revenue growth for the year. But the trends, obviously, you're pointing in your favor towards the movement towards assets towards larger banks, and I think it was 9 LOIs. So just thinking even about longer term, are you guys feeling a little bit more positive about maybe the issuer outlook even beyond 2023 as a result of some of these trends?Jeffrey S. SloanBryan, it's Jeff. I couldn't be more positive about where we are in issuer. I mean I think this is the fourth quarter in a row of significant sequential acceleration in the rate of growth of that business. B2B has been part of it now for probably 9 months or something, and that provides another leg of growth and, I think I said last quarter, added like 50 basis points or something of incremental growth relative to the core issuer business. So yes, I would say not in the 9 RFP number or other things that are going on in terms of large financial institutions looking to select either new providers for the first time or switch providers. I think we're very well positioned there. As I said on the call in February that the cloud sells, right? So when we first started this, we weren't sure number of years ago of the receptivity. Now you walk into a meeting, and it's kind of table stakes. And I think with AWS, we're in a very strong position. So very excited about where we are. And these are the things that I've been talking about for 1.5 years kind of rolling in. And I think as difficult as maybe for the broader macro economy, even today's announcement of JPM, yes, it's good news, right? So I think the more we see toward money center and SIFI, I think the more confidence we have in the tailwinds over the next number of periods. And those aren't going to reverse themselves immediately, so I think you've got a very nice tailwind heading into the next period of time.OperatorOur final question today is coming from Vasu Govil from KBW.Vasundhara GovilCongratulations to you both, I want to add that as well. My first question is for you, Jeff. I think you mentioned MineralTree grew 20% in the quarter and you're expecting it to grow 30% for the year. So I just wanted some color on what's sort of going to drive that acceleration. And if you could also give us more broadly an update on the cross-sell efforts you are seeing for that piece of the business into your merchant base.Jeffrey S. SloanIt's a great question, Vasu. So we really couldn't be more excited about where we are in B2B. And by the way, I know you have to have MineralTree that, of course, EVO has now rolled into from the end of March. So obviously, that's an incremental tailwind to kind of what we're doing. So look, I think the answer to your question is there is a long and deep pipeline that we've been selling over at MineralTree for quite some time. The person running our business now started last summer. I think it was right around July 1, so he's been very busy building that pipeline. We're seeing the benefit of that now. We're also seeing a very substantial benefit from cross-sell of virtual card, where TSYS is one of the largest virtual card providers on the planet into our core business, and that's growing at rates well worth 20%. So I just think, Vasu, to answer your question, is it's the mathematics of selling recurring cloud SaaS business. The deeper the pipeline is, the more it rolls in. It's obviously very visible on the cross-sell and attach rate from virtual cards into the core, and the software sale is very high. So it's really just the mathematics of what we built. In terms of notables wins, I think we said those, to be honest, not that February call. I think we talked about U.S. Bank. I think we talked about Citizens. Those are obviously 2 notable wins. And I expect over the balance of the year, Cameron and Josh and team will be describing more. But we couldn't be more pleased with where that business is and its trajectory and, look, increasing the rate of growth from 20% to 30% or a 50% increase, I think, is evidence of our confidence in it.Vasundhara GovilThat's great. And then just my follow-up on just the macro backdrop. I know you guys are sort of assuming that macro stays stable from here. But I think the risk of a recession is probably higher today than it was 3 months ago. So just can you talk about the sensitivity in both the merchant and issuer revenue as to the extent we do see a slowdown and also cost levers that you might have?Jeffrey S. SloanYes, I'll start, Vasu, and then I'll ask Cameron and Josh to comment. So let me just start by saying kind of what we've assumed. So we've assumed where we are today -- I guess May 1. I was going to say April, but today is May 1, so we're taking the current environment meeting today. So to answer your question, just initially, the macro level, we're not looking back to where we were on our February 10 call. We're actually going with what the current trends are today. And I think we said as it relates to the issuer business, we obviously have the KPIs through the vast majority of April on there. As we said in our prepared remarks, we don't see any discernible moderation in what we're doing. So we don't assume things get better, and we don't assume things to look the way they were 2, 3 months ago in February. Rather, we're taking kind of where they are today, and obviously, our raised outlook for today reflects the current environment. Cam, do you want to comment on merchant a bit? And Josh, you, too?Cameron M. BreadyYes, Vasu, it's Cameron. I think I mentioned this before. Obviously, to Jeff's point earlier, we saw strong trends in January, February. March kind of slowed down a little bit relative to that. And April has been more of the same relative to what we saw in March. So that's the expectation we kind of have as we look towards the balance of the year. As I said kind of many times in the past, we don't need perfection for the balance of the year relative to our current outlook to obviously achieve the expectations that we've set forth today. So I think we feel good about how we're positioned to deliver on the overall guide that we've shared. And obviously, that can withstand, I would say -- relatively, I can say we're seeing slight deviations, I'd say, in the overall macro environment that we're anticipating for the balance of the year. If things fall off precipitously, then obviously we'll revisit it. If things obviously improve more than we anticipate, obviously, that creates some upside opportunity. So I think we feel good about, obviously, how the business is positioned for the balance of the year. The guide, I think, today reflects that. And we're looking forward to continue to execute against that.Jeffrey S. SloanOn behalf of Global Payments, thank you for your interest in us and for joining us this morning.OperatorThank you.

In addition to GAAP measures, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to focus on the factors the company believes are pertinent to the daily management of our operations. Management believes adjusted net revenue more closely reflects the economic benefits to the company's core business and allows for better comparisons with industry peers. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures, together with other metrics, to set goals for and measure the performance of the business and to determine incentive compensation.Adjusted net revenue, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS should be considered in addition to, and not as substitutes for, revenues, operating income, net income and earnings per share determined in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures reflect management's judgment of particular items, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Adjusted net revenue excludes gross-up related payments associated with certain lines of business to reflect economic benefits to the company. On a GAAP basis, these payments are presented gross in both revenues and operating expenses. Adjusted operating income, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS exclude acquisition-related amortization expense, share-based compensation expense, acquisition, integration and separation expense, gain or losses on business divestitures, and certain other items specific to each reporting period as more fully described in the accompanying reconciliations in Schedules 6 to 7. Adjusted operating margin is derived by dividing adjusted operating income by adjusted net revenue. The constant currency growth measures adjust for the impact of exchange rates and are calculated using average exchange rates during the comparable period in the prior year. The tax rate used in determining the income tax impact of earnings adjustments is either the jurisdictional statutory rate in effect at the time of the adjustment or the jurisdictional expected annual effective tax rate for the period, depending on the nature and timing of the adjustment.The supplemental non-GAAP information excludes the results of the consumer business that was divested in April 2023. Management believes that providing such supplemental financial information should enhance shareholders’ ability to evaluate how the business will be managed going forward.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230501005138/en/ContactsInvestor contact:investor.relations@globalpay.com Winnie Smith770-829-8478Media contact:media.relations@globalpay.com Emily Edmonds770-829-8755]"

Pictures film is getting a lot of buzz for bringing the famous Mattel (MAT) doll to life.Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor Brian Sozzi sat down with Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz at the 26th annual Milken Institute Global Conference to talk about how transformational the ""Barbie"" movie would be for the toymaker.Kreiz explained that the movie wasn't created to just sell more toys. The CEO believes ""this is about franchise management.""By working with major studios, Kreiz says he's ""amplifying the brand"" to extend the business beyond selling toys.See the full interview interview here.Key Video Highlights:0:00:11 - 'Barbie' film impact on Mattel0:01:20 - Building a brand beyond toy makingVideo Transcript- Let's get to Barbie. July 21, how big of an event is this for a company like Mattel?YNON KREIZ: Look, we really believe this will be an event, not just for Mattel, but we believe it will have an impact broader than that. And this is about franchise management. This is not just about one quarter or about one year. This is how you manage a franchise. And this film is really being developed by one of the most creative and prolific filmmaker of our generation, with Greta Gerwig, who co-wrote it with Noah Baumbach. She's directing. We have an incredible cast led by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, Will Ferrell, and other top lead talent.We're very excited about it. But this is not just about the quarter. And this is the first of an exciting film slate that we're pointing out, as I mentioned before.- I think this was mentioned on the last earnings call just a couple of days ago. You said this movie was a legacy making moment for Mattel. Explain that to us.YNON KREIZ: Yeah, this is the first time that Mattel is putting a movie out based on any of our IPs. Any of our franchise. Barbie is really an important brand. It's one of our three power brands. And it will be in many ways a showcase for the quality of the movies that we're looking to make, the type of partnerships we're formulating with lead talent in Hollywood, working with major studios, and of course amplifying the brand in the movie through our own marketing capabilities, and social reach and engagement. So it will be a way for us to show what does it mean when we say that we Mattel is an IP driven high performing toy company, and an opportunity to extend our business outside of everything we do on the toy side of the company.]"

The toy industry overall has seen inventory challenges amid a larger slowdown. But looking ahead there could be a number of potential catalysts. Now that includes a licensing partnership with rival Hasbro. We'll get a Barbie edition Monopoly game out of that union.Speaking of Barbie, the hotly anticipated Barbie movie is out in theaters this summer, July 21. Let's head back to the Milken Conference out in California. Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi sitting down with the CEO of Mattel, Brian.BRIAN SOZZI: All right, thanks so much, Seana. Yes, joining me now Mattel CEO, Ynon Kreiz. Good to see you in person for a change, Ynon Kreiz.YNON KREIZ: Good to see you too, Brian.BRIAN SOZZI: So the mood here at the conference, I wouldn't say gloomy but a little bit of realistic. Everybody's acknowledging an economic slowdown. You're fresh off of your earnings report. How has this slowdown impacted toy demand?YNON KREIZ: Well, from where we sit, we saw a decline in-- the point is, we're in the first quarter. But we do expect the industry to be flat, to slightly up. And for Mattel we saw increase in consumer demand for our product. In fact, we grew consumer demand in all of our leader category, dolls, vehicles, infant, toddler, and preschool, as well as in action figures and building sets. So we saw growth and we expect that growth to be positive for the full year as well.BRIAN SOZZI: Do you already have visibility into the holiday shopping season? Is that why you're so confident in the second half of the year?YNON KREIZ: It's so early to tell how the holiday season will shape up. But we have some meaningful drivers for Mattel for the full year. From the launch of Disney Princess and Frozen, which is added to our dolls portfolio, Trolls, Wish, two big movies that will launch the second part of the year. The global rollout of Monster High. And of course, the release of the Barbie movie in July that will be a catalyst. So we have a few incremental new drivers for our business in 2023.Story continuesBRIAN SOZZI: Well, I'm going to make people wait, viewers wait to talk more about that Barbie movie, because I know they're very excited about. But that Disney, that Frozen license. How big is that for Mattel this year? Sales wise?YNON KREIZ: It's important and it's meaningful, both culturally as well as a business opportunity. We really believe it will be a win-win situation for Mattel and Disney. And we can grow this franchise and leverage our capability and leadership position in the dolls category in a meaningful way.BRIAN SOZZI: The writers strike that we're looking at in Hollywood, does that impact your business at all in terms of movies getting out, content being produced, impacting the toy business?YNON KREIZ: It will not impact, of course, the Barbie movie, which is out soon. But we're looking to see how it will impact the rest of the business. Of course, we have multiple projects in the making. Some are relatively advanced than others, and we'll have to continue to watch this space and make sure that we manage it properly.BRIAN SOZZI: I still feel as though investors don't understand what you're doing on the content front. So let's take them through it. How many pieces of content did you have in development over the next two years? And what are some of the big names outside of the Barbie movie?YNON KREIZ: Well, we announced 14 projects in development. We have Hot Wheels as a project with JJ Abrams to produce at Warner Brothers, Matchbox, which is being developed by Skydance. We have a Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots with Vin Diesel and Universal. We have a Major Matt Mason that we're developing with Tom Hanks and Akiva Goldsman as a writer. We have a Barney movie in development, Masters of the Universe.BRIAN SOZZI: Barney?YNON KREIZ: Barney. With Daniel Kaluuya, we announced that. We have a Thomas the Tank as a film in development. We have several projects in the making. And you can see that the diversity by genre, by audience demographic, by type, and each project is very different, which is exciting. Because we really have an opportunity to capture value from our intellectual properties outside of the toy aisle. And this is obviously not just the Barbie movie, but multiple projects, different partners, all quality focus on quality of this project. This is not just to sell toys, but really to participate in the film business right at center stage with the best talent in the industry.BRIAN SOZZI: Let's get to Barbie. July 21. How big of an event is this for a company like Mattel?YNON KREIZ: We really believe this will be an event, not just for Mattel, but we believe it will have an impact broader than that. And this is about franchise management. This is not just about one quarter or about one year. This is how you manage a franchise. And this film is really being developed by one of the most creative and prolific filmmaker of our generation, with Greta Gerwig, who co-wrote it with Noah Baumbach. She's directing. We have an incredible cast led by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. Will Ferrell and other top lead talent. We're very excited about it. But this is not just about the quarter. And this is the first of an exciting film slate that we're pointing out, as I mentioned before.BRIAN SOZZI: I think this was mentioned on the last earnings call just a couple of days ago. You said this movie was a legacy making moment for Mattel. Explain that to us.YNON KREIZ: Yeah this is the first time that Mattel is putting a movie out based on any of our IPs, any of our franchise. Barbie is clearly an important brand. It's one of our three power brands. And it will be in many ways a showcase for the quality of the movies that we're looking to make, the type of partnerships we're formulating with lead talent in Hollywood, working with major studios. And of course amplifying the brand in the movie through our own marketing capabilities, and social reach and engagement. So it will be a way for us to show, what does it mean when we say that we, Mattel, is an IP driven high performing toy company, and an opportunity to extend our business outside of everything we do on the toy side of the company.BRIAN SOZZI: Speaking of partnerships, you just signed a partnership with Hasbro. Now, when I saw this news cross, Ynon, I thought this was like Apple and Google joining forces to make some piece of new hardware. Take us through this deal, because I don't think a lot of people even saw this coming.YNON KREIZ: This is a cross-licensing agreement where we are integrating Transformers into Hot Wheels and Uno, and Monopoly is integrating Barbie into its play. Now, we do that with other parties as well. We do it with other toy companies.BRIAN SOZZI: This is a Hasbro!YNON KREIZ: Clearly, this is the first time it happened. And it's really going to be a case where we both went from this partnership, but the real winner is the consumer. The fans that will have more ways to engage and interact with their favorite brands.BRIAN SOZZI: Is there more to come on the Hasbro, Mattel front?YNON KREIZ: At this point this is the partnership we agreed on. But we constantly look to innovate and partner and collaborate with parties that where we have an opportunity to create something unique and exciting.BRIAN SOZZI: Lastly before we let you go, I followed your transformation journey in Mattel. Everything you've done. What's next for you? And what's next for Mattel over the next year?YNON KREIZ: Yeah, it has been an exciting journey. Just a few days ago we reached investment grade rating. This was a milestone moment for the company. Capping a five year journey of taking the company from a negative more than 200 million operating income loss, adjusted operating income loss, to positive $689 million of adjusted operating income. So financially it's been a transformative period for the company, and we believe there's so much more to come, both on the toy side of the company and everything we do on the IP side of the company, the entertainment side of the company. In film, television, licensing and merchandise, consumer product, and of course, digital experiences. So we believe we are still on an exciting journey with a lot more to come.BRIAN SOZZI: All right, we'll leave it there. Mattel chairman and CEO Ynon Kreiz, good to see you and July 21 I will be at that Barbie movie. Definitely seeing it. And I will be sending you a photo. Ynon, good to see you in person.YNON KREIZ: Thank you.]"

(Jason Tidwell / Associated Press)In honor of Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, Mattel has debuted an elegant new Barbie doll in the image of trailblazing Chinese American actor Anna May Wong.On Monday, the toy company unveiled the doll as part of its ""Inspiring Women"" collection. The Barbie wears Wong's signature hairstyle (bangs and a low bun), a dragon-embroidered gown and red and gold accessories.In a statement featured on the Barbie Instagram account, the toymakers at Mattel said they are ""proud to spotlight the courageous life and legacy of Anna May Wong, widely considered to be the first Chinese American movie star."" Last year, Wong became the first Asian American to be printed on United States currency.""Earning her first leading role at age 17, she founded her own production company at 19 after growing frustrated at being typecast or sidelined as a supporting character,"" the statement read.""#AnnaMayWong changed the course of Asian representation in Hollywood and left an indelible stamp on audiences around the globe, paving the way for generations of girls to dream bigger than ever before.""The Wong doll is now available to purchase for $35 on the Mattel website. Inside the collectible box — stamped with a black-and-white photo of Wong and a copy of her signature — are a doll stand and certificate of authenticity.Other historical figures featured in the ""Inspiring Women"" collection include Rosa Parks, Jane Goodall, Susan B. Anthony and Ida B. Wells.Barbie debuted the Wong doll about a week after launching its first Barbie with Down syndrome in an effort to ""counter social stigma through play.""“Our goal is to enable all children to see themselves in Barbie, while also encouraging children to play with dolls who do not look like themselves,” Lisa McKnight, executive vice president of Mattel, said last week.“Doll play outside of a child’s own lived experience can teach understanding and build a greater sense of empathy, leading to a more accepting world.""This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

The doll is dressed in a red gown with a shiny golden dragon design and cape, inspired by her appearance in the 1934 movie “Limehouse Blues.”Wong's niece, Anna Wong, gave her blessing and worked closely with the brand to develop the Barbie's look.“I did not hesitate at all. It was such an honor and so exciting,” Wong told The Associated Press in an email. “I wanted to make sure they got her facial features and clothing correct. And they did!""As a child, Anna Wong owned a Barbie and Skipper doll (Barbie's little sister) and a Barbie dream house and car. She loves the idea that Asian children will now have a doll who looks like them.The doll is part of the Barbie “Inspiring Women” series, which features dolls in the likeness of pioneering women. Past inspirations include aviator Amelia Earhart and artist Frida Kahlo.“As the first Asian American actor to lead a U.S. television show, whose perseverance broke down barriers for her gender and AAPI community in film and TV, Anna May Wong is the perfect fit for our Barbie Inspiring Women Series,"" Lisa McKnight, an executive vice president at Mattel, said in a statement.Born in Los Angeles, the Chinese American actor is considered the first major Asian American movie star. She started out during the silent movie era in the 1920s and gained international notice in films like “The Thief of Bagdad” as well as for her fashion sense. In the 1930s, Anna May Wong was acting opposite stars like Marlene Dietrich in “Shanghai Express.” But in 1937, she lost the lead role of a Chinese villager in “The Good Earth” to Luise Rainer, a white actor who went on to win a best actress Oscar.In the ensuing decades, Anna May Wong went to Europe to act. But she later returned to the U.S. In 1951, she led her own television show, “The Gallery of Madame Liu-Tsong."" The short-lived mystery series was believed to be the first with an Asian American lead.In another first, she was the first Asian American woman to get a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for acting in 1960.

126,160b975c-13d7-36e2-a2c1-43ffdce285b9,SLB,2023-05-02,16 Biggest Offshore Oil Rig Companies in the U.S.,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/16-biggest-offshore-oil-rig-105011636.html,1683024611,STORY,"['CL=F', 'HAL', 'NBR', 'FLR', 'RIG', 'SLB', 'PXD']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 16 biggest offshore oil rig companies in the U.S. For more companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Offshore Oil Rig Companies in the U.S. The energy industry is one of the biggest sectors in the world and one which came under renewed spotlight last year - both in the U.S. and globally. This was due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine which upended global energy markets and caused prices to skyrocket, leading to inflation and high costs of doing business and living. At the same time, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) also reduced oil output as it feared a crash in prices due to reduced global economic activity.Fast forward to 2023 and there is still some uncertainty in the oil market. A report from the International Energy Agency (IEA) believes that oil demand will rise to a record high of 101.9 million barrels per day by the end of this year - climbing by two million barrels. Fueling this growth will be China, where economic reopening and return to normalcy is expected to contribute to 90% of the demand growth. Oil production as of March 2023 is below this upbeat demand trajectory, though, with OPEC and non-OPEC countries producing 44.17 million barrels per day. Almost one fourth of this output is from Saudi Arabia, with Russia being the second largest producer through its 9.58 million barrels of output. Crucially, Russian oil exports soared in March too, as oil shipments jumped to 8.1 million barrels per day to touch levels seen before the brutal Ukraine invasion. However, Russia is not earning as much from its exports as it previously did, with oil revenues dropping to $12.7 billion, or by 43% from the previous year.At the same time, OPEC's latest supply cuts that were announced in April 2023 have created a new market for U.S. and non OPEC oil. According to the IEA, while global oil production growth is expected to drop by 1.2 million barrels per day this year, non-OPEC+ production, originating largely from the U.S. and Brazil is expected to grow by 1.9 million barrels. However, even as America boosts its oil production, it is unlikely that the output will soar back to cross levels seen before the coronavirus pandemic. According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), U.S. oil production stood at 11.7 million barrels in 2022 and is expected to rise to 12.4 million barrels this year. However, while the government agency believes that this will ""surpass the record high set in 2019"" the chief executive officer of Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) Mr. Scott Sheffield believes that this will not surpass the 2019 record high of 13 million barrels in November of that year. Some reasons behind this, according to the CEO, are an under capacity in the oil refining market and a tendency for oil firms to be cash flow friendly. The executive also believes that it is possible for levels to cross 13 million barrels per day, but it's a slow process that can take years.Story continuesBuilding on this, almost half U.S. oil is produced in Texas, with New Mexico and North Dakota also accounting for large percentages. The largest U.S. oil production site is the Permian Basin, and America has also drilled for oil on the Pacific Coast, the Atlantic Coast, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Great Lakes. However currently, the Gulf of Mexico is the predominant player in U.S. offshore oil production, and according to the EIA, the region accounts for 15.3% of the total American oil output. Offshore drilling is done primarily through oil rigs, with several large firms such as Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) and Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) being not only the biggest offshore oil companies in America but also in the world.In terms of monetary value, the global offshore oil production market is estimated to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.7% between 2023 and 2030, or from $36 billion to $66 billion. Asia Pacific is by far the largest segment of the market, as the growing economies of India and China will boost the demand for locally available oil.  This growth rate is also matched by the estimates for offshore oil rigs, as research from Straits Research points out that the offshore drilling rigs market will grow from $96 billion in 2021 to $176 billion by 2028 at a CAGR of 8.61%. Finally, the Gulf of Mexico oil and gas market should grow at a CAGR 4.5% through 2028 according to Mordor Intelligence. The latest bid for oil and gas leases in the Gulf took place in March 2023 when giants such as Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP) participated in a $264 million bid for drilling rights.Taking stock of the situation on the ground, the management of Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) shared updates during the firm's earnings conference for the fourth quarter of 2022 when they outlined:Second, there is a greater sense of urgency around energy security. This is resulting in new investment in capacity expansion and diversity of supply. You will see this reflected in the number of new projects sanctioned, gas supply agreements signed and the return of offshore exploration, all at a pace unforeseen just 18 months ago. And third, the secular trends of digital and decarbonization are set to accelerate, driven by significant digital technology advancement in cloud and AI, favorable government policy support in New Energy investments and increased spending on low carbon initiatives by operator globally. Underpinning everything, commodity price remained at supportive levels for durable investment. In North America, spending growth is expected to be more restrained after an exceptionally strong year in 2022.Capital spending growth is expected to increase in the high teens as rig counts potentially approach a plateau. Public companies, particularly the majors, are expected to increase short-cycle spending in key U.S. land basins and drilling activity remain strong to build up well inventory and support target production increase. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, where we have a significant presence, we expect the strong spending uplift to continue. Turning to international, markets are poised for strong growth in the Middle East and Latin America geographically, and more broadly, in offshore and in gas. In the Middle East, we expect record levels of upstream investments, with a ramp-up in various capacity expansion projects designed to deliver more gas production and a combined oil increment of 4 million barrels per day through 2030.Offshore activity will continue to strengthen as tiebacks and new development projects mobilize and new FID's are sanctioned, while Russian activity is expected to contract. Excluding Russia, customers' capital spending internationally is expected to increase in the mid-teens. The combination of long-cycle oil capacity expansion projects, offshore deepwater resurgence and strong gas development activity will be a key driver for the multiyear duration of this cycle.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the biggest offshore companies in the U.S., out of which the top picks are Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL), Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB), and Baker Hughes Company (NASDAQ:BKR).16 Biggest Offshore Oil Rig Companies in the U.S.marchello74 / shutterstock.comOur Methodology To compile our list of the biggest offshore companies in America, we first listed all firms with offshore platforms in the world.

With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Leggett &amp; Platt, Incorporated (NYSE:LEG).Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. Check out our latest analysis for Leggett &amp; Platt How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Leggett &amp; Platt is:19% = US$310m ÷ US$1.6b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.19.Does Leggett &amp; Platt Have A Good ROE?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. The image below shows that Leggett &amp; Platt has an ROE that is roughly in line with the Consumer Durables industry average (20%).roeSo while the ROE is not exceptional, at least its acceptable. While at least the ROE is not lower than the industry, its still worth checking what role the company's debt plays as high debt levels relative to equity may also make the ROE appear high. If a company takes on too much debt, it is at higher risk of defaulting on interest payments.  Our risks dashboardshould have the 2 risks we have identified for Leggett &amp; Platt.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityCompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Story continuesCombining Leggett &amp; Platt's Debt And Its 19% Return On EquityLeggett &amp; Platt does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.27. There's no doubt its ROE is decent, but the very high debt the company carries is not too exciting to see. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.ConclusionReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.But note: Leggett &amp; Platt may not be the best stock to buy.

The improving price trend will likely be reflected in the company’s first-quarter sales, benefiting the top line.We expect macroeconomic factors like cost headwinds (including the higher cost of goods sold), the rising cost of capital and supply chain disruptions in certain parts of the world amid the Russia-Ukraine war to have hurt the company’s operating margins.Story continuesInvestors are likely to ask questions about potential product launches this year.

132,507a3a66-9963-3fa1-b3cb-bb19dcdbd402,NTRS,2023-05-02,Northern Trust Pension Universe Data: Canadian Pension Plans on solid footing in Q1 2023 despite market turmoil,Business Wire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/northern-trust-pension-universe-data-150000610.html,1682953200,STORY,"['NTRS', 'NTRSO']","[TORONTO, May 01, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Canadian Pension plan investment returns demonstrated resilience during the first quarter of the year, shrugging off volatility and turmoil that erupted within the U.S. banking sector, according to the Northern Trust Canada Universe. The median Canadian Pension Plan returned 4.2% for the quarter.The first quarter of 2023 was marked by continued high inflation and tight labor markets, expectations of prolonged monetary tightening and a banking crisis triggered by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and the subsequent downfall of Credit Suisse. Assertive actions undertaken by the U.S. government and Federal Reserve (Fed), the Swiss National Bank and Financial Market Supervisory Authority(FINMA) served to restore confidence and stability within the banking sector.Throughout the period, most major central banks stayed the course in their fight against inflation, hiking interest rates with the objective of restoring price stability in the economy. The Bank of Canada (BoC) was the exception as it became the first major central bank pivoting to a pause mode, in an effort to assess the impact of consecutive rate hikes over the last year. Despite economic and global disruption, including devastating earthquakes in Turkey and Syria, financial markets concluded the first quarter on a strong note, with both equities and bonds producing attractive returns for the period.""The confluence of events taking place this quarter unveiled the unwavering nature of monetary authorities, as they remained focused on their commitment to tame inflation. As central banks navigated through the ongoing macro tensions, pension plans rose to the occasion underscoring their adaptive nature generating superior returns during such a precarious period,"" said Katie Pries, President and CEO of Northern Trust Canada.The Northern Trust Canada universe tracks the performance of Canadian institutional defined benefit plans that subscribe to performance measurement services as part of Northern Trust’s asset servicing solutions.Story continuesDuring the first quarter of 2023, monetary authorities remained focused on the pillars of inflation. Absolute readings continued to be much higher than central bank targets, however the trajectory of inflation signaled restrictive monetary policy was gaining traction. Financial markets navigated the macro environment as well as turbulence that manifested within the banking sector, regaining momentum late in the period, as witnessed by the robust returns generated by the equity markets. Although yields observed volatile movements throughout the period, Canadian bonds closed the quarter with healthy positive returns.Canadian Equities, as measured by the S&amp;P/TSX Composite Index, advanced 4.6% for the quarter. Information Technology was the top performer for the quarter, while Energy was the only sector that declined for the period.U.S. Equities, as measured by the S&amp;P 500 Index, generated 7.4% in CAD for the quarter with seven of the eleven sectors posting positive results. Information Technology, Communication Services and Consumer Discretionary sectors led the way as top performers, while the Financials, Energy and Health Care sectors were the largest decliners for the period.International developed markets, as measured by the MSCI EAFE Index, returned 8.5% in CAD for the quarter. Ten of the 11 sectors witnessed positive returns for the period, led by the Information Technology and Consumer Discretionary sectors. Real Estate was the lone sector that posted negative returns during the period.The MSCI Emerging Markets Index advanced 3.9% in CAD for the quarter, as Information Technology and Communication Services sectors stood out with the strongest performance, while the Utilities and Health Care sectors had the largest declines.The Canadian economy continued to produce data supportive of a tight labor market as witnessed by strong labor figures and an unemployment rate that held steady at 5.0%. Inflation showed signs of moderating with results of 4.3% (y/y, NSA) for March, down from 6.3% in December.The U.S. economy demonstrated resilience during the quarter as the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) raised interest rates by 50 basis points throughout the period, taking the Federal Funds Target Rate to 4.75-5.0%. The labor market remained strong, while CPI declined to 5.0% in March down from 6.5% (y/y, NSA) in December. Behind this economic backdrop, the U.S. witnessed the largest bank failure since 2008, led by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.International markets generated attractive returns for the quarter despite the downfall and subsequent takeover of Swiss financial institution Credit Suisse. The European Central Bank (ECB) raised interest rates 100 basis points over the period in an effort to rein in elevated inflation. The Bank of England (BoE) continued on its tightening path, raising rates 75 basis points during the quarter. Conversely, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) maintained its ultra-loose monetary policy.Emerging Markets posted positive returns for the quarter, however they could not keep pace with developed markets over the period. Although monetary policy remained restrictive in most developed markets, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) maintained an accommodative stance, cutting its reserve requirement ratio for banks by 25 basis points.The Bank of Canada (BoC) hiked interest rates by 25 basis points to 4.5% in January and then pivoted to a pause mode in March, maintaining the overnight interest rate.

133,d4737c1b-a457-381a-9ea3-e138fda200fc,AIG,2023-05-02,American International (AIG) to Post Q1 Earnings: What to Expect,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-international-aig-post-q1-191307350.html,1682968387,STORY,"['AIG', 'RNR']","[American International Group, Inc. AIG is set to report its first-quarter 2023 results on May 4, after the closing bell.What Do the Estimates Say?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings per share of $1.43 has witnessed no upward estimate revision in the past 30 days against three movements in the opposite direction. The estimated figure, however, suggests an increase of 10% from the prior-year reported number. Our estimate of $1.36 per share indicates a 5% year-over-year increase.American International beat the consensus estimate in three of the prior four quarters and missed once, with the average being 6.9%. This is depicted in the graph below:American International Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise American International Group, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAmerican International Group, Inc. price-eps-surprise | American International Group, Inc. Quote The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues of $11,350 million indicates a 3.3% increase from the year-ago reported figure while our estimate also suggests 3.3% growth.Before we get into what to expect for the to-be-reported quarter in detail, it’s worth taking a look at AIG’s previous-quarter performance first.Q4 Earnings RewindIn the last reported quarter, the leading global insurance organization’s adjusted operating earnings of $1.36 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 14.3% due to solid North America Commercial Lines growth and improved underwriting income in General Insurance. However, the positives were partially offset by reduced alternative investment income, higher expenses and losses due to the winter storm.Now let’s see how things have shaped up prior to the first-quarter earnings announcement.Q1 Factors to NoteIn the first quarter, improved retention, new business and continued growth in the insurance premium rate are likely to have boosted the performance of the General Insurance business. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net premiums earned in General Insurance is pegged at $6,464.5 million, indicating a 3.3% increase from the year-ago period, whereas our estimate predicts a 6.1% jump.Story continuesProfits from General Insurance are likely to have increased due to strong North America operations. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted pre-tax income of $1,346.8 million for the first quarter indicates an increase of 11.2% from the year-ago period, whereas our estimate predicts a 24.8% surge.The effects of its transformative program, named AIG 200, are expected to have enabled the company to further curb costs and expenses in the first quarter. This is likely to have provided the bottom line some breathing room in the quarter under review. Our estimate for total expenses indicates around 21% year-over-year decline, which is likely to have positioned the company for year-over-year growth.However, both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate for net investment income indicate a 5.8% decline from the year-ago period, despite a high interest environment. This is likely to have been caused by a reduction in alternative investment income.Moreover, the consensus mark for adjusted pre-tax income for the overall Life and Retirement business is pegged at $694.9 million, signaling a decrease of 4% from the prior-year quarter. Our estimate also suggests a significant drop in Life and Retirement profits, making an earnings beat uncertain in the first quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for American International this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of -5.50%.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like American International Group (NYSE:AIG). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. See our latest analysis for American International Group How Fast Is American International Group Growing?Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Recognition must be given to the that American International Group has grown EPS by 55% per year, over the last three years. That sort of growth rarely ever lasts long, but it is well worth paying attention to when it happens.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. Not all of American International Group's revenue this year is revenue from operations, so keep in mind the revenue and margin numbers used in this article might not be the best representation of the underlying business. The music to the ears of American International Group shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 21% to 29% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.Story continuesThe chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time.

While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for American International Group's future EPS 100% free.Are American International Group Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since American International Group has a market capitalisation of US$39b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. With a whopping US$76m worth of shares as a group, insiders have plenty riding on the company's success. This would indicate that the goals of shareholders and management are one and the same.Does American International Group Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?American International Group's earnings per share growth have been climbing higher at an appreciable rate. That sort of growth is nothing short of eye-catching, and the large investment held by insiders should certainly brighten the view of the company. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. So based on this quick analysis, we do think it's worth considering American International Group for a spot on your watchlist. We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 1 warning sign for American International Group that you need to be mindful of.Although American International Group certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

MET, American International Group Inc. AIG, Prudential Financial Inc. PRU, CNO Financial Group CNO and Kemper Corp. KMPR.Industry: Insurance - MultilineLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2087026/5-stocks-to-watch-from-the-thriving-multiline-insurance-industryProduct diversification helps Zacks Multiline Insurance industry players to lower concentration risk, ensure uninterrupted revenue generation and improve retention ratio. Better pricing, prudent underwriting, increased exposure, faster economic recovery on the receding impact of the pandemic and increased vaccinations should benefit MetLife Inc., American International Group Inc., Prudential Financial Inc., CNO Financial Group and Kemper Corp. Accelerated digitalization will help in the smooth functioning of the industry.The solid capital level of the multiline insurers will fuel merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activities. With one rate hike already this year and more to come in the future, investment income should improve further as insurers are beneficiaries of a rising rate environment.About the IndustryThe Zacks Multiline Insurance industry comprises companies that provide single insurance coverage, bundling automobile, homeowner, long-term care, life and health insurance to individuals and businesses. The insured pays a single premium and is covered for many things through a single contract.These companies cover commercial and personal properties, automobiles, marine, livestock, aviation, personal accident, life, including permanent and term insurance, supplemental accident and health insurance, workers’ compensation, annuity products, private mortgage insurance, et al. The industry participants also provide risk management services. Since the companies offer single insurance coverage for multiple products, customer retention improves. The insured stands to benefit from lower premium payment compared to paying individual premiums for insuring varied products.Story continues3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Multiline Insurance IndustryDiversified portfolio lowers concentration risk: Given the nature of the business, multiline insurers’ product and service portfolios are diversified. This lowers concentration risk. Increased awareness, driving higher demand for protection products, should benefit sales and premiums for life insurance operations. Continued improvement in pricing and an increase in exposure should support premium growth.Also, per Deloitte Insights, the transition to green energy and related insurance products, as well as exposure to intangible assets, offers growth opportunities. Per Deloitte Insights, life insurance premium is estimated to increase 1.9% in 2023 while non-life premiums are expected to increase 2.2%. The report also stated that trends like commercial lines witnessing growth at a faster pace than personal lines and homeowners’ premiums improving at a better rate than personal auto are likely to continue in 2023.Merger and acquisitions: Consolidation in the multi-line insurance industry is expected to continue as players look to diversify their operations into new business lines and geographies. Buying businesses along the same lines is driven by the players’ need to gain a fair market share and grow in their niche areas. However, with high inflation and a rise in interest rate (the Fed has already made one rate hike this year), momentum in the M&amp;A environment is likely to slow down. The first half of 2022 witnessed 427 deals per Deloitte.Increased adoption of technology: Digitalization has increased by leaps and bounds, especially amid pandemic-induced restrictions. The industry is witnessing greater use of technology like blockchain, AI, advanced analytics, telematics, cloud computing and robotic process automation to expedite business operations and save costs.Many life insurers have started selling policies online that appeal to the tech-savvy population. At the same time, the use of real-time data is making premium calculation easier and reducing risk. The P&amp;C industry, in particular, also witnessed the emergence of insurtech — technology-led insurers — sparking competition for incumbent players.Insurers remain focused on ramping up data and analytics capabilities as well as realizing the benefit of the technological infrastructure per Deloitte Insights. Moreover, the adoption of technology has helped in seamless underwriting and claims processing. However, the adoption of technology comes with the risk of cyber threats.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates solid prospects in the near term. The Zacks Multiline Insurance industry, housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #115, which places it in the top 46% of 255 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is the result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. The bright outlook reflects that the industry’s earnings estimates have been revised upward by analysts for the current year.Before we present a few multiline insurance stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Underperforms Sector and S&amp;P 500The Multiline Insurance industry has underperformed both the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and its sector over the past six months.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.44 billion.

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Hologic: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future.

We are also pleased to increase our full-year guidance once again.""Recent HighlightsRevenue of $1,026.5 million decreased (28.5%) for the quarter, or (27.5%) in constant currency, primarily driven by significantly lower sales of COVID-19 assays, which was expected, compared to the prior year period. Revenue, however, was notably higher than the Company’s guidance of $930 to $980 million provided last quarter.Excluding COVID-19 revenues, total organic revenue grew 20.2%, or 21.9% on a constant currency basis.Diagnostics revenue decreased (52.9%), or (52.2%) in constant currency, primarily driven by lower sales of COVID-19 assays compared to the prior year period.Excluding COVID-19 revenues, Diagnostics revenue grew 14.9% on an organic, constant currency basis.Molecular Diagnostics revenue declined (60.3%), or (59.8%) in constant currency, primarily driven by lower sales of COVID-19 assays compared to the prior year period.Excluding COVID-19 revenues, Molecular Diagnostics revenue grew 23.9% on an organic, constant currency basis.Breast Health revenue increased 24.2%, or 25.7% in constant currency, primarily due to improving semiconductor chip supply enabling additional gantry deliveries within the quarter, resulting in higher capital equipment revenue compared to the prior year period.Surgical revenue grew 23.4%, or 25.2% in constant currency, with strong results across an increasingly diverse business.Cash flow from operations remained very strong in the second quarter at $206.3 million. In addition, the Company repurchased 0.6 million shares of its stock for $50 million in the quarter.The Company was named on the Forbes list of America’s Best Midsize Employers 2023 and was ranked 14th among 500 midsize companies included on the list.The Company published its latest annual sustainability report, ""Making a World of Difference.""Story continuesKey financial results for the fiscal second quarter are shown in the table below.GAAPNon-GAAPQ2’23Q2’22ChangeIncrease(Decrease)Q2’23Q2’22ChangeIncrease(Decrease)Revenues$1,026.5$1,435.7(28.5%)$1,026.5$1,435.7(28.5%)Gross Margin57.1%65.9%(880 bps)62.1%71.0%(890 bps)Operating Expenses$313.7$352.5(11.0%)$317.0$338.2(6.3%)Operating Margin26.5%41.4%(1,490 bps)31.3%47.4%(1,610 bps)Net Margin21.3%31.7%(1,040 bps)25.9%36.5%(1,060 bps)Diluted EPS$0.87$1.80(51.7%)$1.06$2.07(48.8%)Throughout this press release, all dollar figures are in millions, except EPS, unless otherwise noted.

""We are raising our full-year guidance for both revenue and EPS, highlighting our confidence in the remainder of our fiscal year despite an uncertain macro environment.""Hologic’s financial guidance for the third quarter and full year 2023 is shown in the table below. The guidance is based on a full year non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 19.0%, and diluted shares outstanding of 250 million for the full year. Constant currency guidance assumes that foreign exchange rates are the same in fiscal 2023 as in fiscal 2022. Organic revenue guidance is in constant currency and excludes the divested Blood Screening business. Revenue from acquired businesses is generally included in organic revenue guidance starting a year after the acquisition. In fiscal 2023, Bolder is part of organic revenue starting in the fiscal second quarter.Current GuidancePrevious GuidanceGuidance $Reported %Increase(Decrease)Constant Currency% Increase(Decrease)Organic %Increase(Decrease)Guidance $Fiscal 2023Revenue$3,925 - $4,025(19.3%) to (17.2%)(18.5%) to (16.4%)(18.7%) to (16.6%)$3,850 - $4,000GAAP EPS$2.91 - $3.11(43.3%) to (39.4%)$2.69 - $2.99Non-GAAP EPS$3.75 - $3.95(37.7%) to (34.4%)$3.55 - $3.85Q3 2023Revenue$930 - $980(7.2%) to (2.3%)(6.9%) to (1.9%)(6.8%) to (1.8%)GAAP EPS$0.64 - $0.74(28.9%) to (17.8%)Non-GAAP EPS$0.83 - $0.93(12.6%) to (2.1%)This guidance assumes low double-digit constant currency organic revenue growth ex. COVID-19 for the total Company for the full-year fiscal 2023.Use of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThe Company has presented the following non-GAAP financial measures in this press release: constant currency revenues; organic revenues; organic revenues excluding COVID-19, non-GAAP gross margin; non-GAAP operating expenses; non-GAAP operating margin; non-GAAP effective tax rate; non-GAAP net income; non-GAAP net margin; non-GAAP EPS; adjusted EBITDA; and adjusted ROIC. Organic revenue for the fiscal second quarter of 2023 excludes the divested Blood Screening business. Revenue from acquired businesses is generally included in organic revenue starting a year after the acquisition. Organic revenue excluding COVID-19 revenues is organic revenue less COVID assay revenue, COVID related sales of instruments, collection kits and ancillaries, COVID related revenue from Diagenode and Mobidiag, as well as COVID related license revenue, and revenues from discontinued products. The Company defines its non-GAAP net income, EPS, and other non-GAAP financial measures to exclude, as applicable: (i) the amortization of intangible assets and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets; (ii) adjustments to record contingent consideration at fair value; (iii) additional expenses resulting from the purchase accounting adjustment to record inventory at fair value; (iv) restructuring charges, facility closure and consolidation charges (including accelerated depreciation), and costs incurred to integrate acquisitions (including retention, transaction bonuses, legal and professional consulting services); (v) expenses related to the divested Cynosure business incurred subsequent to the disposition date primarily related to indemnification provisions for legal and tax matters; (vi) transaction related expenses for acquisitions; (vii) third-party expenses incurred related to implementing the European MDR/IVDR requirements and obtaining the appropriate approvals for its existing products; (viii) debt extinguishment losses and related transaction costs; (ix) the unrealized (gains) losses on the mark-to-market of foreign currency contracts for which the Company has not elected hedge accounting; (x) litigation settlement charges (benefits) and non-income tax related charges (benefits); (xi) other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments and realized gains and losses resulting from the sale of investments; (xii) the one-time discrete impacts related to internal restructurings and non-operational items; (xiii) other one-time, non-recurring, unusual or infrequent charges, expenses or gains that may not be indicative of the Company's core business results; and (xiv) income taxes related to such adjustments. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as its non-GAAP net income plus net interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization expense included in its non-GAAP net income. The Company defines its adjusted ROIC as its non-GAAP operating income tax effected by its non-GAAP effective tax rate divided by the sum of its average net debt and stockholders’ equity, which is adjusted to exclude the effects of goodwill and intangible impairment charges.These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company's definition of these non-GAAP measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by others.The non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release adjust for specified items that can be highly variable or difficult to predict. The Company generally uses these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate management's financial and operational decision-making, including evaluation of Hologic's historical operating results, comparison to competitors' operating results and determination of management incentive compensation. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company's operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting Hologic's business.Because non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effect of items that will increase or decrease the Company's reported results of operations, management strongly encourages investors to review the Company's consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the tables accompanying this release.Conference Call and WebcastHologic’s management will host a conference call at 4:30 p.m. ET today to discuss its financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2023.

Conglomerates are under pressure from Wall Street to make their streaming services profitable after pumping billions of dollars into programming to attract subscribers.The rise of streaming has led to declining television ad revenue, as traditional TV audiences shrink and advertisers go elsewhere. The threat of a recession in the world's biggest economy also looms.The last WGA strike in 2007 and 2008 lasted 100 days. The action cost the California economy an estimated $2.1 billion as productions shut down and out-of-work writers, actors and producers cut back spending.The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which represents studios, said it had proposed ""generous increases in compensation,"" and was willing to increase its offer.But it said it objected to WGA demands that ""would require a company to staff a show with a certain number of writers for a specified period of time, whether needed or not.""Writers say they have suffered in the streaming TV boom with shorter seasons and smaller residual payments.""Wow. This is scary,"" Emmy-winning writer Ashley Nicole Black wrote on Twitter after the strike was called. ""But a future where we accept what the companies are trying to do - low paid, freelancer writing gigs with no job security - is much scarier.""Story continuesFor TV viewers, the strike's first impact will be seen on late-night talk shows such as ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" that count on teams of writers to pen topical jokes for programs recorded on the day they are broadcast.Those shows are expected to immediately start airing re-runs.""The Late Show"" host Stephen Colbert, in an episode taped just hours before the strike was called, showed pictures of his writing staff on screen in a gesture of support.""They're so important to our show,"" said Colbert, who also is a WGA member. ""I think that the writers' demands are not unreasonable.""Other TV programming may be disrupted depending on how long the strike lasts.Writers said they were willing to walk off the job because changes from streaming have made it difficult for many to earn a living in expensive cities such as New York and Los Angeles.Half of TV series writers now work at minimum salary levels, compared with a third in the 2013-14 season, according to WGA statistics. Median pay for scribes at the higher writer/producer level has fallen 4% over the last decade.Artificial intelligence (AI) is another issue at the bargaining table.The WGA wants safeguards to prevent studios from using AI to generate new scripts from writers' previous work. Writers also want to ensure they are not asked to rewrite draft scripts created by AI.With a potential strike looming, production already had ground to a halt in Los Angeles. Film LA, which issues permits for filming in Los Angeles, said it had no shoots for scripted shows scheduled for Tuesday or the rest of the week.If the work stoppage becomes protracted, the networks will increasingly fill their programming lineups with unscripted reality shows, news magazines and reruns. It also could lead to a delay of the fall TV season.

(NASDAQ:NFLX) has historically leaned on subscriber growth to drive its top line. However, the video streaming landscape has grown fiercely competitive over the years, leading to the company's slowdown in subscriber growth for the first time last year.Nevertheless, its robust subscriber growth over the past several quarters indicates the event was somewhat of a blip. Moreover, its management team is pivoting to explore new revenue-generating strategies, including introducing ad-supported, lower-cost subscription plans and implementing fees for password sharing. Hence, there is still plenty to like about the stock.NFLX 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of NFLXPeter Lynch Chart of NFLXFurthermore, the company's strong track record over the past decade is a testament to its ability to execute its new initiatives effectively. It remains committed to producing high-quality original content that keeps its viewers hooked. Though the company's stock seems to be fairly valued, the shift in discount rates following the Federal Reserve's upcoming changes could see its price growing past its 52-week high of $393.60.That being said, let's dive a little deeper into the Netflix story to assess its attractiveness at this time.Subscriber growth is keyIt is understandable why the bears are sounding the alarm about Netflix's business based on the the past few years. Revenue growth has slowed down substantially from its historical averages. However, it continues to grow its subscribers at an encouraging pace each quarter, which points to more upside ahead.For streaming companies, subscriber growth is critical in spinning the flywheel. The formula is straightforward; increased subscribers lead to higher revenues, which enable greater investments in fresh content. As a result, this positive cycle effectively retains the current subscriber and also lures in new viewers.Before getting to the positives, though, having a clearer picture of the company's revenue performance is important. In the past 12 months, its average revenue per share growth has slowed down to 5.80%. In contrast, the company's average revenue per share growth rate over the past three years was 16.20%, while 10 years showed a healthy 25.30% per year. Moreover, the chart below shows the slowdown as Netflix's revenue growth lags its historical growth rate.Story continuesNetflix's Stellar Subscriber Growth Outshines Its WeaknessesNFLX Data by GuruFocusRevenue growth has lagged over the past couple of years due to post-pandemic headwinds, intensifying competition in the streaming space, macroeconomic challenges and a slowdown in average revenue per user.Objectively speaking, the slowdown in revenue growth is concerning, but most of it is due to the evolving dynamics of the streaming market and the weaknesses in its business environment. Perhaps what is more noteworthy is that the streaming pioneer continues to grow its subscriber base at a remarkable pace.In the first quarter, it managed to amass an impressive 1.75 million new subscribers, taking its membership numbers past 232.50 million. Moreover, it has set on an addressable market of over one billion broadband households, which also includes roughly 500 million connected TV customers. Hence, it still has a massive growth runway ahead of it.An enticing futureThe landscape of television consumption is evolving at a rapid pace. Still, Netflix accounts for an estimated 10% to 20% of TV time in the U.S. It leaves plenty of room to grow and outpace its competition. Moreover, some of its peers, such as Disney (NYSE:DIS), are slashing their content budgets, creating an opportunity for the company to add to its viewership base.Furthermore, we see how proactively the company has grown its addressable market. It has implemented robust strategies, such as offering an ad-supported, lower-cost subscription tier and cracking down on password sharing. Its ""borrowers"" base it a whopping 100 million globally, leaving untapped potential subscribers offering a promising windfall in sales.Expanding horizons and emerging markets across the globe could add significantly to its growth potential. As we advance, Fortune Business Insights predicts the global streaming industry will skyrocket by 19.9% annually, reaching an eye-watering $1.6 trillion valuation by 2029.The bottom lineNetflix's historical subscriber-driven growth strategy has faced challenges due to rising competition. Despite a slowdown in subscriber growth last year, recent quarters have shown a robust resurgence, proving it was merely a hiccup. Moreover, it is now exploring new revenue avenues to bolster its success over the long run, positioning it as a juggernaut in the streaming sector for years to come.While revenue growth has slowed, its stellar subscriber growth numbers remain key to driving the streaming giant's monster success. With its massive addressable market, its growth prospects remain as vast as ever. Additionally, its proactive approach includes introducing ad-supported plans and password sharing crackdowns, enabling it to tap into a borrowers base of 100 million globally.Though some would consider it is trading at a premium multiple, its long-term outlook suggests the sstock will surge to new heights, offering incredible value for shareholders. In fact, its GF Value is at a whopping $633.6, making it significantly undervalued.Netflix's Stellar Subscriber Growth Outshines Its WeaknessesThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

The talks have centered on pay concerns brought on by the streaming boom, in addition to other fundamental changes within entertainment like the recent wave of cost-cutting that has prompted media giants from Disney (DIS) to Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) to enact mass layoffs and shelve multiple projects.Yahoo Finance reached out to both the WGA and the AMPTP for comment but did not immediately hear back.Writer's strike 'would really be a miserable thing'FILE - Striking Hollywood writers walk the picket line outside Paramount Studios on Dec. 13, 2007, in Los Angeles. In an email to members Monday, April 17, 2023, leaders of the Writers Guild of America said nearly 98% of voters said yes to a strike authorization if a new contract agreement is not reached with producers. (AP Photo/Nick Ut, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)What's different today versus prior years is just how much the streaming boom has changed the industry.Streaming shows often have fewer episodes and less residual income compared to traditional network television, which means less money in the pockets of these writers.At the same time, the majority of these studios are no longer just ""pure play"" production houses. Rather, they have their own streaming divisions, which have brought on a new set of challenges as direct-to-consumer losses mount.""Whether this is a blip on the radar or a prolonged strike like in 2007 remains to be seen,"" Scott Purdy, U.S. media industry leader at KPMG, told Yahoo Finance. ""In the near-term though, consumers should prepare for some of their favorite TV shows to be delayed and to potentially enter a period where there’s a limited amount of new content to watch. We’ll be watching to see how this impacts subscription decisions with inflation-pinched consumers who were already reassessing their spending habits.""Story continuesLate night television shows would be the first to feel the impact. Seth Meyers, who hosts NBC's ""Late Night"" show, said over the weekend, ""If a writers’ strike happens that would shut down production on a great many shows.""""It doesn’t just affect the writers, it affects all the incredible non-writing staff on these shows. And it would really be a miserable thing for people to have to go through, especially considering we’re on the heels of that awful pandemic that affected, not just show business, but all of us.""""What the writers are asking for is not unreasonable,"" he continued. ""If you don't see me here next week, know that is something that is not done lightly.""FILE - This July 13, 2014 file photo shows Seth Meyers at the NBC 2014 Summer TCA held at the Beverly Hotel in Beverly Hills, Calif. Meyers delivered an emotional monologue on President-elect Donald Trump's victory during his ""Late Night"" show on Nov. 9, 2016. (Photo by Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Studio executives have said they have enough scripted content banked to prevent disruptions to the content pipeline, but they'd still prefer to avoid a strike.""Just to be clear — we're at the table,"" Netflix (NFLX) co-CEO Ted Sarandos said during the company's quarterly earnings call last month.""We don't want [a] strike. The last time there was a strike, it was devastating to creators. It was really hard on the industry. It was painful for local economies that support production, and it was very, very, very bad for fans,"" Sarandos said. ""If there's a strike, we want to work really hard to make sure we can find a fair and equitable deal so we can avoid one. But if there is one, we have a large base of upcoming shows and films from around the world, so we could probably serve our members better than most.""Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav echoed similar sentiments during the company's Max streaming launch presentation last month, telling reporters, ""We’re assuming the worst from a business perspective. We’ve got ourselves ready. We’ve had a lot of content that’s been produced and we are launching a product on May 23.

If you don't want to get into details, feel free to skip to the Top 5 Entertainment Brands in the World.The entertainment industry is undoubtedly one of the biggest industries in the world. Entertainment brands have spread throughout the world, capturing audiences with their engrossing narratives, ground-breaking technologies, and creative approaches to entertainment in everything from films and TV shows to music and live events. Last year, the worldwide entertainment and media (E&amp;M) sector grew significantly faster than the world economy as a whole. Following a 2.3% dip in 2020 due to the pandemic, E&amp;M revenue increased by a robust 10.4% in 2021, from US$2.12 trillion to US$2.34 trillion.  In this context, it's critical to examine the leading entertainment brands that have had a big impact on the sector. By establishing themselves as household names and building a devoted following, these companies have dominated the entertainment industry. These major players in the sector include studios that make blockbuster films, record companies that produce top-charting singles, and theme parks that provide their guests with once-in-a-lifetime experiences. The most well-known entertainment companies, among others, include The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), Universal Studios, and Sony Pictures. These companies have transformed the entertainment sector by providing audiences with unmatched experiences using technology and creativity. They have also had a significant impact on popular culture and how we consume content.  Industry Outlook   New streaming options in the industry have completely changed how we consume entertainment, enabling us to binge-watch our favorite shows and films whenever we want with no restriction on the number of things we get to watch. Previously, we had to wait for a show to air at the exact time and could only watch one episode of the show per week. Statista reports that around 7.2 billion hours of content was viewed in the third quarter of 2022. Although Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) wasn't the original developer of streaming, it is thought to have been the first to popularize it, and since then, it has developed into one of the largest entertainment industries in the world, with ad revenue projected to increase by 39% CAGR from 2023 to 2026 and reach $1.7 billion by that year.Story continuesThe pandemic, in the opinion of experts, has simply hastened the transition from traditional to digital entertainment, and as a result, we have already passed the tipping point, which would have taken years to reach otherwise. People who were confined to their houses during lockdowns turned to stream all of their content to pass the time, making entertainment more individualized and digital than ever. Because of services like HBO Go, Amazon Prime, Hulu, and many others that offer streaming content, television is no longer as highly sought-after as it once was. Top 20 Entertainment Brands in the WorldCopyright: tang90246 / 123RF Stock PhotoOur Methodology   For our methodology, we have ranked the top 20 entertainment brands in the world in ascending order based on the highest market cap as of April 2023, for which the data is publicly available.

A strike would be the first by the WGA in 15 years.Writers say they have suffered financially during the streaming TV boom, in part due to shorter seasons and smaller residual payments. They are seeking pay increases and changes to industry practices that they say force them to work more for less money.Half of TV series writers now work at minimum salary levels, compared with one-third in the 2013-14 season, according to Guild statistics. Median pay for scribes at the higher writer/producer level has fallen 4% over the last decade.""The way that it's looking now is that there won't be a middle class in Hollywood,"" said Caroline Renard, a Guild liaison and writer who has worked on Disney Channel's ""Secrets of Sulphur Springs"" and other shows.Artificial intelligence is another issue at the bargaining table. The WGA wants safeguards to prevent studios from using AI to generate new scripts from writers' previous work. Writers also want to ensure they are not asked to rewrite draft scripts created by AI.The negotiations take place against a difficult economic backdrop for the industry. Entertainment conglomerates are under pressure from Wall Street to make their money-pit streaming services profitable, after investing billions of dollars on content to attract subscribers.They also are contending with declining television ad revenue, as traditional TV audiences shrink and advertisers go elsewhere. The threat of a recession also looms.The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which represents Comcast Corp, Disney, Warner Bros Discovery, Netflix and hundreds of production companies, has said it is committed to reaching a fair agreement.Story continuesLATE NIGHT WILL TAKE HITIf a strike is called, late-night shows such as ""The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon,"" ""Last Week Tonight with John Oliver"" and ""Saturday Night Live,"" which use teams of writers to craft topical jokes, are expected to immediately stop production.That means new episodes will not be available during their traditional TV time slots or on the streaming services that make them available the next day.Soap operas and other daytime shows such as ""The View"" will likely be disrupted. News programs would not be interrupted because those writers are members of a different union.Further ahead, the strike could lead to a delay of the fall TV season. Writing for fall shows normally starts in May or June. If the work stoppage becomes protracted, the networks will increasingly fill their programming lineups with unscripted reality shows, news magazines and reruns.Netflix may be insulated from any immediate impact because of its global focus and access to far-flung production facilities outside of the U.S.The last WGA strike in 2007 and 2008 lasted 100 days. TV networks broadcast reruns and more reality shows, and the effects rippled through the California economy as productions shut down and out-of-work writers, actors and producers cut back spending.The strike cost the state an estimated $2.1 billion and tipped its already fragile economy into a recession, according to the Milken Institute think tank.Studios do not want another disruption after the COVID-19 pandemic halted production worldwide for months. But budgets are tight, and a new era of fiscal austerity has dawned in Hollywood, with studios laying off thousands of employees and curtailing spending on content.""The writers have legitimate issues here,"" said one talent agent close to the bargaining process. ""But the studios and the producers have very legitimate issues also. Their stock prices are down. They've overspent on content. They need to show profits to their shareholders.""(Reporting by Lisa Richwine, Dawn Chmielewski and Danielle Broadway in Los Angeles; Editing by Mary Milliken and Jonathan Oatis)]"

COST, The TJX Companies, Inc. TJX, Target Corp. TGT and Dollar General Corporation DG.Industry: Discount RetailLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2087347/4-retail-discount-stocks-with-potential-to-beat-industry-bluesConsumer spending activity, which is one of the pivotal factors driving the economy, has somewhat slowed down. This is because inflation and recession-wary shoppers have curtailed spending. Underlying price pressure, a slowing labor market and a higher interest rate environment have cooled demand. Of late, players in the Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry have been encountering these headwinds.That said, industry participants have been focusing on deepening engagements with consumers, adding more compelling products and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities. Inventory management, supply-chain enhancement, cost-structure realignment and investments to accelerate digitization have been working in favor of companies like Costco Wholesale Corp., The TJX Companies, Inc., Target Corp. and Dollar General Corporation.About the IndustryThe Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry comprises companies that offer apparel, accessories, footwear, beauty products, personal and baby care products, cleaning products, pet supplies, and food and beverage products at lower prices than traditional retail outlets. The industry participants also provide home textiles, home furnishings, housewares, art and craft supplies, toys and seasonal decor products. These companies sell their products through stores, digital channels, or both.Some industry players operate membership shopping warehouse clubs, offering branded and private-label products in a range of merchandise categories. Most discount stores are gradually emerging as one-stop shopping destinations. The profitability of players depends on a prudent pricing model, a well-organized supply chain and an effective merchandising strategy.Story continues4 Key Industry Trends to WatchSoft Demand May Hit Revenues: Elevating prices and geopolitical concerns continue to pose a threat to consumer spending activity. Undoubtedly, the industry’s prospects are correlated with the purchasing power of consumers. However, rising prices have been discomforting family budgets. The Fed’s aggressive rate hikes to tame inflation also made things tough for consumers by squeezing disposable income.Consequently, the demand has softened. Also, concerns related to a slowing economy and a possible recession have hit consumers’ sentiments that slid to a nine-month low in April. Per Conference Board data, the Consumer Confidence Index nudged down to 101.3 in April from 104 in March.Pressure on Margins to Linger: Companies in the industry are vying for a bigger share on attributes such as price, products and speed to market. Further, the increasing dominance of e-commerce players has made the retail-discount space highly competitive. This has compelled many players to strengthen their digital ecosystem and boost shipping and delivery capabilities. While these endeavors drive sales, they entail high costs.Apart from these, higher marketing, advertising and other store-related expenses might compress margins. Of late, the industry participants have been dealing with product cost inflation. Nonetheless, companies have been focusing on undertaking initiatives to mitigate cost-related challenges. These include streamlining operational structures, optimizing supply networks and adopting effective pricing policies.Consumers Seek Better Bargains: The strategy to sell products at discounted prices has helped industry players draw customers in low-to-middle-income groups who have been seeking both value and convenience amid rising prices. Industry participants have been focusing on creating innovative and compelling products and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities. They are trying to tap any surge in demand unless derailed by elevated inflation. We also believe that failure to restock inventory at fair prices or delay in getting the products delivered to consumers’ doorsteps could compound retailers’ woes.Digitization is the Key to Growth: With the change in consumer shopping patterns, industry participants have been evolving to play dual in-store and online roles. Initiatives, such as building omnichannel, coming up with loyalty and marketing programs, enhancing the supply chain and providing faster delivery options, be it doorstep delivery, curbside pickup or buy online and pick up at the store, are worth mentioning.Simultaneously, companies are investing in renovation, improved checkouts and mobile point-of-sale capabilities to keep stores relevant. Keeping in mind consumers’ product preferences and growing inclination toward online shopping, retailers have been replenishing shelves with in-demand merchandise and ramping up investments in digitization.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry is housed within the broader Zacks Retail – Wholesale sector.

Its operating subsidiaries are: PSEG Power, Public Service Electric and Gas Company (PSE&amp;G) and PSEG Long Island. (PRNewsfoto/PSEG)Non-GAAP Operating Earnings for the first quarter of 2023 were $695 million, or $1.39 per share, compared to $672 million, or $1.33 per share for the first quarter of 2022.  Non-GAAP results for the first quarter of 2023 and 2022 exclude items shown in Attachments 7 and 8.""PSEG delivered solid operating and financial performance to begin the year and we are on track to achieve our full-year 2023 non-GAAP Operating Earnings guidance.  We are executing our plan to grow PSEG while also increasing its predictability – which we outlined at our March 10th Investor Conference that also detailed the decision to retain our five-unit nuclear generating fleet.  This year's utility capital spending budget of $3.5 billion will be directed to modernizing T&amp;D infrastructure, clean energy future programs, and ""Last Mile"" projects that support New Jersey's policies for energy transition.  The 2023 capital program represents PSE&amp;G's largest annual investment plan to date, and supports PSEG's long-term outlook for non-GAAP Operating Earnings growth of 5% to 7% over the 2023 through 2027 period."" said Ralph LaRossa, PSEG's chair, president and CEO.LaRossa continued, ""We recently completed the second phase of the Gas System Modernization Program (GSMP), and to continue these critical infrastructure investments, PSE&amp;G proposed GSMP III with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU) to invest $2.5 billion over a three-year period.  Also this quarter, PSEG achieved several milestone metrics in customer satisfaction and nuclear operations; negotiated new, four-year labor agreements with all of our NJ unions; and implemented back-to-back gas cost reductions that helped on the customer affordability front.""Story continuesEarnings GuidancePSEG is re-affirming its full-year, 2023 non-GAAP Operating Earnings guidance of $3.40 to $3.50 per share.  This range was narrowed in February 2023 with no change to the original midpoint, and reflects the actual pension impact of 2022 investment results on 2023 earnings and higher interest expense expectations offset by growth in regulated operations, a higher average hedged price for 2023, the majority of which was realized in the first quarter, and cost reduction efforts throughout the organization.  The following tables provide a reconciliation of PSEG's Net Income/(Loss) to non-GAAP Operating Earnings for the first quarter.

(https://corporate.pseg.com).Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresManagement uses non-GAAP Operating Earnings in its internal analysis, and in communications with investors and analysts, as a consistent measure for comparing PSEG's financial performance to previous financial results. Non-GAAP Operating Earnings exclude the impact of gains (losses) associated with the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust (NDT), Mark-to-Market (MTM) accounting and material one-time items.See Attachments 7 and 8 for a complete list of items excluded from Net Income/(Loss) in the determination of non-GAAP Operating Earnings. The presentation of non-GAAP Operating Earnings is intended to complement, and should not be considered an alternative to the presentation of Net Income/(Loss), which is an indicator of financial performance determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, non-GAAP Operating Earnings as presented in this release may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.Due to the forward-looking nature of non-GAAP Operating Earnings guidance, PSEG is unable to reconcile this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure because comparable GAAP measures are not reasonably accessible or reliable due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying measures that would be required for such reconciliation. Namely, we are not able to reliably project without unreasonable effort MTM and NDT gains (losses), for future periods due to market volatility. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and may have a material impact on our future GAAP results.Forward-Looking StatementsCertain of the matters discussed in this report about our and our subsidiaries' future performance, including, without limitation, future revenues, earnings, strategies, prospects, consequences and all other statements that are not purely historical constitute ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Another cohort of major utility stocks, including Edison International EIX and Public Service Enterprise Group PEG, is set to announce earnings on May 2.Factors to ConsiderDomestic-focused utility companies are focused on cost management and implementation of energy-efficiency programs. Favorable rate revision and customer additions have been creating fresh demand as well as assisting the utilities. Investment in strengthening the infrastructure has been allowing utilities to provide services even during extreme conditions, leading to stable earnings. Domestic-focused operations also insulate utilities from the adverse impact of currency fluctuation. These factors are projected to contribute to this sector’s Q1 results.A clear transition is evident in the Utilities space, with the players gradually moving toward clean sources of fuel to produce electricity and lower emission. The stringent regulations pertaining to emissions and the high cost of conventional fuel and government incentives on the usage of clean fuel have been leading utilities to focus more on clean energy sources. Many utilities have already pledged to provide 100% electricity from clean sources in the next few decades. We expect the Q1 results from utility companies to reflect such clean energy developments.The passage of Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is expected to have supported and accelerated utilities’ transition toward clean energy sources. IRA has removed the uncertainties relating to federal incentives provided for renewable sources usage. The Act entails an opportunity for a wide range of low-cost clean energy solutions in a much more predictable way for a long time and will create earnings visibility.However, the fact that utilities need massive funds to upgrade, maintain and expand their infrastructure and operations, have made their operations difficult in the current interest rate scenario. Thus, the capital-intensive utilities are likely to have experienced higher borrowing costs thanks to the increase in interest rates from near-zero levels, which in turn might have hurt their bottom line performance. Also, warmer-than-normal weather conditions in major parts of the United States might have had unfavorably impacted the utilities’ top-line performance in the January-March quarter.Story continuesQ1 ExpectationsTotal Q1 earnings of Utility stocks are expected to decline 4.7% year over year, while revenues are likely to improve 7.2%.For more details on quarterly releases, you can go through our latest Earnings Preview.Utilities' Earnings in FocusLet's take a look at the following utility companies that are scheduled to report first-quarter 2023 earnings on May 2 and find out how things have shaped up prior to the announcements.Edison International delivered a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 13.65%. Its service territories witnessed colder-than-normal temperatures, accompanied with frequent snowfall in some parts. This is likely to have boosted Q1 revenue growth.Higher interest expenses along with higher depreciation expense and wildfire claim payments might have hurt its bottom line (read more: Edison International to Post Q1 Earnings: What's in Store?).According to the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

It can be as simple as identifying dividend stocks to buy and hold for the next decade or more. Some of the most successful investors purchase dividend stocks with the intent to hold them indefinitely. Warren Buffett is one such investor with some of the names listed below. He’s a well-known proponent of investing in solid companies with long-term business potential. Indeed, that same simple model applies here as well.It’s a simple, low-risk strategy that mitigates potential losses, while providing income which can be spent, or used for reinvestment. Here are seven such stocks I think fit this profile.NEENextEra Energy$74.07KOCoca-Cola$63.55ALBAlbermarle$181.20PGProcter &amp; Gamble$154.58MDTMedtronic$89.97JPMJPMorgan Chase$135.23GDGeneral Dynamics$214.83InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsNextEra Energy (NEE)Nextra Energy (NEE) website on a mobile phone screenSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comNextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is the only energy producer on this list. Perhaps the reason oil stocks are conspicuously absent is because fossil fuel production and consumption are trending downward. That said, NextEra Energy offers the upside of secular trends in its renewable wind and solar business, NextEra Energy Resources (NEER). It balances that potential nicely with its utility business, Florida Power &amp; Light.The combined business controls the most prominent U.S. utility company and one of the world’s largest renewable companies. Thus, it’s clear that investors should be interested in the stock over the next decade.In 2022, NextEra Energy reported $20.95 billion in sales. Most of those sales – $17.3 billion – were attributable to FPL. FPL saw its revenue increase year-over-year, from $17.07 billion. So, NEE stock offers a notoriously stable utility business model, and the upside of NextEra’s massive renewable energy business. Notably, NextEra is also among the dividend stocks that haven’t reduced their distribution in 25+ years.Story continuesCoca-Cola (KO)coca-cola bottles and cans. coke is a blue-chip stocksSource: Fotazdymak / Shutterstock.comCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is the ideal choice for risk-verse, long-term-oriented investors. Unsurprisingly, KO shares comprise 8.5% of Warren Buffett’s portfolio. It’s a great business with readily-identifiable advantages, and remains the dominant name in soft drinks globally. It’s among the dividend stocks worth considering, with a dividend hasn’t been reduced since 1963, and a payout ratio indicative of a healthy business that continues to reinvest in internal growth.Coca-Cola is also a company that offers products with relatively low demand elasticity. Consumers tend to buy its products steadily across the business cycle. Accordingly, that’s part of the reason that KO stock boasts a low beta of 0.55. It’s simply not a volatile company, which is what beta measures. Instead, it’s a steady performer that risk-averse investors will certainly appreciate for the lack of drama and the steadily-increasing income.Classic Coca-Cola remains the core product for the firm, but the company maintains a portfolio of 200 brands optimized to provide drama-free returns to investors.Albemarle (ALB)Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screenSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.comAlbemarle (NYSE:ALB) stock is currently in a bit of a freefall, as commodity price fluctuations take their toll on the company’s shares. The firm is a significant producer of the lithium used in EV batteries. This, its shipments will rise and fall as market dynamics shift. That’s abundantly clear, as ALB stock has dropped to an 18-month low, after surging to record highs in late 2022.However, it wouldn’t be prudent to judge the opportunity in Albemarle by current short-term dynamics alone. Global lithium demand is expected to grow five-fold by 2030. The U.S. is a significant driver of that demand, and Albemarle is a prominent name domestically.Subsidies caused a rush in manufacturing that led to overproduction last year. Excess inventory has resulted. A drawdown will take time, but overarching trends remain. EVs are here to stay, and lithium will continue to be needed. It might also be wise to sit on the sidelines and try to buy ALB stock, as it continues to get cheaper.Procter &amp; Gamble (PG)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comProcter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) is the world’s largest consumer packaged goods company. Investing in firms that boast long-term, dominant positions in significant sectors is generally safe, so PG stock makes this list.Various metrics also suggest that now is a reasonable time to make that investment. Procter &amp; Gamble’s price-earnings ratio aligns with average levels over the past ten years. It’s not overpriced based on earnings. Further, over the last ten years, Procter &amp; Gamble has provided excellent returns to investors. It has averaged nearly 10% annual returns during that period. Every dollar invested and held would have grown into $2.52.That calculation doesn’t include dividends currently of $0.941 per share, paid quarterly. Thus, investors’ total returns are potentially quite a bit higher, factoring in stock repurchases and the power of compounding.PG stock benefits from higher pricing charged to consumers for things like toothpaste and detergent, proving sustainable demand, even as consumers become stretched.Medtronic (MDT)Medtronic (MDT) sign outside office building representing healthcare stocksSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comMedtronic (NYSE:MDT) is a business with apparent, stable demand for the next decade and beyond. The company specializes in medical devices and comprises cardiac, minimally invasive surgery, restorative therapies, and diabetes.With the world’s major economies continuing to age, it’s reasonable to anticipate that Medtronic will continue to grow for the foreseeable future. The company is expected to reach approximately $30.9 billion in sales this year and $32.3 billion in 2024. That’s not phenomenal growth by most measures, but extrapolated out, such gains add up. By 2023, 1 in 6 people are anticipated to be 60 years old, or more. Aging is associated with increased rates of diabetes and cardiac issues requiring pacemakers. Those are particular strengths for Medtronic.Medtronic shares are currently very close to being fully-priced, so waiting for them to fall to some arbitrary level might make sense before making a purchase. In any case, long-term trends favor Medtronic.JPMorgan Chase (JPM)JPMorgan Chase (JPM) lettering on a corporate office in New York City.Source: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.comJPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) would have been a good stock for long-term dividend investors to invest in early in 2023. Those prospects have only gotten better as the year has progressed. JPMorgan Chase is the largest U.S. bank and is only likely to get bigger. The banking crisis has provided the bank an opportunity to consolidate its lead.It’s old news now that depositors fled through JPMorgan Chase’s doors with their money as the banking crisis unfolded. Indeed, size equates to safety in the banking sector, so into JPM the deposits went. The bank played the part well, shoring up reserves by providing liquidity to failing regional banks. Thus, it all results in JPM stock looking better and better.If you didn’t buy shares at the depth of the crisis, now is the next best time. JPMorgan will deploy those deposits to build its brand into a bigger, more dominant banking chain.General Dynamics (GD)US tank General Dynamics (GD) Abrams M1A1 in military polygon in the exercise Platinum Lynx 16 on Galati, Romania, 11 December 2015Source: PhotoStock10 / Shutterstock.comGeneral Dynamics (NYSE:GD) is the lone defense firm among the 68 current dividend aristocrats. That means it boasts 25+ years of consecutive dividend increases, is listed in the S&amp;P 500, and meets liquidity and size requirements. It is arguably the best of the best defense firms for long-term investors.Top-line results are expected to increase at General Dynamics over the short term. That’s important. But it’s also important to understand that the next decade will also benefit General Dynamics. Geopolitical tensions are rising, and the threat of war with China only increases GD stock’s upside.This is also among the dividend stocks that have recently declared dividend, with General Dynamics putting forward a $1.32 dividend. This represents a 4.8% increase over last year’s dividend.Three out of four of General Dynamics’ business lines are defense-related, with only its aerospace division focused elsewhere on Gulfstream business jets. General Dynamics is only likely to get stronger over the coming decades.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The bottom-line surpassed estimates in one of the trailing four quarters, missed in two, and met in the other. The company delivered an average earnings surprise of 1.04% in the same time frame.Shares of ZTS gained 19.9% in the year-to-date period against the industry’s 1.3% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet's see how things might have shaped up in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Factors to ConsiderThe veterinary drugmaker derives most of its revenues from a diversified product portfolio of medicines and vaccines used to treat and protect livestock and companion animals. Zoetis’ remaining revenues are derived from its non-pharmaceutical product categories, such as nutritional and agribusiness, and products and services in biodevices, genetic tests and precision animal health.The company reports business results under two geographical operating segments — the United States and International.First-quarter revenues in the United States segment are likely to have increased from the previous quarter. The top-line estimate for this segment stands at $1.07 billion.International revenues in the last reported quarter were flat on a reported basis but increased 12% year over year on an operational basis. This trend is expected to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter. The top-line estimate for this segment stands at $957 million.Improved sales of Apoquel and Cytopoint brands must have boosted the dermatology portfolio in the first quarter. Zoetis’ CompanionAnimal business has also been performing well. This is primarily due to higher sales of Simparica Trio, a triple combination parasiticide for dogs, and the recent launches of its mAb therapies, Librela and Solensia. Such developments are likely to have driven growth in the to-be-reported quarter.However, livestock product sales and sales of cattle products are expected to have declined year over year, much like the previous quarter.Story continuesSales of poultry products in the United States segment declined in the last reported quarter. This was mostly due to the expanded use of lower-cost alternatives for premium products. However, the same increased in the International segment owing to market growth and demand generation efforts. The trend is likely to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter.  Sales of swine products must have also declined year over year due to increased generic competition.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Zoetis this time around.

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Masco (NYSE:MAS). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Masco with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. See our latest analysis for Masco Masco's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingGenerally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Masco managed to grow EPS by 16% per year, over three years. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. Despite the relatively flat revenue figures, shareholders will be pleased to see EBIT margins have grown from 12% to 15% in the last 12 months. Which is a great look for the company.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyWhile we live in the present moment, there's little doubt that the future matters most in the investment decision process. So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for Masco?Are Masco Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$12b company like Masco. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Indeed, they hold US$50m worth of its stock. This considerable investment should help drive long-term value in the business. Despite being just 0.4% of the company, the value of that investment is enough to show insiders have plenty riding on the venture.Story continuesWhile it's always good to see some strong conviction in the company from insiders through heavy investment, it's also important for shareholders to ask if management compensation policies are reasonable. Well, based on the CEO pay, you'd argue that they are indeed. For companies with market capitalisations over US$8.0b, like Masco, the median CEO pay is around US$13m.Masco's CEO took home a total compensation package of US$6.3m in the year prior to December 2022. First impressions seem to indicate a compensation policy that is favourable to shareholders. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense.Is Masco Worth Keeping An Eye On?One important encouraging feature of Masco is that it is growing profits. The growth of EPS may be the eye-catching headline for Masco, but there's more to bring joy for shareholders. With company insiders aligning themselves considerably with the company's success and modest CEO compensation, there's no arguments that this is a stock worth looking into. Before you take the next step you should know about the 2 warning signs for Masco (1 makes us a bit uncomfortable!) that we have uncovered.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

There are still suppliers of parts related to internal-combustion engines that are steadfast in their belief that the looming (and eventual) shift away from ICE toward any number of battery-electric propulsion formats is just a passing fad.In their view, scores of OEMs, suppliers, dealers, and infrastructure partners have it completely wrong. That the billions in investment earmarked in virtually every major global market to build a new ecosystem is capital that is misallocated. That years of industry strategic moves and government regulations to position both nations and organizations for success in a battery-electric vehicle future are in haste.Or, conversely, these legacy players may recognize that change is coming, but their corporate strategy is paralyzed by the surge of electric vehicle introductions.They will be the losers when the next history of the auto industry is written.While the pace and timing of this transition will be variable (read: lumpy), working under the premise of, ""When, not if,"" should be the rally cry among the supplier base. This existential threat is already separating winners from losers -- whether they know it or not.That's not to say the shift will be immediate, or that there won't be strong revenue streams to be had during this transformation. It will be protracted, and there are still tremendous profits to be made in the internal combustion space over the next couple of decades -- especially in the aftermarket.After all, there are 1.3 billion internal combustion cars on the world's roads today, according to S&amp;P Global Mobility estimates, and they aren't going to just vanish. Nor will BEVs take dominant share of the vehicles in operation for many years to come. But the shift is happening.There are thousands of moving parts in the internal-combustion powertrain; battery electric vehicles have only a couple dozen. As a result, there will be a brutal shakeout and consolidation among engine, transmission, and driveline suppliers in addition to those in the fuel and exhaust systems sectors. The victims will be those who failed to plan ahead and listen to their customers.Story continuesAs S&amp;P Global Mobility sees it, those suppliers have four strategic choices:Divest from ICE, and shift to BEV componentsMilk the cash cow dry, while shrinking to an eventual shutdownDouble down to become the dominant part supplierPosition to be acquiredWe will delve into the strategic ramifications of those choices, but first, a bit of history to set the gameboard to enable the decision-making process to begin.The ICE-to-BEV transition is but one recent concernThe last handful of years have been unkind to light-vehicle component suppliers. Impacted by numerous disruptions and resultant erratic production volumes, the recent past has been more of a daily dumpster fire for supplier executives.These mounting issues date back to early 2019 when once surging production volumes in China started to take a breather. According to S&amp;P Global Mobility's light vehicle production research, Mainland China's annual volumes more than doubled to 26.6 million units between 2009 and 2018. But in 2019, volume slipped greater than 8% in one year and started an endless cascade of industry hurdles. Meanwhile, in North America, a late-2019 labor spat between General Motors and the UAW impacted scores of suppliers.Then COVID hit, shuttering output for almost two months and crippling output for months to come. North American production slipped more than 20% in 2020. In many respects, the light vehicle production ecosystem has been reeling ever since, with few opportunities to come up for air.Macroeconomic impacts started with ongoing semiconductor shortages for automotive-grade chips, followed by growing geopolitical trade tensions spiked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and capped by mounting labor availability issues. Though abating in amplitude of late, the industry will still feel these extraneous pressures through the end of 2023.But there were industry-specific issues as well. Suppliers were sandwiched between OEMs and their capability to lever vehicle prices/content upwards with end customers. Meanwhile, upstream material suppliers gained new pricing leverage due to the strength of demand as COVID abated. As an example, hot rolled steel is expected to rise 14% from last fall to the end of next year. As a result, tier 1 and 2 suppliers are caught in the middle.Add to this other external cost pressures such as wages, logistics, and energy prices - suppliers are longing for the days of predictable output and cost stability. Adding to the equation are rising interest rates, which increases the cost of debt service among lending institutions with a renewed focus on debt quality.The supplier cost squeeze has limited strategic optionsWhy the history lesson, the circumstances of which would hurt the industry even if there weren't a fundamental shift in its propulsion method? Because it magnifies the situation.Even if it were the best of the times, an industry experiencing this sort of transformation from ICE to BEV propulsion would have its fair share of participants throwing in the towel. Add the aforementioned financial pressures and risk dynamics impacting the industry since 2019, and you have a recipe for significant industry turnover.This frantic pace of change and its inherent risks for capital in a rising interest rate environment, the skills/process transition required, and the advantages gained by innovators and first movers in this new environment is head spinning. Emerging from this unfortunate timing combination of significant competitive challenges will be an ecosystem which will not resemble the one in which we entered this century. Despite the challenges, nimble industry participants -- be they OEMs, suppliers or dealers -- will leverage this tumult to their advantage.Early evidence of a looming propulsion transition emerged even before 2019. Both China and the European Union understood (albeit for differing reasons) that legislating vehicle emission reductions through the coming decade was going to upend the competitive dynamics of their home market vehicle manufacturers and the suppliers which served them.As a result, OEMs will be required to devote a substantial share of capital expenditures to battery-electric propulsion systems and platform structures. They are understandably reducing their focus and resources on traditional ICE systems due to limited payback and slowly abating volumes/utilization.Back in 2015, the number of new engine combinations (family/program) launched for production in North America reached 13; in 2025, this will plummet to two, according to S&amp;P Global Mobility forecasting data. The result of this transformation is predictable. Impacted suppliers in these ICE-focused systems are being asked to extend programs past their expected life cycles, slow efforts to integrate innovation, and search for efficiencies to lower/control costs.Some ICE powertrain suppliers may discover they are unable to pivot to a BEV world. One option for entrapped medium-sized suppliers may be to ride an ever-decreasing ICE revenue stream until the business is unsustainable; Wall Street tends to look unkindly on that business model. Another path is to become the dominant supplier in a niche segment - be it for throttle bodies, ignition coils, exhaust manifolds, or some such - and hope that the aftermarket business is sufficient to keep the business afloat.While traditional propulsion systems suppliers face these challenges, an opportunity is emerging for others to build new value chains and differentiate innovations and competitive advantages as first movers.The new world: Think global, source local, build localThough the number of new BEV platforms (all-new structures and processes) has primarily been initiated in China and the European Union through this decade so far, North America is catching up quickly. Installation of new, highly flexible BEV platforms is already underway in North America. According to S&amp;P Global Mobility, 84 BEV nameplates, built at 47 vehicle production lines, are forecast by 2025 - and North American numbers may surge due to benefits incurred under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). For many of these offerings, development and component sourcing occurred years ago.The emerging BEV production ecosystem has few similarities to that of today's ICE-focused version. For decades the advantages of a globally-rationalized industry were touted as optimal - the tide is now turning.For instance, the days of efficiently sourcing engines and transmission from over an ocean has given way to propulsion systems (battery cells and enclosures) produced regionally. We are entering a BEV chain based on localism - usually within a couple hundred miles of the final-assembly plant. While this new supply chain was forming well ahead of the recently enacted IRA, financial incentives will drive even greater value-add through the upstream battery inputs (anode &amp; cathode material) within North America.What's more, geopolitical risks, potential trade frictions (such as between the United States and China), sustainability and ESG concerns, and growing logistics issues will drive tomorrow's supply chain even closer to home factories. Suppliers will need to adapt to nearer supply networks, an even-greater concentration on efficiency, and labor stability to build robust upstream chains.Irrational exuberance and overcompensationThere also is a danger in changing course too quickly. What happens to suppliers that go all-in on an electrification push that does not meet expectations?After all, it's an industry truism that, if you added up each automaker's calendar year sales projections, the US market would be 22 million vehicles. Of course, it has never come close to that.Mike Wall, executive director of automotive analysis, warns that sort of overexuberance in sales projections seen with internal-combustion vehicles could happen just as easily with electric vehicles. And suppliers could end up holding the bag.""Automakers are making some big production projections. One will say, 'We're going to sell 1 million EVs.' Then the next one says, 'We're going to sell 2 million.' And suppliers are being told to plan for this much capacity,"" Wall said.""If you are a supplier told to plan for a vehicle with 150,000-unit volume, what if it happens to come in at 50,000? Besides altering the basic profit potential for the part, if you amortize tooling and development costs into your piece costs, it will take much longer to recover those costs, if it ever happens. If you are a supplier, you won't be selling at 100% capacity at job one,"" Wall added.These are important considerations as suppliers venture into the quoting process for any new business, particularly electrified vehicles.Additionally, going it alone may not be the optimal path. Reacting to new opportunities through alliances and partnerships will be key as the speed of vehicle development rises. A new competitive dynamic will emerge as reliance on past advantages gives way to a new definition of success or failure.Those suppliers slow to transition to BEV technologies have missed the initial surge. Remember that there are three timelines in the industry:Development (which occurs up to five years before start of production)Tooling for production (two to three years before start of production); andService/aftermarket requirements once in service.It's a harsh assessment, but given the time-factors involved, a supplier's strategic perspective needed to be in play years ago. In an industry built on relationships, the need to break into the BEV supplier base will be frenetic. But BEV propulsion uses a fraction of the parts required for internal combustion, and as a result, more than a few suppliers will be left standing without a chair when the music stops. The level of displacement and disruption will be significant.

178,9fb12143-1579-3f96-b871-df8b211cdbcd,TSN,2023-05-02,Firm that hired kids to clean meat plants keeps losing work,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/firm-hired-kids-clean-meat-190848520.html,1682968128,STORY,['TSN'],"[OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — The slaughterhouse cleaning company that was found to be employing more than 100 children to help sanitize dangerous razor-sharp equipment like bone saws has continued to lose contracts with the major meat producers since the investigation became public last fall.For its part, Packers Sanitation Services Inc., or PSSI as it is known, said it has taken a number of steps to tighten up its hiring practices but it says the rising number of child labor cases nationwide is likely related to the increase in the number of minors crossing the U.S. border alone in recent years.The scandal that followed the February announcement that PSSI would pay a $1.5 million fine and reform its hiring practices as part of an agreement with investigators also prompted the Biden administration to urge the entire meat processing industry to take steps to ensure no kids are working in these plants either for the meat companies or at contractors like PSSI.Federal investigators confirmed that children as young as 13 were working for PSSI at 13 plants in Arkansas, Colorado, Indiana, Kansas, Minnesota, Nebraska, Tennessee and Texas. It wasn't immediately clear if any additional children have been found working for the company because PSSI declined to answer that and government officials haven't offered an update on the investigation since February.The Labor Department has said there has been a 69% increase since 2018 in the number of children being employed illegally nationwide, and it has more than 600 child labor investigations underway. Officials have said they are particularly concerned about the potential exploitation of migrants who may not even have a parent in the United States.PSSI maintains that it prohibits hiring kids and the only way children could have been hired is “through deliberate identity theft or fraud at a local plant. Regardless of the reason they occurred, it is our responsibility to address the problem.”Story continues“As has been widely reported, the recent record rise in unaccompanied minors from abroad and rising prevalence of identity theft has clearly revealed new vulnerabilities in the area of underage labor across hundreds of different businesses including ours,” PSSI spokesman Ray Hernandez said.Companies like PSSI are put in a difficult situation of having to turn away applicants who appear to have a valid ID when they want to hire workers, and they also have to be careful not to discriminate by imposing extra scrutiny on immigrants, said David Bier, an immigration policy expert at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute that advocates for more open immigration laws. The fact that more than half a million children have crossed the border without their parents since 2019 creates a large group of minors who may try to get jobs.""Seventeen-year-old, 16-year-old or 15-year-old even gets an ID and a company needs workers, it’s difficult to police,” Bier said. And the meatpacking industry is always desperate to find more workers. “If you’re willing to do the work and you have an ID, then you’re going to be able to get a job.”Cargill, Tyson Foods and JBS have all terminated contracts with PSSI at at least some of their plants — particularly any plants where Labor Department investigators confirmed children were working — although Cargill went furthest and cut ties with the Kieler, Wisconsin-based company entirely. Another meat processing giant, Smithfield Foods, said only that it is taking a close look at its contracts with PSSI, which currently cleans about one-third of the company’s 45 plants, to ensure that all labor laws are being followed.Those four companies, along with National Beef, control over 80% of the beef market and more than 60% of the pork market nationwide. National Beef didn’t respond to questions about its actions.Cargill spokeswoman April Nelson said the company notified PSSI in March that it would end all 14 of its contracts because “we will not tolerate the use of underage labor within our facilities or supplier network.”Tyson and JBS officials also reiterated their commitment to eliminating child labor in their plants, and they said each of their companies had ended PSSI contracts at several plants. But they declined to provide specific numbers about how many contracts they cut and how many plants PSSI is still cleaning for them.“Tyson Foods is committed to compliance with all labor laws and holding those we do business with to the highest standards of accountability,” said Dan Turton, a senior vice president at Tyson, in a letter to members of Congress about their child labor concerns. He promised Tyson would step up its audits of contractors and continue cooperating with federal officials to ensure its own hiring meets all standards.The major meat processors say they are looking to bring more of the cleaning work at their plants in house, but they will likely continue to rely on contractors in many places. Tyson, for instance, said that its own workers clean about 40% of its plants.PSSI wouldn't say how many workers it has laid off after losing contracts, but the way it describes itself on its website hints at the job losses. PSSI now says it has about 16,500 employees nationwide working at more than 400 plants, down from the more than 17,000 it cited last fall before the investigation. Still, it remains one of the largest cleaners of food processing plants.PSSI says it is going above and beyond what the official court agreement required to ensure no kids are working there. And the company, which is owned by the New York-based private equity firm Blackstone, named a new CEO who just took over last week after its longtime top executive retired after 24 years.PSSI hired a former U.S. Customs and Border Patrol officer to help strengthen the training its managers get to spot identity theft, and brought on a former Labor Department official to conduct monthly unannounced checks on its practices. The company also set up a hotline for employees to anonymously report any concerns.]"
179,af24a657-c393-308c-9695-df520c56c2a2,TSN,2023-05-02,Tyson Foods (TSN) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Can the Stock Move Higher?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tyson-foods-tsn-expected-beat-140002513.html,1682949602,STORY,['TSN'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Tyson Foods (TSN) reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 8. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis meat producer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.78 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -65.9%.Revenues are expected to be $13.6 billion, up 3.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.78% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Tyson?For Tyson, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.65%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Tyson will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Tyson would post earnings of $1.35 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.85, delivering a surprise of -37.04%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Tyson appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Kellogg (K) earns a Zacks Rank #3 three days from its next quarterly earnings release on May 4, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.01 a share.By taking the percentage difference between the $1.01 Most Accurate Estimate and the $1 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Kellogg has an Earnings ESP of 0.17%.K is part of a big group of Consumer Staples stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Tyson Foods (TSN) as well.Tyson Foods is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on May 8, 2023. TSN's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.78 a share seven days from its next earnings release.Tyson Foods' Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 0.65% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.78.K and TSN's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Story continuesFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

This snacks and convenience food company delivered an earnings surprise of 11.9% in the last reported quarter.We expect first-quarter revenues to grow 3.6% to $3,805.9 million and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to decline to $1.Kellogg Company Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseKellogg Company price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Kellogg Company QuoteFactors to ConsiderKellogg has been gaining from revenue growth management, momentum across snacks and emerging markets as well as recovery in the North America cereal business. Management expects price realization, momentum in its categories and solid brand plans to contribute to its net sales growth in 2023. This bodes well for the quarter under review.Kellogg has been seeing the adverse impacts of input cost inflation stemming from global constraints and shortages. Escalated SG&amp;A expenses have also been a concern. These factors may have affected Kellogg’s profits in the first quarter.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Kellogg this time. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat, which is the case here.Kellogg has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.17%.

185,4001b7e5-609d-3eeb-bb91-5eea4236da36,MA,2023-05-02,15 Most Acquisitive Public Companies in the US,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-most-acquisitive-public-companies-235715088.html,1682985435,STORY,"['GE', 'MA', 'WMT', 'PG', 'XOM', 'TSLA', 'V', 'JPM']","[In this article, we take a look at the 15 most acquisitive public companies in the US. For more on this, go to 5 Most Acquisitive Public Companies in the US.Through acquisition, companies can bring an effective pool of resources, broaden their market reach, and compete efficiently with their rivals. This article will give investors and stakeholders an insight into the 15 most acquisitive public companies in the US.Market OutlookIn 2021, the US acquisition market had the highest record of $2.9 trillion in transactions, an increase of 55% from $1.9 trillion in 2020. At this time, the U.S. acquisitions market was unparalleled (up from less than 50% in 2020). This represents over 60% of all worldwide agreements based on the stated value.In times of uncertainty or market volatility, M&amp;A tends to slow down, but those can also be the exact times when valuations improve, and opportunities present themselves. Having said that, 2022 was a year of uncertainty due to rising inflation. North America's fourth quarter of 2022 saw a dismal finish to a challenging year as corporations refrained from growing due to rising interest rates and a weakening economy.According to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence statistics, the overall value of mergers and acquisitions in the United States decreased to $1.477 trillion in 2022, down 41.4% from 2021. In 2022, there were 20,965 transactions, a 21.2% decrease from the previous year.Early in 2023, concerns about a global recession and increasing interest rates maintained a shadow over the short-term economic picture as central bankers worked to contain high inflation in several areas. So it's understandable why executives have been pushed back on their heels given the crisis in Ukraine, other geopolitical risks, supply chain interruptions, increased regulatory scrutiny, and the jittery investors still processing 2022's precipitous collapse in global stock market prices.Interest Rate - A Big Concern in 2023 for Acquisitive Public CompaniesSince the start of October 2022, businesses have been developing their budgets and business plans for 2023. Numerous changes have occurred in the economy and financial markets during this time. Two major worries are rising interest rates worldwide and how long they could stay high.Story continuesOn the ten-year bond issued by the US Department of the Treasury, interest rates are approximately the same in 2009 and 2022, ranging between 3 and 4 percent. However, credit was much more accessible back then because governments had opened the floodgates of fiscal support.US ""new money"" leveraged-loan issuance through October 2022 (i.e., not a refinancing) is down roughly a third year to date compared to 2021. A comparable metric for high-yield bonds is down by about 70% year over year, and 2021 was worse than 2020.2023 will be an incredible year for potential US acquisitive public companies. These businesses should be better protected against the hazards of an economic downturn because of their strong and adaptable balance sheets. They should also have reserves to take advantage of the worthwhile growth prospects of a recession's recovery phase.Cross-Border Acquisitions Might Get IncreasedDeal-making across international boundaries was considerably slowed down in 2022 by the COVID-19 epidemic, trade tensions between the U.S. and China, and regionally different economic situations. As a result, from 2012 through 2022, the average annual percentage of worldwide M&amp;A dollar volume is roughly 18%.Although M&amp;A was not exempt from all of this turmoil, cross-border M&amp;A remained alluring to dealmakers. In 2022, cross-border transactions accounted for 32% ($1.1 trillion) of all worldwide M&amp;A, which was in line with the average percentage for the previous ten years (35%). $217 billion in transactions were spent on acquiring American firms by non-American parties in 2022, accounting for 6% of worldwide M&amp;A activity and 19% of cross-border M&amp;A activity. Acquirers from China, India, and other emerging economies accounted for only 8% of the volume of cross-border acquisitions of U.S. targets, compared to 50% from the British, Canadian, Singaporean, Australian, and Japanese acquirers.15 Most Acquisitive Public Companies in the USPhoto by Kai Wenzel on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe have selected the most acquisitive public companies based on factors like the number of deals (acquisitions) made by an organization, the acquiring companies' total buying value, the acquirer's market capitalization, and the quality companies (potential companies) being acquired by the acquirer. After analyzing and combining all these factors, the 15 most acquisitive public companies are chosen. The main sources include Mckinsey, Companiesmarketcap, and Mergr. The companies are picked and ranked in ascending order based on the above four factors.15. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)A worldwide manufacturer of consumer products, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) has been in business for more than 180 years – founded in 1837. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) has made 12 investments and 21 acquisitions during its existence. Over $59.90 billion has been spent by the company on acquisitions.

In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 0.85%. It pulled off a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 3.75%, on average. The company is expected to have recorded lower year-over-year revenues due to falling demand for its smartphone chips amid global uncertainty.Factors at PlayDuring the to-be-reported quarter, Qualcomm introduced Snapdragon 7+ Gen 2 for mobile platform to boost performance and ensure greater power efficiency. Leveraging Snapdragon X62 5G Modem-RF System, it provides greater bandwidth connectivity and up to 4.4 Gbps download speed. The 5G/4G Dual-Sim Dual Active (DSDA) technology lets users utilize two SIM cards to differentiate their personal and professional interactions.The newly-released series ensures a more realistic gaming experience for end users and the Auto Variable Rate Shading (VRS) delivers greater power efficiency and enhanced capabilities. Integrated AI improves visual quality, gaming scenes and graphics and boosts performance by 40%. It also leverages Qualcomm Sensing Hub, an efficient AI processor that provides contextual awareness and enhances the audio. This is likely to be reflected in the upcoming quarterly results.However, Qualcomm anticipates a rapid deterioration in demand for its handset chips, as high inventory combined with low demand situations have forced vendors to reduce shipments drastically. Rising geopolitical tension in Europe and Asia is fueling global instability and adding to the macroeconomic challenges. In addition, softness in demand in China due to the adverse economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic is likely to have affected unit volumes. These are likely to have hurt the company’s fiscal second-quarter revenues.For the March quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $9,080 million, indicating a decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure of $11,164 million. Adjusted earnings per share are pegged at $2.16, suggesting a contraction from $3.21 recorded in the year-earlier quarter.Story continuesKey Developments in Q2In the fiscal second quarter, Qualcomm inked an agreement with Iridium Communications Inc. to enable satellite-based messaging services in Android phones. The deal will enable customers to stay connected through satellite communication facilities even when there is no Wi-Fi or cellular data connectivity. The service is likely to be available in select regions in premium Android smartphones from the second half of 2023.Dubbed Snapdragon Satellite, the service will be accessible in devices that utilize the second-generation Snapdragon 8 mobile platform. These include laptops, tablets, IoT devices and connected vehicles. The collaboration with Qualcomm will likely help Iridium to “serve the smartphone industry horizontally” and gradually extend this service to other verticals.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not predict an earnings beat for Qualcomm for the fiscal second quarter.

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 78% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Institutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's market cap fell by US$4.2b last week. However, the 11% one-year return to shareholders may have helped lessen their pain. They should, however, be mindful of further losses in the future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Lockheed Martin, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Lockheed Martin?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Lockheed Martin. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Lockheed Martin's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Lockheed Martin. State Street Global Advisors, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 15% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 9.0% and 7.0% of the stock.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 13 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Lockheed MartinThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Lockheed Martin Corporation. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$91m worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 22% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Lockheed Martin better, we need to consider many other factors. Be aware that  Lockheed Martin is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis , you should know about...But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do.

BYD, PACCAR Inc. PCAR, Meta Platforms, Inc. META, PulteGroup, Inc. PHM and Life Time Group Holdings, Inc. LTH.5 Excellent Stocks to Ride on Relative Price StrengthClosing out last week, the Fed’s favored inflation report — Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) — came in line with estimates. Among other economic positives, the regional bank failures of last month are likely in the rear-view mirror, while the labor market continues to be resilient.At the same time, we should avoid painting an overly optimistic picture by overstating the improvements. While we are well off the peaks we saw in 2022, we have apparently hit a bed of resistance. In other words, inflation is indeed coming down, but too slowly. It means a near-certainty that another quarter-point rate hike is in the cards.We believe that more visibility regarding the future market direction will only be available post first-quarter 2023 earnings season, along with management guidance and business outlook.Till then, investors who want to stay exposed to the equity setup should focus on good investment opportunities. One of the ways such potential plays could be identified is to look for signs of relative price strength.Relative Price Strength StrategyInvestors generally gauge a stock’s potential returns by examining earnings growth and valuation multiples. At the same time, it’s essential to measure the performance of such a stock relative to its industry or peers, or an appropriate benchmark. If you see that a stock is underperforming on fundamental factors, it would be prudent to move on and find a better alternative. However, those outperforming their respective sectors in terms of price should be selected because they stand a better chance of providing considerable returns. Then again, it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength. Stocks delivering better than the S&amp;P 500 for 1 to 3 months at least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy.Story continuesFinally, it is crucial to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings of these companies. In order to do this, we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter’s (Q1) earnings to our screen. When a stock undergoes an upward revision, it leads to additional price gains.Here are five of the 10 stocks that made it through the screen:Boyd Gaming Corp.: This is a multi-jurisdictional gaming company, which owns and operates gaming entertainment properties in several states.

(NYSE:PHM) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript April 25, 2023PulteGroup, Inc. beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $2.35, expectations were $1.81.Operator: Good morning. My name is Audra and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PulteGroup Inc. Q1 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jim Zeumer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Jim Zeumer: Great. Thank you, Audra. Good morning. I want to thank everyone for joining today’s call. As you read in this morning’s press release, PulteGroup had an exceptional first quarter and we are excited to discuss our operating and financial results. Participating on today’s call are Ryan Marshall, President and CEO; and Pablo Shaughnessy, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Ossowski, Senior Vice President, Finance. A copy of our earnings release and this morning’s presentation slides have been posted to our corporate website at pultegroup.com. We will post an audio replay of this call later today. As noted in this morning’s earnings release, to be more consistent with industry reporting practices, effective with our first quarter 2023 reporting, the company has reclassified closing cost incentives and cost of sales to net revenues for all periods presented.This reclassification impacted the company’s reported home sale revenues and associated average sales price as well as home sale gross margin and SG&amp;A percentages, but had no impact on reported earnings. An analysis of the impacts on the current quarter in comparable prior year period is included in this morning’s press release and can be found in our webcast slides associated with today’s call. Our comments today reflect these changes for all periods referenced. Also, I want to inform everyone that today’s discussion includes forward-looking statements about the company’s expected future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments today. The most significant risk factors that could affect future results are summarized as part of today’s earnings release within the accompanying presentation slides.Story continuesThese risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual and quarterly reports. Now, let me turn the call over to Ryan. Ryan?Ryan Marshall: Thanks, Jim and good morning. Based on the improving demand dynamics we experienced in the fourth quarter of last year, we were cautiously optimistic heading into 2023. I am extremely pleased to report that the market momentum that began building in Q4 continued to expand into the first quarter of 2023. Today’s stronger market conditions, combined with actions implemented by our outstanding field teams to enhance our competitive position helped drive our first – strong first quarter results that included a 15% growth in home sale revenues, a 100 basis point increase in operating margin and a 28% increase in earnings per share. Among the actions we have taken has been to increase our production of spec homes, a strategy we began implementing in the back half of 2022.As discussed on previous earnings calls, we made the decision to increase spec starts as we saw the opportunity to realize a number of strategic benefits within our homebuilding operations. With more units in production, we can better meet buyer demand as more consumers are seeking quick move-in homes as a hedge against rising mortgage rates. By maintaining the level of spec starts, we can commit to a more consistent start cadence. This is particularly valuable in today’s environment when negotiating with our trades and suppliers. Keeping units in production allows us to turn assets more efficiently which is critical to delivering high returns over the housing cycle. The importance of having an appropriate inventory of spec homes available can be seen in our first quarter sign-ups, which on a gross basis increased 1% over last year to 8,900 homes.Of these sign-ups, almost 60% were spec sales, so the decision to increase spec starts was the right one. That said I want to be clear that our strategy is to keep starts directionally in alignment with market demand. We believe this balanced approach is consistent with both these historic business practices and allows us to turn our assets while maintaining a better margin profile. Our first quarter results show that we are successfully executing against this strategy as we realized strong sales while still delivering exceptional gross margins of 29.1%. You have heard me say that we won’t be margin proud, but we also won’t sacrifice profits if we don’t have to. By being more measured in our starts cadence, we can meet buyer demand while not oversupplying the market.Case in point, we ended the first quarter with 1,500 fewer specs in production than we started the quarter. This gives us flexibility to maintain or increase production volumes, which in today’s market is an important lever when working with trades and suppliers. As it relates to overall housing demand, home sales are benefiting from recent declines in mortgage rates, but I also think just having a general sense of stability in rates is important to consumer confidence. Given improvements in demand conditions in the broader interest rate environment as well as a generally limited inventory of existing homes, we are starting to see the pressure on selling prices ease in many of our markets. In fact, and well over half of our markets, we have found opportunities to pull back on incentives and/or move prices higher in many of our communities.While the price changes are modest, it demonstrates the point that people desire home ownership and are willing to buy when they see value. Earlier this month, there was an article in the Wall Street Journal that looked at the housing shortage in this country. The article raised the point that depending upon which expert you ask, the housing shortage ranges from 2 million to 7 million houses. While there are certainly debates about the number, I think there is broad agreement that we have a housing shortage. I believe this is one of the reasons homebuyers are quick to respond when affordability pressures can be eased. Before turning the call over to Bob, let me take a minute to address impacts on credit availability given recent disruptions in the banking industry, particularly among the regional banks.The short answer is that we have not experienced any disruptions. On the mortgage side, we are advantaged by having a captive financial services operation that routinely originates mortgages for between 75% to 80% of Pulte homebuyers that require financing. On the project side, big builders such as PulteGroup, self-fund or have access to capital that smaller builders typically cannot match. In the end, it maybe that recent disturbances in the banking sector may create opportunities for PulteGroup to put its more than $2 billion in total liquidity to work. I am very proud of our team as PulteGroup delivered exceptional operating and financial results in the quarter. I am also highly encouraged by the improving demand conditions we have been experiencing over the past two quarters.And I would add that buyer demand has remained strong through the first few weeks of April. While we have and will continue to take steps to best position PulteGroup for success within today’s changing market dynamics, we remain measured and disciplined in our actions. From production rates and land spends to overheads and share repurchases, we remain focused on delivering performance over the long-term. Now, let me turn the call over to Bob for a detailed review of the quarter.Pablo Shaughnessy: Thanks, Ryan and good morning. As Jim noted at the beginning of the call, we have reclassified closing cost incentives from cost of sales to net revenues for all periods presented. The total incentive reclassified amounts is $81 million in the first quarter of this year and $38 million in the first quarter of last year. This reclassification impacted our reported home sales revenue and associated average sales prices as well as our reported home sale gross margin and SG&amp;A percentages. An analysis of the impact of this reclassification in the current quarter and prior year periods is included in today’s webcast slides. Where appropriate, any numbers referenced in my comments, current, past or future are inclusive of this reclass.Let me now get started with a review of our first quarter results. Home sale revenues in the first quarter increased 15% over the prior year to a first quarter record of $3.5 billion. Higher revenues for the period reflect a 6% increase in closings to 6,394 homes and a 9% increase in average sales price to $545,000. On a year-over-year basis, we realized higher average sales prices across all buyer groups, led by double-digit gains in both move-up and active adult. In the quarter, we reported 6,394 closings, which represents a 6% increase over the comparable prior year period. Our closings for the quarter came in above our guide as we capitalized on stronger demand for spec homes, an improvement in select areas of our supply chain that allowed us to close additional homes in the period.I’d like to take a moment to thank our procurement and construction teams working in partnership with our trades and suppliers for their contributions over the last several quarters. Their efforts during a time of extraordinary market volatility were instrumental to the operating success we have achieved. Looking at the mix of our closings in the quarter, our results included 39% from first-time buyers, 35% for move-up buyers and 26% from active adult. In the first quarter of last year, the closing mix was 34% first-time, 40% move-up and 26% active adult. The higher percentage of closings from first-time buyers reflects our increased investment in that part of our business over the last several years as well as an increase in the availability of spec homes in our first-time communities, resulting from our decision to increase spec production to the back half of 2022.Looking at our orders in the quarter, our net new orders totaled 7,354 homes, which is down 8% from the prior year. Our cancellation rate as a percentage of beginning backlog was 13% in the first quarter, which is up from 4% last year. On a sequential basis, the 13% cancellation rate is up less than 200 basis points from the fourth quarter. So cancellations are beginning to stabilize. In fact, on a unit basis, cancellations in this quarter amounted to 1,544 homes, which is down sequentially from 1,871 homes in the fourth quarter. By buyer group, net new orders to first-time buyers increased 18% over the prior year to 3,177 homes, while move-up orders decreased by 20% to 2,645 homes, and active adult orders were lower by 22% to 1,532 homes. Our average community count in the first quarter increased 13% over last year to $879.Based on the communities opened in the period, our absorption pace of 2.8 homes per month was down from the prior year, but in line with our pre-pandemic sales rate, which averaged 2.7 for the 5-year period from 2016 to 2020. Based on land investments we made in prior years, we expect to operate out of approximately 900 communities in the second quarter, which would represent an increase of 14% over the second quarter of last year. Looking over the balance of the year, we continue to expect community count growth of 5% to 10% over the comparable prior year quarter. Given our expanding community count, PulteGroup is well positioned to increase its market share within the improving demand environment. We ended the first quarter with a backlog of 13,129 homes with a value of $8 billion.This compares with last year’s Q1 record backlog of 19,935 homes valued at $11.5 billion. At the end of the first quarter, we had a total of 16,872 homes under construction, of which 15% were finished. Spec units represented 38% of our production, which is up from last year and consistent with our strategy to have specs available to meet buyer demand for homes that can close sooner. Over the course of the first quarter, we started production on approximately 5,200 homes. This start rate was down about 40% from the first quarter of last year, but up on a sequential basis from the fourth quarter of 2022 as we continue to drive an appropriate start cadence as we focus on turning our assets. Based on the roughly 17,000 homes we have under construction and their stage of production, we expect to deliver between 7,000 and 7,400 homes in the second quarter.Given the ongoing improvement in the overall operating environment, we are pleased by the level of production we have been able to realize, thanks to the efforts of our outstanding operating teams. In addition to these higher unit volumes, we are also seeing the beginning stages of a shortening in our production cycle. At this point, depending upon the market, the gains range from just a few days to a few weeks, but the trends are generally positive. Based on our strong Q1 results and the potential for cycle times to gradually improve, the production potential of homes will have available to close in 2023 has increased to 27,000, 28,000 homes. This is up from our initial guide of 25,000 loans. Obviously, the strength of sign-ups in the second quarter will go a long way in determining how much of this production universe actually converts into 2023 closings.While the average sales price in our backlog is $608,000, we currently expect the average sales price to our second quarter closings to be in the range of $525,000 to $535,000. That estimate reflects both the mix of homes scheduled to close as well as the impact of anticipated spec closings, which are primarily first-time homes that have a lower average sales price. We reported first quarter gross margins of 29.1% which was 20 basis points below last year. Please note that our reported gross margins in the first quarter benefited by approximately 70 basis points from the reclass of closing incentives and cost of sales to net revenue. The benefit to our first quarter 2022 gross margin was 40 basis points. I would highlight that in the current quarter, our margins benefited from our move-up and active adult business where pressures on our selling prices have been relatively less impactful compared with entry level homes.After several years of gross margin parity across buyer groups, we are seeing a reversion to the historic trend of higher margins in our move-up and active adult business. Based on the mix of homes we plan to close in the second quarter, we expect gross margins to be in the range of 27.5% to 28%. As with our closings and reported margins in the first quarter, deliveries in the second quarter will reflect the benefit of lower lumber costs that are flowing through our operations. In the first quarter, we reported SG&amp;A expense of $337 million or 9.6% of home sale revenues. In the comparable prior year period, our SG&amp;A expense was $329 million or 10.9% of home sale revenues. Higher closings and associated revenues in this year’s first quarter drove the improved overhead leverage relative to last year and our guide.With expected 2023 production volumes moving higher, we are carefully adding sales and construction staff, but still expect to maintain overhead leverage. As such, we expect second quarter SG&amp;A to be in the range of 9.0% to 9.5%. In the first quarter, our financial services operations reported pre-tax income of $14 million, which is down from $41 million in the prior year. Pre-tax income in the period was impacted by lower loan volumes, competitive pricing dynamics and higher mortgage incentives being used throughout the industry. In Q1, our capture rate was 78% compared with 81% last year. Market conditions have clearly improved, but as we do under all market conditions, we continue to routinely reassess our own planned positions and pending land transactions.Based on this review process, in the first quarter, we walked away from 5,300 lots that were previously held under option and wrote off approximately $6 million in associated deposits and pre-acquisition costs. In the first quarter, our reported tax expense was $170 million or an effective tax rate of 24.2%. We expect our tax rate in the second quarter to be 24.5%. Our net income for the first quarter was $532 million or $2.35 per share, which is up from prior year net income of $455 million or $1.83 per share. In addition to significantly higher net income, our earnings per share benefited from the company’s share repurchase program. In the first quarter, we repurchased 2.8 billion common shares at a cost of $150 million or an average price of $54.30 per share.Consistent with our plans to continue returning excess funds to our shareholders, our Board has approved an additional $1 billion of share repurchase authorization, bringing the total available under the program to $1.2 billion. Along with returning funds to our shareholders, we continue to strategically invest in our business. In the first quarter, we invested $906 million of land acquisition and development, down from $1.1 billion in Q1 of last year. Given the stronger demand environment and the increase in our overall construction activities, we now expect to invest between $3.5 billion and $4 billion in land acquisition development in 2023. We ended the period with 210,000 lots under control. This is consistent with year-end and down 10% from last year.Based on our activity over the past several quarters, 61% of those lots are owned and 49% are options. We will continue to seek increased optionality of our land bank with a target of up to 70% of our lots being controlled via option. Reflecting the strength of our first quarter financial results and associated cash flows, we ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of cash, which lowered our net debt to capital ratio of 7.2%. On a gross basis, our debt-to-capital ratio was 18.1%, down from 21.5% at the end of the first quarter last year. Now let me turn the call back to Ryan for some final comments.Ryan Marshall: Thanks, Bob. I think there are a lot of positives to be taken out of our first quarter results, including we delivered record first quarter earnings, driven by higher closings, continued strong gross margins and improved overhead leverage. Overall market conditions continue to improve as we experienced strong demands and are finding opportunities to reduce incentives and/or increase prices in many communities. Supply chain conditions are stabilizing, and we have seen at least an initial turn towards shorter cycle times. At this point, the gains have been market-specific but we are optimistic that we’ve seen a high watermark in terms of construction cycle times. Our national and local teams are making strides and climb back construction days, which is critical because shortening our cycle time is an important driver to expanding our 2023 production universe.PulteGroup’s Board approved another $1 billion increase due to the company’s share repurchase authorization. We’ve bought over – we have bought back over 40% of our shares and clearly remain committed to the systemic return of bonds to our shareholders. One other positive I would highlight is that PulteGroup was once again ranked among the Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work for. This is our third year on this prestigious list and we again moved higher, climbing from number 43 last year to number 36 in the most recent ranking. We take fry and being included on this list because it is based on what our employees say about their experience as part of the PulteGroup team. Our success in delivering quality homes and delighting our customers starts and ends with our 6,100 employees dedicated to doing the right thing, taking care of our customers, focusing on quality and lifting the teammates around them.The amazing culture resident of PulteGroup doesn’t happen by chance, but rather it comes from a committed effort by every employee to create a world-class culture. I am extremely proud of our team and I want to thank all of our employees, along with our trade partners and suppliers for their tremendous work in helping to deliver another outstanding quarter of operating and financial results. Let me now turn the call back to Jim Zeumer.Jim Zeumer: Thanks, Ryan.

Now the main actor appears to be inventory.That’s the takeaway from a host of data points revealed in the last week such as the unexpected increase in home prices and the unforeseen drop in pending sales. Add to that home builders’ first-quarter results, which surprised on the upside.Underpinning all those metrics is a housing market devoid of enough homes for sale.The result? A profitable break for home builders — and their stock investors. More misery for the homebuyers still hunting for a deal before everyone else.""It's supply and demand,” Sean Dycus, real estate agent Mainstreet Properties, told Yahoo Finance. “What happens when the supply is low and the demand is there? You know what's going to happen.""A for sale sign is posted in front of a home on March 22, 2023 in San Anselmo, California. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)How bad is the shortage?New listings of homes for sale fell 22.4% nationwide from the previous year during the four weeks ended April 23—one of the largest declines since the start of the pandemic, according to Redfin. Similarly, Realtor.com found the number of homes newly listed for sale dropped 20% versus a year ago in March.""Put another way, the number of homeowners deciding to sell homes in March 2023 was roughly on par with the number in April 2020, when early-pandemic uncertainty caused many to put off major housing-related decisions,” Realtor.com Chief Economist Danielle Hale told Yahoo Finance.Of course, mortgage rates play a significant role in the inventory story. A big reason there aren’t enough homes for sale is because current homeowners are deciding against listing their houses. They don’t want to give up the lower mortgage rate they have now.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Approximately 82% of potential move-up buyers said they felt trapped by their current low mortgage rate, a Realtor.com poll of over 1,200 potential sellers in February found.“The challenge for the sellers is if they sell today, they're likely to have to take a higher interest rate if they're going to buy another house,” Doug Duncan, chief economist at Fannie Mae, previously told Yahoo Finance. “If they have to use any mortgage, then they're probably gonna give away some of the equity they take out in the higher payment because mortgage rates are up.”Story continuesInventory: Bad for homebuyersWhat that means for buyers is that they will have an even harder time finding a house to buy. The latest stats bear this out.Pending home sales for March dropped by 5.2% from the previous month, a bigger drop than expected, according to the National Association of Realtors. The group’s chief economist called the dearth of properties “a major constraint to rising sales.”This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Meanwhile there's a feeding frenzy for homes on the market.The NAR found that a third of listings are getting more than one bidder and 28% of homes are selling above their list price. Altos Research found that the median price for new listings—and for homes in contract last week—increased from a week ago.That syncs with two separate indexes last week showing national home prices unexpectedly rose month over month in February.""There's still many areas of the country where there are multiple offers being made, which is part of the reason that you don't see house prices declining further than they do,” Duncan said. “There's still pent-up demand…there just isn't the supply out there.""Inventory: Good for home buildersThe crushing environment for homebuyers is a boon for home builders.Sentiment among home builders is on the rise, for instance, climbing in April for the fourth straight month amid inventory woes, according to the National Association of Home Builders.""Currently, one-third of housing inventory is new construction, compared to historical norms of a little more than 10%,"" NAHB Chief Economist Robert Dietz.D.R. Horton (DHI) and PulteGroup (PHM) both reported better than expected results in the first three months of the year. D.R. Horton CEO David Auld said the spring selling season was “off to an encouraging start” and the builder recorded a 73% increase in net sales from the previous quarter.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.""Although higher interest rates and economic uncertainty may persist for some time, the supply of both new and existing homes at affordable price points remains limited, and demographics supporting housing demand remain favorable,” D.R. Horton’s Auld wrote in the press release.PulteGroup also reported stabilizing cancellation rates, a decline in purchase contracts that was smaller than forecast, and an 18% increase in net new orders from first-time buyers.PulteGroup President and CEO Ryan Marshall credited a change in “buyer psychology” that allowed the builder to pull back on incentives and post moderate price increases during the quarter.“And then the biggest thing as I go back to, we’ve got a housing shortage in this country, and that hasn’t changed,” Marshall said on the company’s earnings calls. “And so in the places where we’ve been able to demonstrate value … we’re seeing some nice momentum on the sales floor…And that’s allowed us to be optimistic and bullish with our forward start projections and some of the things that we’re anticipating to be able to do for the balance of the year.”Gabriella is a personal finance reporter at Yahoo Finance.

(PHM): Here is What You Need to Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-pultegroup-inc-130001894.html,1682946001,STORY,['PHM'],"[PulteGroup (PHM) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this homebuilder have returned +15.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +5.1% change. The Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry, to which PulteGroup belongs, has gained 12.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.PulteGroup is expected to post earnings of $2.19 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -19.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +21.8%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.43 points to a change of -21.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +13.4%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.42 indicates a change of -0.2% from what PulteGroup is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +16.3%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, PulteGroup is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PHM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of PulteGroup, the consensus sales estimate of $3.7 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -5.7%. The $14.51 billion and $14.92 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -10.6% and +2.8%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPulteGroup reported revenues of $3.58 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.2%. EPS of $2.35 for the same period compares with $1.83 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.27 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +9.42%. The EPS surprise was +32.02%.Over the last four quarters, PulteGroup surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.PulteGroup is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about PulteGroup. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

200,2037a8ac-e840-3b70-baa4-f374fb4f1e64,PHM,2023-05-02,Here's How Much You'd Have If You Invested $1000 in PulteGroup a Decade Ago,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-much-youd-invested-1000-123012439.html,1682944212,STORY,['PHM'],"[How much a stock's price changes over time is a significant driver for most investors. Not only can price performance impact your portfolio, but it can help you compare investment results across sectors and industries as well.Another thing that can drive investing is the fear of missing out, or FOMO. This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in PulteGroup (PHM) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to PHM for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?PulteGroup's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at PulteGroup's main business drivers.Based in Atlanta, GA, PulteGroup Inc. engages in homebuilding and financial services businesses, primarily in the United States. The company conducts operations through two primary business segments – Homebuilding (which accounted for 98.1% as of 2022 total revenues) and Financial Services (1.9%).The Homebuilding segment offers a wide variety of home designs including single family detached, townhouses, condominiums and duplexes at different prices, with a variety of options and amenities to all major customer segments: first-time, move-up and active adult. Pulte’s brand portfolio includes Centex, Pulte Homes,Del Webb, DiVosta Homes, John Wieland Homes and Neighborhoods, and American West.The company operates in 810 active communities in 42 markets in 24 states across the United States in 2022. The homebuilding division is broken down into six reportable segments; Northeast, Southeast, Florida, Texas, Midwest and West.Pulte’s direct subsidiaries under the homebuilding segment include Pulte Diversified Companies Inc., Del Webb Corporation and Centex Corporation.Pulte’s Financial Services business includes mortgage banking and title operations through Pulte Mortgage and other subsidiaries. Pulte Mortgage arranges financing by originating mortgage loans for homebuyers.In first-quarter 2023, the company’s orders were 8,898 units, up from 8,767 homes in the prior- year quarter. Quarter-end backlog totaled 13,129 homes versus 19,935 units in the year ago quarter. Potential housing revenues from quarter-end backlog decreased 30.8% from the prior-year to $8 billion.Story continuesBottom LinePutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For PulteGroup, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in May 2013 would be worth $3,145.20, or a 214.52% gain, as of May 1, 2023, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.Compare this to the S&amp;P 500's rally of 163.52% and gold's return of 29.44% over the same time frame.Analysts are anticipating more upside for PHM.Shares of PulteGroup have outperformed its industry in the past three months. The company reported impressive first-quarter 2023 results, wherein earnings and revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 32% and 9.4%, respectively. The company has been benefiting from robust land acquisition and operational strategic initiatives. PHM expects the land acquisition and development investment in 2023 to range within $3.5-$4 billion, up from the previously considered value of $3.3 billion. This is attributed to strong buyer demand and increase in its construction activities. Earnings estimates for 2023 have increased in the past 30 days. Although a challenging sales environment, higher cancellation rates, supply-chain issues, and significant inflation are dampening the performance, the improving interest rate environment is raising hope.Shares have gained 15.22% over the past four weeks and there have been 4 higher earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2023 compared to none lower.

Look no further than PulteGroup's fourth-quarter earnings, which saw its buyer cancellation rate soar to 32%—or nearly three times greater than the 11% cancellation rate it saw in the fourth quarter of 2021.More from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash? This CD has a 5.15% APY right nowBuying a house? Here's how much to saveThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home ""Federal Reserve actions to fight inflation through higher interest rates continued to impact homebuying demand in the [fourth] quarter,"" PulteGroup told investors in January.However, that's already old news: Through the first few months of 2023, giant builders across the country are seeing their fortunes improve as buyer demand stabilizes.Case in point: A pair of homebuilders on the Fortune 500 list, No. 124 D.R. Horton and No. 267 PulteGroup, just reported a big drop in cancellation rates. D.R. Horton's cancellation rate for the first three months of 2023 came in at 18%—down from the 27% rate just one quarter earlier. Meanwhile, only 13% of PulteGroup's buyers canceled their home contracts in the first quarter of 2023—well below the 32% cancellation rate it saw in the fourth quarter.What's going on? Two things.First, the national U.S. housing market stabilized this year as we entered the busier spring season. Mortgage rates falling back under 7%, coupled with a lack of existing home inventory, has done just enough to put the market back into equilibrium.Second, homebuilders have recently gained an edge over the existing/resale market. During the Pandemic Housing Boom—a time with seemingly unlimited housing demand—builders achieved frothy profit margins as they quickly raised new house prices. Those frothy margins are coming in handy for builders: As mortgage rates spurred a housing downturn last year, builders like D.R. Horton and PulteGroup had the breathing room to reduce margins (i.e. cutting prices and/or aggressive rate buydowns) in pursuit of finding the market, or the price point at which buyer demand would return. Of course, those rate buydowns now give builders an edge over average Joes trying to sell their house.Story continuesView this interactive chart on Fortune.comGiant builders like D.R. Horton and PulteGroup aren't outliers: Builders from coast to coast are seeing an uptick in buyer demand.Builders surveyed by John Burns Research and Consulting in March had an aggregate cancellation rate of 9%. That's far below the peak of 24.6% hit in October, and just slightly above the 8% hit at the height of the Pandemic Housing Boom in March 2022.""For perspective on just how much things have improved, Phoenix cancellations hit 60% in November 2022 and are currently [at] 15%,"" Rick Palacios Jr., director of research at John Burns Research and Consulting, tweeted on Sunday.Indeed, even KB Home, a builder with significant exposure in slumped Mountain West markets like Boise, saw its first-quarter cancellation rate come in at 36%—or nearly half the 68% rate it saw in the fourth-quarter of 2022.""As we entered the spring selling season during the quarter, we began to see an increase in [housing] demand. This reflected in part the targeted sales strategies we deployed, together with a stabilizing mortgage interest rate environment. As a result, we achieved a sequential improvement in our net orders in both January and February, and net orders have remained strong in the early weeks of March. Although there are still considerable interest rates and economic uncertainties, we are encouraged by this progression,"" Jeffrey Mezger, CEO of KB Home, told investors in March.On one hand, the national housing market has stabilized this spring. On the other hand, housing affordability (or lack thereof) remains at levels not seen since the housing bubble era.In order to reach more priced-out buyers, some builders are pivoting from larger single-family homes to smaller townhomes.""We just closed all our backlog from dirt buyers who bought in March-May of 2022, which was where most of our cancels were coming from. They literally bought at the peak,"" Tyler Watkins, a new-home consultant at M/I Homes in Columbus, Ohio, tells Fortune. ""Helping first-time buyers is still the hardest to help because pricing still is high. Cancels have drastically decreased since January of this year. One thing you’ll see is builders going to townhome products for affordability.

KlappaThank you very much. Live from the Heartland. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the first quarter of 2023. First, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Scott Lauber, our President and Chief Executive; Xia Liu, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Now as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported first quarter 2023 earnings of $1.61 a share. Weather was a major factor in our lower results for the quarter. We saw one of the mildest winters in the history of the Upper Midwest. For example, it was the second warmest first quarter in Milwaukee since 1891, However, we're confident in our plan for the remainder of the year and we're reaffirming our guidance for 2023. As a reminder, we're guiding to a range of $4.58 to $4.62 a share for the full year. This assumes normal weather going forward. And as always, we remain focused on the fundamentals of our business, financial discipline, operating efficiency and customer satisfaction. Switching gears now. The work on our ESG progress plan continues at a steady pace. It's the largest 5-year investment plan in our history, totaling $28.1 billion for efficiency, sustainability and growth. The plan is based on projects that are low risk and highly executable. And as we look to the future, it's clear that the mega trend of decarbonization and the need for even greater reliability will drive investment plans that are long and strong. Scott will provide you with more detail on several specific projects in a moment. But I'm pleased to report that just since last December, the Wisconsin Commission has approved more than $1 billion of new capital investment by our companies. As we've discussed, we project that our ESG progress plan will drive compound earnings growth of 6.5% to 7% a year from 2023 through 2027. And we fully expect to fund our capital plan without any need for new equity. Now let's take a brief look at the regional economy. We have good news from the latest data in Wisconsin. In March, the unemployment rate came in at 2.5%. That's a record low for the state and well below the national average and we continue to see major developments in the area. Just a few weeks ago, in fact, Microsoft announced that it plans to create a new data center campus in our region with an initial investment of $1 billion. This data center complex will be built south of Milwaukee in the technology park that is also being developed by Foxconn. Microsoft will purchase a 315-acre parcel in Area 3 of the park. Local approvals have been received, and we expect Microsoft to close on the land purchase on or before the 31st of July. In the meantime, Microsoft is moving full speed ahead with planning and design work. The decision by Microsoft underscores the strength and the potential of the Wisconsin economy and positions us very well for more growth in the technology sector. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott for more information on our regulatory developments, our operations and our infrastructure segment. Scott, all yours.Scott J. LauberThank you, Gale. I'd like to start with a few updates on the regulatory front. New rates have been in effect for our Wisconsin utilities since the start of the year. As expected, we're planning to file a limited reopener for 2024 later this quarter. The filing will address the recovery of capital investments for projects going into service this year and in 2024. The return on equity and the equity layer are all set and are not up for consideration, the request will be quite modest, and we expect a decision from the commission by the end of this year. And as you recall, we have rate filings under review in Illinois for Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas. The next step will be for the commission staff and interveners to file their direct testimony on May 9. Hearings are scheduled for early August. After 9 years without a rate case at Peoples Gas, who are making these requests for 2024 to support our investment in key infrastructure and with lower natural gas prices, we project customer bills will be flat with 2022. We also have rate reviews in progress at Minnesota Energy Resources and Michigan Gas Utilities. We filed in Minnesota last November and interim rates went into effect January 1. I'm pleased to announce that we received a settlement with parties that would result in a 7.1% increase in base rates. That's based on a 9.65% return on equity with an equity layer of 53%. This settlement is subject to commission approval, which we expect in the next several months. And in March, we filed for a base rate increase of 9.1% at Michigan Gas Utilities for 2024. This application is primarily driven by our capital investments supporting safety and reliability. Meanwhile, we're making good progress on a number of regulatory capital projects. Red Barn Wind Park went to service last month. The project is providing 82 megawatts of clean energy capacity to our Wisconsin customers. And as Gale noted, we received 3 significant approvals for the Wisconsin Commission since last December for the Dairyland Solar Battery Park, West Riverside Energy Center and Koshkonong Solar Battery Parks. We discussed the Dairyland approval last quarter. And as you recall, the solar park is planned to go in service in 2024. West Riverside is a combined cycle natural gas plant owned by Alliant Energy. In February, we received approval for our purchase of 100 megawatts of Riverside capacity for approximately $102 million. We expect to close this purchase by the end of the month. We have an option to purchase another 100 megawatts of Riverside capacity, and we plan to exercise that option later this year. We also received approval for our purchase of Koshkonong Solar Battery Park with plans for 300 megawatts of solar capacity and 165 megawatts of battery storage. We will own 90% of the project with an expected investment of $585 million. We project the solar portion of this facility to go into service in 2025. We also continue on the Badger Hollow II solar facility and the Paris Solar-Battery Park. While Badger Hollow has received some of the solar panels, the remaining panels for projects are currently in Chicago going through the customs process. Assuming timing release of the panels, we expect these solar parks to go into service late this year or early next year. For the Paris and Koshkonong projects, we're evaluating the timing of the battery investments. Of course, we'll keep you updated on any future developments. Outside of utilities, we continue to make progress on zero carbon projects in our WEC Infrastructure segment. In February, we completed our acquisition of the Sapphire Sky Wind Farm, now in service in Illinois. As a reminder, that project offers 250 megawatts of capacity in total, and we own a 90% share. Also in February, we added an 80% ownership in the Samson 1 Solar Project located in Northeast Texas. The project has a capacity of 250 megawatts. As disclosed previously, Samson 1 suffered storm damage at the beginning of March, but we expect no significant bottom line impact for the property losses. The project is currently producing energy at about 70% level and improving every day as we continue to restore the site. With that, I'll turn things back to Gale.Gale E. KlappaScott, thank you very much. Now as you may recall, our Board of Directors at its January meeting raised our quarterly cash dividend by 7.2%. This marks the 20th consecutive year that our company will reward shareholders with higher dividends. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. We're right in the middle of that range now, so I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in our earnings per share. Next up, Xia will provide you with more details on our financial results and our second quarter guidance. Xia?Xia LiuThank you, Gale. Our 2023 first quarter earnings of $1.61 per share decreased $0.18 per share compared to the first quarter of 2022. Our earnings package include the comparison of first quarter results on Page 12. I'll walk through the significant drivers. Starting with our utility operations, our earnings were $0.09 lower compared to the first quarter of '22. Rate-based growth contributed $0.22 to earnings, driven by continued investment in our ESG progress plan. This includes the base rate increase for our Wisconsin utilities as well as the interim rate increase for Minnesota Energy Resources, both of which were effective January 1, 2023. This favorable margin impact from rate base growth was more than offset by a number of factors. First, as Gale noted, we experienced one of the mildest winters in history which drove a $0.12 decrease in earnings compared to the first quarter of last year. Additionally, timing of fuel expense, depreciation and amortization interest, day-to-day O&amp;M, taxes and other drove a combined $0.19 negative variance. Before I turn to earnings at the other segments, let me briefly discuss our weather-normalized sales. You can find our sales information on Page 9 of the earnings package. I'd like to remind you that weather normalization is not a perfect science, extreme warm weather in the first quarter may not be fully reflected in our weather-normalized data. Having said that, Weather-normal retail natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin, excluding natural gas used for power generation, were down 1%. However, residential usage, again on a weather-normal basis, grew 0.9%. That was ahead of our forecast. Weather-normal retail electric deliveries, excluding the iron ore mine, were 1.9% lower. Residential usage was relatively flat compared to last year. Now at our Energy Infrastructure segment, Earnings were $0.01 lower in the first quarter of '23 compared to the first quarter of '22. Production tax credits were higher by $0.03 quarter-over-quarter resulting from acquisitions of renewable generation projects. This increase was largely offset by a pickup that we recorded in the first quarter last year from the resolution of market settlement in the Southwest Power Pool. Finally, you'll see that earnings at our Corporate and Other segment decreased $0.08 primarily driven by an increase in interest expense and a pickup recorded in the first quarter '22 from our investment in a clean energy fund. These items were partially offset by favorable rabbi buy trust performance and some tax and other items. Remember, rabbi trust performance is largely offset in O&amp;M. Looking now at the cash flow statement on Page 6 of the earnings package. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $281 million. The mild winter and timing of recovery of commodity costs contributed to this decrease. Total capital expenditures and asset acquisitions were $1.3 billion in the first quarter of '23, and $884 million increase from the first quarter of '22. This was primarily driven by the acquisition of the Whitewater Natural Gas Power Generation Facility in our Wisconsin segment, as well as the Sapphire Sky Wind Farm and Samson 1 Solar facility in our Infrastructure segment. In closing, as Gale mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming our 2023 earnings guidance of $4.58 to $4.62 per share, assuming normal weather for the rest of the year. To offset the mild first quarter weather impact, we are implementing a variety of initiatives. As a result, we now expect our day-to-day O&amp;M to be 2% to 3% higher than 2022 versus our previous expectation of 3% to 5% higher. I will also add that largely due to timing of O&amp;M and fuel expense, we expect earnings in the second half of this year to be materially better than the second half of 2022. For the second quarter, we're expecting a range of $0.83 to $0.85 per share. This accounts for April weather and assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. As a reminder, we earned $0.91 per share in the second quarter last year. With that, I'll turn it back to Gale.Gale E. KlappaXia, thank you. Overall, we're on track and focused on providing value for our customers and our stockholders. Operator, we're ready now for the Q&amp;A portion of the call.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.Gale E. KlappaAfternoon, Shar. You're still using those pillow cases?Shahriar PourrezaYes. But they don't match the rest of the house, so that's the issue. How are you doing?Gale E. KlappaWe're fine. How about you?Shahriar PourrezaGood. Not too bad, not too bad. So Gale, a quick one here. So half a dozen utilities have issued these like hybrid convertible notes at pretty attractive rates. I think in some cases, it's like 200 basis points of interest rate savings. There's obviously no equity credit there. So you've seen it even being utilized by some peers that don't need equity. I just want to get your sense from your shot like whether you see, I guess, any value with these hybrid securities to help fund the 5-year plan? Does it make sense? I mean obviously, we're waiting for your Q to be released to see if there's any kind of language around it, but.Gale E. KlappaYes, good question, Shar. And clearly, there are a number of companies in the sector even 2 today that have announced the use of this cash pay convert product. We've taken a good hard look at it. And let me just say this, if we found -- as we go through the course of the remainder of 2023, if we found that it was really advantageous for us, we would certainly take a hard look. But we're -- we're more than halfway, Shar through our debt issuance plan for 2023 and doing very well against our budget. Xia?Xia LiuYes, not much to add. We're very aware of the transaction. We understand the pros and cons. And at this time, we really have not made any decision as to whether cash pay convertible notes fit those -- fit our criteria. But we've done quite a bit financing so far, and we've done really well, better than the planned rates. So.Shahriar PourrezaAnd then just in short, I know I don't want to front run the queue, but is there -- will there be any language around looking at hybrids potentially as an option to fund the plan or not?Gale E. KlappaShar, are you talking about hybrids? Are you talking about the cash pay converts or both?Shahriar PourrezaThese cash pay converts or hybrids or whatever you want to call them at this point.Gale E. KlappaI don't think there's any language that we're planning in the Q or...Xia LiuNo. We haven't planned that at this point.Shahriar PourrezaOkay. Perfect. I appreciate that. And then just lastly on Illinois, obviously, the cases were filed in January. There's not a lot of data points since then, but gas prices have actually have come off, which I think hopefully will help the case. It's a tailwind. Any thoughts, I guess, Gale at this point on potentially settling, how has the dialogue been going? Do you see anything we should be thinking about?Gale E. KlappaWay, way too early to even think about or contemplate settlement in the process in Illinois. The process is going along very smoothly. I think the next steps as Scott mentioned in his prepared remarks, the next step will be staff and intervenor testimony on May 9. But so far, we are responding to data requests. The process in Illinois is going exactly as historically they've gone. And to your point about commodity costs moving in our favor, and they moved even more in our favor since we filed the case. But long story short, even with the base increase that we're seeking, you combine that with much lower commodity costs, and we expect customer bills to be flat even granting a full base rate increase for 2020 -- for bills in 2024. So again, we think that's very good news. And when you look at just the basic facts of what we're -- of what we filed. This will be, as you may recall, the first base rate increase for Peoples Gas since we acquired the company, first base rate increase actually in 9 years. And our O&amp;M is about $60 million a year lower than when we actually acquired the company in 2015. So a pretty good story.Shahriar PourrezaPerfect. Congrats on great execution so far. I appreciate it.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithListen, let me follow up on where Shar would go with that. So with respect to the Peoples case here and just talking a little bit about the future of gas, but also just the CapEx and just some of the scrutiny on bill pressures. How do you think about moderating bills? I mean, obviously, gas has rolled over any mitigating items, circumstances we should be thinking about on that front? And definitely, how do you think and respond to some of the -- there's been some (inaudible) out there, et cetera. Any thoughts as to how you tackle sort of the longer term versus the here and now of investing without the QIP in place in the traditional sense?Gale E. KlappaYes. Good question, Julien. On the QIP program and the investment in the safety modernization program, the pipe upgrade program that we've been carrying out in Chicago. Let me first say that we really welcome the public debate and the policy decision that the Illinois Commerce Commission will make about the future of the program. And just to put it in perspective, on average, we've invested about $280 million a year in upgrading the pipe network under the city of Chicago, which is, by the way, one of the oldest and now most deteriorated natural gas delivery networks in the country. So long story short, we're almost 36% complete with the pipe upgrade plan and again, investing about $280 million a year. Now, those who think we should do something different are banking on electrification. So the bets you would have to make to not, in some form, continue the program is that Chicago can completely electrify in less than 15 years because the independent study that the Illinois Commerce Commission has ordered and accepted, the independent engineering study shows that more than 80% of the iron pipes and our delivery network under Chicago have a useful life left of 15 years. And then lastly -- or 15 years or less. And then lastly, there are some who say, well, just patch the pipes. Julien, I'm telling you some of those pipes can't be patched. And when you look at the continued O&amp;M that would be required to patch after patch after patch, it would not, in our estimation, save customers any money. So we think there's overwhelming evidence here to continue the program, we would do so under our proposal as an annual base rate increase, if you will, to cover the cost of what we think is a very important program for both the immediate safety of Chicago. And then secondly, to preserve a long-term future, where that delivery network could deliver, say, hydrogen or other no carbon fuels to keep Chicago warm. So I hope that response helps.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithAbsolutely does. I appreciate it. With respect to the process, I want to come back to this super quickly. We've got a new ICC in place, et cetera. I mean to the extent to which that you're looking for direction here, I mean, this rate case should be the right venue to think about the pace and the sort of the new vision on where things are going, right? There's not some other avenue? I'm just trying to think through the -- how the ICC wants to articulate a response to your proposed spending, if you will? It will be through the case.Gale E. KlappaThere are extensive, as you would expect, and we wanted to have this kind of dialogue. We welcome this kind of dialogue, but there are multiple data requests as there are in any rate review but particularly, there are data requests about the program, about the need for the program, about the future of the program, et cetera. So I agree with you, I think this is the proper forum to have that policy decision made and everything is proceeding under the normal schedule, if you will, of data requests. And now, as we said earlier, the next formal step would be May 9 when we expect staff and intervenor testimony.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithRight. Yes. Thank you for confirming that. And we'll look next week. All right. You take care.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan Chase.Gale E. KlappaJeremy, are you moving to -- Jeremy, are you removing the Republic Bank or?Jeremy Bryan TonetNothing to say there. Just wanted to kind of come back, I guess, to the weather impacts as happened in the quarter and the offset there. Should we think about this as just kind of O&amp;M being the main tool for offsets over the balance of the year? I'm just wondering if you could quantify or give any more color there and how that might shape up across the year, I think you said in the back half, it kind of lightens up a bit. So any more color there could be helpful.Gale E. KlappaYes, I'd be happy to do that, and we'll ask Xia to give you some specifics. Let me frame a couple of things for you. First of all, we've got a pretty experienced management team. We've been down this road before. So we have a pretty well-tested playbook and the playbook has been implemented. There are O&amp;M initiatives in every group of the company, every department, every section. They have plans and they have goals. So a big part of it, obviously, is related to day-to-day operation and maintenance costs. Another big positive for us, again, compared to our budget and our forecast is really the interest cost savings that we're seeing. And then we're going to ask Xia and Scott to kind of briefly walk you through the difference that we see in Q3 and Q4 this year compared to Q3 and Q4 of last year when we were deep into our sharing bands with customers. So Xia, why don't we start off with you and some specifics and then we'll let -- I'll ask Scott to talk about the sharing bands that really impacted Q3 and Q4 last year.Xia LiuSure. So Q1 weather was about $0.12 deficit, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks. So we've identified O&amp;M reduction targets that can offset $0.04, $0.05, $0.06 of that. We also built some conservative financing assumptions in the plan. So in terms of issuing debt at rates lower than the plan or continued execution later this year, we expect the financing savings to be $0.05 to $0.06 also. So between those 2 items, we could offset the Q1 weather deficit. But we also have other initiatives we're looking at beyond those 2 items.Scott J. LauberSure. And then when you think about the last half of the year, you have to remember the last several years, we've been very fortunate to actually be into a sharing band where we're sharing with customers. I think last year, we were able to reduce our fuel request about $54 million. So that's quite a bit when you think about charges in the last half of the year. And last half, remember, we had warmer than normal weather, so we were able to accelerate or do some additional spending for our customers. So we incurred additional O&amp;M costs plus the sharing band. So that was meaningful for the last half of the year compared to what you see this year come and shaping up.Gale E. KlappaAnd to Scott's point, we obviously don't see ourselves into the sharing bands with customers this year. So I think in terms of basically $54 million of costs that won't reappear in the third and fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the second half of 2022.Jeremy Bryan TonetGot it. That's very helpful there. And just shifting a bit to solar and I know that you touched on this a bit in the prepared remarks as it relates to the solar supply chain. But just wondering, I guess, thoughts on ongoing progressional efforts to revoke the present 2-year solar tariff suspension. Just wondering if you had any thoughts you could share there or just on the supply chain in general.Gale E. KlappaWell, my understanding is that President Biden said he would veto any effort to undo that particular initiative. So I'm not sure that one's going anywhere. But in the meantime, as Scott indicated in his prepared remarks, for our Badger Hollow II Solar Project in Wisconsin for our regulated utility and for our Paris Solar-Battery Project, again, for our Wisconsin utilities. Scott, we got all the solar panels we need hanging in a warehouse in Chicago.Scott J. LauberThey're in the warehouse in Chicago. We're just working with customs, to get them out of that warehouse. And of course, for the future projects, we're looking at other alternatives, including U.S. potential options available in the future to source those future projects that the commission has approved.Gale E. KlappaJeremy, Scott and I went down to that warehouse one night, but the Doberman wouldn't let us in. So -- but we know all of those panels are there.Jeremy Bryan TonetGot it. That's helpful. And then just one last quick one, if I could, as it relates to transmission and future MISO tranches maybe kind of taking shape in the not-too-distant future here. Just wondering if you had any updated thoughts permitting reform or with the MISO outlook could mean for wet down the road?Gale E. KlappaDon't see much of any progress on permitting reform at this stage of the game. But again, as MISO works its way through all of the stakeholder process, Tranche 2 Phase I, the early indications are quite favorable in terms of the investment opportunity being even greater than what we saw in basically Tranche 1. And then in addition to that, I mentioned the major economic development project that was just announced with Microsoft, any particular upside on transmission or generation needs related to that Microsoft project would be incremental to the plan and not in the current plan. And I'm guessing there may be some additional transmission need coming out of that project, Scott?Scott J. LauberNo, that's correct, Gale. And also a reminder, Tranche 1 was using a lot of existing right of away. So we're very happy using existing right if aways to be able to get that construction started in an earlier time frame in that '25, '26 time frame.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research.Michael P. SullivanMaybe just back to the O&amp;M. So understand it was going to tick up a little bit this year. Now you're kind of pulling that back to help offset the weather. As we think beyond 2023, how should we think about the trajectory? I know you have a track record of bringing it down, and this year was kind of the first time in a while. It was set to step up.Gale E. KlappaYes. I think when you look at the near-term future past 2023, we're going to be seeing another chunk of O&amp;M reduction related to the planned retirements. And just as a reminder, we have 4 older units at our Oak Creek site, units 5, 6, 7 and 8. And units 5 and 6 are scheduled for retirement next year and then units 7 and 8 in 2025. And along with that, the retirement will come a substantial chunk of O&amp;M reduction. Scott?Scott J. LauberNo, you're exactly right. As we put on those retirements, O&amp;M will go down. But remember, the driver for the O&amp;M increases this year as we put in new plants into the system. We added a lot of capital over this last year and to run those new plants, including the new race units that we're putting in service and also the plants in Milwaukee infrastructure, all of that's additional O&amp;M. So really supporting capital investments.Gale E. KlappaAnd one other thought adding on to what Scott is saying, there's another benefit to the investments that we're making that are coming online, particularly the solar investments that we're in the final stages of completion. Those investments when they're online and producing energy actually replace fuel costs. So in addition to O&amp;M, chunks of savings coming forward here from the retirement of older coal-fired units, we're also going to see reductions in fuel costs simply because, obviously, with solar and wind, the fuel is free.Michael P. SullivanOkay. That's very helpful. I appreciate the detail. Just related to that, to the extent that we see any shifting in timing of the solar with supply chain issues and the panels in the warehouse and all that. Does -- how do you kind of react to that? Is there a risk that -- is that -- are you tying that to the coal shutdown retirements in terms of just earning on those assets and rate base? Are there other things you have to move around? Just what are kind of the other implications across the business to the extent that your solar projects get pushed down a little bit?Gale E. KlappaWell, to answer the second part of your question on retirements of the 4 older coal-fired units, we don't see any change in that schedule. That, I believe, will continue to be the 2024 and 2025 retirement dates for each of those 2 units. And then in terms of potential further delays again, we have to get clearance here and we've got a plan B if we can't get clearance to finish the solar projects. But remember, these are regulated projects. The commission is very, very supportive of the need for those projects. And Scott, we're earning AFUDC during the construction period.Scott J. LauberCorrect. And we're continuing the construction. So they are site ready when the solar panels get released. So Paris and Badger Hollow II construction is pretty well done. On Badger Hollow II, we just need the solar panels and Paris is moving along nicely. So those panels already. Won't take long to pop them on.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.Gale E. KlappaWow, you got the Jersey #8 on. Durgesh?Durgesh ChopraI don't know. I don't know about that, Gale.Gale E. KlappaI know. I know. Still die hard Eagle fan, right?Durgesh ChopraIt's still hurts, still hurts.Gale E. KlappaI'm sorry.Durgesh ChopraOkay, yes, we'll be back next year. So just Gale, I wanted to go back to the reopener. We've had a ton of discussion here as you make the filing. I think Scott mentioned in his opening remarks that it's not for ROE for equity layer. Maybe can you just talk about the projects that you will be filing for? Am I right in thinking about that these projects are already approved so you're not necessarily seeking for prudency of those projects? And then to the extent that you can sort of help us frame what CapEx would -- are we looking at as you file -- as you make these filings in the quarter?Gale E. KlappaSure. We'll ask Scott to help out as well. So you are correct. This limited reopener as defined in the rate order, does not -- I mean, the ROE and the equity layer are set and they're not up for reconsideration. There's roughly and yes, you are correct, all of the projects that we will be filing for recovery in this limited reopener have already been approved by the commission. So that is absolutely correct. And Scott, it's about $1 billion of capital that will be coming in, if I recall correctly, into that reopener.Scott J. LauberYes, it's approximately that. I don't have the exact number at my fingertips, but when you think about the reopener, it's projects like we talked about, Riverside was approved now that $102 million, we'll put that into the reopener. The Weston Race Units those are going to be in for a full year. So that will be part of the reopener. So some of these are full year, some of these are actually part of a year capital projects.Gale E. KlappaAnd LNG? One of our LNG's projects.Scott J. LauberThe LNG projects. So it's really across electric and gas and just truing up with the capital additions.Durgesh ChopraGot it. And then you've previously talked about O&amp;M savings to be included as part of that request. Is that also part of this limited reopener filing or could be a part of this limited reopener filing?Scott J. LauberSure that the real -- the O&amp;M piece is really the retirement for the Oak Creek 5 and 6, those older Oak Creek units. Remember, last year, we filed the case and then we extended them and now what we're doing is closing those units at the end of May here of 2024. So that will be the O&amp;M reduction that we put in the actual order for us to factor that into the case.Gale E. KlappaAnd Durgesh, the largest O&amp;M reduction. Scott's exactly right. The largest O&amp;M reduction from the closure of the Oak Creek units really will come all 4 units are retired because we won't be retiring the environmental control operation at that site for those older units until all 4 are off-line.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank.Andrew Marc WeiselFirst, a question on timing of fuel cost. I know a minus $0.07 in the 1Q waterfall. What's your expectation for the full year based on current curves? Do you expect that to fully reverse and if so, when?Xia LiuAndrew, this is Xia. We -- that's purely timing. We expect that to recover in the second quarter and throughout the third and fourth quarter. Remember that last year, like Gale mentioned, we booked quite a bit of fuel expense because of the sharing band, and we don't expect that to happen. So we see a pickup in fuel in terms of impact on earnings.Gale E. KlappaSo purely timing. We'll see a second half turnaround.Andrew Marc WeiselOkay. And then on usage, Xia, if you could elaborate a little bit on the demand trend. I think you said residential gas came in better than expected, adjusting for weather, but on the electric side all customer classes were down. How much of that has just been noise around the extreme weather? Or do you see any notable changes in demand trends?Xia LiuYes, a lot of expected noise around weather normalization, like I said, just to put it in perspective, the weather-normalized residential sales met our forecasted expectations. So those are the higher-margin segment. And on the C&amp;I front, we -- just a reminder, we have a very diverse mix of industries. We call provide essential services like food, paper, plastic processing and many of which had a really good growth in the first quarter and we don't have exposure to lots of automobile or oil and gas industry. So we feel really good about the industry mix and we really haven't seen any trends of any potential recession in our service territory. So we track about a little over 100 large customers regularly. There are 4 that contributed to almost half of the negative variance in the first quarter year-over-year, and 2 of those were down substantially year-over-year because of noneconomic reasons. So one had a fire, the other had an outbreak. So we expect those to return to normal through the rest of the year. So -- and again, whether normal noise played a role in these numbers. So I wouldn't overreact to these numbers right now.Gale E. KlappaYes. Andrew, just to build on to what Xia's saying, when you look at the temperatures across Q1, they were basically 2 standard deviations away from normal. And I can just tell you, not only for our company but for the industry as a whole, and for those of you who followed us a long time, you've heard me say this a gazillion times. I mean the weather normalization techniques are far more precise than accurate. And the further you get away from in terms of standard deviations from the norm, the less reliable the weather normalization techniques are. So again, just as a general caveat, as Xia said, I wouldn't read too much in the Q1 numbers.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho.Gale E. KlappaYou got a dog to name?Anthony Christopher CrowdellI was thinking that warehouse Doberman, that may work for Julien.Gale E. KlappaAnd not a bad idea. I'll take all of your input on naming the dog for Julien, but go Anthony.Anthony Christopher CrowdellAndrew, Xia had just took my question on the recession in C&amp;I sales. If I could just pivot and I think maybe some of your comments earlier on the iron piping in Chicago. I'm just curious, if we think back maybe 10 years ago or 15 years ago, when we talked about nuclear generation, how we're getting rid of it? How we're getting rid of it? And then all of a sudden, we've come to the realization of its importance and zero carbon. Do you think we have a similar moment in gas LDCs? And if we do, do you think that's going to be more dependent on its locations such as you bring up colder Midwest area that, hey, there is this recognition that if we wanted to retire it, we have to do it, electrified within 15 years were that as we get closer to that the parties realize how valuable the asset is?Gale E. KlappaYes. That's a great question, Anthony. And I do think there will be an epiphany moment. Don't know exactly when that epiphany moment will occur, but here are a couple of thoughts. The first is if you think you can electrify completely by, let's say, 15 years from now, you then have to take the next step and say, how are we going to build the generation that would be needed to replace gas heating. And what kind of generation would that be?Well, think about when gas heating is needed the most. It's the heavy cold winter days in January and February, right? So how much solar could you count on particularly in the Midwest in January and February? How much wind could you count on in January and February? And guess what? You end up clicking into the plan a tremendous amount of gas-fired power generation. When people start working through that equation, I think there will be quite an epiphany moment. I think that's part of it. And then the other is, as we continue to see the evolution of hydrogen hubs and as we continue to see more and more cost effectiveness from hydrogen under the IRA. I mean some gas utilities are already beginning to blend hydrogen with natural gas, we're beginning to blend. In fact, this summer, we will begin blending RNG, renewable natural gas into our network. So I think as people begin to think through past the bumper sticker, yes, you're going to see an epiphany moment about how valuable having that resource will be as we transition to a low and no carbon future. I mean, think about it another way. We have got to get this transition right to no-carbon future. And if we sacrifice reliability in that transition, it will delay the transition for many, many, many years. So we're back to all of the above and we're back to -- I think we will have a moment where everybody recognizes the practical approach to this and the safe approach to this.OperatorOur final question will come from the line of [Ashar Khan] with [Parisian].Unidentified AnalystMost of my questions have been answered. I just had a small one. So, why are we down quarter-over-quarter in the second quarter? Could you just help me with the variances which you expect in the second quarter?Xia LiuSure. Be happy to. So financing costs are expected to be higher compared to the Q2 last year. So that's a big driver. There is plus and minuses, but we do have rate base growth that's better than last year, fuel is expected to be better last year, but largely offset by financing costs.Gale E. KlappaTerrific. Well, folks, I think that concludes -- is there more? I'm sorry.OperatorI'll now turn the call back over to you, Mr. Klappa for any concluding remarks.Gale E. KlappaThere we go. I jump the gun. Thank you. Well, that concludes our conference call for today. Thanks so much for participating, as always. If you have additional questions, feel free to contact Beth Straka at (414) 221-4639.

But you have said, you see the world through the lens of genetics. What is this world telling you right now?ANNE WOJCICKI: Oh. Well, genetics-- so I should say, we're on the 20th anniversary of when the first human genome was sequenced. And it has, you know, it's a big milestone of like when it costs billions of dollars to get a single person sequenced and what you can learn from that to where we are today, where 23andMe has over 13 million people. You can learn a tremendous amount from your genome. And you can start to account for like all of this incredible diversity we see in life and all of the variation we have in our health, and like why some people do so well on a treatment, why some people don't, why some people get a disease, why some people don't.Story continuesSo I'm excited about the 20th anniversary and like, where it can go from here. But I do look at everything with that perspective of genetics, because it's almost like a digital code way of looking at all of the diversity that we see in life. And I look around a room, and I do think about like, I look at your eyes right now, and I'm like, ah--[LAUGHTER]I know he's an AG.BRIAN SOZZI: What's AG?ANNE WOJCICKI: It's just me, like you have like greenish eyes.BRIAN SOZZI: Ha, what does that say about my DNA?ANNE WOJCICKI: Well, just like you're not a GG.BRIAN SOZZI: OK. Is one better than the other?ANNE WOJCICKI: No, no. It's all-- no, that's the thing about diversity. Like, it's not-- you know, the diversity that we have of humans is about our story of survival, which is like a really beautiful story of like how we as, like, humans are made to keep living on this planet. Like, some people are made for cold, some people are made for hot. Some people have darker skin, and that protects them from sun. Some people are fair skin, and they can absorb more sun. Like, it's just like diversity is amazing.BRIAN SOZZI: I wasn't going to go here, but are you a-- when you go into a room, are you assessing people like this? I didn't even realize anything. You just told me.ANNE WOJCICKI: [LAUGHS][INTERPOSING VOICES][LAUGHTER]ANNE WOJCICKI: I mean, I do-- I do sometimes see people, then I'm like, and they'll say, they're like, oh, yeah, I haven't done 23andMe yet. And I'll be kind of chomping at the bit. I'd be like I'm dying to see your DNA.BRIAN SOZZI: Wow. OK, let me go-- let me get back on topic here. We're at the Milken Conference. And there's so much focus on health care because of the efforts by Michael Milken. I went to the doctor recently, just a checkup, didn't tell me anything about my genetics. Didn't even tell me where I can go, what I can do, what I may not do. Is it-- is it interwoven in health care right now? Or is there something missing here?ANNE WOJCICKI: No. I mean, again, I'd say that's the disappointment I have of the 20 years having been around when they first sequenced the human genome that it's not broadly adopted. And I think part of that reason is that genetics tells you a lot about what you're at risk for. And it doesn't necessarily financially pay to get you that preventative information and to intervene in that way versus just treating people once they have a disease.And so that's frankly it's my disappointment here is that we don't look at genetics, for instance, when you're getting a prescription and say, like, are you likely to respond? Should you have a different dose? You look at the epidemic of depression. There's all kinds of, you know, you can look at your genetics, look at a number of the drug, you know, interaction genes and see what medication you're likely to most respond to.It's a tragedy to me that people are not first tested before they are prescribed something. I think also there's all kinds of other conditions like hereditary, you know, colon cancer. People should actually know whether or not they have something like that. And they can have increased screening. Familial hypercholesterolemia is where you have like really high, you know, cholesterol levels, and you need to get screened.So things like that you could actually really start to, you know, see it for yourself.BRIAN SOZZI: All of that makes a lot of sense to me.ANNE WOJCICKI: Yeah.BRIAN SOZZI: What's the biggest roadblock preventing health care from adopting these things?ANNE WOJCICKI: It's a good question. I'd say there's two things. Like, one is it's not in the workflow. So meaning like when you go to your doctor, it's not necessarily part of the workflow, the processes. Like, if you said you're interested in having children, it isn't necessarily part of that workflow for actually how your doctor would follow up, how insurance would pay-- be paid. Does the doctor-- is the doctor educated about genetics? And what, you know, why they should do it, what you're potentially going to learn, how to potentially deal with the results if they get them.I think for a long time we were really just used to genetic counselors and saying, like, hey, it's going to be put on a genetic counselor if you have this particular issue. And more and more, it's going into the mainstream. It should be your primary care physician really integrating it with primary care.So I think that insurance and payment is a big obstacle. And I would say that physician education is a main-- is a significant obstacle as well as like being part of the workflow.BRIAN SOZZI: Last time you talked to you around the time of the IPO 2021, you were just starting, I guess, getting going on a partnership with GSK and drug development. Where is that now? And when is that first drugs from this deal coming to market?ANNE WOJCICKI: Well, that is thriving. GSK is actually-- it's done extraordinarily well. We have over 50 programs underway with GSK. We do have one that is in a phase I study that GSK now controls. We've-- it's co-developed, but we-- they're taking lead now. So, and there's a huge number of programs behind it.23andMe also has our own wholly owned program. It's an immunotherapy program. So super excited about it. It is definitely exciting to see that you can go from understanding the genetic variation-- that makes me so excited-- to saying, wow, some people are, you know, genetically not likely to develop, you know, a certain kind of condition. And then can I understand that and turn that actually into a drug to help either treat people who have that condition?BRIAN SOZZI: Is that the holy grail in health care, looking out over the next decade, the ability to match up your genetics with figuring out the cure for cancer or some other disease?ANNE WOJCICKI: I look at all the explosion of all these new technologies with gene therapy, with CRISPR, with RNA technologies, and understanding the human genome. And I think what 23andMe can really bring to the table here is the understanding of the human genome.So for instance, one thing that we can do really well is we study healthy people, meaning that you might have a particularly interesting mutation that the scientific world thinks like they don't know. Maybe it's potentially disease-causing. But because I can study you, and I can say, OK, you have finished a knockout mutation, you're doing really well. You have no other health issues.We potentially know that that, like, changing that or modifying that gene is not going to create any other kinds of issues. So it's a way to help the pharmaceutical industry study essentially what's naturally going on in humans. So we find like studying huge populations and huge numbers helps us just understand that natural variability in people.BRIAN SOZZI: How do you-- how do you go about championing this in the educational system? Do you see the things you're talking about today being embedded in our education system?ANNE WOJCICKI: I think that, you know, genetics to be really successful, I think it needs to be part of medical school training. And it needs to be integrated not as a single subject but throughout all aspects of the curriculum. So when you're doing, you know, cardiovascular health, that it's part of that. When you're doing renal health, it's part of that.That everything, every aspect of health care has a genetic component and helping realize, you know, the personalization that comes with it. Like, every patient that is coming also is unique and different. And so we're all going to metabolize drugs in a different way. You're going to have potentially, like, your blood values are naturally going to be different than my blood values based on your genetics.There's just a lot of variability that we're going to understand from your genetics. And that's going to manifest in different ways in each of us. So what your baseline is going to be different than what my baseline is. So I do see that it needs to be integrated throughout all aspects of health care, not just as a specialty in genetics.BRIAN SOZZI: Lastly, what's next for your company?ANNE WOJCICKI: I'm excited-- there's two big areas. One is consumer, which is really about helping. We have over 13 million people and helping them do more with the information that we already provided. So one thing that we've gotten the feedback from our customers. Is that it's almost an overwhelming amount of information. So how do you translate all this into a care plan?And there's a lot of lifestyle information we're also collecting from our customers about how they eat, how much they sleep, how much they walk, exercise, happiness. So helping people understand their health in the context of what they've self-reported, their genetics, and then all of their lifestyle information, so that then you can know what things should you change. And some of that might be more proactive screening in the medical system. Some of it might be changing how you sleep. Some of it might be changing how you eat.So I see a real opportunity for us to deliver a type of personalized prevention that's grounded in your genetics. But we take all that other information about you. And we really help you be as healthy as you can.I think the second slide, I think, we see this from the work that we've done with GSK. Having a large-- you know, a large amount of genetic information with really, really broad phenotypic data is incredibly powerful for drug discovery. And the end of the GSK collaboration comes in July. And it opens up all kinds of doors for us to, you know, start to do more partnerships with more companies. And I feel a responsibility to my customers that if you're somebody who has a family history of Alzheimer's, it's on me.]"

215,b1a8274d-4255-3133-a874-71278fcac6dd,JNJ,2023-05-02,20 Cities with the Highest Depression Rates in the U.S.,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-cities-highest-depression-rates-192540799.html,1682882740,STORY,['JNJ'],"[In this piece, we will take a look at the twenty cities with the highest depression rates in the U.S. For more cities, head on over to 5 Cities with the Highest Depression Rates in the U.S. The devastating effects of depression cause suffering to countless families each year and also lead to staggering economic losses. For instance, according to research published in PharmacoEconomics, the economic burden of adults suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD), which is one of the several kinds of depression, stood at a whopping $362 billion in 2020. This marked a massive 37.9% growth from 2010 values, and the growth indicates that unless effective depression treatments are developed, the costs of the mental health disease will only rise. Delving deeper into the costs,  researchers reveal that this economic burden consists of direct costs, suicide related costs, and workplace costs. The workplace costs make up the biggest component as they account for 73% of the total.Researchers in China have an interesting study on this topic. Typically, it's thought that as the economy falters, rates of mental health disturbances and depression go up in society. Assuming this to be true, it's only natural to assume that the reverse is also true i.e. as the economy grows, mental health should also improve. Well, as is the case with most things, the inverse relationship isn't really that simple. The researchers used data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) of people 45 years or older, and assessed them for several indicators of mental health. They concluded that higher growth rates of gross domestic product (GDP per capita) led to higher scores in depression, life impairment, and cognitive dissatisfaction. Food for thought, huh?It's clear that whether the economy is good or bad, depression's here to stay. Naturally, this opens up a large market to develop and sell treatments. On this front, the research firm Emergen Research believes that the global anxiety and depression market was worth $12.06 billion in 2019 and is set to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.9% from then until 2027 to be worth $16 billion as 2027 ends. There are several treatments available for depression, which include medications such as antidepressants, behavioral therapy such as cognitive behavioral therapy, and stimulative methods such as Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).Story continuesBelieve it or not, the ECT market is one of the fastest growing treatments for depression - perhaps because it is also one of the smallest. According to Precedence Research, the global shockwave market was worth $1.2 billion in 2021 and will more than double by 2030 by growing at 11.2% and sitting at $3.1 billion. Of course, this market is also made of non mental health treatments such as sports injuries. However, depression has the potential to 'stimulate' the market as well, as several reports such as those from the Korean Psychiatric Association outline that ECT sees a response rate in up to 90% of MDD cases.Cities with the Highest Depression Rates in the U.S.Photo by Jonathan Rados on UnsplashMoving forward to new treatments, particularly pharmacological ones, for depression, two such drugs are the first to secure approval from the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) in decades. The first of these is esketamine, approved in 2019, and the second is Dextromethorphan/bupropion, which was approved just last year. The former is sold by a subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and is marketed as Spravato, and the second is marketed by Axsome Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:AXSM) as Auvelity.Since it is a freshly launched drug, Johnson &amp; Johnson cannot yet specifically provide figures for Spravato's sales. However, during its latest earnings call for the results for the fourth quarter of 2022, the firm shared that the drug will be part of  its future growth. During the event, the company's management outlined:We expect to again deliver above-market growth in 2023, driven by key assets such as DARZALEX, ERLEADA, TREMFYA, GA SUSTENNA and UPTRAVI as well as continued uptake of recently launched products, such as CARVYKTI, SPRAVATO and TECVAYLI. This growth is despite lower Pharmaceutical market growth than experienced in recent years and considers the STELARA loss of exclusivity, which we anticipate occurring in late 2023 in the U.S. While we continue to expect volume growth for STELARA in the U.S. up to the LOE date, we expect this growth to be offset by pricing pressure. Further, we continue to expect a 2023 impact from other post-LOE products as well as potential increased austerity measures across Europe.Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB) and Sage Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:SAGE) are developing a treatment called zuranolone which might be needed to be used for as little as two weeks. Sage's management shared details about this drug in an earnings call as it shared:Starting with our depression franchise. We recently shared new analyses and additional data from the zuranolone clinical development program at the 2022 site Congress and the 35th European College of Neuropsychopharmacology, or ECMP Congress. These presentations included data from the SHORELINE Study, and health economics and outcomes research, as well as the presentation of data from the SKYLARK Study. The analyses and data presented continue to build on the positive data we’ve shared earlier in the year. I want to highlight a few of the key themes that support the potential for zuranolone. First, the analyses highlight the rapidity of onset of zuranolone seen in patients with both MDD and PPD in our clinical trials.In particular, results from the WATERFALL Study showed a treatment effect compared placebo, as early as day three in zuranolone 50 milligrams. Additionally, a post hoc analysis of MDD patients from the study to get the improvements with zuranolone 50 milligrams compared to placebo, or clinically meaningful. Further in the SKYLARK Study, patients with PPD treated with zuranolone 50 milligrams experienced rapid, clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in depressive symptoms as early as day three that were sustained through day 45. In both studies, the results were clinically meaningful across the early time periods, further reinforcing our belief in the rapid acting nature of zuranolone in-patients with both MDD and PPD.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some U.S. cities with the highest depression rates.Our Methodology To compile our list of America's most depressed cities, we used data from CEUfast, a nursing education provider operating for decades with accredited courses. Their data covers the percentage of the population of metropolitan areas with depression, with fifty total entries. Out of these, the top twenty cities with the highest depression in the U.S. are listed below.Don't Miss: 25 States that have the Highest Rates of Depression in America.Cities with the Highest Depression Rates in the U.S.20.

Also, for patients who are active, Micra AV2 has a higher available tracking capability for faster heart rates (increased from 115 to 135 beats per minute for upper limits).4""Improved AV synchrony – requiring less in-office reprogramming thanks to algorithm optimization – and longer battery life are major wins for patients,"" said Camille Frazier-Mills, M.D., MHS, an electrophysiologist at Duke University Health System. ""I'm excited to offer my patients the new Micra devices. This best-in-class technology transforms the patient experience by eliminating pocket-related complications, and now reduces the chance that patients will need their device changed in the future.""""Our goal is to improve the patient experience by continuously reinventing our ground-breaking leadless pacemaker,"" said Robert C. Kowal, M.D., Ph.D., general manager, Cardiac Pacing Therapies within the Cardiac Rhythm Management business, which is part of the Cardiovascular Portfolio at Medtronic. ""Since inventing the first battery-operated cardiac pacemakers 65 years ago, Medtronic has transformed pacing technologies to benefit patients, including the nearly 200,000 patients globally who have received a Micra device so far.""Story continuesComparable in size to a multivitamin, Micra pacemakers are less than one-tenth the size of traditional pacemakers. Unlike traditional pacemakers, Micra pacemakers do not require leads or a surgical ""pocket"" under the skin, so potential sources of complications related to leads and pockets are eliminated, and there is no visible sign of the device.Leaders in Cardiac Pacing   This FDA approval builds on the Medtronic legacy in cardiac pacing, which includes:Inventing the first wearable pacemaker in 1957.Launching the first pacemaker for use in MRIs in 2011.Creating and launching the first leadless pacemaker in 2015.Launching the first leadless pacemaker to coordinate the heart's electrical signals by sensing atrial activity, without a lead or device in the atria, in 2020.Gaining regulatory approval for the first pacing system to activate the heart's natural electrical system, conduction system pacing (approval via the His-bundle in 2018 and via the left bundle branch area in 2022).About Medtronic   Bold thinking.

It can be as simple as identifying dividend stocks to buy and hold for the next decade or more. Some of the most successful investors purchase dividend stocks with the intent to hold them indefinitely. Warren Buffett is one such investor with some of the names listed below. He’s a well-known proponent of investing in solid companies with long-term business potential. Indeed, that same simple model applies here as well.It’s a simple, low-risk strategy that mitigates potential losses, while providing income which can be spent, or used for reinvestment. Here are seven such stocks I think fit this profile.NEENextEra Energy$74.07KOCoca-Cola$63.55ALBAlbermarle$181.20PGProcter &amp; Gamble$154.58MDTMedtronic$89.97JPMJPMorgan Chase$135.23GDGeneral Dynamics$214.83InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsNextEra Energy (NEE)Nextra Energy (NEE) website on a mobile phone screenSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comNextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is the only energy producer on this list. Perhaps the reason oil stocks are conspicuously absent is because fossil fuel production and consumption are trending downward. That said, NextEra Energy offers the upside of secular trends in its renewable wind and solar business, NextEra Energy Resources (NEER). It balances that potential nicely with its utility business, Florida Power &amp; Light.The combined business controls the most prominent U.S. utility company and one of the world’s largest renewable companies. Thus, it’s clear that investors should be interested in the stock over the next decade.In 2022, NextEra Energy reported $20.95 billion in sales. Most of those sales – $17.3 billion – were attributable to FPL. FPL saw its revenue increase year-over-year, from $17.07 billion. So, NEE stock offers a notoriously stable utility business model, and the upside of NextEra’s massive renewable energy business. Notably, NextEra is also among the dividend stocks that haven’t reduced their distribution in 25+ years.Story continuesCoca-Cola (KO)coca-cola bottles and cans. coke is a blue-chip stocksSource: Fotazdymak / Shutterstock.comCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is the ideal choice for risk-verse, long-term-oriented investors. Unsurprisingly, KO shares comprise 8.5% of Warren Buffett’s portfolio. It’s a great business with readily-identifiable advantages, and remains the dominant name in soft drinks globally. It’s among the dividend stocks worth considering, with a dividend hasn’t been reduced since 1963, and a payout ratio indicative of a healthy business that continues to reinvest in internal growth.Coca-Cola is also a company that offers products with relatively low demand elasticity. Consumers tend to buy its products steadily across the business cycle. Accordingly, that’s part of the reason that KO stock boasts a low beta of 0.55. It’s simply not a volatile company, which is what beta measures. Instead, it’s a steady performer that risk-averse investors will certainly appreciate for the lack of drama and the steadily-increasing income.Classic Coca-Cola remains the core product for the firm, but the company maintains a portfolio of 200 brands optimized to provide drama-free returns to investors.Albemarle (ALB)Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screenSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.comAlbemarle (NYSE:ALB) stock is currently in a bit of a freefall, as commodity price fluctuations take their toll on the company’s shares. The firm is a significant producer of the lithium used in EV batteries. This, its shipments will rise and fall as market dynamics shift. That’s abundantly clear, as ALB stock has dropped to an 18-month low, after surging to record highs in late 2022.However, it wouldn’t be prudent to judge the opportunity in Albemarle by current short-term dynamics alone. Global lithium demand is expected to grow five-fold by 2030. The U.S. is a significant driver of that demand, and Albemarle is a prominent name domestically.Subsidies caused a rush in manufacturing that led to overproduction last year. Excess inventory has resulted. A drawdown will take time, but overarching trends remain. EVs are here to stay, and lithium will continue to be needed. It might also be wise to sit on the sidelines and try to buy ALB stock, as it continues to get cheaper.Procter &amp; Gamble (PG)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comProcter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) is the world’s largest consumer packaged goods company. Investing in firms that boast long-term, dominant positions in significant sectors is generally safe, so PG stock makes this list.Various metrics also suggest that now is a reasonable time to make that investment. Procter &amp; Gamble’s price-earnings ratio aligns with average levels over the past ten years. It’s not overpriced based on earnings. Further, over the last ten years, Procter &amp; Gamble has provided excellent returns to investors. It has averaged nearly 10% annual returns during that period. Every dollar invested and held would have grown into $2.52.That calculation doesn’t include dividends currently of $0.941 per share, paid quarterly. Thus, investors’ total returns are potentially quite a bit higher, factoring in stock repurchases and the power of compounding.PG stock benefits from higher pricing charged to consumers for things like toothpaste and detergent, proving sustainable demand, even as consumers become stretched.Medtronic (MDT)Medtronic (MDT) sign outside office building representing healthcare stocksSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comMedtronic (NYSE:MDT) is a business with apparent, stable demand for the next decade and beyond. The company specializes in medical devices and comprises cardiac, minimally invasive surgery, restorative therapies, and diabetes.With the world’s major economies continuing to age, it’s reasonable to anticipate that Medtronic will continue to grow for the foreseeable future. The company is expected to reach approximately $30.9 billion in sales this year and $32.3 billion in 2024. That’s not phenomenal growth by most measures, but extrapolated out, such gains add up. By 2023, 1 in 6 people are anticipated to be 60 years old, or more. Aging is associated with increased rates of diabetes and cardiac issues requiring pacemakers. Those are particular strengths for Medtronic.Medtronic shares are currently very close to being fully-priced, so waiting for them to fall to some arbitrary level might make sense before making a purchase. In any case, long-term trends favor Medtronic.JPMorgan Chase (JPM)JPMorgan Chase (JPM) lettering on a corporate office in New York City.Source: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.comJPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) would have been a good stock for long-term dividend investors to invest in early in 2023. Those prospects have only gotten better as the year has progressed. JPMorgan Chase is the largest U.S. bank and is only likely to get bigger. The banking crisis has provided the bank an opportunity to consolidate its lead.It’s old news now that depositors fled through JPMorgan Chase’s doors with their money as the banking crisis unfolded. Indeed, size equates to safety in the banking sector, so into JPM the deposits went. The bank played the part well, shoring up reserves by providing liquidity to failing regional banks. Thus, it all results in JPM stock looking better and better.If you didn’t buy shares at the depth of the crisis, now is the next best time. JPMorgan will deploy those deposits to build its brand into a bigger, more dominant banking chain.General Dynamics (GD)US tank General Dynamics (GD) Abrams M1A1 in military polygon in the exercise Platinum Lynx 16 on Galati, Romania, 11 December 2015Source: PhotoStock10 / Shutterstock.comGeneral Dynamics (NYSE:GD) is the lone defense firm among the 68 current dividend aristocrats. That means it boasts 25+ years of consecutive dividend increases, is listed in the S&amp;P 500, and meets liquidity and size requirements. It is arguably the best of the best defense firms for long-term investors.Top-line results are expected to increase at General Dynamics over the short term. That’s important. But it’s also important to understand that the next decade will also benefit General Dynamics. Geopolitical tensions are rising, and the threat of war with China only increases GD stock’s upside.This is also among the dividend stocks that have recently declared dividend, with General Dynamics putting forward a $1.32 dividend. This represents a 4.8% increase over last year’s dividend.Three out of four of General Dynamics’ business lines are defense-related, with only its aerospace division focused elsewhere on Gulfstream business jets. General Dynamics is only likely to get stronger over the coming decades.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Rather it be strong top or bottom line figures, positive guidance, or an overreaction in the market that leads to a quality stock being oversold.With that being said, here are three top-rated Zacks stocks that may offer good buying opportunities right now.Crocs (CROX)First up is Crocs, the footwear and apparel leader sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and appears to be somewhat oversold following its first-quarter results last Thursday.Despite beating top and bottom-line expectations, Crocs stock fell more than 11% after the company issued a profit warning in its outlook for the second quarter. Crocs now expects Q2 earnings between $2.83-$2.98 per share which is below many analysts’ forecasts and the current Zacks Consensus of $3.15 a share.  Still, Crocs beat its first-quarter earnings expectations by 22%. Crocs Q1 earnings were $2.61 per share compared to estimates of $2.13 a share. First-quarter earnings were also up 27% year over year with EPS at $2.05 in Q1 2022.Although Crocs Q2 guidance was modest, annual earnings estimate revisions have continued to trend higher as the company raised its full-year revenue outlook for fiscal 2023. To that point, Crocs is still expanding and has beaten earnings expectations for 12 consecutive quarters. Furthermore, earnings are now forecasted to rise 5% this year and jump another 10% in FY24 at $12.69 per share.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRockwell Automation (ROK)Another stock that looks attractive after earnings is industrial automation and information solutions provider Rockwell Automation which also has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Rockwell topped its fiscal second-quarter earnings expectations by 15% last Thursday.Rockwell’s Q2 EPS came in at $3.01, compared to estimates of $2.62 per share. More impressive, earnings climbed 81% from the prior-year quarter with Q2 2022 EPS at $1.66. Rockwell attributed the strong growth to continued improvement in component availability and strong execution in delivering critical solutions to customers.Story continuesRockwell earnings are now forecasted to climb 22% in fiscal 2023 at $11.55 per share compared to EPS of $9.49 in 2022. Fiscal 2024 earnings are expected to rise another 7%. Earnings estimate revisions have continued to rise over the last week with FY23 earnings estimates now up 6% over the last quarter while FY24 EPS estimates are up 4%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUnited States Steel (X)Last but not least is United States Steel which boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and surpassed its bottom line expectations by 26% last Thursday.United States Steel stock makes the case for being undervalued despite the large inflationary boost that steel producers received from higher commodity prices beginning to fade. First-quarter EPS came back to reality and dropped -78% from the prior-year quarter at $0.77 per share but still blasted estimates of $0.61 per share.Better still, fiscal 2023 earnings estimates are still up a very intriguing 210% over the last 90 days with FY24 estimates up 15%. With United States Steel stock trading at just 5.8X forward earnings, the rising EPS estimates and Q1 earnings beat makes now look like an opportunistic time to buy.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineFollowing their strong quarterly results these stocks look more attractive and may be underappreciated at the moment. The rising earnings estimates are a great sign that Crocs, Rockwell Automation, and United States Steel will continue to have a strong year and this could lead to more upside in their stocks.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer and President, John Plueger now. John?Story continuesJohn L. PluegerThank you, Jason. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we generated $636 million in total revenue during the first quarter and diluted EPS of $1.06 per share. First quarter revenue was another record for ALC, primarily driven by the strong growth of our fleet this quarter. This increase was partially offset by elevated operating expenses, which Greg will cover in more detail in a moment. We purchased 22 new aircraft during the quarter, adding approximately $1.4 billion of flight equipment to our balance sheet and sold two aircraft. Our utilization rate remains strong at 99.9%, reflecting the continued high demand for the new commercial aircraft in our fleet. As of today, 93% of our deliveries through 2024 are placed, and we placed 57% of our total order book. As we've commented in recent quarters, airline customer demand is strong and seems only to continue to accelerate as traffic volumes rise. We have only a handful of deliveries scheduled for 2024 yet to place and 2025 slots are also being snapped up at a rapid pace as well. Boeing and Airbus are largely sold out on narrow-body aircraft until 2028 and beyond. And widebodies are also increasingly in short supply, offering upward impetus to lease rates. Now on the topic of lease rates, we continue to see strength in new placements, lease extensions and placements of used aircraft, reflecting the high demand and constrained supply environment that we're witnessing at present. For Air Lease, with our young fleet, we have only 20 lease maturities in 2023, relative to our fleet of 437 aircraft. So this is not something that will be meaningfully impactful to our financial statements this year. But we do think it is a noteworthy trend that illustrates market strength, and we are happy with extending leases at attractive rates. While new aircraft deliveries were somewhat higher than we guided for the first quarter, we remain cautious in our bigger picture outlook on OEM delivery time lines. In recent weeks, we have received additional notices of delay from both Airbus and Boeing for 2023 and 2024 deliveries. We fully expect delays to persist for several years as indeed one OEM has advised us to expect delays compared to originally contracted delivery dates through 2028, as our delivery schedules are being revised according to their actual ability to achieve production rate increases. As an A321 XLR launch customer, for example, we're seeing the time line for that program get pushed further out to the right by 14 to 16 months. While clearly frustrating for ourselves and our customers to have delayed deliveries, from a scarcity aspect, this does serve to benefit the value of our existing fleet and the deliveries we are receiving. Our delivery outlook for 2023, therefore, remains fluid as a product of these circumstances. So in turn, we continue to expect a range of $4 billion to $5 billion of aircraft to be acquired this year. I would like to note that at either end of the range, that still does offer us meaningful fleet growth on our existing fleet of $26 billion of commercial aircraft, just not at the contracted deliveries as scheduled or as we ordered. As it stands right now, we expect approximately $1.3 billion of aircraft deliveries for the second quarter of this year. We will update you further on our delivery outlook as the year progresses. Turning to aircraft sales. While we completed sales of only two aircrafts this quarter, we expect to see the pace of aircraft sales increase throughout the remainder of the year with the largest volumes during the second half of the year. Our pipeline for sales remains robust, and we continue to expect to sell between $1 billion to $2 billion of aircraft in the remainder of this year. We remain excited to return to more steady sales activity given our sales program has been effectively on pause even prior to the pandemic as a product of the MAX grounding. As a reminder, we target ownership of our new commercial aircraft over the first 1/3 of their economic lives. So we would expect a certain component of our fleet to become candidates for sale in any given year. Lastly, I'd like to comment briefly on the bigger picture operating environment. The week before last, I completed a week-long trip in Europe, visiting a diverse group of airlines, including Virgin Atlantic, TUI UK, Lufthansa, Swiss, TAP, Portugal and Norwegian, most of whom are current lessees of ours. Most of these airlines advise the same key themes that we largely see globally: first, passenger traffic remains strong and growing with a healthy yield environment despite inflationary pressures with no pullback yet in sight; second, labor shortages, including pilots, aircraft availability and infrastructure constraints continue to frustrate their efforts to grow and serve the passenger demand they see looming for the upcoming busy summer season; third, that shorter on-week engine life -- on-wing engine life of most of the new technology engines continues to frustrate their aircraft operations and deployment with record numbers of power plants requiring shop visits earlier than originally promised by the engine OEMs. This has led to a global shortage of spare engines, increasing lead times and repair times for engine shop visits and rapid cost escalation for all engine overhauls and repairs. To address these problems, engine OEMs on single-aisle aircraft are diverting greater quantities of new production engines to support existing aircraft in the field. With production capabilities largely maxed out by the engine OEMs, this leads to fewer engines delivered to meet airframe OEM current and future production rate goals, which may impact Airbus more as they maintain higher production rates than Boeing. With more engines in the shop and more aircraft rounded awaiting engine replacements, this further adds to the need at a number of airlines to have additional aircraft coverage in their fleets, illustrating yet another aspect underpinning the aircraft demand picture that bodes well for ALC. And the fourth and final point raised by many of the airlines is a continued focus on sustainability, operating the most fuel-efficient aircraft with a stepped-up focus on sustainable aviation fuel, SAF, as we now call it. In fact, just this past week in Europe, the European Commission welcomed a new political agreement reached called the Renew Fuel EU Aviation proposal. The new rules are aimed to help decarbonize the aviation sector by requiring fuel suppliers to blend SAF with kerosene in increasing amounts from 2025. These factors are all very positive for us at Air Lease, a key benefit of having our lessor industry-leading $24 billion order book of Boeing and aircraft and Airbus aircraft in that we have delivery slots that the airlines need to take advantage of for these broader industry trends as well as having our youngest aircraft existing in our fleet with a weighted average of only 4.5 years. Airlines need these aircraft, and they can't get them anytime soon from the manufacturers. We are among a handful of lessors who have order books and ours is the largest -- and ours of the lessors is the largest focusing only on Boeing and Airbus commercial aircraft. This is a tremendous strategic advantage for ALC as we continue to place new aircraft in the current environment. And in many cases, we have multiple airline customers buying for the same delivery slot or the same used aircraft, which only further supports momentum for lease rates over time. I would remind you that it does take time for these impacts to be seen in our financial statements with our current existing owned fleet of 437 aircraft, and the new aircraft deliveries we are taking in 2023 largely reflect deals struck in 2021. So in the big picture, we remain confident and bullish on our future outlook. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Steve Hazy, who will offer more commentary on the performance of the airline industry and success in our business. Steve?Steven F. Udvar-HazyThank you very much, John. First, I'd like to congratulate our ALC team on achieving another quarter of record revenues in Q1 of 2023, benefiting from our continued strong fleet growth, with nearly 400 more aircraft to deliver over the next 5 years, more growth and achievements are on the horizon for Air Lease Corporation. As John highlighted a moment ago, we remain very pleased by the continued strong increases of global air passenger traffic volumes. The latest IATA traffic numbers released in early April are up a sizable 55% year-over-year. As would be expected, given the lag in international market recovery, we've seen the largest improvements in traffic volumes in these international markets, which rose 90% relative to the prior year. Domestic traffic meanwhile, continues to improve in all the major markets followed by IATA, and most are either within single-digit percentage range of pre-pandemic levels or in some cases, are exceeding those levels. In addition, domestic China traffic has improved meaningfully following the on again, off again travel restrictions in place in that country in 2021 and 2022. And air traffic is up 38% in China relative to the same month last year. The resumption of China travel is a significant regional positive, not only due to the country's own domestic scale, but traffic and commerce for the Asia region as a whole. Total Asia Pacific international traffic continues to expand dramatically, rising close to 380% year-over-year. I'd like to add that while the comparisons to pre-pandemic 2019 traffic made sense previously, we think these are now beginning to feel somewhat less relevant given that 2019 is now 4 years in the past, we should not be anchoring our industry views to the past, but instead looking to the significant industry growth potential we foresee in the future. I'd like to add a few additional comments about our outlook for commercial aircraft demand. We remain extremely active placing our order book positions and are pleased by what we are hearing in our dialogue with our airline customers. In addition to what we're seeing with respect to lease rate momentum, both on new narrow-body and wide-body aircraft. Commercial aircraft demand is very high now and only seems likely to accelerate as traffic expansion continues at a strong clip and airline profitability across the board rises. While volumes have been obviously positive driver, airfares generally have also picked up pace over the last 6, 7 months and are now outpacing inflation. Load factors meanwhile, are very strong across the globe already. And it may come as no surprise that many of the U.S. domestic market load factors, for example, were at 20-year plus high levels last summer and continue to be very robust. We believe these levels could potentially be exceeded this summer, which only adds to further pressure on airlines to expand capacity. Just as it appears an industry prognosticators, who were calling for pandemic -- sorry, traffic recovery in the 2025, '26 time frame will be proven wrong. We think there could also miss out on the order of magnitude on the upside as well. When combined with the higher probability of delivery delays extending further out versus improving, this is only setting up for further upward momentum in lease rates and aircraft values, particularly those of the most desirable jet aircraft types that make up the ALC fleet. As John mentioned, deliveries in the first quarter were modestly better than we expected, albeit still well below the OEM's contractual obligations to us. We delivered 22 new aircraft to our customers comprised of both narrow-body and wide-body aircraft. This past quarter, our deliveries included six A321neos, primarily A321 LR, long-range aircraft with three going to Vistara Airlines in India, along with several other customers. As a reminder, Air Lease's fleet and order book is highly focused on the A321neo variant and particularly given its combination of capacity, range, operating efficiency, which drives the high appeal to airline customers. And as you know, we are the official large customer for both the extended range LR and the upcoming XLR variant of the particular type. We also delivered 13 new Boeing 737-8 and -9 aircraft to customers such as Alaska, Aeromexico and several others. On the widebody side, we delivered two A330-900s to Virgin Atlantic, along with an A350-900 to Starlux in Asia. We hope to receive our first new 787 this year in the coming weeks. Each of these aircraft are among the most fuel-efficient, new technology aircraft available with outstanding capacity, performance and range characteristics relative to all prior generations of commercial aircraft. I would also like to highlight the fact that Air Lease maintains a conservative approach with respect to risk management. And I emphasize risk management. We continue to focus on managing fleet risk by airline, country and region. And in fact, our average customer exposure is just roughly 1% of our total fleet. We also maintain a firm stance and requiring airline customers to provide significant security deposits to pay maintenance reserves, which further insulate us from downside risk. Unlike banks that build reserves for losses out of their own pockets getting into low profitability, we require these cash deposits and reserves to be paid upfront by our airline customers. We do not put all our eggs in one basket by only serving one particular customer or airline market segment. In fact, our customers include flag carriers, full service airlines, LCCs and ULCCs across particularly all points on the globe that are favorable for us to operate in. Ultimately, maintaining a fleet and order book of the newest technology in fuel vision aircraft available also affords us one of the best risk mitigants. And that is new technology aircraft that are always in demand, and we can move them quickly from one challenged airline to another into various different markets as well as the airlines and markets where conditions are more favorable. We believe this is a tremendous competitive advantage as compared to practically all other asset businesses. In closing, I wish to convey our strong sense of optimism as we are invested in new commercial aircraft, acquired at deeply discounted prices in our existing fleet and our industry-leading Boeing and Airbus order book, which, along with extensive customer and supplier relationships and broad access to diverse funding, places us in a position of significant strength. The fundamental demand backdrop is robust, and the limited supply and elevated demand seen for new commercial aircraft is highly weighted in our favor. And we do expect the market to remain this way for multiple years ahead. In turn, we remain very excited about the future opportunities ahead for Air LC. Now I'll turn over the call to CFO, Greg Willis, to comment further on our recent financial performance.Gregory B. WillisThanks very much, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In the first quarter of 2023, Air Lease generated record revenues of $636 million. This is comprised of approximately $618 million of rental revenues and $18 million of aircraft sales, trading and other activities. The increase in total revenues was primarily driven by the growth of our fleet, partially offset by lower security deposits and maintenance reserve income as compared to the prior year. You will remember that last year, we recognized $60 million in security deposits and maintenance reserve income related to the sanctions imposed on our Russian fleet. This quarter, we recognized $35 million in end of lease revenue related to the transition of 11 aircraft. You will recall that at the end of our leases, we retain the maintenance reserves, which helped insulate us from maintenance and other costs associated with aircraft transitions. I will also highlight that all 11 of these aircraft has been subsequently placed with follow-on lessees. Moving on to expenses. The interest expense line rose 26% as compared to the first quarter of 2022. This was due to an increase in our average debt balances, which follows the growth of our fleet as well as an uptick in our composite cost of funds from 3.7% at the end of last year to 3.42% at quarter end. Despite higher prevailing interest rates relative to prior years, we continue to benefit from 88% of our debt being at fixed rates. Depreciation continues to track the growth of our fleet, while SG&amp;A rose as business activities have increased over the course of the past year, along with an uptick in certain other operating expenses, including the increase in insurance premiums, as we've highlighted in the past as well as aircraft transition-related costs. I would also like to note that we incurred approximately $6 million in expenses in the quarter associated with airline bankruptcies, which were covered by the end of lease income that I just discussed. Turning briefly to the cash flow statement. I think it's worthwhile highlighting that our customers are, by and large, have returned to a normalized rental schedule and have made great progress in repaying the deferral balances. This has driven a 37% increase in our operating cash flow in the quarter, which is great to see. Moving on to the financing side of the equation. Our largely fixed rate balance sheet and strong investment-grade ratings continue to position us favorably for interest rate movements over the intermediate term. We remain dedicated to maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet, utilizing unsecured debt as our primary form of financing, maintaining a high ratio of fixed rate funding and utilizing a conservative amount of leverage with a target debt-to-equity ratio of 2.5x. Our debt-to-equity ratio at the end of the first quarter was 2.88x on a GAAP basis, which net of cash on the balance sheet is approximately 2.78x. Our leverage remains modestly above our target following the write-off of our Russian fleet last year. We continue to expect that we will trend back to our long-term target as our aircraft sales volumes increased this year, and given the continued delivery delays that we expect, as John discussed earlier. During the past quarter, we returned to the debt capital markets with a $500 million -- excuse me, with a 5-year $700 million senior unsecured note issuance at 5.3% that closed in January. We also completed our inaugural Sukuk issuance in March, raising $600 million in trust certificates at 5.85% due in 2028, helping to drive funding diversity as well as to open a new capital markets for us. At the end of the first quarter, our balance sheet remains strong and is supported by our significant liquidity position of $6.5 billion and our large unencumbered asset base of $28 billion. In conclusion, as John and Steve highlighted, we remain very optimistic about our business. Even at the low end of our 2023 delivery expectations, these aircraft-s will help drive our strong revenue growth for years to come. And our order book remains a key component of our future success, providing a clear pipeline for growth. We are also excited about the ramp of our sales program, which we expect to benefit our margins and our ROE meaningfully in the future. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jason for the question-and-answer section of the call.Jason ArnoldThanks, Greg. This concludes management's commentary and remarks. (Operator Instructions). Regina, can you please open the line for the Q&amp;A session?Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs.Catherine Maureen O'BrienSo as you kind of alluded to in the prepared remarks, it's going to take some time for today's strong lease rates to make more marked impact on your financials as those aircraft deliver over the coming years, your current fleet gets remarketed, can you just give us a sense of how much upside there is to the deals you're striking today versus your current portfolio yields?John L. PluegerThanks, Catie. I think overall, these sorts of specific details about how much is affecting, et cetera, are not items that we disclosed. However, we've told you that of our strong lease rate environment and the factors that mean that it will take a little bit of time for that to cross through. I would invite Greg to make any other comments.Gregory B. WillisYes, John, I mean, historically, there's always been a lag between rising interest rates and rising lease rates. We're placing airplanes in the 2024, '25 time frame right now. So of course, it will take that long for those airplanes to work their way into our fleet. But remember, we're delivering airplanes every single day or virtually -- basically every single day that are helping driving our lease yield upwards. So I think it will take a little bit of time because we do have close to $28 billion in total assets, but we're very optimistic about the power of our order book and what it'll mean to ultimately, our financial results in the future.Steven F. Udvar-HazyYes. This is Steve. I just want to add to that, that the highest increases in lease rate factors are on the aircraft types that we have in our backlog, such as the A321neo, the A321neo LR, the 737 MAX, 787s and A350. So the very types of aircraft that we have in our portfolio are the ones that are experiencing the highest demand from the airlines and the best progress in terms of future lease rates.Catherine Maureen O'BrienGot it. So a lot of good news to come. Maybe if I could just sneak one more in on the sales. I think you noted last quarter, you have a good pipeline of sales, but had cautioned that timing was a bit uncertain quarter-to-quarter just given time to close. And you just mentioned that we should probably expect more volume in two halves than first half. But can you just speak to a little bit like where you're seeing the most demand for your aircraft come from? The other operating lessors, financial institutions, airlines looking to buy off lease? That would be really helpful.John L. PluegerSure. Well, there's really not been that much of a change there. A lot of our sales are to other aircraft lessors, smaller lessors. Occasionally, they are to the airlines that operate the airlines themselves, the aircraft themselves. So there's really been no big change there. It has actually surprised all of us, especially me that given interest rates that there -- it remains as strong of a demand across the board as there is. And we're happy to see it, and we're happy to supply it.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Helane Becker with TD Cowen.Helane Renee BeckerJust one question from me. In the past, you guys have talked about ordering just half of what the demand -- when you actually forecast the demand would be. So maybe part A and part B. Part A is how are you thinking about that going forward, given the fact that the delivery delays cause so many aircraft to get pushed to the right? And b, how are you thinking about lease rate factors in scenarios where the economy would tip into a recession?John L. PluegerSteve, do you want to take that one?Steven F. Udvar-HazyHappy to do it. First of all, the leases that we do, Helane, are, as you know, are long-term leases. And generally, they're anywhere from 8 to 14 years in length. So during the period of these leases, the global economy and regional economies can go through multiple cycles. And once the aircraft delivered, the lease rates are fixed. So whether we're in a recession or whether oil prices are $50 a barrel or $120 a barrel, the lease rates are what they are. And there's no sort of rehashing of lease rates during the course of the lease term. So we don't really think that a mild to medium recession will have a great impact for the very reason you mentioned that we've only ordered about half of the aircraft we can place. So as we sit here today, if we had an order book of 750 or 800 aircraft, we could easily place all of them. But our order book now is a little under 400 aircraft, which means we can be more picky, we can be more selective on which airlines we lease to and also maximize lease rate revenue inflows for the next 10 or 12 years.John L. PluegerLet me just add one other comment, Helane. Just please remember that all the aircraft we have on order that Steve indicated or -- on order through 2028. That's 5 years from now. So we have a long runway with a lot of good delivery positions to offer the marketplace. And we're also cognizant of the fact that this industry has always been cyclical, so 2028 is a fair piece away, and we will see how the industry is looking over the next couple of years. But I think I'm kind of reading between the lines of your question, we feel no gun to our head whatsoever to order additional aircraft today.Steven F. Udvar-HazyIn fact, Helane, if there is a recession on the horizon, that could actually create opportunities for us between now and 2028, '29, to pick up some aircraft from a distressed airline or perhaps an entity that ordered some airplanes that wants to scale back their orders for whatever their own reasons are. So we do not feel pressure today to order more planes in '29, '30, '31 because having been in this business a long time, I'm certain that there'll be opportunities for us to have selective acquisition opportunities of new aircraft in the next 5 years over and above our order book.Helane Renee BeckerOkay. That's very helpful. And then just one follow-on. Do you think the engine issues that you were talking about would drag on the valuations of new -- of those new technology aircraft?John L. PluegerNo, because the demand remains so strong. These are the aircraft that we have in this industry, and there's no other alternatives. The only other alternatives are for the engine manufacturers themselves to upgrade and slightly modify these engines to get them to the on-wing reliability that needs to be there. So that's what's happening. So no, we don't have any concerns about that because that's all that we have. And therefore, that's all the airlines can order, and that's all that we can -- that anyone can give.Steven F. Udvar-HazyAnd remember that the airlines are responsible for the operating cost elements, including fuel, maintenance, crewing, insurance, et cetera. And we have commitments now from all of the engine manufacturers, GE, CFM, Pratt &amp; Whitney, Rolls-Royce to make specific improvements to all of their engines on these new technology aircraft. And those improvements will be incorporated both on the new deliveries and also on existing aircraft where engines will go into the shop. So over a multiyear period, all of these engines will be upgraded to the latest standard.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Hillary Cacanando with Deutsche Bank.Hillary CacanandoSo we've heard that some Russian airlines have approached AerCap about purchasing plans at a discount or for potential insurance settlement. Have you been approached by any Russian airlines? And so would you even be allowed to allowed to get the money from the EU -- to get the approval from the EU and the U.S. to get the money? And would that be something that the EU and U.S. would consider in the future, if not?John L. PluegerThank you. This is John. I'll take that. We're not offering any commentary on that at this time. We continue to work closely on all matters related to Russia and our insurance recovery and any other possibilities. But beyond that, we're not commenting.Hillary CacanandoOkay. Got you. And then you talked about the strong demand in the sales environment. Historically, your sales margins have been about 7.5% to 8%. I guess in the current environment, would you say that your sales margin could actually now be higher than that?John L. PluegerGreg?Gregory B. WillisYes, I think historically, it's been between 8% and 10%. But with the sales that we've been seeing lately have been significantly higher. That again is due to the quality of the leases as well as the supply-demand imbalance for the airplanes themselves. So I think it's a very favorable environment right now. And a lot of lessors are looking to pick up additional products from us.Hillary CacanandoSo even higher than 10%, you would say?Gregory B. WillisYes.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.Unidentified AnalystThis is James on for Jamie and Mark. I guess following up with Helane's question, I want to ask on the risk management side. With the rising lease rate environment, are you guys being more aggressive in holding back more now to kind of keep more spot inventory? And how does that dynamic play out? Has that changed at all just given the macro backdrop?John L. PluegerSteve, do you want to take that?Steven F. Udvar-HazyYes. I mean, generally, we lease aircraft anywhere from 24 months out to as short as maybe 18 months. Some of our placements, where we have multiple aircraft going to the same airline, the lead time can be as much as 36 months. So what we're focused on now is to complete the placement of our 2024 deliveries in the next 3 to 5 months, but we are being more cautious on committing aircraft in 2025 until we see: a, what the interest rate trends are for the next 18 to 24 months. And if we continue to see lease rates rising, yes, we will hold back a certain percentage of our forward orders in the next 2 years to make them available for opportunistic placements. But keep in mind that on new aircraft, we generally have to nail down the specification and configuration anywhere from 12 to 15 months before delivery. So we can't just sit on these airplanes until the last minute, but we do have the ability to hold back on placing some of the longer lead time aircraft to capture the best possible lease economics.Unidentified AnalystGot it. For the new aircraft, but how about the rollover aircraft that are not being extended?Steven F. Udvar-HazyWell, right now, about 90% plus of our leases that have their normal contractual lease expirations are being extended by airlines. So we have very little coming off lease. And where they do come off, we have plenty of lead time to find the best possible follow-on transition less.Unidentified AnalystOkay. Got it. And then just shifting to delays, I guess just weighing the two between engine and aircraft, how much is engine driven? And -- I mean, I guess, from your prepared remarks, I would guess it's more aircraft. But in terms of the resolution to the engine situation, what -- how fast is that clearing up?Steven F. Udvar-HazyWell, the dilemma we have is that both Boeing and Airbus are increasing production rates on both their single and wide-body aircraft. But at the same time, the existing fleet that's out there and flying is requiring more spare engines because the longevity of these new technology engines has not been what we all expected. So the engine manufacturers are sort of caught between having to deliver more engines to Boeing and Airbus and yet they have their airline customers screaming at them to give them more spare support. So I would say of the delays as much as maybe 70%, 75% is engine related and the rest are either self-induced problems at the manufacturers not having enough staffing, not having enough resources, not having enough infrastructure suppliers that cannot keep pace with these increased delivery targets. So it's kind of a combination of self-inflicted wounds at Airbus and Boeing of ramping up too quickly after they cut back so much during the pandemic. We've got engine delivery delays. And we certainly have some aviation suppliers that are not able to keep up with demand and therefore, can't deliver the goods to Boeing and Airbus. It's a combination of all of those. And it's really different aircraft types.John L. PluegerYes. Let me add as an overall comment that I have to say, from the highest view possible, the bottom line is the airframe OEMs oversold compared to what they can deliver. And they knew full well going into selling all these aircraft, what kinds of reduction rate increases would be required. Yet at the same time, they booked those sales, and they put a production rate program in the face of known, well-known supplier challenges. So the bottom line is we don't accept supply chain as a delivery excuse. We expect to be compensated for our late deliveries, and we're working through our airframe OEMs just to get that and to continue to get that.OperatorThere are no further questions at this time. Mr. Arnold, I turn the call back over to you.Jason ArnoldOkay. Thank you, everyone, for your time participating in our first quarter call today. We look forward to speaking with you again when we report next quarter's results. Regina, thank you very much, and please disconnect the line.OperatorThis concludes today's conference call.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Francis.Francis deSouza: Thank you, Salli. Good afternoon, everyone. Illumina delivered revenue of approximately $1.09 billion and diluted non-GAAP EPS of $0.08 in Q1, both ahead of the guidance we provided at the beginning of the year but down year-over-year, as expected. Joydeep will take you through more detail later in the call. Our focus for the rest of the year is to deliver sequential growth primarily by scaling the production and distribution of NovaSeq X, driving elasticity on the back of its increased capabilities, and improving margins. We will share more on each. We achieved key product milestones in Q1, including shipping the first NovaSeq X systems. We also launched Illumina Complete Long Read technology and Illumina Connected Insights, a cloud-based tertiary analysis tool that addresses a key barrier to adoption, and will enable more labs to perform comprehensive genomic profiling for advanced tumors.Turning to our performance across platforms, beginning with high-throughput. The NovaSeq X launch further strengthened Illumina's competitive position in high-throughput sequencing. The strong global interest for the NovaSeq X series continued in Q1 and we exited the quarter with over 200 orders received from more than 30 countries. Clinical demand continued to be stronger than expected, generating approximately 40% of orders, with some customers planning to leverage the NovaSeq X to launch new clinical offerings. About 15% of orders are from new-to-high throughput customers, like the clinical genomics lab that is leveraging NovaSeq X's ease of use and cost benefits to perform high-throughput whole genome, single cell, and RNA sequencing. Our manufacturing capabilities for NovaSeq X instruments and consumables are scaling nicely.We shipped 67 NovaSeq X instruments in Q1, above initial expectations of 40 to 50, and now expect to deliver more than 330 NovaSeq X instruments this year, up from 300. Customers' initial runs are showing robust data output and sequencing quality, with some customers reporting outputs greater than 7 terabases and more than 95% of bases above Q30, well ahead of published specifications. As customers take delivery of their NovaSeq Xs and plan their deployments, they are sharing examples about how NovaSeq X will unlock demand elasticity in the sequencing market. Customers are planning to leverage the X's greater output and lower price per sample to sequence more samples, perform more analyses per sample, and obtain more data per analysis. For example, a leading European life science research institute will use NovaSeq X to scale up its data-intensive research programs, specifically in multi-omics, spatial, and single cell, enabling them to deliver ""atlas-scale"" projects.Within our clinical base, customers are using the greater output and cost savings of NovaSeq X to launch new, sequencing-intensive offerings. Some customers are planning to move from targeted panels to exomes and genomes, to achieve higher diagnostic yield and healthcare efficiency. An oncology customer is planning to use the X to launch liquid biopsy testing, which requires 12 to 15 times more sequencing than solid tumor testing. Some customers are using the cost and turnaround time benefits to enter deeper sequencing applications like minimal residual disease, or MRD, to build datasets at scale. We also saw continued demand for NovaSeq 6000, primarily for fleet expansions of existing workflows, and we shipped 17 NovaSeq 6000s in Q1. More than 80% of NovaSeq 6000 shipments were to clinical customers, and approximately 25% of shipments to oncology testing.In mid-throughput, NextSeq 1k/2k unit shipments increased 6% year-over-year, as customers expand their existing fleets, or continue to shift projects from the MiSeq and NextSeq 550. More than 20% of NextSeq 1k/2k units in Q1 were placed with new-to-Illumina customers. Our win rate in the mid-throughput segment remains strong, but we are seeing some sales cycles lengthen. Our low-throughput platforms continue to provide an entry point to sequencing. Approximately 30% of these shipments in the first quarter were to new-to-Illumina customers, further increasing our installed base and enabling adoption of sequencing across a broad customer network. Looking now at our clinical markets. Q1 marked an important milestone for Illumina, with clinical sequencing consumables revenue representing 50% of our total sequencing consumables revenue for the first time.In Q1, oncology testing consumables declined 3% year-over-year, but increased 21% sequentially, driven by growing clinical testing volumes and increased product development in areas like liquid biopsy and MRD. Some customers in this segment are facing pressures to improve profitability, which may in turn slow down their ability to develop new tests and scale. Revenue from our market-leading TruSight Oncology assay, TSO 500, was greater than $25 million in the quarter, up 26% year-over-year across more than 540 accounts, driven by increased utilization and pull-through, particularly in Europe. In March, we announced the expansion of our partnership with Myriad Genetics to broaden access to homologous recombination deficiency, or HRD, testing.HRD is an important biomarker identifying tumors with a specific type of DNA damage, like those in ovarian, breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancers. Our TSO 500 HRD, a research-use-only test, is now available in the US, with early customers like Florida Cancer Specialists &amp; Research Institute, one of the largest independent medical oncology and hematological practices in the United States. The expanded partnership also establishes a unique alliance to develop HRD as a companion diagnostic for novel agents targeting these tumors. There was significant progress for NGS-based oncology testing reimbursement this quarter in Europe, expanding the accessible market. Seven regions in Italy committed €10 million for next-generation sequencing in lung cancer.In Germany, health insurers commenced reimbursement for whole genome sequencing in pediatric cancer patients with relapse. And in the Czech Republic, funding for comprehensive genomic profiling was added to the national fee schedule, effective January 1st. Also in oncology, GRAIL saw accelerating demand in Q1 for its Galleri multi-cancer early detection blood test and delivered revenue of $20 million, exceeding plan, and representing 100% growth year-over-year. GRAIL non-GAAP operating expenses increased to $173 million, driven primarily by investments in clinical trials and scaling GRAIL's commercial organization. Since launch, GRAIL has received more than 85,000 Galleri test orders, with about 20,000 delivered in Q1 alone. The 140,000-participant NHS-Galleri trial, which completed enrollment in July 2022 in just over ten months, is progressing well, with more than half of study participants having returned for their second annual blood draw.The trial recently achieved its halfway point and is currently on track to meet retention targets. GRAIL continued to expand its partner relationships. Following a successful pilot last year, John Hancock, one of the largest life insurance companies in the US and a unit of Manulife, announced that it would expand access to Galleri to eligible life insurance customers. And Providence, a health system serving the Western US, expanded its partnership with GRAIL to offer Galleri to eligible individuals across its 52 hospitals and 900 clinics across seven states. In reproductive health, consumables shipments declined 4% year-over-year, primarily due to FX, but increased 14% sequentially due to continued coverage progress. In the US, Virginia and Michigan initiated state Medicaid coverage for NIPT in all pregnancies, adding about 4.3 million additional covered lives and more than 70,000 pregnancies per year.Genetic Disease Testing, or GDT, had a record quarter. In Q1, GDT consumables shipments grew 7% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. Coverage continues to grow for whole genome sequencing in patients with rare and undiagnosed genetic diseases. During the quarter, one of the largest US health insurance companies updated their policy to include Managed Medicaid lives in 16 states, adding another approximately 3.8 million covered lives for whole genome sequencing. Also in GDT, earlier this month we announced a partnership with Henry Ford Health, a health care organization in the Detroit metro area and a leading US academic medical center, to assess how whole-genome sequencing can improve cardiovascular disease management, with a particular interest in diverse and underserved populations.Turning to our Research and Applied markets, sequencing consumables shipments were down 19% year-over-year, primarily due to the slowdown in COVID surveillance. Looking at the whole year, we are on track to deliver on our financial commitments for 2023 as well as some important releases in the coming quarters. Specifically, we will ship the ICLR enrichment assay, an affordable, high throughput, targeted long-read solution, in Q3 and XLEAP-SBS chemistry on NextSeq 1k/2k in the first half of 2024, delivering step-change cost, speed, and sustainability benefits on that platform. Finally, as we navigate through this dynamic environment, we are focused on delivering durable success for our shareholders through a balance of investing in breakthrough innovations for future growth, while delivering operating leverage through disciplined expense management across the organization.To that end, we announced earlier today our commitment to deliver Core Illumina non-GAAP operating margins of 25% in 2024 and 27% in 2025, while maintaining investment in the key elements of our innovation roadmap. Building on the cost reduction actions announced last November, we are taking additional steps to reduce our annualized run rate expenses by more than $100 million beginning later in 2023. This will accelerate progress toward higher margins as well as free up capital to increase investment in high-growth areas. I'll now turn the call over to Joydeep to discuss additional details on our results and outlook, as well as provide more detail on the steps we are taking to deliver on the cost reduction I mentioned. Joydeep?Joydeep Goswami: Thank you, Francis. I'll start by reviewing our consolidated financial results, followed by segment results for Core Illumina and GRAIL, and then conclude with additional remarks on our current outlook for 2023. I will be discussing non-GAAP results, which include stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures which can be found in today's release and in supplementary data available on our website. In the first quarter, consolidated revenue was $1.09 billion, up 1% from the fourth quarter of 2022, exceeding the high end of our guidance range on stronger-than-expected shipments of NovaSeq X. Consolidated revenue was down 11% year-over-year, or down 9% on a constant currency basis, net of the effects of hedging.This was primarily driven by an expected year-over-year slowdown in COVID surveillance, COVID-related disruptions in China, the transition of some of our high-throughput customers to NovaSeq X, and customers managing constrained capital markets globally. Non-GAAP net income was $13 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, which included dilution from GRAIL's non-GAAP operating loss of $164 million for the quarter. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 27.3% for the quarter, which increased from 17.8% in Q1 2022, with both quarters reflecting the impact of R&amp;D capitalization requirements. Although the non-GAAP tax expense impact of R&amp;D capitalization requirements in dollar terms was the same in both periods, the impact to our effective tax rate in quarter one 2023 was more significant due to our lower earnings.Our non-GAAP weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was approximately 158 million. Moving to segment results: Core Illumina revenue of $1.08 billion was down 12% year-over-year, which included an anticipated headwind from COVID surveillance of approximately 400 basis points. COVID surveillance contributed approximately $11 million in total revenue in Q1 2023 compared to $60 million in Q1 2022, reflecting a $49 million headwind. On a constant currency basis, Core Illumina revenue was down 10%, net of the effects of hedging. Core Illumina sequencing consumables revenue of $692 million was up 1% sequentially, but down 12% year-over-year, which included an approximately 500 basis point headwind from COVID surveillance. In addition to the slowdown in COVID surveillance, the year-over-year decrease was primarily attributable to lower NovaSeq 6000 consumables pull-through due to the headwinds I mentioned earlier, COVID-related disruptions in China, the transition of some of our high-throughput customers to NovaSeq X, and customers managing constrained capital markets globally.Total sequencing activity on our connected high- and mid-throughput instruments grew 6% from Q4 2022 and 3% year-over-year. Research &amp; Applied grew 7% from Q4 2022 and declined 4% year-over-year. Clinical sequencing activity growth remained robust, up 7% from Q4 2022 and 15% year-over-year. As a reminder, we believe this data is a useful reference that shows the general activity trends across our installed base and is directionally correlated with revenue over time. Sequencing instruments revenue for Core Illumina of $154 million declined 27% year-over-year, including a 300 basis point headwind from COVID surveillance. As expected, the year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by lower NovaSeq 6000 shipments compared to a record Q1 2022, and a decrease in mid-throughput shipments due primarily to fewer NextSeq 550 placements in China.Stronger-than-expected shipments of NovaSeq X helped partially offset this impact, although we remain supply constrained in the first year of launch. We continued to see strong demand for NextSeq 1K/2K from new-to-Illumina customers. Core Illumina sequencing service and other revenue of $119 million was up 7% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher instrument service contract revenue on a growing installed base. Before moving to regional results for Core Illumina, I'd like to highlight that we've implemented a new global commercial structure to improve operating efficiencies and better align with local markets. We've integrated APJ with emerging markets across Middle East, Africa, Turkey, and CIS. Going forward, we will report regional results for the following regions: Americas, Europe, Greater China and AMEA, or Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa.Americas revenue of $605 million grew 5% sequentially from Q4 2022 and exceeded our expectations due to stronger-than-anticipated NovaSeq X shipments. Revenue for the region was down 6% year-over-year due to the expected decline in Research, driven by the slowdown in COVID surveillance and delayed recruitment for some large research projects. We continued to see strong demand for NextSeq 1k/2k in the Americas, with instrument shipments up over 20% year-over-year. Europe revenue of $261 million represented a 9% decrease year-over-year, or a 4% decrease on a constant currency basis, net of the effects of hedges. Growth in Clinical, led by oncology testing, was more than offset by the expected decline in COVID surveillance revenue as well as lower high-throughput instrument shipments due to supply constraints on NovaSeq X in the first quarter.Greater China revenue of $91 million represented a 28% decrease year-over-year, or a 23% decrease on a constant currency basis, net of the effect of hedges. The year-over-year decline was primarily driven by persistent COVID disruptions and liquidity and funding constraints at our customers. This resulted in lower sequencing consumables revenue and a decrease in mid-throughput instrument shipments compared to last year. We will continue to closely monitor and mitigate market headwinds in China through the rest of the year. Finally, AMEA revenue of $119 million declined 27% year-over-year, or 23% on a constant currency basis, net of the effects of hedges. As expected, the year-over-year decline was primarily caused by the completion of a large research project in Japan, lower COVID surveillance revenue and a decrease in NovaSeq 6000 instrument shipments, only partially offset by NovaSeq X shipments as demand in the region outpaced supply.AMEA revenue was also impacted by sanctions affecting our ability to conduct business in Russia. We expect the impact of sanctions to persist through 2023 and have reflected approximately $60 million in lower sequencing consumables revenue expectations for the region in our outlook for 2023. Moving to the rest of the Core Illumina P&amp;L: Core Illumina non-GAAP gross margin of 65.2% decreased 500 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by less fixed cost leverage on lower manufacturing volumes, and lower instrument margins due to the NovaSeq X launch, which is typical with a new platform introduction. We expect gross margins to improve sequentially through the year as we scale NovaSeq X manufacturing and continue to drive operating efficiencies.Easiest Md/PhD Programs to Get IntoCopyright: dolgachov / 123RF Stock PhotoCore Illumina non-GAAP operating expenses of $514 million were up $9 million year-over-year, primarily due to the full year impact of our headcount growth in 2022. Non-GAAP operating expenses were lower than expected as a result of cost containment initiatives. Transitioning to the financial results for GRAIL: GRAIL revenue of $20 million for the quarter grew 100% year-over-year, driven primarily by accelerating adoption of Galleri. As expected, GRAIL revenue decreased sequentially due to a milestone payment in Q4 2022 related to MRD pharma partnerships. GRAIL non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $173 million and increased $34 million year-over-year, driven primarily by continued investments in clinical trials and to scale GRAIL's commercial organization.Moving to consolidated cash flow and balance sheet items. Cash flow provided by operations was $10 million. First quarter 2023 capital expenditures were $52 million, and free cash flow was negative $42 million. We did not repurchase any common stock in the quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. During the first quarter, we used $500 million to repay the outstanding principal of our 2023 term notes that matured in March. Moving now to 2023 guidance. We still expect full year 2023 consolidated revenue to grow 7% to 10%, including Core Illumina revenue growth of 6% to 9%. As a reminder, these ranges include an anticipated headwind from COVID surveillance of approximately 200 basis points as well as a year-over-year headwind from foreign exchange rates.GRAIL revenue is still expected to be in the range of $90 million to $110 million for 2023. Our revenue outlook for 2023 now reflects the following offsetting factors: one, lower revenue in AMEA due to the impact of sanctions affecting our ability to conduct business in Russia; two, an increase in our NovaSeq X shipment expectations to more than 330 instruments; and three, higher contributions from our strategic partnerships related to drug discovery. As we have previously stated, we expect quarterly Core Illumina revenue to ramp sequentially throughout 2023, with linearity trends similar to 2017 when we launched the NovaSeq 6000, where we delivered approximately 54% of our total revenue in the second half of the year, including approximately 26% in Q3 and the remainder in Q4.Our revenue ramp for 2023 reflects the following assumptions: one, a quarterly ramp in NovaSeq X instrument shipments as the manufacturing capacity improves each quarter; two, sequencing consumables revenue increases as NovaSeq X customers kick off projects in the second half of 2023; and three, certain macroeconomic headwinds lessen in the second half of 2023, including a recovery from COVID disruptions in China. For fiscal 2023, at the midpoint of our revenue guidance: we now expect Core Illumina sequencing instrument revenue growth of approximately 13% year-over-year, reflecting our higher NovaSeq X shipment expectations; we now expect Core Illumina sequencing consumables revenue growth of approximately 5.5% year-over-year driven predominately by our lower revenue outlook for AMEA due to the impact of sanctions affecting our ability to conduct business in Russia; we continue to expect Core Illumina sequencing revenue to grow approximately 8% year-over-year.This now includes a higher contribution from sequencing service and other revenue primarily due to higher contributions from strategic pharma partnerships. We continue to expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.25 to $1.50 for 2023, including a consolidated non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 8% and Core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 22%. We are reaffirming all other financial guidance for fiscal 2023 that we provided on February 7, 2023. Moving to the second quarter of 2023. We expect consolidated revenue in the range of $1.15 billion to $1.17 billion for Q2 2023, reflecting a sequential increase of approximately 670 basis points from Q1 2023 at the midpoint or approximately $70 million, primarily driven by: a sequential increase in NovaSeq X instrument shipments as manufacturing capacity continues to ramp; continued sequential growth in sequencing consumables and service revenue as new instruments continue to come online; a sequential increase in GRAIL revenue driven by accelerating Galleri adoption; partially offset by a sequential decrease in microarrays revenue due to historical seasonality.For the second quarter, at the midpoint of our revenue guidance range, we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS of approximately $0.01, reflecting consolidated non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 1% and Core Illumina non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 17%. These margins reflect a sequential increase in Core Illumina operating expenses driven by an increase in compensation-related expense due to our typical annual equity grant and merit adjustment in March. We continue to expect operating margins to improve in the second half of 2023 as revenue ramps and we scale our production of NovaSeq X and leverage the fixed cost of the manufacturing base. Looking forward, we are committing to achieve Core Illumina non-GAAP operating margins of 25% in 2024 and 27% in 2025.Illumina will reduce its annualized run rate expenses by more than $100 million beginning later in 2023. These cost savings will accelerate progress toward higher margins as well as free up capital to increase investment in high-growth areas. Illumina will achieve these savings through a combination of several actions. We will leverage the recent modularization of R&amp;D innovation created as part of the NovaSeq X development, including XLEAP-SBS and new flow cell technology, to lower the cost and accelerate time to market for future platforms. We will achieve additional savings through leveraging our global footprint enabling activities at more cost-effective hubs. We are also streamlining our organization and processes, including rationalization of the company's global real estate portfolio and third-party vendor spend, as well as accelerating IT optimization efforts.The company will continue to prioritize innovations that generate highly differentiated products that are valued by Illumina's customers. I will now invite the operator to open the line for Q&amp;A.

Illumina has decreased the price of sequencing a human genome from $150,000 in 2007 to $200 in 2023 with the recently launched NovaSeqTM X and is expanding the addressable genomics market from $5 billion to $120 billion by 2027.Illumina is the only pure-play genomics company with profitable revenue growth. The company's strategy will continue driving long-term shareholder value through a balanced investment approach in breakthrough innovations for future growth and operating leverage through disciplined expense management. The company is committed to achieving Core Illumina non-GAAP operating margins of 25% in 2024 and 27% in 2025.In addition, Illumina committed to achieving more than $100 million in annualized run-rate cost savings beginning later in 2023 to accelerate margin improvement and create flexibility for further investment in high-growth areas.Story continuesIllumina has strengthened its position as the global leader in research and clinical genomics led by its world-class Board members. The company's thoughtful and disciplined nomination process ensures the composition of its Board has the right skill sets and experiences to advance the company's strategic goals for value creation. Carl Icahn's unqualified nominees cannot replace the unique collection of strengths and experiences that Illumina's current directors bring to the Board, and his nominees are potentially harmful to Illumina's core business.Illumina's Board of Directors requests shareholders to protect their investment and reject all three of Carl Icahn's nominees by voting the WHITE proxy card today FOR all nine of the company's highly qualified director nominees. The Annual Meeting will be held on May 25, 2023, at 10:00 am Pacific Time (1:00 pm Eastern Time). Shareholders of record as of close of business on April 3, 2023, are entitled to vote at the meeting.The Board does not endorse Carl Icahn or his unqualified nominees and believes the election of any such nominees would detract from Illumina's strong momentum. The full text of the letter follows:VOTE USING THE WHITE PROXY CARD TODAY IN SUPPORT OF ILLUMINA'S NINE HIGHLY QUALIFIED DIRECTORSMay 1, 2023Dear Shareholder,Our Board of Directors remains committed to delivering value to shareholders and executing our innovation roadmap. We thank you for your continued trust and investment at this crucial juncture.Over the last two and a half decades, Illumina has maintained leadership in research and clinical genomics. Illumina leads the Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) industry and is an important player and driver of innovation, as demonstrated by products like NovaSeqTM X, a revolutionary sequencer. We are the only pure-play genomics company with profitable revenue growth. Illumina has a proven strategy to penetrate markets and catalyze new opportunities Innovation has been key to our success over the last 25 years. Our continuous innovation has enabled new applications across multiple vectors, expanding the genomics diagnostic tools market and our leadership position.We have scaled profitable growth through a four-point playbook: 1) deliver breakthrough technology to win sequencing business, 2) deliver end-to-end services in large clinical markets, 3) accelerate clinical adoption, and 4) innovate to create new addressable markets. Our consistent application of this strategy reinforces and expands our global leadership position in genetic sequencing, keeping us at the forefront of genomics.We have dramatically increased the affordability, efficiency, and accuracy of genomic sequencing across the world with the launch of the NovaSeqTM X Series, our latest high-throughput instrument. We expect the launch of NovaSeqTM X, the execution of our strategic playbook, and our commitment to managing costs, will deliver long-term Core Illumina revenue growth in the mid-teens and non-GAAP operating profit growth in the high teens.We are proud of the advances we have made to maximize patient impact, empower genomic breakthroughs, and deliver significant value to shareholders.For Illumina to continue on this proven path to success, it is crucial that you vote this year for Illumina's nominees to the Board of Directors. We request our shareholders to use the WHITE proxy card to vote FOR only Illumina's nine highly qualified nominees. Your vote FOR our nominees using the WHITE card is critically important – no matter how many or how few shares you may own. As you may have heard, activist investor Carl Icahn has launched a self-serving and deliberately misleading campaign against our company, and we urge you to discard any gold proxy card you may have received from Icahn's group and only vote the WHITE proxy card.Strong NovaSeqTM X shipments exceeded expectations and drove solid first quarter results and Illumina commits to further reduce costs and accelerate expansion of operating marginsOn April 25, the company reported first quarter financial results for fiscal year 2023 that exceeded analysts' estimates. Our results showed particularly strong demand for NovaSeqTM X and sequential revenue growth. The company also announced a commitment to further reduce annualized run-rate expenses by more than $100 million beginning later in 2023. In addition, we committed to achieving Core Illumina non-GAAP operating margins of 25% in 2024 and 27% in 2025[2], while maintaining investment in the key elements of our innovation roadmap.We continue to see strong demand and expect Core Illumina revenue to ramp sequentially throughout 2023. For the 2023 fiscal year, we reiterated consolidated revenue guidance of 7% to 10% growth from 2022, including Core Illumina revenue growth of 6% to 9% and GRAIL revenue in the range of $90 million to $110 million.We are focused on delivering durable results through a balanced investment approach in breakthrough innovations for future growth, while delivering operating leverage through disciplined expense management across the organization.With regard to our more than $100 million annualized cost reduction commitment, we expect to realize these savings through a combination of several actions, including leveraging the recent modularization of R&amp;D innovation to lower the cost and accelerate time to market for future platforms, leveraging our global footprint to enable activities at more cost-effective hubs, accelerating IT optimization efforts, and streamlining our organization and processes.We expect these improvements to be durable and believe this commitment sets Illumina on the best path to deliver long-term sustainable success for our shareholders.Relative total shareholder return (rTSR) metric added to executive compensationIn order to strengthen the alignment of Illumina's executive compensation program with shareholder returns, the Board's Compensation Committee, after reviewing current market practices and in consultation with its independent compensation consultant, added a rTSR metric to a portion of the annual performance share units (PSUs) granted in 2023, which were awarded alongside grants of PSUs with an EPS metric as in prior years. This will ensure that Illumina executives continue to be motivated to drive strong financial performance while further aligning the compensation they receive with the returns received by our shareholders. To that end, Illumina's CEO's compensation is 96% at-risk and tied to performance. The Board and Compensation Committee will continue to evaluate the link between executive compensation and shareholder returns and whether additional changes are desirable in order to strengthen this link.GRAIL strategy GRAIL is a growth engine with unprecedented potential for Illumina, and it continues our strategy of platform-enhancing acquisitions that ultimately accelerate growth and deliver value for shareholders.GRAIL's Galleri™ test is the only commercially available multi-cancer early detection test on the market. It has enjoyed the fastest first-year revenue ramp in cancer screening history and has reached over 85,000 patients. The clinically validated technology unlocks an underpenetrated multi-cancer screening market worth more than $44 billion. GRAIL already has strong market traction, with $90 million to $110 million of expected annual 2023 revenue and 60-90% expected compounded annual revenue growth over the next five years. Importantly, GRAIL will save lives, and Illumina will accelerate that mission: Galleri™ is predicted to avert one in three cancer deaths within a five-year timeframe.Illumina can accelerate the commercialization of Galleri™ and drive efficiencies across GRAIL by supporting FDA approval and reimbursement, driving cost efficiencies through more effective and efficient R&amp;D operations, and extending geographic and commercial reach within Illumina's global footprint.Regulatory review process for GRAIL Illumina is moving as quickly as possible to work through the legal and regulatory processes associated with its acquisition of GRAIL. Both the U.S. FTC appeal and EU jurisdictional appeal are on similar timelines to a divestiture path and do not extend the time for its conclusion.On April 25, 2023, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted Illumina's request for an expedited review process, with briefing expected to be completed by July. Illumina now expects a decision in this appeal is likely in 2023, earlier than previously expected. Illumina expects a decision in the European Commission's (EC) jurisdictional appeal in late 2023 or early 2024.If Illumina does not prevail in either the U.S. FTC appeal or the EU jurisdictional appeal, the company expects to move quickly to divest GRAIL consistent with divesture order guidelines and in a manner that serves the best interests of Illumina's shareholders.Illumina is on the fastest path to maximize value and is committed to concluding the legal process of GRAIL by early 2024. It is important to note that this regulatory process is finite. Winning these appeals eliminates any EC fine and provides the greatest optionality for Illumina to maximize value in GRAIL, including enabling Illumina to conduct a divestiture if that is in the best interest of shareholders.2016 GRAIL spin-out from Illumina An inflammatory blog post, repeated by Icahn, incorrectly suggested that Illumina spun out and reacquired GRAIL in order to enrich Illumina's directors and executives. Icahn himself, however, admits ""We have no idea if the allegations are true.""The allegations are completely false.The facts are as follows:None of Illumina's directors involved in either the decision to sign or the decision to close the GRAIL acquisition – including our former CEO and Executive Chairman Jay Flatley, our current CEO Francis deSouza and each of Illumina's current directors – has ever held any equity interests in GRAIL.At the time of Illumina's various investment rounds in GRAIL, no individuals at Illumina were investors in GRAIL. Illumina's employees, executive officers and Board members were not permitted to participate in GRAIL investment rounds and did not otherwise receive any GRAIL equity.Illumina, Inc. was the founder of GRAIL and individuals employed by Illumina moved to GRAIL as part of the spin-out in 2016. Those who moved to GRAIL terminated their relationship with Illumina at the time of transition and directors and employees who remained at Illumina could not invest in GRAIL nor did they receive any GRAIL equity.No executive officers of Illumina held GRAIL shares at the signing or closing of the GRAIL acquisition, other than Alex Aravanis, who Illumina had hired from GRAIL, and Mostafa Ronaghi, Illumina's former CTO, who received GRAIL shares upon joining GRAIL's board in May 2020. The economic interests and relationships of these individuals with GRAIL were fully disclosed to, and known by, Illumina and its Board, and, consistent with good corporate governance practices, both were recused from any decisions to sign and close the GRAIL acquisition.Adding new independent directors to Illumina's BoardThe company is focused on ensuring that the Board has the right combination of skills, backgrounds, and experience to lead the company forward. To that end, the Board's Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee works with an executive search firm to continually assess new candidates who bring relevant skill sets and experiences to the Board based on the company's evolving strategic needs. As a result of a two-year assessment, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee expects to propose the addition of two new independent directors, including a sitting public company CEO and a sitting public company CFO, in the coming months.It is the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee's belief that the professional experiences of a CEO and a CFO of other public companies will be additive to the skills and experiences of the current Board and will help the Board exercise prudent, independent judgment, provide effective oversight to our operations, and assist in significant value creation.World-class Board and best-in-class governance practicesIn addition to the two prospective directors, Illumina's Board has been continually refreshed, with seven new directors appointed in the last seven years.Seven directors with technology and innovation experienceSeven directors with life sciences experienceFive directors with financial expertise~Six years average Board tenureOver 50% gender / underrepresented minority diversityIllumina's Board is led by an independent chair, John Thompson, and all nine members are independent, with the exception of the Chief Executive Officer, Francis deSouza. Our Board structure consists of four committees chaired by independent directors, which enables our Board to effectively oversee our operations. Members of the Board bring the highest personal character, integrity, and ethical standards, and reflect a range of professional backgrounds and skills relevant to Illumina's business.Carl Icahn seeks to replace Mr. deSouza, Robert Epstein, MD, and Mr. Thompson, with his unqualified nominees as directors at the 2023 Annual Meeting. Icahn's nominees, all of whom are current or former employees of Icahn, cannot replace the unique collection of strengths and experience that these three directors bring to the Board. Mr. Icahn said his nominees would report to him and act in his interests. ""My guys answer to me,"" said Mr. Icahn.Icahn's campaign is willfully misinforming, has no plan to create shareholder value, and his nominees are potentially harmful to our core business Carl Icahn has made many inflammatory statements and baseless claims in the last several weeks, but we are here to set the record straight. Quite simply, Carl Icahn and his unqualified nominees have:NO actionable plan to accelerate the divestment of GRAILNO intention or plan to improve Illumina's operationsIcahn and his nominees also lack an understanding of our business: Icahn has repeatedly noted that he has not developed an investment thesis, does not know how to run the business, and believes the business is well run. Furthermore, Icahn's reckless ""pull the plug"" on GRAIL strategy only guarantees to increase the risk of fines and a suboptimal divestiture process for all shareholders. We see this as willfully misinformed, because Icahn himself has said that he ""hasn't really studied it.""[3]Icahn's nominees bring NO additive skills, NO relevant industry experience, and NO independence from Icahn. Icahn's nominees' only unifying qualification appears to be their allegiance to Icahn – confirmed by Icahn and then directly by the nominees in our interviews with them.Illumina engaged with Icahn in good faith and attempted multiple times to reach a resolution that was amenable to both parties and in the best interest of all shareholders, including offering to appoint one of Icahn's nominees alongside an independent director known to Icahn. When Illumina did not accede to Icahn's demand that Illumina accept all three of his nominees as directors, he chose to launch a costly and distracting proxy contest. It appears that Icahn will do anything to get his way, whether or not it is the right thing for Illumina shareholders.Illumina's Board does not endorse Carl Icahn or his unqualified nominees and believes the election of any such nominees would detract from Illumina's strong momentum and deprive the Board of critical leadership and perspective required for the execution of the business. Illumina firmly believes that it has the right team and strategy in place to deliver long-term sustainable value for shareholders.PLEASE VOTE THE WHITE PROXY CARD TODAYYour Board recommends that you vote the WHITE proxy card FOR all NINE of Illumina's nominees.

INVESTORS AND SECURITY HOLDERS ARE URGED TO READ THE PROXY STATEMENT (INCLUDING ANY AMENDMENTS OR SUPPLEMENTS THERETO) FILED BY ILLUMINA AND ANY OTHER RELEVANT DOCUMENTS FILED WITH THE SEC CAREFULLY AND IN THEIR ENTIRETY BECAUSE THEY CONTAIN OR WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ANY SOLICITATION.

Copies of the documents filed by Illumina are also available free of charge by accessing Illumina's website at www.illumina.com.Statement regarding use of non–GAAP financial measuresThe company only provides non–GAAP measures for operating margin targets because of the difficulty of projecting with reasonable certainty the financial impact of specific GAAP operating adjustments, such as acquisition–related expenses, gains and losses from our strategic investments, fair value adjustments related to contingent consideration and contingent value rights, potential future asset impairments, restructuring activities, and the ultimate outcome of pending litigation without unreasonable effort. These items are uncertain, inherently difficult to predict, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on GAAP measures for the operating margin target periods. For the same reasons, the company is unable to address the significance of the unavailable information, which could be material to future results.ParticipantsIllumina, its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees will be participants in the solicitation of proxies with respect to a solicitation by Illumina.

(NYSE:PWR) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:""We initiated a position in Quanta Services, Inc. (NYSE:PWR) during the quarter. Quanta is a leading specialized contracting services company for the utility, energy, and communications industries. We think the company is well positioned to benefit from the substantial investment that will be required to build out both the existing electric grid and renewable energy production capacity to meet the country’s clean energy goals.Investment in the electric grid is necessary not only to upgrade aging infrastructure and increase its reliability but also to connect it to sources of renewable energy. The nature of the electric grid is changing. It will increasingly be expected to meet the needs of a diverse energy landscape, as more intermittent renewable energy resources are added and more distributed energy resources, like rooftop solar, are connected. In particular, we believe that widespread adoption of electric vehicles will require substantial investment in the distribution grid. This is because the ensuing load requirements are well in excess of what the existing infrastructure can support, leading to necessary upgrades. The Inflation Reduction Act should accelerate these trends and give more than a decade of visibility into grid related investments. We believe these drivers create a robust backdrop for Quanta’s business…” (Click here to read the full text)Story continuesazerbaijan, baku, business, crane, dawn, derricks, drilling, energy, engineering, equipment, evening, exploration, fuel, gas, gasoline, industrial, industry, installation, land, machinery, offshore, oil, petrol, petroleum, platform, power, production, pumps, rig, sea, shallow, ship, silhouette, sky, technology, tool, tug, vessel, water, wellCopyright: Elnur / 123RF Stock PhotoQuanta Services, Inc.

The completion of hot functional testing marks a significant step towards operations and providing customers with a reliable, carbon-free energy source for the next 60 to 80 years. Unit 4 is projected to enter service in late fourth quarter 2023 or the first quarter 2024.Georgia Power logo. (PRNewsFoto/Georgia Power) (PRNewsfoto/Georgia Power)""The energy and enthusiasm at the Vogtle site, and across our entire company, is high with Unit 3 in the final stages of startup testing and Unit 4 making progress towards safely loading fuel,"" said Kim Greene, chairman, president and CEO of Georgia Power. ""The team at Unit 4 has been able to take lessons learned from Unit 3 and apply them. That has allowed us to safely complete hot functional testing on Unit 4 in significantly less time than we did for Unit 3. It's incredible that these new units will provide our state with zero-emissions energy for the next 60 to 80 years, and that's thanks to the dedication of the teams at the site to getting these units built, and built right.""During hot functional testing, plant systems achieved normal operating pressure and temperature, without nuclear fuel in the reactor, to demonstrate the systems will operate on an integrated basis as designed. Now, the site team focuses on completing the remaining work necessary to submit documentation to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) that all inspection, tests and analyses have been performed and all acceptance criteria, collectively known as ITAACS, have been met on Vogtle Unit 4 as required by Southern Nuclear's Combined Operating License. Each ITAAC closure notice must be verified by the NRC before fuel can be loaded into the reactor.The new Vogtle units are an essential part of Georgia Power's commitment to delivering clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to its 2.7 million customers. Once operating, the two new units, which will be clean energy sources that produce zero emissions, are expected to power more than 500,000 homes and businesses. Southern Nuclear will operate the new units on behalf of the co-owners: Georgia Power, Oglethorpe Power, MEAG Power and Dalton Utilities.Story continuesAbout Georgia PowerGeorgia Power is the largest electric subsidiary of Southern Company (NYSE: SO), America's premier energy company.

247,d2e35559-e3fd-3336-a33b-679af9fc4367,SWKS,2023-05-02,Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Can the Stock Move Higher?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/skyworks-solutions-swks-expected-beat-140102846.html,1682949662,STORY,"['SWKS', 'QRVO']","[Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 8. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis chipmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.01 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -23.6%.Revenues are expected to be $1.15 billion, down 14% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.05% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Skyworks?For Skyworks, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.45%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Skyworks will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Skyworks would post earnings of $2.59 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.59, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Skyworks appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Semiconductors - Radio Frequency industry, Qorvo (QRVO), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.12 per share for the quarter ended March 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -96.2%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $621.27 million, down 46.7% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Qorvo has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.70%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Qorvo will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(Photo Credit: U.S. Army)HUNTSVILLE, Ala., May 01, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Northrop Grumman Corporation’s (NYSE: NOC) Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS) has achieved initial operational capability from the U.S. Army. With this declaration, the system is now ready to be fielded to U.S. Army units to further support the development of the system’s capabilities.IBCS is the cornerstone of the Army’s air and missile defense modernization strategy, replacing the multiple current air and missile defense command and control systems with a single system. The system has completed rigorous and demanding Initial Operational Test and Evaluation and numerous successful development and operational flight tests. During these demanding assessments, IBCS demonstrated its ability to deliver decision-quality fire control data across joint networks, increasing situational awareness and time for decision making.“IBCS has the leading role in the Army’s air and missile defense modernization strategy because its ability to integrate multi-domain sensors to create fire quality fused data enables the warfighter to quickly decide on the best shooter to defend against incoming threats,” said Rebecca Torzone, vice president and general manager, combat systems and mission readiness, Northrop Grumman. “With its mature, proven and ready capabilities, IBCS transforms and extends the battlespace for the U.S. and its allies.”This groundbreaking step toward putting multi-domain capabilities in the hands of the warfighter comes on the heels of the program’s recent approval for Full Rate Production. These milestones are the result of the successful completion of critical testing, and development of logistics, support and training. To date, IBCS has integrated, or demonstrated integration on numerous sensors and shooters from all U.S. service branches and allies. IBCS can quickly integrate additional systems given its open architecture – enabling the U.S. and its allies to move beyond interoperability to achieve the high level of multi-domain integration required today and in the future.Story continuesIBCS implements a modular, open and scalable architecture that integrates available assets in the battlespace onto a common, integrated fire control network, regardless of source, service or domain. Its architecture enables the efficient and affordable integration of current and future systems and extends the battlespace by disaggregating sensors and effectors. By enabling this high level of network integration, the warfighter is given unprecedented time to make accurate decisions. Through numerous successful developments, operational tests and demonstrations, IBCS has proven its capability to connect and fuse multi-service sensor data to multi-service weapons, demonstrating the Army’s contribution to Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) capabilities.Northrop Grumman is a leading global aerospace and defense technology company.

The vaccine brought in $3 billion in the first three months of this year compared to more than $13 billion in last year's first quarter, when virus cases were soaring.Both analysts and Pfizer have predicted that drop as the drugmaker shifts this year from supplying governments through big contracts to selling the vaccine on the commercial market.The company said Tuesday that it also expects significantly lower sales from its vaccine and COVID-19 treatment, Paxlovid, in the second quarter compared to the first. But commercial sales are expected to kick in later this year, after leftover government inventory is absorbed.Plus Pfizer also expects a revenue boost later this year from new product launches and fall vaccinations.Both the vaccine and treatment have generated billions in revenue for Pfizer over the last several quarters and have easily become the drugmaker's top sellers. But Pfizer also produces other vaccines and is expanding its cancer treatments.Sales grew 4% to $1.6 billion in the first quarter from Pfizer’s Prevnar vaccines for preventing pneumonia and related bacterial diseases. Sales of Eliquis, which is used to prevent blood clots and strokes, also grew 5% to $1.87 billion.The drugmaker's research and development costs also climbed 9% in the quarter, as Pfizer prepared for some upcoming product debuts. The company expects to launch several products in the year’s second half, including a vaccine for the respiratory illness known as RSV.Overall, Pfizer's net income sank 30% to $5.54 billion in the quarter on $18.28 billion in revenue. Adjusted earnings totaled $1.23 per share.Analysts expected earnings of 98 cents per share on $16.61 billion in sales, according to FactSet.Story continuesPfizer also reaffirmed on Tuesday its forecast for full-year earnings to range between $3.25 and $3.45 per share. That forecast initially fell short of Wall Street expectations when Pfizer released it in January.FactSet says analysts now expect earnings of $3.39 per share.Pfizer said in March that it would spend about $43 billion to buy biotech drug developer Seagen, which specializes in developing cancer treatments. Company officials said Tuesday that deal remains on track to close either by the end of this year or in early 2024.Shares of New York-based Pfizer Inc. fell 49 cents to $38.72 Tuesday afternoon while broader indexes also dropped.___ Follow Tom Murphy on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thpmurphy]"

But sales of both its vaccine and oral antiviral treatment came in above Wall Street estimates.Pfizer still expects significantly lower sales of COVID products in the second quarter.Wells Fargo analyst Mohit Bansal said it was a positive surprise that Pfizer did not lower its full-year COVID forecast.Pfizer is pumping billions of dollars into research and acquisitions to mitigate an anticipated $17 billion hit to revenue by 2030 from patent expirations for top drugs, and a decline in demand for COVID products.The company said it would become more balanced with allocating capital after a string of deals in the last two years once its recent $43 billion buyout of Seagen closes.Graphic: Pfizer's recent string of deals Pfizer's recent string of deals - https://www.reuters.com/graphics/PFIZER-RESULTS/akpeqjaqbpr/chart.pngPfizer said it remains on track to achieve its goal of 7% to 9% non-COVID revenue growth this year, driven by newer drugs.""Given that a large number of launches are expected to occur in the third- and fourth-quarters of 2023, we anticipate that our non-COVID revenues will grow more quickly in the back half of the year,"" Chief Financial Officer David Denton said on a call with analysts.Citi analyst Andrew Baum said Pfizer's non-COVID revenue missed expectations for the quarter.The company is preparing to launch an RSV vaccine, an ulcerative colitis treatment and a hair loss drug by the end of this year, pending U.S. approval.COVID-19 vaccine sales plunged 77% to $3.06 billion in the quarter, but topped diminished estimates of $2.37 billion, according to Refinitiv data.Story continuesSales of antiviral Paxlovid nearly tripled to $4.07 billion, bolstered by demand in China. Analysts' had estimated $3.13 billion for the quarter.Pfizer expects a 2023 profit of $3.25 to $3.45 per share and COVID products sales of about $21.5 billion.Overall revenue for the first quarter fell 29% to $18.3 billion, but topped estimates of $16.59 billion.Excluding items, the U.S. drugmaker's profit of $1.23 per share topped Wall Street estimates by 25 cents.Pfizer shares were down 0.9% - less than the broader market - at $38.84.(Reporting by Bhanvi Satija and Raghav Mahobe in Bengaluru and Michael Erman in New York; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila and Bill Berkrot)]"

(NYSE: PFE) reported financial results for the first quarter of 2023 and reaffirmed full-year 2023 financial guidance.The first-quarter 2023 earnings presentation and accompanying prepared remarks from management as well as the quarterly update to Pfizer’s R&amp;D pipeline can be found at www.pfizer.com.EXECUTIVE COMMENTARYDr. Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated: ""This is an exciting time for Pfizer as we are already executing on and rigorously planning for an unprecedented number of anticipated new product and indication launches, most of which are expected to occur in the second half of 2023. We have made excellent progress toward this goal already this year with the U.S. approvals for Zavzpret, Cibinqo for adolescents and Prevnar 20 in pediatric patients, and regulatory filing acceptances for a Braftovi + Mektovi sNDA, sNDA for the Talzenna and Xtandi combination, elranatamab BLA and our RSV maternal vaccine candidate — which, if approved, would be the first vaccine for administration to pregnant individuals to help protect against the complications of RSV disease in infants from birth up to six months of age.Story continuesDuring the first quarter, we announced plans to advance the battle against cancer with a definitive agreement to acquire Seagen, a global biotechnology company that discovers, develops and commercializes transformative oncology medicines. By combining Seagen’s category-leading antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) technology with Pfizer’s scale, expertise and capabilities, we believe we can accelerate breakthroughs in cancer medicines and introduce new solutions to patients around the world. Oncology remains a core therapeutic area for Pfizer, and we believe the proposed acquisition will enhance our position in this important space.We believe the strength of our in-line products and expected near-term launches and revenue contribution from business development activities, including the proposed acquisition of Seagen, will position Pfizer to deliver robust operational growth through 2025 and beyond.""David Denton, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, stated: ""Our first-quarter results were in line with our expectations, underlining our continued confidence in achieving 7% to 9% operational revenue growth for fiscal-year 2023, excluding our COVID-19 products and anticipated foreign exchange impacts. We expect the majority of this growth to occur in the second half of 2023, given the timing of our expected near-term launches. Integration planning for our proposed acquisition of Seagen is underway, and we continue to expect the transaction to close in late 2023 or early 2024, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. As we de-lever our capital structure after the close, we expect our strong balance sheet will continue to provide the flexibility for future dividend increases and share repurchase activity, as well as additional business development activity.""Results for the first quarter of 2023 and 2022(5) are summarized below.OVERALL RESULTS($ in millions, exceptper share amounts)First-Quarter20232022ChangeRevenues$ 18,282$ 25,661(29%)Reported Net Income(2)5,5437,864(30%)Reported Diluted EPS(2)0.971.37(29%)Adjusted(3) Income7,0369,338(25%)Adjusted(3) Diluted EPS1.231.62(24%)REVENUES($ in millions)First-Quarter20232022% ChangeTotalOper.Global Biopharmaceuticals Business (Biopharma)(6)$ 17,971$ 25,323(29%)(26%)Primary Care(6)11,50518,851(39%)(37%)Specialty Care(6)3,6123,5053%8%Oncology(6)2,8552,967(4%)(1%)Business Innovation$ 310$ 338(8%)(5%)TOTAL REVENUES$ 18,282$ 25,661(29%)(26%)Beginning in the third quarter of 2022, Pfizer made several organizational changes to further transform its operations to better leverage its expertise in certain areas and in anticipation of potential future new product and indication launches. These changes included establishing a new commercial structure within Biopharma focused on three broad customer groups (primary care, specialty care and oncology)(6), optimizing Pfizer’s end-to-end R&amp;D operations and further prioritizing its internal R&amp;D portfolio, as well as realigning certain enabling and platform functions across the organization to ensure alignment with this new operating structure.In addition, in the first quarter of 2023, Pfizer established an operating segment named Business Innovation that includes Pfizer CentreOne (PC1), the company’s global contract development and manufacturing organization and a leading supplier of specialty active pharmaceutical ingredients; and Pfizer Ignite, a recently launched offering that provides strategic guidance and end-to-end R&amp;D services to select innovative biotech companies that align with Pfizer’s R&amp;D focus areas.Prior period amounts have been revised to conform to the current period presentation for all changes discussed above.Some amounts in this press release may not add due to rounding. All percentages have been calculated using unrounded amounts. References to operational variances pertain to period-over-period changes that exclude the impact of foreign exchange rates(7).CAPITAL ALLOCATIONDuring the first three months of 2023, Pfizer deployed its capital in a variety of ways, which primarily include the following two categories:Reinvesting capital into initiatives intended to enhance the future growth prospects of the company, including $2.5 billion invested in internal research and development projects, andReturning capital directly to shareholders through $2.3 billion of cash dividends, or $0.41 per share of common stock.No share repurchases have been completed to date in 2023. As of May 2, 2023, Pfizer’s remaining share repurchase authorization is $3.3 billion. Current financial guidance does not anticipate any share repurchases in 2023.First-quarter 2023 diluted weighted-average shares outstanding used to calculate Reported(2) and Adjusted(3) diluted EPS were 5,727 million shares, a decrease of 31 million shares compared to the prior-year quarter, primarily due to shares repurchased in the first quarter of 2022, partially offset by shares issued for employee compensation programs.2023 FINANCIAL GUIDANCE(4)Pfizer reaffirms all components of its full-year 2023 financial guidance, which is presented below. This guidance includes management’s expectations for contributions from the entire company, including Comirnaty(1) and Paxlovid.2023 Financial GuidanceRevenues*$67.0 to $71.0 billionOperational(7) Growth/(Decline) vs. Prior Year(33%) to (29%)Growth/(Decline) vs. Prior Year(33%) to (29%)Adjusted(3) Diluted EPS*$3.25 to $3.45Operational(7) Growth/(Decline) vs. Prior Year(50%) to (47%)Growth/(Decline) vs. Prior Year(51%) to (48%)*Changes in foreign exchange rates have had a minimal incremental impact since full-year 2023 guidance was issued. Please refer to Press Release Footnote (4) for additional information.The midpoint of the guidance range for revenues reflects a 31% operational decrease compared to 2022 revenues. Company revenues are anticipated to be lower in 2023 than in 2022 due entirely to expected revenue declines for Pfizer’s COVID-19 products.Excluding COVID-19 products, the Company continues to expect 7% to 9% operational revenue growth in 2023.Revenue guidance for Pfizer’s COVID-19 products is as follows:Comirnaty(1) revenues of approximately $13.5 billion, down 64% from 2022 results.Paxlovid revenues of approximately $8 billion, down 58% from 2022 results.In contrast to previous years, guidance for both products is no longer based primarily on expected deliveries under existing signed or committed supply contracts, but now also includes, among other things, anticipated sales through traditional commercial markets in the U.S. in the second half of 2023.The midpoint of the guidance range for Adjusted(3) diluted EPS reflects a 49% operational decrease compared to 2022, primarily driven by anticipated lower revenues from COVID-19 products, higher spending to support anticipated near-term launches and greater investment in certain late-stage pipeline projects.Financial guidance for Adjusted(3) diluted EPS is calculated using approximately 5.75 billion weighted average shares outstanding, and assumes no share repurchases in 2023.Other components of Pfizer’s 2023 financial guidance are presented below.Adjusted(3) Cost of Sales as a Percentage of Revenues28.0% to 30.0%Adjusted(3) SI&amp;A Expenses$13.8 to $14.8 billionAdjusted(3) R&amp;D Expenses$12.4 to $13.4 billionAcquired IPR&amp;D Expenses(4)Approximately $0.1 billionAdjusted(3) Other (Income)/DeductionsApproximately $1.5 billion of incomeEffective Tax Rate on Adjusted(3) IncomeApproximately 15.0%Pfizer’s 2023 financial guidance is based on estimates and assumptions that are subject to significant uncertainties, particularly with regard to the anticipated performance of Comirnaty(1) and Paxlovid. See the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook — The Global Economic Environment section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Pfizer’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Pfizer’s fourth-quarter 2022 earnings press release (available at www.pfizer.com) for additional information.QUARTERLY FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (First-Quarter 2023 vs. First-Quarter 2022)First-quarter 2023 revenues totaled $18.3 billion, a decrease of $7.4 billion, or 29%, compared to the prior-year quarter, reflecting an operational decline of $6.6 billion, or 26%, primarily due to a decrease in Comirnaty(1) revenues globally, as well as an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $730 million, or 3%. First-quarter 2023 revenues from Comirnaty(1) and Paxlovid were $7.1 billion. Excluding contributions from Comirnaty(1) and Paxlovid, company revenues grew $563 million, or 5%, operationally.Compared to the prior-year quarter, first-quarter 2023 revenue growth was unfavorably impacted by approximately 1% as a result of having one fewer selling day in international markets. This unfavorable impact is expected to reverse in the fourth quarter of 2023.First-quarter 2023 Comirnaty(1) revenues declined $10 billion, or 75%, operationally compared with the prior-year quarter, largely driven by lower contracted deliveries and demand in international markets, as well as lower U.S. government contracted deliveries with anticipated transition to traditional commercial market sales in the second half of 2023.First-quarter Paxlovid revenues increased $2.8 billion compared with the prior-year quarter, primarily driven by favorable timing of final delivery associated with the U.S. government contract before anticipated transition to traditional commercial markets in the second half of 2023; strong demand in China due to increased COVID-19 infections; and launch in certain international markets.Excluding contributions from Comirnaty(1) and Paxlovid, first-quarter 2023 operational growth was primarily driven by:Recently acquired products, Nurtec ODT/Vydura and Oxbryta, which contributed $167 million and $71 million in global revenues, respectively;Sulperazon internationally, up 64% operationally, largely driven by demand in China, which is not expected to be sustained;Eliquis globally, up 7% operationally, driven primarily by continued oral anti-coagulant adoption and market share gains in the non-valvular atrial fibrillation indication in the U.S. and certain markets in Europe, partially offset by declines due to loss of exclusivity and generic competition in certain international markets; andVyndaqel family (Vyndaqel, Vyndamax, Vynmac) globally, up 16% operationally, largely driven by continued strong uptake of the transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) indication, primarily in the U.S. and developed Europe, partially offset by a planned price decrease that went into effect in Japan in the second quarter of 2022,partially offset primarily by lower revenues for:Xeljanz globally, down 33% operationally, driven primarily by lower net price in the U.S. due to unfavorable changes in channel mix, as well as decreased prescription volumes worldwide resulting from ongoing shifts in prescribing patterns related to label changes.GAAP Reported(2) Income Statement HighlightsSELECTED REPORTED COSTS AND EXPENSES(2)($ in millions)First-Quarter20232022% ChangeTotalOper.Cost of Sales(2)$ 4,886$ 9,984(51%)(50%)Percent of Revenues26.7%38.9%N/AN/ASI&amp;A Expenses(2)3,4182,59332%35%R&amp;D Expenses(2)2,5052,3019%10%Acquired IPR&amp;D Expenses(2)21355(94%)(94%)Other (Income)/Deductions––net(2)70350(80%)(71%)Effective Tax Rate on Reported Income(2)11.4%12.9%First-quarter 2023 Cost of Sales(2) as a percentage of revenues decreased by 12.2 percentage points compared with the prior-year quarter, primarily driven by changes in sales mix, including lower sales of Comirnaty(1) and higher sales of Paxlovid.First-quarter 2023 SI&amp;A Expenses(2) increased 35% operationally compared with the prior-year quarter, primarily reflecting increased investments to support Paxlovid, recently acquired and launched products, and products across multiple customer groups.First-quarter 2023 R&amp;D Expenses(2) increased 10% operationally compared with the prior-year quarter, primarily driven by increased investments to develop recently acquired assets and certain vaccine programs, as well as activities to support upcoming product launches, partially offset by lower spending on programs to prevent and treat COVID-19 and certain other late-stage clinical programs.First-quarter 2023 acquired IPR&amp;D Expenses(2) decreased 94% operationally compared to the prior-year quarter, primarily driven by the non-recurrence of an upfront payment to Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Company Ltd. (Biohaven) and a premium paid on Pfizer’s equity investment in Biohaven, as well as a premium paid on Pfizer’s equity investment in BioNTech SE (BioNTech) to develop a potential mRNA vaccine against shingles — both recorded in the first quarter of 2022.Other deductions––net(2) decreased 71% operationally in the first quarter of 2023 compared with the first quarter of 2022, primarily driven by lower net losses on equity securities, higher dividend income and lower net interest expense, partially offset by asset impairment charges in the first quarter of 2023, and lower net periodic benefit credits associated with pension and postretirement plans.Pfizer’s effective tax rate on Reported income(2) for the first quarter of 2023 decreased compared to the prior-year quarter primarily due to a favorable change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings.Adjusted(3) Income Statement HighlightsSELECTED ADJUSTED(3) COSTS AND EXPENSES($ in millions)First-Quarter20232022% ChangeTotalOper.Adjusted(3) Cost of Sales$ 4,746$ 9,958(52%)(51%)Percent of Revenues26.0%38.8%N/AN/AAdjusted(3) SI&amp;A Expenses3,3502,49634%37%Adjusted(3) R&amp;D Expenses2,4912,2959%10%Adjusted(3) Other (Income)/Deductions––net(528)(406)30%23%Effective Tax Rate on Adjusted(3) Income14.0%14.8%Reconciliations of certain Reported(2) to non-GAAP Adjusted(3) financial measures and associated footnotes can be found in the financial tables section of the press release located at the hyperlink below.RECENT NOTABLE DEVELOPMENTS (Since January 31, 2023)Product DevelopmentsBraftovi (encorafenib) and Mektovi (binimetinib) – In April 2023, Pfizer announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted for review the supplemental New Drug Applications (sNDAs) for Braftovi + Mektovi for patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a BRAF V600E mutation, as detected by an FDA-approved test. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date for a decision by the FDA is in the fourth quarter of 2023 for the sNDAs.Cibinqo (abrocitinib) – In February 2023, Pfizer announced the FDA approved an sNDA for Cibinqo, expanding its indication to include adolescents (12 to &lt;18 years) with refractory, moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis whose disease is not adequately controlled with other systemic drug products, including biologics, or when use of those therapies is inadvisable. Cibinqo was previously approved in the U.S. only for the treatment of adults 18 years and older.Comirnaty (COVID-19 vaccine, mRNA)(8)Regulatory DevelopmentsIn April 2023, the FDA amended the emergency use authorization (EUA) of the Pfizer-BioNTech Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccine to simplify the vaccination schedule for most individuals. This action included authorizing the bivalent vaccine to be used for all doses administered to individuals six months of age and older, including for an additional dose or doses for certain populations such as older adults and the immunocompromised. The monovalent Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is no longer authorized for emergency use in the U.S.In March 2023, Pfizer and BioNTech announced the FDA granted EUA to provide a single 3-µg booster dose of the companies’ Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccine in children six months through four years of age (also referred to as under five years of age) at least two months after completion of primary vaccination with three doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine [Original]. Simultaneously, the FDA authorized the bivalent vaccine in this age group as the third dose of a three-dose primary series. The companies have submitted an application to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to extend the Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent vaccine’s marketing authorization (MA) to include use in children six months through four years of age as both primary series (all three doses) and booster vaccination (fourth dose).In February 2023, Pfizer and BioNTech announced the submission of a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) to the FDA for approval of the companies’ Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent (Original and Omicron BA.4/BA.5)) as a primary series and booster dose(s) for individuals 12 years of age and older. The companies have also submitted an application to the EMA for a variation of the MA to include the bivalent vaccine as a primary course of vaccination in individuals five years of age and older. In the European Union, the bivalent vaccine was previously granted full MA for administration as a booster dose in individuals five years of age and older.Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir [PF-07321332] tablets and ritonavir tablets)(8) – In March 2023, Pfizer announced the FDA’s Antimicrobial Drugs Advisory Committee (AMDAC) voted that available data support the safety and effectiveness of Paxlovid for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adult patients who are at high risk for progression to severe illness. The AMDAC's vote, while not binding, will be considered by the FDA when making its decision regarding the potential approval of Paxlovid. If approved by the FDA, Paxlovid could be the first U.S. FDA-approved oral treatment for COVID-19. The target PDUFA action date for a decision by the FDA is in May 2023.Prevnar 20 (20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine) – In April 2023, Pfizer announced the FDA approved Prevnar 20 (20-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine) for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) caused by the 20 Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcal) serotypes contained in the vaccine in infants and children six weeks through 17 years of age, and for the prevention of otitis media in infants six weeks through five years of age caused by the original seven serotypes contained in Prevnar. Prevnar 20 offers the broadest serotype coverage of any pediatric pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, helping to protect against all 20 serotypes contained in the vaccine.Talzenna (talazoparib) – In February 2023, Pfizer announced positive results from the Phase 3 TALAPRO-2 study of Talzenna, an oral poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, in combination with Xtandi (enzalutamide), demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) compared to placebo plus Xtandi in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), with or without homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene mutations. Additionally, the FDA granted priority review for Pfizer’s sNDA for Talzenna in combination with Xtandi for the treatment of men with mCRPC. The FDA’s decision on the sNDA is expected in 2023. In addition, the marketing authorization application (MAA) for this same indication has also been accepted for review by the EMA.Xtandi (enzalutamide) – In April 2023, Astellas Pharma and Pfizer announced that Xtandi plus leuprolide significantly reduced the risk of metastasis or death by 58% versus placebo plus leuprolide, as assessed by the primary endpoint of metastasis-free survival (MFS), in men with non-metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (nmHSPC; also known as non-metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer or nmCSPC) with high-risk biochemical recurrence (BCR). These data from the Phase 3 EMBARK trial were presented as a plenary session during the 2023 American Urological Association Annual Meeting, and detailed results from the trial will be submitted for peer-reviewed publication. Additionally, the EMBARK data will be discussed with regulatory authorities, including the FDA, to support a potential regulatory submission for Xtandi in this indication in 2023.Zavzpret (zavegepant) – In March 2023, Pfizer announced the FDA approved Zavzpret, the first and only calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist nasal spray for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. In the pivotal Phase 3 study, published in The Lancet Neurology, Zavzpret was statistically superior to placebo on the co-primary endpoints of pain freedom and freedom from most bothersome symptom at two hours post-dose. The pivotal study also demonstrated pain relief as early as 15 minutes in a prespecified secondary endpoint versus placebo. In clinical trials, Zavzpret was well tolerated. Zavzpret is anticipated to be available in pharmacies in July 2023.Pipeline DevelopmentsA comprehensive update of Pfizer’s development pipeline was published today and is now available at www.pfizer.com/science/drug-product-pipeline. It includes an overview of Pfizer’s research and a list of compounds in development with targeted indication and phase of development, as well as mechanism of action for some candidates in Phase 1 and all candidates from Phase 2 through registration.Elranatamab (PF-06863135) – In February 2023, Pfizer announced the FDA granted priority review for the company’s Biologics License Application (BLA) for elranatamab, an investigational B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) CD3-targeted bispecific antibody (BsAb), for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). The FDA’s decision on the application is expected in 2023. The EMA also accepted elranatamab’s MAA.RSVpreF (Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Bivalent Vaccine Candidate)Pfizer today reports positive top-line results from the Phase 3 study evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of its RSV bivalent vaccine candidate, PF-06928316 or RSVpreF, coadministered with seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine (SIIV) in adults 65 years and older. The study met its primary endpoint, demonstrating non-inferiority for all four flu strains and both RSV groups. These results show that RSVpreF, if approved, can be administered concomitantly with SIIV.In February 2023, Pfizer announced the FDA accepted for priority review a BLA for its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine candidate, PF-06928316 or RSVpreF, for the prevention of medically attended lower respiratory tract illness (MA-LRTI) and severe MA-LRTI caused by RSV in infants from birth up to six months of age by active immunization of pregnant individuals. If approved, RSVpreF would be the first vaccine for administration to pregnant individuals to help protect against the complications of RSV disease in infants from birth through six months. The PDUFA goal date for a decision by the FDA is in August 2023. Pfizer also announced that the EMA accepted Pfizer’s MAA under accelerated assessment for its RSV vaccine candidate for both older adults and maternal immunization to help protect infants. A decision is expected in the second half of 2023.In February 2023, Pfizer announced that the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) voted that available data are adequate to support the safety and effectiveness of its RSV bivalent vaccine candidate, PF-06928316 or RSVpreF. The vaccine candidate is currently under FDA review for the prevention of acute respiratory disease and lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV in adults 60 years of age and older. The FDA’s decision in older adults is expected by the PDUFA goal date in May 2023.Shingles (Varicella-zoster Virus, or VZV) mRNA Candidates – In February 2023, Pfizer and BioNTech announced the start of a Phase 1/2 trial exploring the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of the companies’ mRNA vaccine candidates against shingles (also known as herpes zoster, or HZ). The study is aiming to enroll up to 900 healthy volunteers 50 through 69 years of age and is being conducted in the U.S. Phase 1 will help select the optimal mRNA vaccine candidate, dose level, dosing schedule and formulation for advancement to Phase 2. Participants in the study will be followed to determine how long protection may last.VLA15 (Lyme Disease Vaccine Candidate) – In February 2023, Pfizer and Valneva SE announced that Pfizer, as the study sponsor, decided to discontinue a significant percentage of participants in the U.S. who had been enrolled in the Vaccine Against Lyme for Outdoor Recreationists (VALOR) (NCT05477524) Phase 3 clinical study. These study participants, representing approximately half of the total recruited participants in the trial, are being discontinued following violations of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) at certain clinical trial sites run by a third-party clinical trial site operator. The discontinuation of these participants was not due to any safety concerns with the investigational vaccine and was not prompted by a participant-reported adverse event. The clinical trial remains ongoing at other sites not operated by the third party, and Pfizer continues to enroll new participants at those sites.Corporate DevelopmentsIn March 2023, Pfizer announced it entered into a definitive merger agreement under which Pfizer will acquire Seagen Inc., a global biotechnology company that discovers, develops and commercializes transformative cancer medicines, for $229 in cash per Seagen share for a total enterprise value of approximately $43 billion. Pfizer expects to finance the transaction substantially through $31 billion of new, long-term debt, and the balance from a combination of short-term financing and existing cash. The companies expect to complete the transaction in late 2023 or early 2024, subject to fulfillment of customary closing conditions, including approval of Seagen’s stockholders and receipt of required regulatory approvals. When combining the expected strong growth trajectories for Seagen’s in-line medicines with candidates that could emerge from Seagen’s pipeline, subject to clinical and regulatory success, Pfizer believes Seagen could contribute more than $10 billion in risk-adjusted revenues in 2030, with potential significant growth beyond 2030.In March 2023, it was announced that the Alliance between Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, (Merck KGaA) and Pfizer to co-develop and co-commercialize Bavencio (avelumab) will terminate. Effective June 30, 2023, Merck KGaA will take full control of the global commercialization of Bavencio. The current profit share will be replaced by a 15% royalty to Pfizer on net sales of Bavencio. Merck KGaA and Pfizer will continue to operationalize their respective ongoing clinical trials for Bavencio; and Merck KGaA will control all future research and development activities.Please find Pfizer’s press release and associated financial tables, including reconciliations of certain GAAP reported to non-GAAP adjusted information, at the following hyperlink:https://investors.pfizer.com/Q1-2023-PFE-Earnings-Release(Note: If clicking on the above link does not open a new webpage, you may need to cut and paste the above URL into your browser's address bar.)For additional details, see the financial schedules and product revenue tables attached to the press release located at the hyperlink referred to above, and the attached disclosure notice.(1) As used in this document, ""Comirnaty"" refers to, as applicable, and as authorized or approved, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent (Original and Omicron BA.4/BA.5), the Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 Vaccine, and Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4/BA.5 Vaccine. In the U.S., monovalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are no longer emergency use authorized or CDC-recommended, although Comirnaty remains a licensed vaccine. ""Comirnaty"" includes direct sales and alliance revenues related to sales of the above-mentioned vaccines, which are recorded within Pfizer’s Primary Care customer group. It does not include revenues for certain Comirnaty-related manufacturing activities performed on behalf of BioNTech, which are included in the Pfizer CentreOne contract development and manufacturing organization. Revenues related to these manufacturing activities totaled $5 million for the first quarter of 2023 and $47 million for the first quarter of 2022.(2) Revenues is defined as revenues in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Reported net income and its components are defined as net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders and its components in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Reported diluted earnings per share (EPS) is defined as diluted EPS attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders in accordance with U.S. GAAP.(3) Adjusted income and Adjusted diluted EPS are defined as U.S. GAAP net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders and Reported diluted EPS attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders before the impact of amortization of intangible assets, certain acquisition-related items, discontinued operations and certain significant items. See the accompanying reconciliations of certain GAAP Reported to Non-GAAP Adjusted information for the first quarter of 2023 and 2022. Adjusted income and its components and Adjusted diluted EPS measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income and its components and diluted EPS(2). See the Non-GAAP Financial Measure: Adjusted Income section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Pfizer’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the accompanying Non-GAAP Financial Measure: Adjusted Income section of the press release located at the hyperlink above for a definition of each component of Adjusted income as well as other relevant information.(4) Pfizer does not provide guidance for GAAP Reported financial measures (other than revenues and acquired in-process R&amp;D (IPR&amp;D) expenses) or a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP Reported financial measures on a forward-looking basis because it is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of unusual gains and losses, certain acquisition-related expenses, gains and losses from equity securities, actuarial gains and losses from pension and postretirement plan remeasurements, potential future asset impairments and pending litigation without unreasonable effort. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on GAAP Reported results for the guidance period.Financial guidance for full-year 2023 reflects the following:Does not assume the completion of any business development transactions not completed as of April 2, 2023, except for signed transactions, if any, through mid-April 2023, which are expected to give rise to acquired IPR&amp;D expenses during fiscal 2023.Reflects an anticipated negative revenue impact of $0.2 billion due to recent and expected generic and biosimilar competition for certain products that have recently lost patent protection or that are anticipated to lose patent protection during fiscal-year 2023.Exchange rates assumed are a blend of actual rates in effect through the first quarter of 2023 and mid-April 2023 rates for the remainder of the year. Financial guidance reflects the anticipated unfavorable impact of approximately $0.4 billion on revenues and approximately $0.13 on Adjusted(3) diluted EPS as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar compared to foreign exchange rates from 2022.Guidance for Adjusted(3) diluted EPS assumes diluted weighted-average shares outstanding of approximately 5.75 billion shares, and assumes no share repurchases in 2023.(5) Pfizer’s fiscal year-end for international subsidiaries is November 30 while Pfizer’s fiscal year-end for U.S. subsidiaries is December 31. Therefore, Pfizer’s first quarter for U.S. subsidiaries reflects the three months ended on April 2, 2023 and April 3, 2022, while Pfizer’s first quarter for subsidiaries operating outside the U.S. reflects the three months ended on February 26, 2023 and February 27, 2022.(6) Beginning in the third quarter of 2022, Pfizer made several organizational changes to further transform its operations to better leverage its expertise in certain areas and in anticipation of potential future new product and indication launches. Biopharma, Pfizer’s innovative science-based biopharmaceutical business, is operating under a new commercial structure designed to better support and optimize performance across three broad customer groups:Primary Care, consisting of the former Internal Medicine and Vaccines product portfolios, products for COVID-19 prevention and treatment, and potential future mRNA and antiviral products.Specialty Care, consisting of the former Inflammation &amp; Immunology, Rare Disease and Hospital (excluding Paxlovid) product portfolios.Oncology, consisting of the former Oncology product portfolio.(7) References to operational variances in this press release pertain to period-over-period changes that exclude the impact of foreign exchange rates. Although exchange rate changes are part of Pfizer’s business, they are not within Pfizer’s control, and because they can mask positive or negative trends in the business, Pfizer believes presenting operational variances excluding these foreign exchange changes provides useful information to evaluate Pfizer’s results.(8) Paxlovid and the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent (Original and Omicron BA.4/BA.5) have not been approved or licensed by the FDA. Paxlovid has been authorized for emergency use by the FDA under an EUA, for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg) with a current diagnosis of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent has been authorized by the FDA under an EUA to prevent COVID-19 in individuals aged 6 months and older. The emergency uses are only authorized for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of the medical product during the COVID-19 pandemic under Section 564(b)(1) of the FFDCA unless the declaration is terminated or authorization revoked sooner.

Meanwhile, inflation in the euro inches up ahead of the European Central Bank's own gathering later this week.1. Futures inch down but hold near flatline as Fed meeting approachesU.S. stock futures were in the red on Tuesday, but largely hovered around the flatline, as attention shifted to what could be a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting (see below) and a string of closely-watched job market data.At 05:25 ET (09:25 GMT), the Dow futures contract traded down by 74 basis points or 0.22%, S&amp;P 500 futures inched down 8 points or 0.15%, and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 4 points or 0.03%.On the economic data front, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (aka JOLTS) is due out on Tuesday. The report, which tracks job vacancies and the number of workers who have decided to quit, helps gauge the level of demand in the labor market.The data will serve as a warm-up act before the all-important April jobs report on Friday, which is expected to point to the third-straight monthly deceleration in employment growth.2. Fed meeting gets underwayThe Federal Reserve's two-day policy-setting meeting is set to begin later today.The U.S. central bank has been aggressively tightening monetary policy over the past year in a bid to cool red-hot inflation, but concerns remain over how much these decisions will impact growth. First-quarter gross domestic product figures last week pointed to sluggish overall activity in the world's biggest economy.But recent turmoil in the banking sector - marked this week by the failure of First Republic Bank and JPMorgan's (NYSE:JPM) subsequent takeover of the bulk of its assets - has led many observers to predict that the Fed will pause after this latest hike.In March, policymakers raised rates to their highest level since 2007. Following that meeting, the Fed's ""dot plot"" forecast signaled that one more quarter-point hike was likely in 2023.3. Pfizer highlights earnings wavePfizer (NYSE:PFE) is among the largest U.S. companies to release their latest results on Tuesday, with investors keen to see how demand for the pharmaceutical giant's COVID-19 products is faring.Any possible updates around the group's $43 billion purchase of biotechnology company Seagen in March, which is still being mulled over by regulators, are also expected to be a major focus.Other companies set to release earnings today include chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), coffee chain Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), and ridesharing firm Uber (NYSE:UBER).This week will also see numbers from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the largest American company by market value. The report from the iPhone maker, which is scheduled to be unveiled on Thursday, is typically considered to be an indicator of the strength of global consumer demand.4. Debt ceiling pressure risingU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen turned the heat up on lawmakers in Washington, warning that the government will not be able to meet its obligations as soon as June 1 if a deal is not reached to raise or suspend the debt ceiling.The statement, issued in a letter to Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy on Monday, set out a deadline that was earlier than many on Wall Street had expected. Economists at Goldman Sachs had tentatively placed the so-called ""X-date"" - that is, the day when the Treasury can no longer meet its obligations to debtholders - at some time in late July.Yellen's comments were backed up by the Congressional Budget Office, which also estimated that the Treasury would run out of funds by early June, citing weaker-than-expected tax receipts.The Biden administration has long said it will not meet with McCarthy over the debt limit as long as House Republicans demand that any deal comes with big cuts to some of the president's major spending initiatives. But as June edges closer, the White House will likely face more pressure to join talks.5. Eurozone inflation edges higher, but core prices coolHeadline inflation in the Eurozone ticked slightly higher as expected in April, in a sign that price growth remains stubbornly elevated as regional rate-setters gear up to unveil their latest rate decision this week.The currency's area consumer price index for the month rose to 7.0% on an annualized basis, according to preliminary data from Eurostat, in line with economists' forecasts. Meanwhile, core inflation, which strips out volatile items like food and fuel, slowed marginally to 5.6%, surprising estimates that the figure would remain unchanged.The April numbers come as the European Central Bank prepares to hold its latest monetary policy meeting on Thursday, with officials widely tipped to raise borrowing costs. However, forecasts differ over whether the ECB will hike rates by 25 basis points or opt for a larger 50 basis point increase.Story continuesRelated ArticlesFed meeting looms, debt ceiling deadline, Eurozone CPI - what's moving marketsTesla raises prices in key markets around the world; not about demand say CitiCheniere Energy Misses Q1 EPS by 18c; raises guidance]"

But you have said, you see the world through the lens of genetics. What is this world telling you right now?ANNE WOJCICKI: Oh. Well, genetics-- so I should say, we're on the 20th anniversary of when the first human genome was sequenced. And it has, you know, it's a big milestone of like when it costs billions of dollars to get a single person sequenced and what you can learn from that to where we are today, where 23andMe has over 13 million people. You can learn a tremendous amount from your genome. And you can start to account for like all of this incredible diversity we see in life and all of the variation we have in our health, and like why some people do so well on a treatment, why some people don't, why some people get a disease, why some people don't.Story continuesSo I'm excited about the 20th anniversary and like, where it can go from here. But I do look at everything with that perspective of genetics, because it's almost like a digital code way of looking at all of the diversity that we see in life. And I look around a room, and I do think about like, I look at your eyes right now, and I'm like, ah--[LAUGHTER]I know he's an AG.BRIAN SOZZI: What's AG?ANNE WOJCICKI: It's just me, like you have like greenish eyes.BRIAN SOZZI: Ha, what does that say about my DNA?ANNE WOJCICKI: Well, just like you're not a GG.BRIAN SOZZI: OK. Is one better than the other?ANNE WOJCICKI: No, no. It's all-- no, that's the thing about diversity. Like, it's not-- you know, the diversity that we have of humans is about our story of survival, which is like a really beautiful story of like how we as, like, humans are made to keep living on this planet. Like, some people are made for cold, some people are made for hot. Some people have darker skin, and that protects them from sun. Some people are fair skin, and they can absorb more sun. Like, it's just like diversity is amazing.BRIAN SOZZI: I wasn't going to go here, but are you a-- when you go into a room, are you assessing people like this? I didn't even realize anything. You just told me.ANNE WOJCICKI: [LAUGHS][INTERPOSING VOICES][LAUGHTER]ANNE WOJCICKI: I mean, I do-- I do sometimes see people, then I'm like, and they'll say, they're like, oh, yeah, I haven't done 23andMe yet. And I'll be kind of chomping at the bit. I'd be like I'm dying to see your DNA.BRIAN SOZZI: Wow. OK, let me go-- let me get back on topic here. We're at the Milken Conference. And there's so much focus on health care because of the efforts by Michael Milken. I went to the doctor recently, just a checkup, didn't tell me anything about my genetics. Didn't even tell me where I can go, what I can do, what I may not do. Is it-- is it interwoven in health care right now? Or is there something missing here?ANNE WOJCICKI: No. I mean, again, I'd say that's the disappointment I have of the 20 years having been around when they first sequenced the human genome that it's not broadly adopted. And I think part of that reason is that genetics tells you a lot about what you're at risk for. And it doesn't necessarily financially pay to get you that preventative information and to intervene in that way versus just treating people once they have a disease.And so that's frankly it's my disappointment here is that we don't look at genetics, for instance, when you're getting a prescription and say, like, are you likely to respond? Should you have a different dose? You look at the epidemic of depression. There's all kinds of, you know, you can look at your genetics, look at a number of the drug, you know, interaction genes and see what medication you're likely to most respond to.It's a tragedy to me that people are not first tested before they are prescribed something. I think also there's all kinds of other conditions like hereditary, you know, colon cancer. People should actually know whether or not they have something like that. And they can have increased screening. Familial hypercholesterolemia is where you have like really high, you know, cholesterol levels, and you need to get screened.So things like that you could actually really start to, you know, see it for yourself.BRIAN SOZZI: All of that makes a lot of sense to me.ANNE WOJCICKI: Yeah.BRIAN SOZZI: What's the biggest roadblock preventing health care from adopting these things?ANNE WOJCICKI: It's a good question. I'd say there's two things. Like, one is it's not in the workflow. So meaning like when you go to your doctor, it's not necessarily part of the workflow, the processes. Like, if you said you're interested in having children, it isn't necessarily part of that workflow for actually how your doctor would follow up, how insurance would pay-- be paid. Does the doctor-- is the doctor educated about genetics? And what, you know, why they should do it, what you're potentially going to learn, how to potentially deal with the results if they get them.I think for a long time we were really just used to genetic counselors and saying, like, hey, it's going to be put on a genetic counselor if you have this particular issue. And more and more, it's going into the mainstream. It should be your primary care physician really integrating it with primary care.So I think that insurance and payment is a big obstacle. And I would say that physician education is a main-- is a significant obstacle as well as like being part of the workflow.BRIAN SOZZI: Last time you talked to you around the time of the IPO 2021, you were just starting, I guess, getting going on a partnership with GSK and drug development. Where is that now? And when is that first drugs from this deal coming to market?ANNE WOJCICKI: Well, that is thriving. GSK is actually-- it's done extraordinarily well. We have over 50 programs underway with GSK. We do have one that is in a phase I study that GSK now controls. We've-- it's co-developed, but we-- they're taking lead now. So, and there's a huge number of programs behind it.23andMe also has our own wholly owned program. It's an immunotherapy program. So super excited about it. It is definitely exciting to see that you can go from understanding the genetic variation-- that makes me so excited-- to saying, wow, some people are, you know, genetically not likely to develop, you know, a certain kind of condition. And then can I understand that and turn that actually into a drug to help either treat people who have that condition?BRIAN SOZZI: Is that the holy grail in health care, looking out over the next decade, the ability to match up your genetics with figuring out the cure for cancer or some other disease?ANNE WOJCICKI: I look at all the explosion of all these new technologies with gene therapy, with CRISPR, with RNA technologies, and understanding the human genome. And I think what 23andMe can really bring to the table here is the understanding of the human genome.So for instance, one thing that we can do really well is we study healthy people, meaning that you might have a particularly interesting mutation that the scientific world thinks like they don't know. Maybe it's potentially disease-causing. But because I can study you, and I can say, OK, you have finished a knockout mutation, you're doing really well. You have no other health issues.We potentially know that that, like, changing that or modifying that gene is not going to create any other kinds of issues. So it's a way to help the pharmaceutical industry study essentially what's naturally going on in humans. So we find like studying huge populations and huge numbers helps us just understand that natural variability in people.BRIAN SOZZI: How do you-- how do you go about championing this in the educational system? Do you see the things you're talking about today being embedded in our education system?ANNE WOJCICKI: I think that, you know, genetics to be really successful, I think it needs to be part of medical school training. And it needs to be integrated not as a single subject but throughout all aspects of the curriculum. So when you're doing, you know, cardiovascular health, that it's part of that. When you're doing renal health, it's part of that.That everything, every aspect of health care has a genetic component and helping realize, you know, the personalization that comes with it. Like, every patient that is coming also is unique and different. And so we're all going to metabolize drugs in a different way. You're going to have potentially, like, your blood values are naturally going to be different than my blood values based on your genetics.There's just a lot of variability that we're going to understand from your genetics. And that's going to manifest in different ways in each of us. So what your baseline is going to be different than what my baseline is. So I do see that it needs to be integrated throughout all aspects of health care, not just as a specialty in genetics.BRIAN SOZZI: Lastly, what's next for your company?ANNE WOJCICKI: I'm excited-- there's two big areas. One is consumer, which is really about helping. We have over 13 million people and helping them do more with the information that we already provided. So one thing that we've gotten the feedback from our customers. Is that it's almost an overwhelming amount of information. So how do you translate all this into a care plan?And there's a lot of lifestyle information we're also collecting from our customers about how they eat, how much they sleep, how much they walk, exercise, happiness. So helping people understand their health in the context of what they've self-reported, their genetics, and then all of their lifestyle information, so that then you can know what things should you change. And some of that might be more proactive screening in the medical system. Some of it might be changing how you sleep. Some of it might be changing how you eat.So I see a real opportunity for us to deliver a type of personalized prevention that's grounded in your genetics. But we take all that other information about you. And we really help you be as healthy as you can.I think the second slide, I think, we see this from the work that we've done with GSK. Having a large-- you know, a large amount of genetic information with really, really broad phenotypic data is incredibly powerful for drug discovery. And the end of the GSK collaboration comes in July. And it opens up all kinds of doors for us to, you know, start to do more partnerships with more companies. And I feel a responsibility to my customers that if you're somebody who has a family history of Alzheimer's, it's on me.]"

(NASDAQ:FOX) has not been having the best time lately with all of its public relations disasters. The stock's performance in recent times has been unsatisfactory due to persistent legal risks and ongoing legal battles. Despite the company's low price-earnings ratio of 11, many investors remain hesitant on the stock due to these risks.Fox's Short-Term Issues Reveal Value OpportunityWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with FOX. Click here to check it out. FOX 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of FOXPeter Lynch Chart of FOXAlthough the company has significant financial resources, Fox's legal battles will undoubtedly negatively impact its performance in the short term. However, I believe the selloff is still overblown. Just because Fox knowingly lies about some things on the news doesn't mean people will suddenly stop wanting to watch its programs. Fox's news and sports programming are still among the most popular on cable TV, and the company's Tubi streaming platform is growing rapidly. Tubi's revenue has quadrupled since Fox acquired it in 2020, and its current viewership of over 60 million could potentially double Fox's current annual revenue within the next five years according to the company's estimates. As such, I believe Fox is worth considering for value investors with a long-term view.Fox is in the legal hot seatFox settled with Dominion Voting Systems for $787.5 million in one of the largest defamation suit payouts in U.S. history on Sept. 28, 2023. The Dominion settlement was significant, amounting to more than 50% of the trailing 12-month net income of $1.507 billion. While the settlement amount is easily covered by Fox's $4.058 billion in cash reserves, the company faces the risk of further lawsuits in the future. Such lawsuits could create a black cloud hanging over the company, despite its top-rated cable status and loyal following.The Dominion settlement was undoubtedly better for Fox shareholders than the $1.6 billion Dominion sought. However, the settlement came late, with the jury already seated. Fox was facing the possibility of having its top anchors testify in court about election fraud. A pre-trial settlement was likely the best way out for Fox, rather than risking damage to the company's reputation.Story continuesFox is also facing a $2.7 billion defamation lawsuit from Smartmatic, a voting technology company, and other defendants. The Dominion settlement sets a precedent, making Fox more likely to have to write another significant check.There are also potential class action suits against Fox by shareholders seeking to make management liable for these costs that would have been avoidable if Fox didn't knowingly report false information.What are the advertisers thinking?Fox's ongoing legal battles may cause advertisers to rethink their partnerships with the company. Advertisers generally avoid controversy and try to appeal to a broad spectrum of consumers. Although Fox's sports and news programming are some of cable TV's biggest draws, it is important to evaluate the potential impact of these legal issues carefully.High-profile exits such as Tucker Carlson's departure from Fox News may also impact the company's brand and overall perception in the market, albeit not necessarily immediately or significantly. The financial impact may depend on Carlson's replacement and their success.Tubi is a key reason to remain optimisticFox's unique entry into the streaming space with Tubi is growing at an impressive rate and could double its annual revenue within the next five years, according to the company's estimates. The ad-supported streaming platform, which Fox acquired in 2020, has quadrupled its own revenue since then, and it has only begun to scratch the surface of its potential.While Fox's cable TV programming, particularly sports and news, has always been a reliable revenue producer, Tubi has proven a worthy addition to the company's portfolio. With over 60 million regular viewers, Tubi is among the top free ad-supported television platforms and contributed to 1% of the total time spent on streaming content in February.Integrating Tubi's tech with VideoAmp's Premium Video Planning Tool, LiveRamp TV Activation's platform and Comscore's measurement tool has bolstered the platform's appeal to advertisers, allowing them to plan their spending and forecast the results of ad campaigns better.Although the profitability of Tubi remains uncertain, Fox's traditional television business has proven to be a reliable revenue and profit producer. The company's savvy approach to picking or producing content that attracts advertisers, coupled with the growth potential of Tubi, makes it an overlooked gem in the media industry.Fox still has good ratingsAlthough Fox's network broadcast generally ranks fourth among the nation's four major names, most of the most-watched cable news shows in the U.S. are Fox programs. Thus, Fox's programming stands out as some of the most widely viewed on television, thanks to the success of its network-broadcast shows such as The Simpsons, The Masked Singer and 9-1-1, along with its other offerings.Fox's success extends to sports broadcasting as well. The company aired this year's Super Bowl, which drew the largest audience for the big game since 2017, the last time Fox produced it. In addition, Fox led viewership for the recent regular season of college basketball and performed well with baseball.Although Fox pays a considerable amount for the broadcasting rights of these prestigious events, such as the 2022 World Series, the investment is justified due to the company's reputation as one of the most reliable revenue and profit producers in the TV industry. Despite the fluctuating advertising market, Fox's financial results are resilient. With its ability to offer top-rated TV content that consistently generates viewership and ad revenue, Fox is a formidable force in the industry.TakeawayDespite Fox's ongoing legal battles and the potential impact on its performance in the short term, the company's balanced portfolio of traditional TV and on-demand platforms, including its streaming platform Tubi, make it an overlooked gem in the media industry in my opinion.With its proven ability to attract advertisers through its reliable ratings and popular programming, combined with the growth potential of Tubi, Fox has great long-term potential that I belive is well worth the risk given the low valuation.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Growing demand for the company’s cloud products from new and existing clients using on-premises products might have acted as a tailwind.The increasing traction for core products like Jira Software and Confluence Cloud and the rising adoption of new products like Jira Service Management may have acted as key catalysts. An improvement in product quality and performance, multiple product launches and increased pricing are also likely to have boosted the firm’s performance.Robust growth in subscription revenues, aided by the solid uptake of the company’s subscription-based offerings, is likely to be reflected in the to-be-reported quarter’s results. Atlassian expects a non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 84% and non-GAAP operating margin of around 15% in the third quarter of fiscal 2023.However, increased investments in its systems and infrastructure, research &amp; development and sales and marketing initiatives might have weighed on the bottom line in the third quarter.Story continuesWhat Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Atlassian this season.

269,cab65c01-bdf6-3bd1-a5d0-8651c31ba75c,PYPL,2023-05-02,Paypal (PYPL) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paypal-pypl-reports-next-week-140102308.html,1682949662,STORY,"['PYPL', 'FTNT']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Paypal (PYPL) reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 8, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis technology platform and digital payments company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.09 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +23.9%.Revenues are expected to be $6.98 billion, up 7.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.08% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Paypal?For Paypal, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.15%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Paypal will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Paypal would post earnings of $1.20 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.24, delivering a surprise of +3.33%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Paypal appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Internet - Software industry, Fortinet (FTNT), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.28 per share for the quarter ended March 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +47.4%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $1.2 billion, up 25.7% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Fortinet has been revised 0.9% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.01%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Fortinet will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

270,54b69c13-0aca-3c5b-a5e2-6e2ddcdcc697,PYPL,2023-05-02,"Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Global X MSCI Argentina ETF, iShares MSCI Mexico ETF, StoneCo, Paypal and MercadoLibre",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-investment-ideas-feature-highlights-095709748.html,1682935029,STORY,"['MELI', '^GSPC', 'PYPL']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 1, 2023 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Global X MSCI Argentina ETF ARGT, iShares MSCI Mexico ETF EWW, StoneCo STNE, Paypal PYPL and MercadoLibre MELI.3 Ways to Play Latin America's Ramping GrowthLatin America is Presenting Growth OpportunitiesAs investors, our job is to look for opportunities wherever they may arise. Though domestic equities provide ample opportunity, it is also worth focusing on emerging markets as well. Firstly, investors may find benefits to tracking emerging markets because they are earlier in their growth trajectory.In other words, even though the companies may be smaller in size, their growth potential is often higher. Secondly, emerging markets provide investors with a means of diversification. If your entire portfolio is too concentrated in one market, an adverse price move in the wrong direction could devastate your portfolio.How to Play LATAM’s GrowthETFsInvesting in ETFs is the most straightforward way to participate in Latin America’s economic development. ETFs are useful for investors because they eliminate single stock risk, are highly liquid, and save investors time researching individual companies.Despite the sentiment you may hear echoed in the news about these economies, the price action doesn’t lie. For example, over the past year, the Global X MSCI Argentina ETF is up by 23% and is just 7% off its all-time highs. Argentina’s stock market is being driven by a revival of economic growth and citizens looking to equities markets to escape rampant hyperinflation.Mexico is another country seeing economic strength. Because of the strained relationship between the United States and China, many U.S. companies are moving to minimize geopolitical risk by moving their manufacturing to Mexico. As a result, the iShares MSCI Mexico ETF is up 21% year-to-date. In Friday’s session, the ETF broke out of multi-month price consolidation to fresh highs in expanding volume – a bullish indicator.Story continuesNo Need to “Reinvent the Wheel”Another way to find opportunities in LATAM is to look for companies that are mirroring the success already achieved by similar companies in the United States.StoneCo is a financial technology solutions provider. The company is the premier player in the Brazilian digital payments market and is considered the “Brazilian Paypal.”A Long RunwayUnlike the U.S. market, which is saturated with digital payment companies, Brazil’s market is largely untapped. As Brazil’s economy develops, more and more of its citizens will begin using digital payments. Though most payments are still conducted in cash, the shift is starting into the digital world, and it is showing up in STNE’s earnings and earnings estimate picture.EarningsLast quarter, EPS swung to a profit of $0.14 per share versus a loss the year before. Meanwhile, revenue jumped a healthy 52%. In the past 60 days, the Consensus Estimate Trend has been revised higher more than once for the next quarter and the full year.Top Tier Industry GroupThe Zacks Internet – Software Industry that STNE is in has been outperforming the market and is ranked in the top 27% of all groups tracked.Relative Strength and DiversificationSTNE checks all the boxes. First, since the company is international, it aids investors in gaining portfolio diversification. Secondly, the stock is showing strong relative strength. Over the past month, STNE is up by 30%, drastically outperforming the 3% gain in the S&amp;P 500 Index.From a technical perspective, the stock is trying to break over a key zone which it has failed at several times in the past. However, the recent relative strength coupled with the strong expectations going forward gives me confidence that this break-out will stick. If the stock can get and stay above the $12.50-$13 zone there is a ton of room to run.Bonus: ARGT’s largest holding is MercadoLibre, the Buenos Aires-based e-commerce leader of South America. While MercadoLibre is based in Argentina, its largest market is Brazil. Recently, Brazil elected a new president who is likely to implement more stimulus in the form of welfare to its citizens. The move is expected to be a catalyst for MELI moving forward, and thus, the ARGT ETF.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +46.4%, +49.5% and +55.2% per year.

Chief Executive Officer Arvind Krishna said the company expects to pause hiring for roles it thinks could be replaced with artificial intelligence in the coming years.Most Read from BloombergTexas Mass Shooting’s Bloody Images Add to Fervor in Gun DebatePowell’s Bet Against Recession Looks Good — Minus the Credit Crunch and a DC StandoffFootball Stadiums Belong in the SuburbsWhy Airfares, Hotels and Cars Are Getting So Expensive for AmericansBiden Trails Trump as His Approval Rating Hits Low in ABC PollHiring in back-office functions — such as human resources — will be suspended or slowed, Krishna said in an interview. These non-customer-facing roles amount to roughly 26,000 workers, Krishna said. “I could easily see 30% of that getting replaced by AI and automation over a five-year period.”That would mean roughly 7,800 jobs lost. Part of any reduction would include not replacing roles vacated by attrition, an IBM spokesperson said.As artificial intelligence tools have captured the public imagination for their ability to automate customer service, write text and generate code, many observers have worried about their potential to disrupt the labor market. Krishna’s plan marks one of the largest workforce strategies announced in response to the rapidly advancing technology.More mundane tasks such as providing employment verification letters or moving employees between departments will likely be fully automated, Krishna said. Some HR functions, such as evaluating workforce composition and productivity, probably won’t be replaced over the next decade, he added.IBM currently employs about 260,000 workers and continues to hire for software development and customer-facing roles. Finding talent is easier today than a year ago, Krishna said. The company announced job cuts earlier this year, which may amount to about 5,000 workers once completed. Still, Krishna said IBM has added to its workforce overall, bringing on about 7,000 people in the first quarter.Story continuesKrishna, who has been CEO since 2020, has worked to focus the century-old company around software and services such as hybrid cloud. He has divested lower-growth businesses like managed infrastructure unit Kyndryl Inc. and part of the Watson Health business. The company is currently considering selling its weather unit.Armonk, New York-based IBM topped profit estimates in its most recent quarter due to expense management, including the earlier-announced job cuts. New productivity and efficiency steps are expected to drive $2 billion a year in savings by the end of 2024, Chief Financial Officer James Kavanaugh said on the day of earnings.Until late 2022, Krishna said he believed the US could avoid a recession. Now, he sees the potential for a “shallow and short” recession toward the end of this year. Though the company’s strong software portfolio, including acquired unit Red Hat, should help it maintain steady growth despite worsening macroeconomic concerns, wrote Bloomberg Intelligence’s Anurag Rana last week.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWhy Launch Rockets When You Can Just Fling Them Into Space?Even $500 Million a Year From Google Isn’t Enough to Save FirefoxBiden Administration Tamps Down Talk of US-China DecouplingAirbus Bets on a Stretched A220 Jet to Beat Boeing’s 737Data Science Is the Hot New Master’s at B-Schools©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

This press release and supporting schedules include the non-GAAP measures adjusted EBITDA; consolidated debt to last twelve months adjusted EBITDA, which we refer to as our leverage ratio; distributable cash flow (DCF); distribution coverage ratio; adjusted free cash flow (Adjusted FCF); and adjusted free cash flow after distributions. The amount of adjusted EBITDA and DCF generated is considered by the board of directors of our general partner in approving the Partnership's cash distribution. Adjusted EBITDA and DCF should not be considered separately from or as a substitute for net income, income from operations, or cash flow as reflected in our financial statements. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to adjusted EBITDA and DCF are net income and net cash provided by operating activities. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income adjusted for: (i) provision for income taxes; (ii) interest and other financial costs; (iii) depreciation and amortization; (iv) income/(loss) from equity method investments; (v) distributions and adjustments related to equity method investments; (vi) gain on sales-type leases; (vii) impairment expense; (viii) noncontrolling interests; and (ix) other adjustments, as applicable. In general, we define DCF as adjusted EBITDA adjusted for (i) deferred revenue impacts; (ii) sales-type lease payments, net of income; (iii) net interest and other financial costs; (iv) net maintenance capital expenditures; (v) equity method investment maintenance capital expenditures paid out; and (vi) other adjustments as deemed necessary.The Partnership makes a distinction between realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives. During the period when a derivative contract is outstanding, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded as an unrealized gain or loss. When a derivative contract matures or is settled, the previously recorded unrealized gain or loss is reversed and the realized gain or loss of the contract is recorded.Adjusted EBITDA is a financial performance measure used by management, industry analysts, investors, lenders, and rating agencies to assess the financial performance and operating results of our ongoing business operations. Additionally, we believe adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors for trending, analyzing and benchmarking our operating results from period to period as compared to other companies that may have different financing and capital structures.DCF is a financial performance measure used by management as a key component in the determination of cash distributions paid to unitholders. We believe DCF is an important financial measure for unitholders as an indicator of cash return on investment and to evaluate whether the partnership is generating sufficient cash flow to support quarterly distributions. In addition, DCF is commonly used by the investment community because the market value of publicly traded partnerships is based, in part, on DCF and cash distributions paid to unitholders.Adjusted FCF and adjusted free cash flow after distributions are financial performance measures used by management in the allocation of capital and to assess financial performance. We believe that unitholders may use this metric to analyze our ability to manage leverage and return capital. We define Adjusted FCF as net cash provided by operating activities adjusted for (i) net cash used in investing activities; (ii) cash contributions from MPC; (iii) cash contributions from noncontrolling interests and (iv) cash distributions to noncontrolling interests. We define adjusted free cash flow after distributions as Adjusted FCF less base distributions to common and preferred unitholders.Distribution coverage ratio is a financial performance measure used by management to reflect the relationship between the partnership's financial operating performance and cash distribution capability. We define the distribution coverage ratio as the ratio of DCF attributable to GP and LP unitholders to total GP and LP distributions declared. Leverage ratio is a liquidity measure used by management, industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies to analyze our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures.Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains forward-looking statements regarding MPLX LP (MPLX).

Crude capacity utilization was approximately 89%, driven by planned maintenance activity in the Gulf Coast region, resulting in total throughput of 2.8 million barrels per day for the first quarter of 2023.Refining operating costs per barrel were $5.68 for the first quarter of 2023, versus $5.22 for the first quarter of 2022. This increase was primarily driven by higher expenses for projects conducted during turnaround activity.MidstreamSegment adjusted EBITDA was $1.5 billion in the first quarter of 2023, versus $1.4 billion for the first quarter of 2022, as growth in throughputs and higher rates more than offset lower natural gas liquids prices.Corporate and Items Not AllocatedCorporate expenses totaled $184 million in the first quarter of 2023, compared with $151 million in the first quarter of 2022.Financial Position, Liquidity, and Return of Capital As of March 31, 2023, MPC had $11.5 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments and $5 billion available on its bank revolving credit facility.In the first quarter, the company returned $3.5 billion of capital through $3.2 billion of share repurchases and $337 million of dividends. And, in April, the company repurchased $1.2 billion of company shares.Additionally, the Board of Directors has approved an incremental $5 billion share repurchase authorization. With the addition of this new authorization, the company has a total of $9.0 billion available under its share repurchase authorization. The authorization has no expiration date. MPC may utilize various methods to effect the repurchases, which could include open market repurchases, negotiated block transactions, accelerated share repurchases, tender offers or open market solicitations for shares, some of which may be effected through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The timing of repurchases will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and repurchases may be discontinued at any time.Strategic and Operations UpdateThe Martinez Renewable Fuels facility reached full Phase I production capacity of 260 million gallons per year of renewable fuels, ramping to design rates and yields as planned. Phase II construction activities are on schedule. Pretreatment capabilities are expected to come online in the second half of 2023, and the facility is expected to be capable of producing 730 million gallons per year by the end of 2023.At its Galveston Bay refinery, the company completed the STAR project, which is expected to add 40,000 barrels per day of incremental crude capacity and 17,000 barrels per day of resid processing capacity. Start-up activities are progressing with utilization expected to increase throughout the second quarter of 2023.The Midstream segment remains focused on executing the strategic priorities of strict capital discipline, fostering a low-cost culture, and optimizing the portfolio. MPLX is advancing growth projects anchored in the Marcellus, Permian and Bakken basins.Second Quarter 2023 OutlookRefining &amp; Marketing Segment:Refining operating costs per barrel(a)$5.20Distribution costs (in millions)$1,350Refining planned turnaround costs (in millions)$400Depreciation and amortization (in millions)$480Refinery throughputs (mbpd):    Crude oil refined2,645    Other charge and blendstocks215        Total2,860Corporate (in millions)$175(a)  Excludes refining planned turnaround and depreciation and amortization expenseConference CallAt 11:00 a.m. ET today, MPC will hold a conference call and webcast to discuss the reported results and provide an update on company operations.

The non-GAAP financial measures we use are as follows:Adjusted EBITDA Amounts included in net income (loss) attributable to MPC and excluded from adjusted EBITDA include (i) net interest and other financial costs; (ii) provision/benefit for income taxes; (iii) noncontrolling interests; (iv) depreciation and amortization; (v) refining planned turnaround costs and (vi) other adjustments as deemed necessary, as shown in the table below. We believe excluding turnaround costs from this metric is useful for comparability to other companies as certain of our competitors defer these costs and amortize them between turnarounds.Adjusted EBITDA is a financial performance measure used by management, industry analysts, investors, lenders, and rating agencies to assess the financial performance and operating results of our ongoing business operations. Additionally, we believe adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors for trending, analyzing and benchmarking our operating results from period to period as compared to other companies that may have different financing and capital structures. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to income (loss) from operations, net income attributable to MPC, income before income taxes, cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companiesReconciliation of Net Income Attributable to MPC to Adjusted EBITDA (unaudited)Three Months Ended March 31,(In millions)20232022Net income attributable to MPC$2,724$845Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests360327Provision for income taxes823282Net interest and other financial costs154262Depreciation and amortization800805Refining planned turnaround costs357145Litigation—(27)Adjusted EBITDA$5,218$2,639Refining &amp; Marketing MarginRefining &amp; Marketing margin is defined as sales revenue less cost of refinery inputs and purchased products.

This measure should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, Refining &amp; Marketing gross margin or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP, and our calculations thereof may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.Reconciliation of Refining &amp; Marketing Segment Adjusted EBITDA to Refining &amp; Marketing Gross Margin and Refining &amp; Marketing Margin (unaudited)Three Months Ended March 31,(In millions)20232022Refining &amp; Marketing segment adjusted EBITDA$3,853$1,374Plus (Less):Depreciation and amortization(464)(461)Refining planned turnaround costs(357)(145)Selling, general and administrative expenses592508(Income) loss from equity method investments36(12)Net gain on disposal of assets(3)—Other income(51)(181)Refining &amp; Marketing gross margin3,6061,083Plus (Less):Operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization)2,7452,389Depreciation and amortization464461Gross margin excluded from and other income included in Refining &amp; Marketing margin(a)(67)14Other taxes included in Refining &amp; Marketing margin(71)(43)Refining &amp; Marketing margin$6,677$3,904Refining &amp; Marketing margin by region:Gulf Coast$2,651$1,653Mid-Continent2,8441,293West Coast1,182958Refining &amp; Marketing margin$6,677$3,904(a)  Reflects the gross margin, excluding depreciation and amortization, of other related operations included in the Refining &amp; Marketing segment and processing of credit card transactions on behalf of certain of our marketing customers, net of other income. CisionView original content:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/marathon-petroleum-corp-reports-first-quarter-2023-results-301812871.htmlSOURCE Marathon Petroleum Corporation]"

This underperformance was due to lower-than-expected operating income from Aerospace and Defense Technologies segment.However, the bottom line improved from the year-ago quarter’s loss of 6 cents per share. This can be attributed to year-over-year strong operating income from certain segments — Subsea Robotics, Manufactured Products, Offshore Projects Group and Integrity Management &amp; Digital Solutions.Total revenues amounted to $537 million, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $547 million. The top line, however, increased approximately 20.3% from the year-ago quarter’s $446.2 million owing to strong performance from Subsea Robotics and Manufactured Products segments.Oceaneering International, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseOceaneering International, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseOceaneering International, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Oceaneering International, Inc. QuoteSegmental InformationSubsea Robotics: The unit provides remotely operated submersible vehicles for drill support, vessel-based inspection, subsea hardware installation, pipeline surveys and maintenance services.Revenues totaled $169.2 million compared with $128 million in the prior-year period. Operating income came in at $33.7 million, higher than the year-ago quarter’s $11.6 million. Days on hire increased 20.1% year over year to 14,228, while Remotely Operated Vehicles’ utilization remained unchanged at 63%.Manufactured Products: The segment focuses on the manufactured products business, theme park entertainment systems and automated guided vehicles.Revenues were $112.9 million compared with the prior-year figure of $82.7 million. Operating profit came in at $11.3 million compared with the year-ago quarter’s figure of $2.6 million. This was primarily due to better cost absorption and a favorable project mix. Backlog rose to $446 million from $334 million as of Mar 31, 2023.Story continuesOffshore Projects Group: This includes Oceaneering’s former Subsea Projects segment, excluding survey services and global data solutions, and the service and rental business, without ROV tooling.Revenues increased about 7% to $104.3 million from $97.4 million in the year-ago quarter. Operating income came in at $5.5 million compared with $666,000 in the first quarter of 2022. This improvement was due to increased vessel utilization.Integrity Management &amp; Digital Solutions: This segment mainly covers Oceaneering’s Asset Integrity segment, along with its global data solutions business.Revenues were $60.1 million compared with the year-ago quarter’s figure of $56.6 million. This improvement can be attributed to increased revenues for extra projects. The segment also reported an operating income of $3.1 million compared with the prior-year quarter’s $3.5 million.Aerospace and Defense Technologies: The segment is engaged in Oceaneering’s government business and focuses on defense subsea technologies, marine services and space systems.Revenues totaled $90.5 million compared with $81.5 million in the year-ago quarter. Operating income of $8.5 million declined from $11.8 million in the prior-year quarter. This can be attributed to higher planned costs on several projects in defense subsea technologies business.Capital Expenditure &amp; Balance SheetCapital expenditure, including acquisitions, came in at $18.3 million. As of Mar 31, 2023, OII had cash and cash equivalents worth $505 million and long-term debt of about $700.7 million. The total debt-to-total capital was 57.1%.OutlookFor the second quarter of 2023, OII expects the Manufactured Products segment to experience higher activity levels but lower operating profitability compared with the previous quarter. It also expects the Integrity Management &amp; Digital Solutions business to remain relatively flat in terms of both activity levels and operating profitability.While the Offshore Projects Group segment is projected to experience a significant improvement in operating profitability, the Subsea Robotics and Aerospace and Defense Technologies unit is likely to see higher activity levels and significant operating profitability improvements.Unallocated expenses are expected in the mid-to-high $30 million range.For 2023, Oceaneering projects consolidated EBITDA in the $260-$310 million range, and continued significant free cash flow generation in the range of $75-$125 million. OII also anticipates capital expenditures of $90-$110 million.The company expects net income in the band of $75-$90 million and cash tax payments in the range of $60-$65 million.Zacks Rank and Other Key PicksCurrently, Oceaneering carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230502005190/en/2023 FIRST QUARTER FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS1Net sales increased 5.9% reported and 8.2% in constant currency, primarily due to positive net pricing and favorable sales mix, partially offset by a slight decline in financial volume.Net sales per hectoliter increased 6.1% reported and 8.4% in constant currency, primarily due to positive net pricing and favorable sales mix driven by premiumization.U.S. GAAP income before income taxes of $101.9 million declined 41.3% reported and 45.3% in constant currency.Underlying (Non-GAAP) income before income taxes of $157.8 million improved 82.8% in constant currency.U.S. GAAP net income attributable to MCBC of $72.5 million, $0.33 per share on a diluted basis. Underlying (Non-GAAP) diluted earnings per share (""EPS"") of $0.54 per share increased 86.2%.1 See Appendix for definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures including constant currency.CEO AND CFO PERSPECTIVESIn the first quarter of 2023, Molson Coors delivered strong net sales growth and increased its underlying income before income taxes on a constant currency basis by high double digits. These results benefited from particularly strong rollover pricing compared to the prior year and were achieved despite continued macro-economic pressures. After growing both these metrics on a full-year basis in 2022, the company continues to deliver against its priorities, growing revenue across both business units in the first quarter and reaffirming its full-year 2023 guidance.Story continuesMolson Coors’ core brands in the U.S. continue to see strong, stable performance, and in Canada, Molson Canadian and Coors Light both grew brand volume in the quarter. In the U.K, Carling remains the number one brand in the market, and more broadly, Molson Coors’ EMEA&amp;APAC business grew total financial volume in the quarter. This growth was supported by Molson Coors’ global premiumization strategy and the continued strength of Madri, which is now the eighth-largest brand in the U.K. In the U.S., Molson Coors continued to expand its presence beyond traditional beer including Simply Spiked, a top five industry growth brand, and the release of Simply Spiked Peach. In addition, the Company launched its first foray into ready-to-drink spirits under the Topo Chico Spirited banner.Gavin Hattersley, President and Chief Executive Officer Statement:""Our results in the first quarter of 2023 demonstrate the strength of Molson Coors’ foundation across our portfolio of winning brands and business units. These results also reaffirm our belief that we’ve laid the right groundwork to continue growing sustainably in 2023 and in the future. We’ve delivered our eighth consecutive quarter of top-line growth and increased our bottom-line on an underlying and constant currency basis by high double digits. Our iconic core brands remain healthy, and our premiumization strategy is working as we see continued momentum across our newest brands in Above Premium Beer and beyond.""Tracey Joubert, Chief Financial Officer Statement:""We are pleased with our first quarter performance, achieving strong net sales revenue and underlying income before taxes growth, while continuing to invest in our business and return cash to shareholders. While we remain mindful of the dynamic global macro-economic environment and beer industry softness, our first quarter performance coupled with the strong foundation we have laid over the last three years, provide us confidence to reaffirm our 2023 annual guidance. Achievement of this guidance would mark another year of growth on a constant-currency basis – delivering on our goal of sustainable top and bottom-line growth.""CONSOLIDATED PERFORMANCE - FIRST QUARTER 2023For the Three Months Ended($ in millions, except per share data) (Unaudited)March 31, 2023March 31, 2022ReportedIncrease(Decrease)ForeignExchangeImpactConstantCurrencyIncrease(Decrease)(1)Net sales$2,346.3$2,214.65.9%$(49.7)8.2%U.S. GAAP income (loss) before income taxes$101.9$173.7(41.3)%$6.9(45.3)%Underlying income (loss) before income taxes(1)$157.8$83.589.0%$5.282.8%U.S. GAAP net income (loss)(2)$72.5$151.5(52.1)%Per diluted share$0.33$0.70(52.9)%Underlying net income (loss)(1)$116.3$63.882.3%Per diluted share$0.54$0.2986.2%(1)Represents income (loss) before income taxes and net income (loss) attributable to MCBC adjusted for non-GAAP items.

Cost of goods sold per hectoliter: increased 22.7% primarily due to changes to our unrealized mark-to-market commodity positions driving more than two-thirds of the increase, cost inflation related to materials, conversion and energy costs and mix impacts due to portfolio premiumization, partially offset by our cost savings initiatives.

Americas brand volumes decreased 1.5% including a 1.2% decline in the U.S. driven by softer industry performance and lower economy portfolio volumes, partially offset by the timing impact related to one more trading day in the current quarter. Canada brand volumes increased 4.9% due to growth in core brands and in part due to cycling softer on-premise performance in the prior year due to Omicron restrictions. Latin America declined 12.4% largely due to industry softness in some of our major markets in the region.Price and sales mix favorably impacted net sales and net sales per hectoliter by 7.0% and 7.1%, respectively, primarily due to increased net pricing to customers including the rollover benefit of several price increases taken in the previous year and favorable sales mix driven by brand mix and geographic mix.U.S. GAAP income (loss) before income taxes: improved 168.0% on a reported basis, primarily due to increased net pricing, lower MG&amp;A expense driven by cycling the recording of a $56.0 million accrued liability related to potential losses as a result of the ongoing Keystone litigation case, the cycling of the non-cash impairment charge taken on our Truss LP joint venture asset group in the prior year and favorable sales mix, partially offset by cost inflation mainly on materials, conversion and energy costs.Underlying income (loss) before income taxes: improved 37.7% in constant currency, primarily due to increased net pricing and favorable sales mix, partially offset by cost inflation mainly on materials, conversion and energy costs.EMEA&amp;APAC SegmentNet sales: The following table highlights the drivers of the change in net sales and net sales per hectoliter for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to March 31, 2022 (in percentages):For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2023FinancialVolumePrice andSales MixCurrencyNet SalesEMEA&amp;APAC - Net sales0.8%15.3%(8.5)%7.6%EMEA&amp;APAC - Net sales per hectoliterN/A15.1%(8.4)%6.7%Net sales increased 7.6% reported and 16.1% in constant currency driven by favorable price and sales mix and an increase in financial volume.Financial volumes increased 0.8% primarily due to above premium volumes in the U.K. and higher factored volumes, partially offset by inflationary pressures impacting Central and Eastern European consumers' discretionary purchases.

Financial volume represents owned or actively managed brands sold to unrelated external customers within our geographical markets, net of returns and allowances as well as contract brewing, wholesale non-owned brand volume and company-owned distribution volume. Contract brewing and wholesale/factored volume is included within financial volume, but is removed from worldwide brand volume, as this is non-owned volume for which we do not directly control performance. Factored volume in our EMEA&amp;APAC segment is the distribution of beer, wine, spirits and other products owned and produced by other companies to the on-premise channel, which is a common arrangement in the U.K. Royalty volume consists of our brands produced and sold by third parties under various license and contract-brewing agreements and because this is owned volume, it is included in worldwide brand volume. Our worldwide brand volume definition also includes an adjustment from Sales-to-Wholesaler (""STW"") volume to Sales-to-Retailer (""STR"") volume. We believe the brand volume metric is important because, unlike financial volume and STWs, it provides the closest indication of the performance of our brands in relation to market and competitor sales trends.We also utilize net sales per hectoliter and cost of goods sold per hectoliter, as well as the year over year changes in such metrics, as key metrics for analyzing our results. These metrics are calculated as net sales and cost of goods sold, respectively, per our consolidated statement of operations divided by financial volume for the respective period. We believe these metrics are important and useful for investors and management because it provides an indication of the trends in pricing and sales mix on our net sales and the trends of sales mix and other cost impacts such as inflation on our cost of goods sold.USE OF NON-GAAP MEASURESIn addition to financial measures presented on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (""U.S. GAAP""), we also use non-GAAP financial measures, as listed and defined below, for operational and financial decision making and to assess Company and segment business performance. These non-GAAP measures should be viewed as supplements to (not substitutes for) our results of operations presented under U.S. GAAP. We have provided reconciliations of all historical non-GAAP measures to their nearest U.S. GAAP measure and have consistently applied the adjustments within our reconciliations in arriving at each non-GAAP measure.Our management uses these metrics to assist in comparing performance from period to period on a consistent basis; as a measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating actual results against such expectations; in communications with the board of directors, stockholders, analysts and investors concerning our financial performance; as useful comparisons to the performance of our competitors; and as metrics of certain management incentive compensation calculations. We believe these measures are used by, and are useful to, investors and other users of our financial statements in evaluating our operating performance.Underlying Income (Loss) before Income Taxes (Closest GAAP Metric: Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes) – Measure of the Company’s income (loss) before income taxes excluding the impact of certain non-GAAP adjustment items from our U.S. GAAP financial statements. Non-GAAP adjustment items include goodwill and other intangible and tangible asset impairments, restructuring and integration related costs, unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses, potential or incurred losses related to certain litigation accruals and settlements and gains and losses on sales of non-operating assets, among other items included in our U.S. GAAP results that warrant adjustment to arrive at non-GAAP results. We consider these items to be necessary adjustments for purposes of evaluating our ongoing business performance and are often considered non-recurring. Such adjustments are subjective, involve significant management judgment and can vary substantially from company to company.Underlying COGS (Closest GAAP Metric: COGS) – Measure of the Company’s COGS adjusted to exclude non-GAAP adjustment items (as defined above). Non-GAAP adjustment items include the impact of unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses on our commodity derivative instruments, which are economic hedges, and are recorded through COGS within Unallocated. As the exposure we are managing is realized, we reclassify the gain or loss to the segment in which the underlying exposure resides, allowing our segments to realize the economic effects of the derivatives without the resulting unrealized mark-to-market volatility.Underlying MG&amp;A (Closest GAAP Metric: MG&amp;A) – Measure of the Company’s MG&amp;A expense excluding the impact of certain non-GAAP adjustment items (as defined above).Underlying net income (loss) attributable to MCBC (Closest GAAP Metric: Net income (loss) attributable to MCBC) – Measure of net income (loss) attributable to MCBC excluding the impact of non-GAAP adjustment items (as defined above), the related tax effects of non-GAAP adjustment items and certain other discrete tax items.Underlying net income (loss) attributable to MCBC per diluted share (Closest GAAP Metric: Net income (loss) attributable to MCBC per diluted share) – Measure of underlying net income (loss) attributable to MCBC (as defined above) per diluted share. If applicable, a reported net loss attributable to MCBC per diluted share is calculated using the basic share count due to dilutive shares being antidilutive. If underlying net income (loss) attributable to MCBC becomes income excluding the impact of our non-GAAP adjustment items, we include the incremental dilutive shares, using the treasury stock method, into the dilutive shares outstanding.Underlying effective tax rate (Closest GAAP Metric: Effective Tax Rate) – Measure of the Company’s effective tax rate excluding the related tax impact of pre-tax non-GAAP adjustment items (as defined above) and certain other discrete tax items. Discrete tax items include certain significant tax audit and prior year reserve adjustments, impact of significant tax legislation and tax rate changes and significant non-recurring and period specific tax items.Underlying free cash flow (Closest GAAP Metric: Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities) – Measure of the Company’s operating cash flow calculated as Net Cash Provided by (Used In) Operating Activities less Additions to Properties and excluding the pre-tax cash flow impact of certain non-GAAP adjustment items (as defined above). We consider underlying free cash flow an important measure of our ability to generate cash, grow our business and enhance shareholder value, driven by core operations and after adjusting for non-GAAP adjustment items, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets and capital structure.Underlying depreciation and amortization (Closest GAAP Metric: Depreciation &amp; Amortization) – Measure of the Company’s depreciation and amortization excluding the impact of non-GAAP adjustment items (as defined above). These adjustments primarily consist of accelerated depreciation or amortization taken related to the Company’s strategic exit or restructuring activities.Net debt to underlying earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (""underlying EBITDA"") (Closest GAAP Metrics: Cash, Debt, &amp; Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes) – Measure of the Company’s leverage calculated as Net debt (defined as current portion of long-term debt and short-term borrowings plus long-term debt less cash and cash equivalents) divided by the trailing twelve month underlying EBITDA. Underlying EBITDA is calculated as Net Income (Loss) excluding Interest expense (income), income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, and the impact of non-GAAP adjustment items (as defined above). This measure is not the same as the company’s maximum leverage ratio as defined under its revolving credit facility, which allows for other adjustments in the calculation of net debt to EBITDA.Constant currency - Constant currency is a non-GAAP measure utilized to measure performance, excluding the impact of translational and certain transactional foreign currency movements, and is intended to be indicative of results in local currency. As we operate in various foreign countries where the local currency may strengthen or weaken significantly versus the U.S. dollar or other currencies used in operations, we utilize a constant currency measure as an additional metric to evaluate the underlying performance of each business without consideration of foreign currency movements. We present all percentage changes for net sales, underlying COGS, underlying MG&amp;A and underlying income (loss) before income taxes in constant currency and calculate the impact of foreign exchange by translating our current period local currency results (that also include the impact of the comparable prior period currency hedging activities) at the average exchange rates during the respective period throughout the year used to translate the financial statements in the comparable prior year period. The result is the current period results in U.S. dollars, as if foreign exchange rates had not changed from the prior year period. Additionally, we exclude any transactional foreign currency impacts, reported within the other non-operating income (expense), net line item, from our current period results.Our guidance for any of the measures noted above are also non-GAAP financial measures that exclude or otherwise have been adjusted for non-GAAP adjustment items from our U.S. GAAP financial statements. When we provide guidance for any of the various non-GAAP metrics described above, we do not provide reconciliations of the U.S. GAAP measures as we are unable to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the actual impact of the non-GAAP adjustment items. By their very nature, non-GAAP adjustment items are difficult to anticipate with precision because they are generally associated with unexpected and unplanned events that impact our company and its financial results. Therefore, we are unable to provide a reconciliation of these measures without unreasonable efforts.RECONCILIATION TO NEAREST U.S. GAAP MEASURESReconciliation by Line Item(In millions, except per share data) (Unaudited)For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2023Cost of goodssoldMarketing,general andadministrativeexpensesIncome (loss)before incometaxesNet income(loss)attributable toMCBCNet income(loss)attributable toMCBC perdiluted shareReported (U.S. GAAP)$(1,575.6)$(615.0)$101.9$72.5$0.33Adjustments to arrive at underlyingRestructuring——0.50.5—Unrealized mark-to-market (gains) losses51.8—51.851.80.24Other items—3.63.63.60.02Total$51.8$3.6$55.9$55.9$0.26Tax effects on non-GAAP adjustments———(12.1)(0.06)Underlying (Non-GAAP)$(1,523.8)$(611.4)$157.8$116.3$0.54Reconciliation to Underlying Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes by Segment(In millions) (Unaudited)For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2023AmericasEMEA&amp;APACUnallocatedConsolidatedIncome (loss) before income taxes$233.4$(25.4)$(106.1)$101.9Add/Less:Cost of goods sold(1)——51.851.8Marketing, general &amp; administrative0.53.1—3.6Other non-GAAP adjustment items—0.5—0.5Total non-GAAP adjustment items$0.5$3.6$51.8$55.9Underlying income (loss) before income taxes$233.9$(21.8)$(54.3)$157.8(1)Reflects changes in our mark-to-market positions on our commodity hedges recorded as cost of goods sold within Unallocated.

Reported EPS is $2.21, expectations were $1.73.Operator: Good morning, and welcome to General Motors Company First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. During the opening remarks, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the opening remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, the conference call is being recorded, Tuesday, April 25, 2023. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ashish Kohli, GM Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.Ashish Kohli: Thanks, Julie, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us as we review GM's financial results for the first quarter of 2023. Our conference call materials were issued this morning and are available on GM's Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast. Joining us today are Mary Barra, GM's Chair and CEO; Paul Jacobson, GM's Executive Vice President and CFO; and Kyle Vogt, CEO of Cruise. Dan Berce, President and CEO of GM Financial, will also join us for the Q&amp;A portion of the call. Before we begin, I'd like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statements on the first page of our presentation. The content of our call will be governed by this language. And with that, I'm delighted to turn the call over to Mary.Mary Barra: Thanks, Ashish, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Paul, Kyle, Dan and I are glad to have this opportunity to discuss our first quarter results with you. Once again, we delivered strong earnings, and I appreciate the efforts of everyone involved, including the GM team, our dealers, our suppliers, our unions, that all helped us meet strong customer demand for our products. Highlights include our international markets outside of China, which had a record quarter, and North America, where we earned 10.9% EBIT-adjusted margins. In the U.S., we are the market leader in retail and fleet sales, including commercial sales. We earned the largest year-over-year increase in U.S. market share of any automaker, and we did it with strong production and inventory discipline as well as consistent pricing.Story continuesWe delivered more than 20,000 EVs in the U.S. in the quarter, on the strength of record Bolt EV and EUV sales and rising Cadillac LYRIQ deliveries. This moves us up to the second market position and increased our EV market share by 800 basis points. We also continue to sell more trucks in the U.S. than anyone by a wide margin. In addition, the $2 billion of fixed cost reductions we are targeting will flow to the bottom line faster than we originally expected. And the enterprise value of these fixed cost reductions will have even greater than $2 billion of value because we're strengthening our culture, which has consistently delivered strong results; we're reducing our executive ranks by more than 15% through voluntary separations, which will help reduce bureaucracy; and we are empowering our leaders to structure their teams to be faster and more agile.In addition, we are prioritizing programs and projects that have the highest revenue and cost impact. We understand the bar continues to be raised, so we're holding ourselves accountable to drive improvements every single day. As we look at the performance of the business and the opportunity ahead of us with new ICE and EV launches, we're able to raise our full year 2023 earnings guidance to a range of $11 billion to $13 billion. The new ICE products we are launching around the world will build on this momentum and support strong mix, pricing and EBIT. In GMI, the new Chevrolet Trax, is off to a very fast start in Korea with more than 13,000 orders placed in the first week of sale. In Brazil, the new Chevrolet Montana pickup saw more than 10,000 orders out of the gate.And demand for our new midsize and heavy-duty pickups in North America is growing, especially at the high end. Over the last years, we've evolved our premium truck offerings from a niche to a franchise. And we did it through manufacturing investments, design, demonstrated capability and technologies like Super Cruise. Our customers are responding. 60% of dealer and customer orders for the new Chevrolet Colorado, our high-end Z71, ZR2 and Trail Boss models. Last year, it was 42%. 75% of the GMC Canyon orders are for higher-end AT4 and Denali models. Last year, it was 45%. 52% of Chevrolet Silverado HD orders are for the top-of-the-line high-country model. And 30% of the GMC Sierra heavy-duty orders are for the new Denali Ultimate, which is a brand-new model that didn't exist a year ago.Our profitable growth opportunities extend into other segments as well. For example, the Chevrolet Trax and Trailblazer and the Buick Encore GX and Envista will help us win new customers from brands that walked away from affordable vehicles or scaled-back customer choice. All four of these small SUVs are beautifully designed, packed with technology and include a long list of standard active safety and driver assistance technologies, yet they all have starting MSRPs below $30,000, with the Trax starting below $25,000. As a measure of just how good these vehicles are, the Trax earned a 63% lease residual. That's 24 points above the previous generation and the best we've ever done in this segment. As for the Envista, one auto writer said its gorgeous styling resembles the Lamborghini and another said, as far as rivals go, the 2024 Envista might be playing in the sandbox alone, because it's both premium and affordable.At the same time, our EV volumes and market share are growing as cell production rises and our teams' master new hardware, software and manufacturing technologies that we are deploying. As Paul and I have shared, we plan to produce 400,000 EVs over the course of '22, '23 and the first half of 2024, including 50,000 EVs in North America in the first half of this year and double that in the second half. So far this year, we've built more than 2,000 Cadillac LYRIQ, and production will continue to rise to help us meet pent-up demand. Both GMC HUMMER EV models are shipping from factory zero, and production is scaling. Our production ramp is carefully cadenced as we add additional trim series to the HUMMER EV pickup and began production of EDITION 1 SUV.The team at KMI has now built more than 500 BrightDrop Zevo 600 vans, and the Zevo 400 begins production in the second half of the year, and we've added Purolator and Ryder as customers. We already have 340 fleet customers for the Silverado EV, and the team at Ramos Arizpe is making great progress preparing for the launches of the Blazer EV and the Equinox EV in the second half of the year. All of this is enabled by rising production at Ultium Cells in Ohio, which we expect to reach full capacity at the end of the year. Everything we learned in Ohio will be applied to our next-use LTM cell plants, including in Tennessee, where we will begin hiring and training production workers in a matter of weeks. Work also continues to transform our assembly plant in Orion Township, Michigan to build the GMC Sierra EV and the Chevrolet Silverado EV.We have progressed so far, that it's now time to plan to end the Chevrolet Bolt EV and EUV production, which will happen at the very end of the year. When Orion EV assembly reopens in 2024 and reaches full production, employment will nearly triple, and we'll have a company-wide capacity to build 600,000 electric trucks annually. We'll need this capacity because our trucks more than measure up to our customers' expectation, and we'll demonstrate that work and EV range are not mutually exclusive terms for Chevrolet and GMC trucks. So stay tuned. As we scale EVs, we will lower fixed costs and will continue to drive margin improvements we outlined at Investor Day. This includes optimizing our pouch cells for energy density, range and cost using new approaches pioneered at our Wallace Battery Center and by our technology partners.And we announced this morning that we're also working with Samsung SDI to add cylindrical and prismatic cells to our portfolio. Having multiple strong cell partners will allow us to expand into new segments more quickly, grow our annual EV assembly capacity in North America significantly above 1 million units and integrate cells directly into battery packs to reduce weight, complexity and cost. Reducing vehicle complexity and expanding the use of shared subsystems between ICE and EV programs is another priority. For example, we are reducing the overall complexity of our software configurations and related hardware on all future ICE and EV products. One important part of our efforts includes the reduction of infotainment screen configurations by 60% across our entire portfolio.By reducing complexity, we can focus on delivering new and improved digital experiences much more quickly. We also expect that our supply chain will be an even bigger competitive advantage starting in '26 and '27, because of the direct investments we've made in lithium, nickel and other commodities as well as CAM, which will allow us to purchase significant quantities of material on favorable commercial terms. All of this is coming together in a way that will fundamentally change the narrative that traditional automakers can't deliver competitive EV margins. We have a lot of work to do, but we have the right trajectory, and I believe we can get there much faster than people think. Now before I turn the call over to Paul, I would like to invite Kyle to share an update on Cruise, which continues to expand the scale and scope of its operations.Kyle, over to you.Kyle Vogt: Thanks, Mary. I'd like to give a brief update on our progress. Since last quarter, our driverless fleet has increased by 86% from 130 to 242 concurrently operating AVs. We've completed over 1.5 million driverless miles, and the pace continues to accelerate. Our first million miles took us about 15 months to complete, while the next million miles will likely take less than three. We're also regularly completing over 1,000 driverless trips with passengers every day, and we're seeing strong retention from our early users. This is significant quarter-over-quarter growth in our services well liked, but we've had limits on when and where it operates. But today, I'm excited to share that right now, a small portion of our fleet is now serving driverless rides 24 hours a day across all of San Francisco.For us, this is a milestone years in the making and represents that our driverless fleet has real commercial value. We're completing the work needed to roll it out to the rest of our driverless fleet as soon as we can. Another key part of rapid scaling is a readily available supply of vehicles. Fortunately, our purpose-built and cost-optimized AV, the Cruise Origin, will be testing in Austin soon. This vehicle has been validated almost entirely in simulation, reducing our historical reliance on expensive and time-consuming supervised test-mile collection. The launch of the Origin is a critical step on our path to profitability as well and towards hitting $1 billion in revenue in 2025. We remain on track and slightly ahead as of today. Thanks, Mary.Back to you.General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Sign, logo, Building, Symbol, Headquarters, CarLinda Parton / Shutterstock.comMary Barra: Well, thanks, Kyle. And now I'm going to turn it over to Paul for a deeper dive into the quarter.Paul Jacobson: Thank you, Mary, and thank you, Kyle, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report a strong start to the year as the team continues to execute on our transformation. We're strategically transitioning the business, while at the same time, leveraging our important ICE portfolio with new and refreshed products, driving continued robust demand for our vehicles while pricing has remained stable. We're also excited to bring on incremental EV volumes, particularly in the second half of the year, as we increase battery cell production at Ultium Cells. And as Mary mentioned, we took initial steps in Q1 towards implementing our $2 billion cost initiative, of which we now expect to realize about 50% in 2023, with the majority of this benefit occurring in the back half of the year.The performance-based exits in roughly 5,000 individuals, who participated in the voluntary severance program, will drive approximately $1 billion towards this target. But people cost is just one of several areas we're focusing on. The remaining $1 billion will come from the following initiatives: actions to reduce complexity across the portfolio and throughout the business, in everything we do from vehicle design to engineering and manufacturing; prioritizing our growth initiatives. We simply cannot do everything. We're focusing on projects like crews, bright drop and software-defined vehicles, which offer the biggest returns on revenue and margin. And lastly, we're being tactical on overhead and discretionary costs, including corporate travel, IT costs and marketing spend.These actions will have a near-term impact on costs, but we also outlined a number of additional medium- to long-term opportunities at our Investor Day in November last year, which we are aggressively pursuing. For example, we are developing a fully integrated battery ecosystem and taking a portfolio approach to battery raw materials. We will source from a mix of established and early-stage miners, giving us both security of supply and lower pricing volatility. These are meaningful advantages as we scale into the back half of the decade. The Treasury Department's recent guidance on the clean energy consumer purchase incentive also validated our battery supply chain work with our entire fleet of EVs under the MSRP cap qualifying for the full $7,500 incentive this year.Now let's discuss another important topic, dealer inventory. As we mentioned on the last earnings call, our plan is to balance supply with demand, and that's exactly what we did this quarter. Early in the year, production improved as supply constraints started to ease and began to outpace proactively plan some downtime, which allowed us to end the quarter with U.S. dealer stock flat compared to December, while we gained 1.3 points of share and increased volumes 4% year-over-year. These production actions were contemplated in our 2023 guidance metrics laid out at the beginning of the year. We are still planning to a 15 million unit SAR and targeting to end 2023 with 50 to 60 days of total dealer inventory, although seasonality production schedules and timing of fleet deliveries may take us out of this range from time to time.Now let's get into the Q1 results. Revenue was $40 billion, up 11% year-over-year. We achieved $3.8 billion in EBIT-adjusted, 9.5% EBIT-adjusted margins and $2.21 in EPS diluted adjusted. Total company results were down only $200 million year-over-year, despite a combined $800 million headwind from lower pension income and lower GM financial earnings, providing more evidence that the underlying business remains quite strong. Adjusted auto free cash flow was essentially flat year-over-year, driven by higher capital expenditures related to our EV investments, seasonal working capital headwinds and GM Financial dividend timing. However, we used our strong balance sheet to repurchase $365 million of stock in Q1, retiring 9 million shares and early retiring $1.5 billion in debt maturing later this year.Given the strong Q1 results and our current outlook, we are increasing our full year guidance to EBIT-adjusted in the $11 billion to $13 billion range, EPS diluted adjusted to the $6.35 to $7.35 range and adjusted automotive free cash flow in the $5.5 billion to $7.5 billion range. I'll provide more details on this after I cover the regional results. North America delivered Q1 EBIT-adjusted of $3.6 billion, up $400 million year-over-year, and EBIT-adjusted margins of 10.9%. Results were primarily driven by higher pricing and volume, partially offset by mix, lower pension income, warranty reserve adjustments and higher commodity and logistics costs. We saw a $1.3 billion pricing tailwind year-over-year in the quarter, driven largely by the price increases in 2022 carrying into 2023.We expect this year-over-year pricing benefit to moderate as we progress through the year. However, we anticipate pricing performance on our all-new midsize pickups and refreshed HD pickups to partially offset this headwind. Demand for our full-size pickups remains strong, with increased year-over-year total sales of our Silverado and Sierra full-size pickups up 3%. We also gained 0.3 percentage points of total market share to continue our number one position in full-size pickup sales. Encouragingly, April-to-date performance is also trending well as demand remains healthy, inventory levels are essentially flat, pricing has been consistent, and we're seeing a steady increase in industry volume. GM International delivered Q1 EBIT-adjusted of $350 million, largely flat year-over-year, despite the fact that equity income in China was down $150 million due to lower volume and pricing pressure, partially offset by cost actions.The environment in China has been very challenging as the industry navigates continued COVID-related impacts, regulatory changes for both EV and ICE vehicles and greater-than-expected competitive pricing actions. The China team is taking aggressive actions to offset. However, we don't expect an improvement in equity income until the second half of the year. EBIT-adjusted in GM International, excluding China equity income, was $250 million, up over $150 million versus last year. The successful turnaround the team has executed over the past few years continued with another record quarter. The results were driven by higher pricing, volume and mix, partially offset by commodity and logistics costs and foreign currency headwinds. For the full year, we expect pricing to be up on a year-over-year basis, leveraging the strength of the portfolio and more than covering FX headwinds.For GM International, we anticipate moderately improved full year 2023 results relative to '22. The strong results and momentum for the rest of GM International are anticipated to more than offset continued headwinds in China. GM Financial delivered first quarter EBT adjusted of over $750 million, down $500 million year-over-year, as expected, primarily due to the expected decrease in net leased vehicle income, driven by lower lease sales mix as a result of reduced new vehicle production since Q3 2021 and lower net gains on lease terminations. Also, while higher cost of funds impacted results versus 2022, it was partially offset by higher effective yields on new originations and growth in the loan portfolio. GM Financial's key metrics, balance sheet and liquidity remained strong, providing them the ability to support the GM enterprise across economic cycles.We've seen no material impact due to the recent banking crisis. In fact, earlier this month, we were able to renew our $16 billion revolving credit facilities while also receiving a ratings upgrade of GM and GM Financial bonds from Moody's. This upgrade should improve credit spreads on future bond issuances and improve cost of funds as their debt portfolio reprices. GM Financial also paid a $450 million dividend to GM in Q1. Our full year GM financial expectations of EBT adjusted in the mid $2 billion range and dividends similar to 2022 have not changed. Corporate expenses were $300 million in the quarter, down slightly year-over-year as we continue to invest in growth initiatives. Crews expenses were $550 million in the quarter, up $250 million year-over-year, driven by an increase in operating spend as well as by the inclusion of stock-based compensation expense this quarter versus Q1 2022.As we look forward to the rest of the year, our goal is to remain agile and adapt to the dynamic macro environment. Our updated guidance assumes that the pricing benefit we saw in Q1 is neutralized over the rest of the year as we cycle price increases taken in 2022 and incentives gradually increase. Commodity and logistics costs have been stickier than originally estimated, primarily due to higher steel prices on market index contracts. For the full year, we now expect commodity and logistic costs to be essentially flat year-over-year versus our prior expectation for a modest tailwind. Our expectation to realize at least $300 million EBIT-adjusted benefit in 2023 from the clean energy production tax credits is unchanged. And while we continue to experience parts availability and logistics challenges as we did in Q1, we expect these issues to gradually improve over the next few quarters and are, therefore, still expecting 2023 year-over-year wholesale volume to increase 5% to 10%.As Mary mentioned, we are making great progress towards our goal of 1 million units of North America EV capacity in 2025. As we scale and launch multiple high-volume EVs in strategically important segments, we will see the benefits of the Ultium platform expand and help us deliver margins in the low to mid-single digits by 2025. In closing, I also want to say how proud and thankful I am for all of our amazing team members for their tireless efforts. They've executed quarter after quarter and delivered two consecutive years of record profits despite many external challenges. Needless to say, my optimism for GM's long-term potential remains very high.

Start your free 7-day trial to get on board.Shares gained around 10% on Thursday after the company reported its Q1 results, with both EPS and revenues coming in better than the consensus estimates.According to BofA Securities, stronger-than-anticipated results in Content &amp; Experiences (C&amp;E), a net increase in broadband subscribers, and solid cost control/reductions at Connectivity &amp; Platforms (C&amp;P) drove the beat. The firm sees Comcast at a turning point, with promising prospects for a robust media operations turnaround, and its connectivity business enjoying low churn, substantial ARPU growth, and solid growth in Business Services.Zillow upgraded to Market Perform ahead of the Q1 earnings announcement Bernstein upgraded Zillow (NASDAQ:ZG) to Market Perform from Underperform and raised its price target to $45.00 from $35.00. This follows the firm’s May 2022 coverage initiation which expressed concerns about negative revision risks in revenues and profits. Since then, revenue and adjusted EBITDA forecasts have dropped significantly.According to the firm, the easing of comps and signs of a bottomed core business have increased its optimism about Zillow's prospects. However, to warrant an Outperform rating, the firm seeks more visibility on the recovery curve and acknowledges that the revenue outlook is still uncertain and the stock isn't particularly cheap.The company is set to report its Q1/23 earnings on Wednesday after the market close.General Motors upgraded to Overweight Morgan Stanley upgraded General Motors (NYSE:GM) to Overweight from Equalweight and raised its price target to $38.00 from $35.00, noting it believes the stock is “oversold” and offers an attractive risk-reward.Story continuesThe firm emphasized last week’s Q1 beat-and-raise results and the internal combustion franchise that has shown more strength and resilience than originally anticipated. The firm anticipates a slower decline in the use of internal combustion engines in the U.S. market than previously predicted, as well as a significant increase in the conversion of free cash flow over the course of the internal combustion runoff vs. history. This is due to a reduced investment burden and a more targeted/premium approach.2 more upgradesNorthland Capital Markets upgraded Power Integrations (NASDAQ:POWI) to Outperform from Market Perform with a price target of $82.00, noting it estimates strong quarter-over-quarter growth in Q2 and Q3, up 15% and 25%, respectively. “These numbers could prove to be low relative to a potential Q1 beat and Q2 raise,” added the firm.Shares gained 3% today.The company will report its Q1/23 earnings on Thursday after the market close.Stifel upgraded Scotts Miracle-Gro (NYSE:SMG) to Buy from Hold and raised its price target to $80.00 from $65.00, outlining an attractive near-term set-up for the shares with a margin recovery enabling outsized EPS growth alongside advantaged long-term growth prospects it believes are undervalued at current levels.The stock has experienced fluctuations in price, and there has been a lot of attention paid to the negative impact of weather conditions in March. While a headwind, Stifel believes the outsized attention is misplaced with April weather of greater consequence and favorable. More importantly, the firm believes the recent update on the company's leverage suggests a more robust margin outlook, providing added flexibility to achieve 2023 profit guidance.Shares rose more than 5% today.The company is set to report its Q2/23 earnings on Wednesday before the market opens.Related Articles5 big analyst picks: Comcast upgraded to Buy following ‘super quarter’ | Pro RecapWall Street near flat after First Republic news, awaiting FedMorgan Stanley to cut 3,000 jobs in second quarter - source]"

The firm boosting the stock to overweight from equal weight, noting, quote, ""GM may be overearning, but the stock is oversold."" So that's an interesting one.We know that they posted their earnings last week. The stock up 2% this morning off the back of that upgrade to shares.I mean, one of the things that was interesting to note when they posted their quarterly report last week is them killing off the Bolt, which was, you know--BRAD SMITH: Bye, bye, Bolt.DIANE KING HALL: Yes, I know. RIP. But basically it's just cutting the cord and, in their way, kind of going just all in on EV, saying basically they're going to retool. And I guess the reason that they needed to do that has to do with just getting their production capacity in order for their fuller push into EVs. So that was interesting.And people were surprised by that about them killing off the Bolt because it's such a good performer, you know, but they're planning to retool existing plants to get ready for their larger push with regard to EV, Brad.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, the Bolt was really just an unsexy EV play, and Tesla came along and made electric vehicles sexy. That's great for them. But it's the way that they came into the market really looking at that higher tier.Now, what's going to be key as well is where other auto manufacturers-- and we're going to hear from Ford over the course of this week too. It's going to be interesting to see on the pricing war that has ensued-- in Tesla's case, might be hitting itself in the foot in one way or the other. It's all about where, for the other automakers who have been able to go to their dealership capacity, who have been able to go to the client bases that they already have because they're able to say, oh yeah, just trade in and trade up. We've already got you in the ecosystem, in the family of products. You already own one of the GM Hummers, perhaps. Why don't you just get a new Hummer? We've got it electrified for you. There's a little bit of a wait list, but that's all right.Story continuesSo for GM, I think bringing it back to what Morgan Stanley is thinking, they think investors are looking past these shares here and particularly saying that they're overearning, but the stock is oversold here. So ultimately continuing to look at GM within the context of what we'll hear from Ford, which is now a business that will have three divisions that they're reporting for when they do report earnings in this EV landscape.Still early moments of this year, so only 6% of the auto sales here. And so for some of the legacy automakers that we're hearing from over the course of this earnings season, how they're spending to ramp up a lot of that spend is going to be key to keep a close eye on too.DIANE KING HALL: Yeah, indeed. I mean, it's got me thinking, do I need to get into the EV--BRAD SMITH: Oh yeah?DIANE KING HALL: --game myself?BRAD SMITH: Oh yeah? I've got to get a car first. We'll start there.]"
294,b4a87d49-bdb7-3cb4-bffa-bc663c89a4bd,GM,2023-05-02,‘Investment opportunity of a lifetime’: Cathie Wood says the robotaxi market could be worth trillions — here are 3 stocks to invest in it (besides Tesla),TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investment-opportunity-lifetime-cathie-wood-133106830.html,1682947866,STORY,"['HSAI', 'GM', 'MBLY']","[Advances in technology often come loaded with financial opportunities and scanning the one presented by the nascent autonomous driving sector, Cathie Wood thinks there is a huge one at play.The Ark Invest CEO has not been shy about making some bold predictions in the past and thinks investors should not underestimate what’s in store for this up-and-coming industry.“We think that the robotaxi opportunity globally will deliver $8 to $10 trillion in revenue by 2030 and is one of the most important investment opportunities of our lifetimes,” Wood said. “One of the reasons for this is that it will save lives; 80-90% of auto fatalities and accidents are caused by human error, and autonomous driving is going to take away the human error.”Good news, then, both for humanity and investors. And while the first name that comes to mind that stands to gain from such a development is the current undisputed EV leader Tesla, there are other companies operating in the space that are readying for a driver-less world.We this in mind, we opened up the TipRanks database and got the lowdown on 3 robotaxi-themed stocks that certain Street analysts believe are primed to make the most of this “opportunity of a lifetime.” Here are the details.Mobileye Global (MBLY)One company that is already operating at the forefront of this secular trend is Mobileye, a leader and pioneer in the ADAS (advanced driver assistance systems) space. Having bought the already public entity back in 2017, last October, Intel spun off Mobileye in what was one of the year’s blockbuster IPOs.The company has already established working relationships with more than 50 auto OEMs including VW, Ford and Zeekr and since being formed in 1999, over 125 million vehicles have already made use of the firm’s driver-assisting tech. The company sees an additional 270 million cars using its offerings by the start of the next decade and expects its commanding position in the ADAS segment will be complimented by the opportunity in self-driving cars.Story continuesThe company is already targeting a leading position in the autonomous vehicle market although the days when these cars become more commonplace could be a while away still. Nevertheless, acting as a test, Mobileye intends to deploy between 100 and 150 robotaxis this year in several European cities and in Israel, while CEO Amnon Shashua has predicted that hundreds of thousands of robotaxis will be zooming across major global hubs by the end of the decade.As a firm specializing purely in the ADAS and AV field, Tigress analyst Ivan Feinseth thinks Mobileye offers a unique value proposition.“MBLY is a pure play on the ongoing evolution of ADAS and AV technologies and offers investors one of the best ways to play the growth and ongoing integration of these emerging technologies,” the 5-star analyst said. “MBLY’s industry-leading vision/AI EyeQ SoC system processor currently has about 70% market share and will continue to grow through ongoing innovation along with future regulatory mandates and increasing auto manufacturer product offerings and consumer demand.”“MBLY has significant proprietary value and key attributes well positioning it to take advantage of and benefit from a potential $500 billion TAM that includes onboard consumer and commercial vehicle ADAS and AV technology as well as the upcoming Robo taxi industry and overall AMaaS (Autonomous Mobility as a Service) market opportunities by the end of the decade,” Feinseth went on to add.These comments underpin Feinseth’s Buy rating while his $52 price target suggests the shares will climb 38% higher over the coming months. (To watch Feinseth’s track record, click here)Almost all of Feinseth’s colleagues agree. One skeptic aside, the 12 other recent analyst reviews are all positive, making the consensus view here a Strong Buy. The average target stands at $47.75, implying gains of ~27% could be in the cards over the coming months. (See MBLY stock forecast)General Motors (GM)If Mobileye represents the new school in auto tech, our next name has been an auto industry mainstay since the industry’s early days. General Motors is one of the biggest car manufacturers in world, and in fact, by sales, it was the largest automaker in the United States last year. In 2022, GM sold around 2.3 million vehicles in the U.S., representing roughly a 17% share of all vehicles bought in the U.S. throughout the year.You might think the Motor City-based giant belongs squarely in the auto legacy camp with the company’s vehicle portfolio including iconic names such as Cadillac, Buick, and Chevrolet, but GM has been making a concerted effort to keep up with the times. Not only has it targeted 2035 as the year when production and sales of ICE (internal combustion engine) vehicles will come to an end, but the company also owns an 80% stake in L4 robotaxi firm Cruise.With operations in San Francisco, Austin, and Phoenix, alongside Google’s Waymo, Cruise is one of just 2 robotaxi providers in the United States. And barely a year after conducting the first fully driverless journey in a major city, in February, the firm announced it had notched 1 million driverless miles.Furthermore, the company’s purpose-built vehicle – which lacks a steering wheel or pedals – could kick off its service this year. This bus-like vehicle can transport up to 6 people without a driver, and is expected to travel 1 million miles over its lifespan.By 2025, the GM-owned Cruise aims to deliver revenues of $1 billion, a target RBC analyst and robotaxi fan Tom Narayan thinks should not be too hard to meet.“We have long been optimists on robotaxis, as we think they have the ability to save lives, time, space in our cities, the environment, and increase mobility,” Narayan explained. “We sense automakers seeing cost escalation (especially from electrification and in particular, batteries) are likely focusing their investments on more immediately commercial L2+/L3 offerings. That said, we do applaud GM’s commitment to L4 even given a potential long time horizon for profitability. Moreover, we don’t think $1B in revenues is an ambitious target for 2025. Our math suggests using Uber’s current fare/mile, Cruise would only need ~4,000 cars on an end-to-end service and ~5,000 if it outsourced the backend to Uber/Lyft. To put this in context, there are 45,000 Uber/Lyfts in San Francisco alone.”Quantifying his stance, along with an Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating, Narayan has a $48 price target for the shares, making room for 12-month returns of 45%. (To watch Narayan’s track record, click here)Elsewhere on the Street, the stock garners an additional 5 Buys and 6 Holds, for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. At $50.08, the average suggests the shares will post 12-month growth of ~52%. (See GM stock forecast)Hesai Group (HSAI)For our last robotaxi-stock we’ll head to China, a country that accounted for 59% of global EV sales last year, easily making it the biggest EV market in the world right now.Based in Shanghai, Hesai’s specialty is LiDAR (light detection and ranging) systems – the remote sensing method used to calculate with a laser an object’s exact distance.In fact, the company held the number 1 spot in global LiDAR shipments in 2022, boating a 58% market share in the Level-4 autonomous mobility LiDAR segment and 36% market share in the Level-3 ADAS (advanced driver-assistance system) LiDAR market. Hesai saw out last year having made more than 100,000 LiDAR unit deliveries since being founded in 2014, building on its relationships with leading automotive OEMs and robotics firms.The company is relatively new to the U.S. public markets, with its IPO of American Depositary Shares (ADS) taking place in February. Having raised $190 million, it represented the biggest IPO of a Chinese company since October 2021.However, it has been tough going for this stock. Since the debut, HSAI shares are down by 57%. Nevertheless, Credit Suisse analyst Bin Wang thinks the shares will claw back those losses and some.Along with an Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating, the analyst’s $28 price target suggests investors could see returns of 210% over the next year. (To watch Wang’s track record, click here)Explaining his stance, it’s the robotaxi opportunity that partly informs Wang’s bullish thesis, with the analyst expecting the robo-car’s “cost inflection point arrival to boost Autonomous Mobility LiDAR demand.”“Currently,” explained Wang, “the typical Robotaxi monthly depreciation is below the total cost of a conventional taxi’s depreciation and driver salary in high-tier cities. By replacing the current 1.4mn-unit human-driven conventional taxi fleet in China, we estimate the Robo-car fleet size to reach ~200k units by 2025 and to 1.4mn by 2030. The key drivers are fast-falling hardware cost, upgrading algorithm, improving infrastructure, and favourable government policy. We estimate Hesai’s Autonomous Mobility LiDAR (for Robo-cars) to increase from 12k units in 2022 to 18k/40k units in 2023/24 on the fast-growing Robo-car fleet size.”Over the past 3 months, only two other analysts have waded in with HSAI reviews, but they are also positive, providing the stock with a Strong Buy consensus rating. Not only that, but they also see plenty of gains ahead. The forecast calls for one-year returns of 216%, considering the average target clocks in at $28.50.

295,7c6033f4-32bc-3ed2-8b50-99448c8193b7,MKC,2023-05-02,"McCormick & Company, Incorporated (NYSE:MKC) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 86%",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mccormick-company-incorporated-nyse-mkc-130758910.html,1682860078,STORY,"['MKC', 'MKC-V']","[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in McCormick implies that they have significant influence over the company's share priceA total of 13 investors have a majority stake in the company with 51% ownership Analyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a businessTo get a sense of who is truly in control of McCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated (NYSE:MKC), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 86% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of McCormick, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for McCormick ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About McCormick?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that McCormick does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of McCormick, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in McCormick. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 11% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.8% and 7.3% of the stock.After doing some more digging, we found that the top 13 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of McCormickWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of McCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$102m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 12% stake in McCormick. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with McCormick , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Higher rates and global economic slowdown are other concerns. However, due to the ebbing pandemic, easing of travel restrictions and pent-up demand in the leisure sector, most carries have come up with upbeat outlook. Capacity growth is expected ahead.Investors should keep a close eye on the industry as it continues to navigate the post-pandemic landscape. Notably, most U.S. airlines have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy). Pure-play airlines ETF U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) was down about 2% during the earnings reporting of those key U.S. airlines (as of Apr 27, 2023).Delta Misses Overall, Upbeat GuidanceOn Apr 13, Delta Air Lines DAL initiated the first-quarter 2023 earnings season for the airline space. This Atlanta-based carrier reported lower-than-expected earnings per share and revenues. However, investors were impressed by the upbeat outlook for second-quarter 2023.Delta’s first-quarter 2023 earnings (excluding 82 cents from non-recurring items) of 25 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 29 cents. Volatile fuel price and unfavorable weather conditions led to this downtick. Revenues of $12,759 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12,767.4 million. Driven by higher air-travel demand, total revenues increased 36.49% on a year-over-year basis.For second-quarter 2023, DAL, expects capacity to increase 17% from second-quarter 2022 actuals. Backed by strong booking trends for summer, the company expects June quarter revenues (adjusted) to increase in the 15-17% band from second-quarter 2022 actuals.United Airlines Beats OverallMeanwhile, United Airlines UAL United Airlines incurred first-quarter 2023 loss (excluding 4 cents from non-recurring items) of 63 cents per share, which was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 73 cents.

Operating revenues of $11,429 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11,420.9 million. UAL’s revenues increased 51.1% year over year owing to upbeat air-travel demand.Story continuesFor the second quarter of 2023, United Airlines expects capacity to improve 18.5% from the year-ago reported figure. Revenues for the June quarter are anticipated to grow 14-16% year over year. Riding on upbeat air-travel demand, UAL expects to be profitable in second-quarter 2023.

298,496205ea-f3b1-41ba-8ed5-036b31f7b0e0,PNC,2023-05-02,Inside JPMorgan's late-night scramble to buy First Republic,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inside-jpmorgans-late-night-scramble-to-buy-first-republic-211503341.html,1682975703,STORY,"['JPM', 'USB', 'USB-PR', 'FITB', 'FITBP', 'BAC', 'PNC', 'CFG', 'CFG-PD', 'CFG-PE']","[JPMorgan Chase (JPM) asked more than 800 people to work over the weekend to make a bid for First Republic. It had to wait until the middle of the night to get what it wanted.The US government informed JPMorgan after 1 a.m. Monday that it won an auction for the troubled San Francisco lender. The news capped a marathon weekend of back-to-back meetings with people from every JPMorgan business line, fueled by takeout Mexican and lots of coffee. The CFO even pulled an all nighter.In Pittsburgh, the news wasn’t as good. There, PNC Financial Services Group (PNC) knew by roughly 12:30 a.m. that its bid wasn't successful, and it didn't know which bank was the winner. Regulators announced the deal at 3:22 a.m. ET.The decision made just hours before markets opened in the US on Monday ended speculation about the destiny of the nation’s 14th-largest lender after a bidding war managed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation attracted some of the biggest names in banking.Bank of America (BAC), the second-largest US lender, ultimately decided against an offer, as did US Bancorp (USB), the nation’s fifth-largest bank.Citizens Bank (CFG) and Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), sizable regional lenders based in Providence, R.I. and Cincinnati, also participated in the bidding, according to The Wall Street Journal.JPMorgan v. PNCFor those watching the auction unfold, the competition really came down to two heavyweights: JPMorgan and PNC. The nation’s largest and sixth-largest banks.Both had survived the 2008 crisis by getting even bigger via a series of acquisitions encouraged by the US government.In JPMorgan’s case, it picked up New York investment bank Bear Stearns and Seattle thrift Washington Mutual in March and September of 2008, giving it a coast-to-coast empire. PNC got Cleveland rival National City in October of that year and eventually established a foothold in nearly every top metro area.A PNC sign in Pittsburgh. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Both were also involved in a prior attempt in March to stabilize First Republic with uninsured deposits, a rescue attempt that received encouragement from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and other top Washington officials. JPMorgan kicked in $5 billion and PNC kicked in $1 billion. Another nine banks contributed an additional $24 billion.Story continuesThe infusion bought First Republic time but it didn’t solve the bank’s underlying crisis of confidence. A disclosure last Monday that it lost more than $100 billion in deposits during the first quarter sent its stock tumbling again.Working through the weekendSo JPMorgan got another call Wednesday evening fielded by JPMorgan CFO Jeremy Barnum. Would the bank be interested in gathering information for a bid to acquire First Republic after its seizure by the FDIC?To answer that question, the bank convened roughly 800 people. It tapped executives from its investment banking, commercial banking and private banking units as well as tax advisers, mortgage experts, asset and wealth management experts and valuation specialists.The assignment for every business at the bank was to look at First Republic and to report on what it expected a deal to be worth to its particular unit.JPMorgan Chase CEO, here testifying in Congress last year, is once again playing the role of rescuer during a banking crisis. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)On Saturday, each team presented its findings to JPMorgan’s senior managers via a series of meetings from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Many on the executive floors ate at their desks as they worked.The pros of buying First Republic were that it would help restore some stability to the banking system and it would lower the costs JPMorgan might have to pay to the FDIC if First Republic were to fail without a buyer in hand. The FDIC charges banks a special assessment to cover the costs of industry failures.The risks were many, too. There were potential legal headaches, credit challenges and the possibility that First Republic employees could weaken the franchise by leaving.'Up all night'Bids were due Sunday at noon. After the first batch came in, it was clear to JPMorgan that not all bidders wanted the same assets. Some were willing to take First Republic’s jumbo mortgages and some were not, said a person familiar with JPMorgan’s negotiations.The FDIC needed a way to conform the bids so that they could start comparing them, this person said. Regulators began asking JPMorgan to resubmit its bid with additional parameters and refocus it around certain categories.“They started trying to get everyone on the same page,” this person said.JPM submitted four new bids between noon and 9 pm on Sunday. The final call came from the FDIC at roughly 1:15 a.m., this person said, and First Republic was seized at roughly 2 a.m. The bank's CFO didn’t get much sleep Sunday night, this person said.“There were a lot of people up all night,” Mr. Dimon said on a call with reporters Monday.By 5:30 a.m., some of Dimon's top executives, including Marianne Lake and Jennifer Piepszak, were on a plane and flying to California to meet their new colleagues. First Republic now belonged to JPMorgan.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

Citizens Financial Group (CFG) and US Bancorp (USB) were also reportedly invited.Bank of America decided against a bid, according to one of these people. US Bancorp also decided not to make an offer, according to a Bloomberg report.Some of these same banks came to First Republic's aid in March with $30 billion in uninsured deposits. They were reluctant last week to provide a second rescue on their own, fearing First Republic would be seized anyway.The FDIC gave banks a noon deadline Sunday, and people familiar with the bidding process interpreted it as the prelude to a government seizure of First Republic. Multiple reports Friday suggested that the FDIC would likely place First Republic into receivership.A sign to a First Republic Bank location is shown in San Francisco, Wednesday, April 26, 2023. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)The FDIC may be able to find a buyer among the big banks that is willing to take all of First Republic's deposits and perhaps some of its troubled assets, too. Sometimes the FDIC can sweeten such deals by agreeing to share future losses on loan portfolios, for example.Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna said on CBS's ""Face the Nation"" that the FDIC should take the ""lowest-cost alternative"" to dealing with First Republic. That is a reference to the regulator's mandate to accept the bid that will result in the least cost to the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund, which it uses to backstop all deposits up a limit of $250,000 per account.The biddersIf JPMorgan were to win, it would need the US government to provide an exception to a rule preventing any bank from making an acquisition providing it with more than 10% of all US deposits, Bloomberg reported. JPMorgan, the nation's largest bank, is already above that cap.Story continuesIts attempt to purchase First Republic places CEO Jamie Dimon at the center of a national banking crisis for the second time in 15 years.In 2008, he acted twice to help stabilize the financial system when JPMorgan purchased New York investment bank Bear Stearns in March of that year, getting a $29 billion backstop from the federal government, and then Seattle’s Washington Mutual in September of 2008. In the case of Washington Mutual, JPMorgan purchased its operations after regulators seized the Seattle thrift. It still is the nation’s largest-ever bank failure.The two deals turned JPMorgan into the nation’s biggest coast-to-coast bank and provided it with an even more powerful hand on Wall Street. They also saddled it with years of legal and regulatory headaches. Dimon has said if he could do it over again he would not have purchased Bear Stearns for those reasons.PNC, based in Pittsburgh, also went for an acquisition during the 2008 financial crisis that made it an even bigger player in the industry.Regulators encouraged it to make a bid for Cleveland rival National City, which had been weakened by its exposure to poor-performing mortgages. The deal announced in October 2008 for more than $5 billion made it one of the largest lenders in the country.PNC, which was sixth-largest bank as of Dec. 31, has made some sizable deals since 2008. In 2012 it purchased the U.S. retail banking subsidiary of Royal Bank of Canada for $3.47 billion and in 2021 it picked up the U.S. arm of Spain’s BBVA for $11.6 billion.The BBVA deal gave it roughly 60 branches in California, First Republic's home state, as well as locations in Texas. It was able to claim a presence in 29 of 30 of the top metropolitan statistical areas in the country.First Republic's troublesFirst Republic became the subject of a government bidding war after a fight for its survival that began in March when panic about the stability of regional lenders cascaded across the country. It tried to weather the turmoil by borrowing from the Federal Reserve and the Federal Home Loan Bank while also taking in $30 billion in uninsured deposits from 11 of the country's largest banks. JPMorgan provided $5 billion of the $30 billion.But First Republic's situation turned more serious Monday after it disclosed a loss of more than $100 billion in deposits. The drop was greater than expected and raised new concerns about the company's chances for survival. By Friday, First Republic's stock had dropped to $3.50, down 97% for the year. The bank's market value, once $40 billion, was just $640 million.Investors punished the stock, sending it down nearly 50% in one day and then nearly 30% on Wednesday. On Thursday it rose nearly 9%, before plunging again Friday by 43%.First Republic was founded in 1985 by Jim Herbert, and over the decades expanded rapidly as it attracted wealthy customers clustered on either coast by offering them large single-family mortgages at ultra-low rates along with personalized service.It went from $88 billion in assets at the end of 2017 to more than $200 billion at the end of 2022. It was the nation's 14th-largest lender as of Dec. 31.Then it, like many banks of its size, struggled to adapt to an aggressive campaign by the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates as a way of slowing inflation.The hikes lowered the value of the interest-rate sensitive assets on its balance sheet and helped create billions in unrealized losses, a hole that ultimately attracted the attention of investors and depositors following the fall of Silicon Valley Bank.The bank also had lots of uninsured depositors, making them a greater flight risk during the chaos that unfolded in March.When customers began pulling more than $100 billion, First Republic had to replace its deposit funding with more expensive borrowing from the Fed and the Federal Home Loan Bank system. Those borrowings, which peaked on March 15 at $138 billion, created another problem by placing more pressure on its profitability.First Republic developed a turnaround plan. It said Monday while releasing its first-quarter results that it planned to increase its amount of insured deposits, trim its borrowings, decrease its loan balances and reduce its workforce by 20-25%. Borrowings had dropped to $104 billion as of April 21 and the deposit outflows had slowed.But its disclosure about the amount of deposits lost in March, and the fact that the company decided not to take any questions from analysts, spooked investors.Short sellers also applied more pressure. Those with bets against First Republic have earned $1.37 billion year to date on a mark-to-market basis, according to S3 Partners. It is the most profitable short position among stocks thus far in 2023, according to S3.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

Guggenheim Securities is advising the FDIC, two sources familiar with the matter said on Saturday.FDIC, Guggenheim, FRC and the banks declined to comment.A deal for First Republic, which had total assets of $233 billion at the end of the first quarter, would come less than two months after Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank failed amid a deposit flight from U.S. lenders, forcing the Federal Reserve to step in with emergency measures to stabilize markets.Those failures came after crypto-focused Silvergate voluntarily liquidated.First Republic was the 14th biggest lender in the U.S. at the end of last year, larger than SVB, which was ranked 16th and Signature 29th, according to Fed data.While markets have since calmed, a deal for First Republic would be closely watched for the amount of support the government needs to provide.The FDIC officially insures deposits up to $250,000. But fearing further bank runs, regulators took the exceptional step of insuring all deposits at both Silicon Valley Bank and Signature.Story continuesFor SVB and Signature, the FDIC created a 'bridge bank' to protect depositors.It remains to be seen whether regulators would have to do so at First Republic as well. They would need approval by the Treasury secretary, the president and super-majorities of the boards of the Federal Reserve and the FDIC.In trying to find a buyer before closing the bank, the FDIC is turning to some of the largest U.S. lenders. Large banks had been encouraged to bid for FRC's assets, one of the sources said.JPMorgan holds more than 10% of the nation’s total bank deposits.Federal law prevents a large bank from an acquisition that would put it above a threshold of 10% of total deposits, but that could be waived by banking regulators if it was buying a failed bank, according to the 1994 law and interpretation of the document by a source who is expert on bank failures.STUNNING FALLFirst Republic was founded in 1985 by James ""Jim"" Herbert, son of a community banker in Ohio. Merrill Lynch acquired the bank in 2007, but it was listed in the stock market again in 2010 after being sold by Merrill's new owner, Bank of America Corp, following the 2008 financial crisis.For years, First Republic lured high-net-worth customers with preferential rates on mortgages and loans. This strategy made it more vulnerable than regional lenders with less-affluent customers. The bank had a high level of uninsured deposits, amounting to 68% of deposits.The San Francisco-based lender saw more than $100 billion in deposits fleeing in the first quarter, leaving it scrambling to raise money.Despite an initial $30 billion lifeline from 11 Wall Street banks in March, the efforts proved futile, in part because buyers balked at the prospect of having to realize large losses on its loan book.A source familiar with the situation told Reuters on Friday that the FDIC decided the lender's position had deteriorated and there was no more time to pursue a rescue through the private sector.By Friday, First Republic's market value had hit a low of $557 million, down from its peak of $40 billion in November 2021.Shares of some other regional banks also fell on Friday, as it became clear that First Republic was headed for an FDIC receivership, with PacWest Bancorp down 2% after the bell and Western Alliance down 0.7%.(Reporting by Chris Prentice and Nupur Anand; Additional reporting by Tatiana Bautzer, Saeed Azhar, David French, Anirban Sen Jaiveer Singh Shekhawat in Bengaluru, Writing by Megan Davies; Editing by Stephen Coates and Claence Fernandez)]"

COST, The TJX Companies, Inc. TJX, Target Corp. TGT and Dollar General Corporation DG.Industry: Discount RetailLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2087347/4-retail-discount-stocks-with-potential-to-beat-industry-bluesConsumer spending activity, which is one of the pivotal factors driving the economy, has somewhat slowed down. This is because inflation and recession-wary shoppers have curtailed spending. Underlying price pressure, a slowing labor market and a higher interest rate environment have cooled demand. Of late, players in the Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry have been encountering these headwinds.That said, industry participants have been focusing on deepening engagements with consumers, adding more compelling products and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities. Inventory management, supply-chain enhancement, cost-structure realignment and investments to accelerate digitization have been working in favor of companies like Costco Wholesale Corp., The TJX Companies, Inc., Target Corp. and Dollar General Corporation.About the IndustryThe Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry comprises companies that offer apparel, accessories, footwear, beauty products, personal and baby care products, cleaning products, pet supplies, and food and beverage products at lower prices than traditional retail outlets. The industry participants also provide home textiles, home furnishings, housewares, art and craft supplies, toys and seasonal decor products. These companies sell their products through stores, digital channels, or both.Some industry players operate membership shopping warehouse clubs, offering branded and private-label products in a range of merchandise categories. Most discount stores are gradually emerging as one-stop shopping destinations. The profitability of players depends on a prudent pricing model, a well-organized supply chain and an effective merchandising strategy.Story continues4 Key Industry Trends to WatchSoft Demand May Hit Revenues: Elevating prices and geopolitical concerns continue to pose a threat to consumer spending activity. Undoubtedly, the industry’s prospects are correlated with the purchasing power of consumers. However, rising prices have been discomforting family budgets. The Fed’s aggressive rate hikes to tame inflation also made things tough for consumers by squeezing disposable income.Consequently, the demand has softened. Also, concerns related to a slowing economy and a possible recession have hit consumers’ sentiments that slid to a nine-month low in April. Per Conference Board data, the Consumer Confidence Index nudged down to 101.3 in April from 104 in March.Pressure on Margins to Linger: Companies in the industry are vying for a bigger share on attributes such as price, products and speed to market. Further, the increasing dominance of e-commerce players has made the retail-discount space highly competitive. This has compelled many players to strengthen their digital ecosystem and boost shipping and delivery capabilities. While these endeavors drive sales, they entail high costs.Apart from these, higher marketing, advertising and other store-related expenses might compress margins. Of late, the industry participants have been dealing with product cost inflation. Nonetheless, companies have been focusing on undertaking initiatives to mitigate cost-related challenges. These include streamlining operational structures, optimizing supply networks and adopting effective pricing policies.Consumers Seek Better Bargains: The strategy to sell products at discounted prices has helped industry players draw customers in low-to-middle-income groups who have been seeking both value and convenience amid rising prices. Industry participants have been focusing on creating innovative and compelling products and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities. They are trying to tap any surge in demand unless derailed by elevated inflation. We also believe that failure to restock inventory at fair prices or delay in getting the products delivered to consumers’ doorsteps could compound retailers’ woes.Digitization is the Key to Growth: With the change in consumer shopping patterns, industry participants have been evolving to play dual in-store and online roles. Initiatives, such as building omnichannel, coming up with loyalty and marketing programs, enhancing the supply chain and providing faster delivery options, be it doorstep delivery, curbside pickup or buy online and pick up at the store, are worth mentioning.Simultaneously, companies are investing in renovation, improved checkouts and mobile point-of-sale capabilities to keep stores relevant. Keeping in mind consumers’ product preferences and growing inclination toward online shopping, retailers have been replenishing shelves with in-demand merchandise and ramping up investments in digitization.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry is housed within the broader Zacks Retail – Wholesale sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #172, which places it in the bottom 31% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates drab near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. Since the beginning of January 2023, the industry’s earnings estimate has declined 7.8%.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry vs. Broader MarketThe Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry has outpaced the broader Retail – Wholesale sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.Stocks in this industry have collectively declined 5.3%.

Its commitment to better pricing, private-label offerings, effective inventory management and merchandise initiatives should drive sales. We also remain encouraged by the company’s host of initiatives, such as DG Fresh, Fast Track, non-consumables, digitization and private fleet, which should yield same-store sales growth and margin expansion.Dollar General has an estimated long-term earnings growth rate of 10.6%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current financial-year revenues and EPS suggests growth of 5.8% and 4.8%, respectively, from the year-ago reported figure.

Some industry players operate membership shopping warehouse clubs, offering branded and private-label products in a range of merchandise categories. Most discount stores are gradually emerging as one-stop shopping destinations. The profitability of players depends on a prudent pricing model, a well-organized supply chain and an effective merchandising strategy.4 Key Industry Trends to WatchSoft Demand May Hit Revenues: Elevating prices and geopolitical concerns continue to pose a threat to consumer spending activity. Undoubtedly, the industry’s prospects are correlated with the purchasing power of consumers. However, rising prices have been discomforting family budgets. The Fed’s aggressive rate hikes to tame inflation also made things tough for consumers by squeezing disposable income. Consequently, the demand has softened. Also, concerns related to a slowing economy and a possible recession have hit consumers’ sentiments that slid to a nine-month low in April. Per Conference Board data, the Consumer Confidence Index nudged down to 101.3 in April from 104 in March.Story continuesPressure on Margins to Linger: Companies in the industry are vying for a bigger share on attributes such as price, products and speed to market. Further, the increasing dominance of e-commerce players has made the retail-discount space highly competitive. This has compelled many players to strengthen their digital ecosystem and boost shipping and delivery capabilities. While these endeavors drive sales, they entail high costs. Apart from these, higher marketing, advertising and other store-related expenses might compress margins. Of late, the industry participants have been dealing with product cost inflation. Nonetheless, companies have been focusing on undertaking initiatives to mitigate cost-related challenges. These include streamlining operational structures, optimizing supply networks and adopting effective pricing policies.Consumers Seek Better Bargains: The strategy to sell products at discounted prices has helped industry players draw customers in low-to-middle-income groups who have been seeking both value and convenience amid rising prices. Industry participants have been focusing on creating innovative and compelling products and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities. They are trying to tap any surge in demand unless derailed by elevated inflation. We also believe that failure to restock inventory at fair prices or delay in getting the products delivered to consumers’ doorsteps could compound retailers’ woes.Digitization is the Key to Growth: With the change in consumer shopping patterns, industry participants have been evolving to play dual in-store and online roles. Initiatives, such as building omnichannel, coming up with loyalty and marketing programs, enhancing the supply chain and providing faster delivery options, be it doorstep delivery, curbside pickup or buy online and pick up at the store, are worth mentioning. Simultaneously, companies are investing in renovation, improved checkouts and mobile point-of-sale capabilities to keep stores relevant. Keeping in mind consumers’ product preferences and growing inclination toward online shopping, retailers have been replenishing shelves with in-demand merchandise and ramping up investments in digitization.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry is housed within the broader Zacks Retail – Wholesale sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #172, which places it in the bottom 31% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates drab near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential.

The same for earnings per share is pegged at 51 cents, indicating a year-over-year decline of 56.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal second-quarter earnings has moved down 7.3% in the past 60 days.Q1 PerformanceIn the last reported quarter, WestRock delivered a year-over-year decline in adjusted earnings per share and revenues. The top and bottom lines missed the Zacks Consensus Estimates. WRK’s earnings have surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four trailing quarters, delivering an earnings surprise of 3.1%, on average.WestRock Company Price and EPS SurpriseWestRock Company price-eps-surprise | WestRock Company QuoteKey Factors to NoteWestRock witnessed a slowdown in volumes in the corrugated packaging segment as customers have been rebalancing their inventory and purchasing has been muted due to weak economic conditions. This is expected to get reflected in the company’s top-line results in the second quarter of fiscal 2023.Wholesome costs were expected to have been favorable sequentially (natural gas and recycled fiber), and higher freight, wage and chemicals costs are likely to have hurt its margins. Labor shortages and supply-chain issues have also been disrupting production, and impacting WRK’s shipments to customers.Unfavorable non-cash pension expenses due to higher interest rates and market volatility are also expected to have impacted its profits in the fiscal second quarter.  The company’s results will also reflect the impacts of four fewer shipping days.Pricing actions and productivity initiatives undertaken by the company are expected to have negated some of these headwinds. WestRock is likely to have benefitted from solid demand for corrugated packaging, containerboard, food and beverage consumer packaging, and industrial packaging.Story continuesSegmental ProjectionsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for WRK’s Consumer Packaging segment’s quarterly revenues is pegged at $1,389 million, suggesting growth of 11.3% from the prior-year period's reported figure. The segment’s adjusted EBITDA is estimated to be $127 million, indicating a year-over-year fall of 38.4%.For the Corrugated Packaging segment’s revenues, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pinned at $2,428 million, implying growth of 4.7% from the year-ago quarter's reported number. The segment’s adjusted EBITDA is projected at $119 million, indicating a 63.8% year-over-year fall.The revenue estimate for the Paper segment is pegged at $1,231 million, suggesting a decline of 20% from the prior-year reported figure. The same for the Distribution segment is pinned at $326 million, indicating a 9.4% year-over-year fall.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for WestRock this time around.

That is, insiders sold more stock than they bought.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for CSX The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At CSXIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Independent Chairman, John Zillmer, sold US$516k worth of shares at a price of US$32.25 per share. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$30.64. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive). The only individual insider seller over the last year was John Zillmer.The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insider OwnershipAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It appears that CSX insiders own 0.1% of the company, worth about US$63m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.So What Does This Data Suggest About CSX Insiders?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. We don't take much encouragement from the transactions by CSX insiders. The modest level of insider ownership is, at least, some comfort. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 1 warning sign with CSX and understanding it should be part of your investment process.Story continuesBut note: CSX may not be the best stock to buy.

Adjusted EBITDA is the primary measure used by management (1) to evaluate the economic productivity of our operations and (2) for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, our operations. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations (1) from period to period and (2) to our competitors, by excluding the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) from our financial results. Management also believes Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors or other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is similar to the measure of current financial performance generally used in our debt covenant calculations. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance;(3) FFO, AFFO and AFFO per share, which are metrics used by our public company peers in the communication site industry, provide investors useful indicators of the financial performance of our business and permit investors an additional tool to evaluate the performance of our business against those of our two principal competitors. FFO, AFFO, and AFFO per share are also used to address questions we receive from analysts and investors who routinely assess our operating performance on the basis of these performance measures, which are considered industry standards. We believe that FFO helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate financial performance by excluding the impact of our asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion and asset impairment and decommission costs). We believe that AFFO and AFFO per share help investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate our financial performance as they include (1) the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense on our outstanding debt) and (2) sustaining capital expenditures and exclude the impact of (1) our asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion and asset impairment and decommission costs) and (2) certain non-cash items, including straight-lined revenues and expenses related to fixed escalations and rent free periods and the non-cash portion of our reported tax provision. GAAP requires rental revenues and expenses related to leases that contain specified rental increases over the life of the lease to be recognized evenly over the life of the lease. In accordance with GAAP, if payment terms call for fixed escalations, or rent free periods, the revenue or expense is recognized on a straight-lined basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the contract. We only use AFFO as a performance measure. AFFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operations or as residual cash flow available for discretionary investment. We believe our definition of FFO is consistent with how that term is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (""NAREIT"") and that our definition and use of AFFO and AFFO per share is consistent with those reported by the other communication site companies;(4) Our Non-GAAP Debt Measures provide investors a more complete understanding of our net debt and leverage position as they include the full principal amount of our debt which will be due at maturity and, to the extent that such measures are calculated on Net Debt are net of our cash and cash equivalents, short-term restricted cash, and short-term investments; and(5) Our Constant Currency Measures provide management and investors the ability to evaluate the performance of the business without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.In addition, Tower Cash Flow, Adjusted EBITDA, and our Non-GAAP Debt Measures are components of the calculations used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain covenants under our Senior Credit Agreement and indentures relating to our 2020 Senior Notes and 2021 Senior Notes. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be an alternative to any of the financial measures provided in our results of operations or our balance sheet as determined in accordance with GAAP.Financial Metrics after Eliminating the Impact of Changes In Foreign Currency Exchange RatesWe eliminate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates for each of the financial metrics listed in the table below by dividing the current period’s financial results by the average monthly exchange rates of the prior year period, and by eliminating the impact of the remeasurement of our intercompany loans. The table below provides the reconciliation of the reported growth rate year-over-year of each of such measures to the growth rate after eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange

And the future looks bright.""Renewables have been growing at a double-digit rate for some time now although that growth rate slowed in 2022,"" noted Jerry Wells, senior vice president and part of Regions Solar Tax Equity coverage team. ""Since our team's inception, we've financed more than 80 projects, creating an investment of $1.8 billion and growing.""Regions Equipment Finance (REFCO) launched its specialty finance team focused on renewable energy and solar, closing the first project in 2016. Partnering with renewable power experts, this team provides tax equity financing to sponsors and developers of solar.Renewables received a boost with the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act last year. Projects can be eligible for more in tax credits - historically, 30 percent, now up to 50 percent if the equipment is sourced domestically and in an energy community.Jerry Wells, senior vice president and part of Regions Solar Tax Equity coverage team""Renewables received a boost with the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act last year,"" said Wells. ""Projects can be eligible for more in tax credits - historically, 30 percent, now up to 50 percent if the equipment is sourced domestically and in an energy community.""Wells noted that costs of building a solar farm have come down significantly, albeit inflation drove an increase in costs last year, while equipment efficiency has improved. States have been active in setting renewable portfolio standards with 10 states requiring 100 percent of power delivered required to come from renewable resources between 2030 and 2050.Story continues""Public policy has driven the employment of renewable assets,"" said Wells. ""In addition to being better for the environment, it is now cost competitive with other sources of energy.""Wells and the Solar Tax Equity coverage team partnered with Regions' Energy and Natural Resources Group when the latter financed a construction loan to build a solar farm in 2018 with the tax equity team providing the permanent take-out financing. With a national mandate, Regions has a concentration of solar projects in the Southeastern United States but has projects on the West Coast and in the Northeast outside the company's traditional footprint.The solar development process takes several years from inception to installation.""Our clients will work through their preliminary development phase over a 2-3-year period, which includes purchasing the land, project design, securing proper permitting and entitlements,"" said Lee Hanna, vice president, Regions Energy and Natural Resources. ""Once the preliminary development phase is complete, they will begin construction and installation. That process typically takes between six months and a year.""A renewable source of power, solar energy plays a key role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions while improving air quality and reducing water use from energy production. These projects are part of a larger strategy in ESG working towards making life better in our local communities and throughout the country. This includes clients such as Silicon Ranch, a full-service solar and carbon solutions company with more than 160 projects across 15 states.""Silicon Ranch is proud of the role we play in the energy transition, and what makes our work so rewarding is our ability to leverage that role as a driver of economic opportunity, providing significant investments in communities across the country, including Clay County and Early County, Georgia,"" said Reagan Farr, Co-founder and CEO of Silicon Ranch.

For more on this, go to 5 Most Acquisitive Public Companies in the US.Through acquisition, companies can bring an effective pool of resources, broaden their market reach, and compete efficiently with their rivals. This article will give investors and stakeholders an insight into the 15 most acquisitive public companies in the US.Market OutlookIn 2021, the US acquisition market had the highest record of $2.9 trillion in transactions, an increase of 55% from $1.9 trillion in 2020. At this time, the U.S. acquisitions market was unparalleled (up from less than 50% in 2020). This represents over 60% of all worldwide agreements based on the stated value.In times of uncertainty or market volatility, M&amp;A tends to slow down, but those can also be the exact times when valuations improve, and opportunities present themselves. Having said that, 2022 was a year of uncertainty due to rising inflation. North America's fourth quarter of 2022 saw a dismal finish to a challenging year as corporations refrained from growing due to rising interest rates and a weakening economy.According to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence statistics, the overall value of mergers and acquisitions in the United States decreased to $1.477 trillion in 2022, down 41.4% from 2021. In 2022, there were 20,965 transactions, a 21.2% decrease from the previous year.Early in 2023, concerns about a global recession and increasing interest rates maintained a shadow over the short-term economic picture as central bankers worked to contain high inflation in several areas. So it's understandable why executives have been pushed back on their heels given the crisis in Ukraine, other geopolitical risks, supply chain interruptions, increased regulatory scrutiny, and the jittery investors still processing 2022's precipitous collapse in global stock market prices.Interest Rate - A Big Concern in 2023 for Acquisitive Public CompaniesSince the start of October 2022, businesses have been developing their budgets and business plans for 2023. Numerous changes have occurred in the economy and financial markets during this time. Two major worries are rising interest rates worldwide and how long they could stay high.Story continuesOn the ten-year bond issued by the US Department of the Treasury, interest rates are approximately the same in 2009 and 2022, ranging between 3 and 4 percent. However, credit was much more accessible back then because governments had opened the floodgates of fiscal support.US ""new money"" leveraged-loan issuance through October 2022 (i.e., not a refinancing) is down roughly a third year to date compared to 2021. A comparable metric for high-yield bonds is down by about 70% year over year, and 2021 was worse than 2020.2023 will be an incredible year for potential US acquisitive public companies. These businesses should be better protected against the hazards of an economic downturn because of their strong and adaptable balance sheets. They should also have reserves to take advantage of the worthwhile growth prospects of a recession's recovery phase.Cross-Border Acquisitions Might Get IncreasedDeal-making across international boundaries was considerably slowed down in 2022 by the COVID-19 epidemic, trade tensions between the U.S. and China, and regionally different economic situations. As a result, from 2012 through 2022, the average annual percentage of worldwide M&amp;A dollar volume is roughly 18%.Although M&amp;A was not exempt from all of this turmoil, cross-border M&amp;A remained alluring to dealmakers. In 2022, cross-border transactions accounted for 32% ($1.1 trillion) of all worldwide M&amp;A, which was in line with the average percentage for the previous ten years (35%). $217 billion in transactions were spent on acquiring American firms by non-American parties in 2022, accounting for 6% of worldwide M&amp;A activity and 19% of cross-border M&amp;A activity. Acquirers from China, India, and other emerging economies accounted for only 8% of the volume of cross-border acquisitions of U.S. targets, compared to 50% from the British, Canadian, Singaporean, Australian, and Japanese acquirers.15 Most Acquisitive Public Companies in the USPhoto by Kai Wenzel on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe have selected the most acquisitive public companies based on factors like the number of deals (acquisitions) made by an organization, the acquiring companies' total buying value, the acquirer's market capitalization, and the quality companies (potential companies) being acquired by the acquirer.

Although the company only grabbed hold of around 20 companies since 2000 (compared to the above acquirers) and the market cap is $407.21 billion (during first quarter of 2023), Walmart’s acquisition of brands of Vudu, Asda, and Jet.com are the notable ones. One of the potential targets was 'Flipkart,' an Indian e-commerce company, where Walmart made a deal to get a 77% stake in the company. The $16 billion deal with Flipkart enabled Walmart to grow its online retail operations aggressively in India.9. Visa, Inc. (NYSE:V)As a multinational provider of financial services, Visa, Inc. (NYSE:V)'s main line of work is handling debit, credit, and prepaid card transactions for clients around the world. One of the biggest payment processors in the world as of 2021, Visa, Inc. (NYSE:V) has more than 3.5 billion credit, debit, and prepaid cards in use. The corporation, with a market value of $487.80 billion as of Q1 of 2023, has already acquired more than 30 businesses.

Source: Marriott.Marriott International on Monday completed its $100 million acquisition of the City Express brand portfolio from Hoteles City Express. It has begun selling its 31st brand under the name City Express by Marriott.By August 3, Marriott plans on making the hotels bookable within its site and mobile app and aims to convert the City Express loyalty program’s points into Marriott Bonvoy points.In the meantime, if a traveler does a search on Marriott’s site and app for a destination where there are City Express properties, the company will place ads that point to City Express’s reservation system among the listed results. It would shortly unveil a points-transfer technology as a placeholder until it can merge the loyalty programs.Marriott said that adding City Hotels properties to its existing ones in the region nearly doubles its presence, giving the hotel group the largest count of rooms in “the Caribbean and Latin America.” It overtakes Accor by room count there. But Marriott still only has about 480 properties in the region, underscoring how fragmented the sector is and how large the growth opportunity.Appealing to the Domestic Latin MarketMarriott has tended to have most of its guests and financial partners be based in the U.S., but this deal reflects a shift.“Our number-one source for guests for properties worldwide has always been the U.S. travelers, but over the last 10 years, we’ve got certainly more domestic market customers in various regions,” King said. “This will propel that forward at a speed I can’t even comprehend.”With 17,000 rooms to start, this select-service brand is ready for new construction or conversions.“For new builds, this brand can be built very quickly,” said Brian King, president of international Caribbean and Latin America. “Once you have a plan, the product can come out of the ground and open its doors within 13 months on average.”“Its supply chain for FF&amp;E [furniture, fixtures, and equipment] is deeply rooted in Mexico, and that in-country model works well for hotel development in Latin America,” King said. “That gives it an edge over a lot of other brands where owners based outside the region rely heavily on Asian distribution for FF&amp;E and other supplies.”Story continuescity express by marriott lobby seating marriottInvestors and developers within the region and external the region may want to learn more about the new product, Marriott hoped.“Our existing ownership basis, when we made the announcement, reached out to us at a speed that was really amazing,” King said. “Some of them are very interested where their sites would not have worked for one of our other brands. But this deal will also bring new partners to the mix.”Some analysts have expressed mixed reactions.“Hilton and IHG created their Americas focused mid-scale brands (Tru and Avid) organically and were able to grow them rapidly with entirely third party capital and entirely new builds — no conversions,” wrote Richard Clarke, managing director, and his analyst team at investment bank AllianceBernstein in a report. “Some of Marriott’s acquired hotels will be 20 years old.

Source: Marriott International. Max PixelMarriott International plans by May 15 to disclose resort fees in the total prices it displays in its initial search results on its website and mobile app. It’s the long-awaited outcome of a 2021 settlement with Pennsylvania — that required the Bethesda, Maryland-based hotel operator to include in fees in upfront total prices.Marriott is the first of the global hotel groups to make the change, which pertains to extra fees for services and amenities offered during a hotel or resort stay. All the other global hotel groups and online travel agencies have continued to charge fees for services or amenities at some properties and exclude them from the room rate or bury them in “taxes and fees,” according to ResortFeeChecker.“We have been working diligently over the last several months on the technology required to update our room rate display and further enhance the way these fees are disclosed, in accordance with our agreement with the State of Pennsylvania,” a Marriott spokesperson said. “In fact, when we deploy our changes by May 15, we expect to be the first hospitality company to change its display, leading the industry on this important issue.”It remained uncertain whether other non-resort fees properties may change, such as mandatory fees for non-valet or valet parking, and would be included in Marriott’s updated search results later this month.In February, U.S. President Joe Biden called out companies for not disclosing “frustrating charges.” The administration stated that more than one-third of hotel guests claim to have paid such fees.Yet many consumers seem to take it in stride. One study found that guests dropped their online ratings by only a small percentage after they encountered fee surprises yet booked anyway.Gary Leff at A View From the Wing was the first to report on Monday that Marriott would finally update its search display this month.“Resort fees make it difficult for consumers to compare prices,” Leff wrote. “Hotels that don’t have resort fees look more expensive and are effectively punished.”Story continuesLeff was skeptical the Biden Administration would take serious action.Contentious IssueWhy do resort fees linger despite consumer annoyance? Money.Marriott alone made at least $206 million off the practice just from its self-managed resorts since 2012, according to depositions from the Washington, D.C., Attorney General’s ongoing lawsuit, which Skift reported on. The fees, which even some non-resort locations charge, generated $17 million for Marriott in 2019 alone.Leff speculated that ongoing lawsuits similar to Pennsylvania’s from attorneys general in California, Texas, and the District of Columbia might pressure Marriott or other hotel groups to change their pricing practices.Yet industry practices haven’t changed since the Pennsylvania settlement, as Christopher Elliott recently noted at The Washington Post. Before the pandemic, Booking Holdings had considered including resort fees in total prices at its online travel agencies but paused the process in 2019.So-called “drip pricing” continues to be a popular sales technique in travel, where a seller gets a consumer psychologically invested in an offering and then adds little additional costs without prompting the buyer to abandon the purchase.Most U.S. airlines have added checked bag fees for the past decade, except for Southwest Airlines, which sees including the cost of the bags as a way to stand out in the market.Marriott might choose to position itself as a change-maker in the hotel sector.“Marriott International is committed to providing customers with clear and transparent pricing,” a spokesperson said on Monday. “We have long been focused on ensuring that any resort/destination fees charged by hotels are separately and clearly stated.”Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

MAR is scheduled to release first-quarter 2023 results on May 2, before the opening bell. In the previous quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.5%.The Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first-quarter bottom line is pegged at $1.86 per share, indicating growth of 48.8% from $1.25 reported in the year-ago quarter.For revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at $5,276 million, suggesting growth of 25.6% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.Let's check out the factors that are likely to have influenced the quarter.Key Factors to NoteMarriot’s first-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from robust leisure demand and business, and leniency in cross-border travel restrictions. With global trends improving, the recovery momentum is likely to have continued in the quarter under review. Attributes such as pent-up demand for all types of travel and resilient travel spending are likely to have boosted the company’s performance.MAR is consistently trying to expand its worldwide presence and capitalize on the demand for hotels in the international markets, which is likely to have aided its performance during the quarter. For 2023, it anticipates net room growth in the range of 4-4.5% year over year. The company’s European pipeline has grown consistently in the recent past and the trend is expected to continue going forward as well.Marriot is likely to have benefited from robust gross fees revenues, and owned, leased and other revenues. Our model predicts, gross fees revenues, and owned, leased and other revenues to increase 29.8% and 20.1% year over year to $1,058 million and $314.7 million, respectively.However, COVID-19-induced travel restrictions (in China) and supply-chain disruptions are likely to have affected MAR’s operations in the first quarter. Although revenue per available room is likely to have increased sequentially in Greater China and Asia Pacific (excluding China), it is expected to have remained below pre-pandemic levels.Story continuesMarriott International, Inc.

(VZ) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-verizon-communications-130001798.html,1682946001,STORY,['VZ'],"[Verizon Communications (VZ) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this largest U.S. cellphone carrier have returned -0.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +5.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Wireless National industry, which Verizon falls in, has gained 0.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Verizon is expected to post earnings of $1.17 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -10.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.2%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.69 points to a change of -9.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.2%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.70 indicates a change of +0.2% from what Verizon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.3%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Verizon is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for VZ _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Verizon, the consensus sales estimate of $33.61 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -0.5%. The $135.65 billion and $137.23 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -0.9% and +1.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryVerizon reported revenues of $32.91 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.9%. EPS of $1.20 for the same period compares with $1.35 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $33.71 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.36%. The EPS surprise was +0.84%.Over the last four quarters, Verizon surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Verizon is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Verizon. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A newly executed lease is classified as a ""new lease,"" where an apartment is leased to a new customer, or as a ""renewal"".The table below shows changes in lease rates, as well as the weighted-average blended lease rates for leases executed in the respective period. Transacted leases are those that became effective during a reporting period and are therefore the best measure of immediate effect on current revenues.

The 90-basis point sequential decline in Average Daily Occupancy (""ADO"") from March to April was consistent with expectations, as we plan for higher frictional vacancy during the six month leasing season.First quarter lease rates were consistent with the assumptions of our annual plan, and reflect a slowing pace of growth due to lower inflation. ADO declined 40 basis points year-over-year and while demand was lower than 2022’s record breaking levels it was consistent with our expectations and in-line with historical norms. AIR’s signed new leases and renewals were up 8.7% and 8.4%, respectively. Blended rates were up 8.6%, inclusive of a 20-basis point benefit from the class of 2021, a 90-basis point benefit from revenue enhancing investments in capital improvements, and a 110-basis point benefit due to our allocation to the Southeast Florida market.Inflation – In recent years, apartment investors benefited from declining cap rates, low cost of leverage, and inflation. As inflation eases and interest and cap rates normalize, investment results may be expected to be more influenced by such operational metrics as resident retention and cost control.Recent Acquisitions – Recent acquisitions include ten properties acquired in 2021, 2022, and 2023. In aggregate, these acquisitions represent approximately 17% of AIR GAV. Operating results are improving significantly due to the AIR Edge. The changes made by AIR to improve the resident profile, optimize the rent roll, reduce costs, and make other income generating improvements. These changes are typically iterative with results lagging until earned in as leases expire and new leases made. The impacts of the AIR Edge are generally most significant between the second and fourth year of ownership, during which time profitability increases much faster than in Same Store. This outperformance contributes substantially to our ability to meet our investment targets of unlevered internal rates of return (""IRR"") above 10%, and more than 200-basis points above AIR’s cost of capital.The five properties acquired in 2021 represent 8% of GAV and are now included in the Same Store portfolio. In the first quarter, revenues increased 16.3% and expenses declined by 2.3%, providing 27.3% NOI growth. These results contributed an incremental 60-basis points to Same Store revenue growth, a negative 80-basis points to Same Store expense growth, and 130-basis points to Same Store NOI growth.The four properties acquired in 2022 represent 6% of GAV and are part of our Acquisition portfolio. In the first quarter, ADO increased by 100-basis points and revenue grew by 5.5% sequentially. The three Florida properties continue to perform in line with underwriting. The fourth property, Willard Towers, is located in Chevy Chase, MD. We have concluded that the strength of the submarket supports a more transformational capital program than originally planned. We expect this will generate an unlevered IRR higher than previously underwritten.Southgate Towers, acquired earlier this year, represents 3% of GAV and is also part of our Acquisition portfolio. In the first 90 days of AIR ownership, ADO increased by 120-basis points above underwriting, reflecting the continuing strong demand in South Beach.Rent Collection and Bad DebtWe measure residential rent collection as the dollar value of payments received and as a percent of all amounts billed for residential uses. We establish a reserve for amounts not collected during or immediately after the period when due unless such amounts are otherwise secured by, for example, a security deposit or credit worthy guarantee. Our experience has been that we collect essentially all past due rent that is not reserved and we are optimistic that we will also be successful in collecting a portion of amounts currently reserved, as we have in the past.During the first quarter, we recognized 98.3% of all residential revenue billed in the quarter as paid currently or adequately secured. The remaining 1.7% of revenue was reserved as gross bad debt. Payments received during the first quarter with respect to revenue treated as bad debt in previous periods, including payments from residents, previous residents, guarantors, and government programs, totaled 40-basis points of first quarter residential revenue. Receipt of these monies reduced reserves previously established and was recognized as a contra entry to bad debt. Bad debt for the first quarter, net of the contra entry, was 1.3% of residential revenue.Of the 1.3% net bad debt, 62% (or 80-basis points) related to rents due (i) with respect to properties in the City or County of Los Angeles where local government afforded residents relief from what was owed, or (ii) in other jurisdictions where courts were operating with a backlog from the government shutdown in response to the pandemic. 38% (or 50-basis points) reflected normal credit issues. Los Angeles’ restrictions on landlord access to typical creditor remedies have since been repealed, and courts across the nation are working through existing backlogs. We expect bad debt to normalize by year end at about 50-basis points.As of March 31, 2023, our proportionate share of residential accounts receivable was $6.7 million, a 10% reduction from the start of the year. After consideration of security deposits and reserves for uncollectible amounts, our net exposure was less than $0.1 million. The number of residents delinquent by two or more months was 160, a 36% reduction from approximately 250 at the start of the year. During April, the number of residents delinquent by two or more months declined further to 130; all of which are now in the collection process.Insurance UpdateInsurance costs included within AIR property results include hazard, together with health, general liability, and workers compensation costs. Year-over-year expenses vary with experience as AIR’s health, general liability and workers compensation coverages are largely self-insured with caps for out of the ordinary claims. In 2022, AIR benefited from lower than typical health care, general liability, and workers compensation costs. As a result, our 2023 budget included an approximately 20% increase assuming that claims revert to their longer-term trends.Separately, we also budgeted for a significant increase in property hazard insurance. The current market is challenging, inflation has increased replacement costs, and insurers have experienced substantial losses. On the other hand, AIR is valued as a customer for the quality of our portfolio, the high credit characteristics of our residents, our loss control including the systematic mitigation and elimination of root causes of losses, plus our retention of losses at routine levels, and our use of insurance primarily for out of the ordinary claims. These qualities make AIR a highly profitable customer; carriers received from AIR $53 million in premiums during the past seven years…and paid only $13.8 million in losses.In AIR’s March 1, 2023, renewal, we continued our insurance, broadly with the same coverages and same highly rated insurers as in the past several years. Importantly, we maintained coverages for full replacement costs, without material margin limits or substantial co-insurance. We lowered our self-insured retention to $5 million, a level $3 million above typical losses, increased total insurable value by approximately 11%, and purchased coverage, including Windstorm and California Quake, with limits that are consistent with, or greater than, the 250-year probable maximum loss. The sufficiency of this insurance is evidenced by its acceptance by our property lenders whose repayment is entirely dependent on the value of the property insured.For our Same Store population, the cost of the renewal is up 40% year-over-year and approximately $1 million, greater than anticipated in January. This increase to budgeted expenses is expected to be offset by lower than budgeted controllable operating expenses and real estate taxes.Portfolio ManagementOur portfolio of apartment communities is diversified across eight core markets in the United States and is also diversified by price points, primarily ""A"" and ""B"", averaging ""A-"" in quality. Since the Separation at year-end 2020, AIR has sold properties for $4.1 billion, approximately 41% of AIR’s gross asset value, and used $2.2 billion to reduce leverage and $1.9 billion to acquire properties that improve the quality and expected profitability of our real estate portfolio. The $1.9 billion of acquisitions since 2021 represents 17% of AIR GAV and their incomes are growing faster than Same Store income. (Please see ""Recent Acquisitions"" above.) We expect to make further acquisitions and to increase our allocation to higher growth properties.AIR uses ""paired trades"" to fund acquisitions, basing our cost of capital on the anticipated unlevered IRR of the communities or joint venture interests sold. We require a spread, or accretion, also measured by an unlevered IRR, higher by 200-basis points or more from the communities acquired. This excess return is driven in part by what we call the AIR Edge, the cumulative result of our focus on resident selection, satisfaction, and retention, continuing property upgrades, and relentless innovation in delivering best-in-class property management.The chart below shows changes in portfolio quality based on customer incomes and apartment rents.AIRAimcoQ1 2023Q4 2019ChangeResidentsAverage Household Income$246,000$165,00049%Median Household Income$170,000$116,00047%CSAT Score (out of 5)4.294.30(0.01)Resident Retention61.9%56.8%5.1%PortfolioProperties75124(40%)Apartment Homes22,69632,598(30%)Average Revenue per Apartment Home$2,766$2,27222%Redevelopment and Development ($M)$—$230($230)Mezzanine Investments ($M)$—$280($280)Over the same period, we have improved AIR’s portfolio by reducing our exposure to regulatory risk. We have achieved this through property sales in the New York City, Chicago, Seattle, and California markets, as well as through a strategic joint venture in California. This has allowed AIR to reallocate capital into states such as Florida, with a more predictable rule of law, and into submarkets such as Miami-Dade and Broward counties with higher growth.As a paired trade investor, AIR is agnostic to market changes insofar as we buy and sell properties in the same market conditions, with focus on gaining an accretive ""spread"". As market conditions change, AIR adjusts target returns and spreads to reflect our changed cost of capital. Our paired trade approach is intended to ensure that new acquisitions are accretive to earnings in the near-term and will generate attractive spreads to unlevered IRRs in the long-term.TransactionsAcquisitionsAs previously announced, in January, 2023 AIR acquired for $298 million, Southgate Towers, a 495-unit luxury apartment community with 29,000 square feet of commercial space located in the South Beach neighborhood of Miami Beach. AIR’s presence in South Beach, a submarket with limited competitive supply, now comprises 1,630 apartment homes between Flamingo Towers and Southgate Towers. This transaction demonstrates AIR’s use of distinctive acquisition currencies including the cash proceeds from the fourth quarter 2022 sale of our New England portfolio, the assumption of $101.2 million of property debt maturing in 2036 with interest at 4.15%, and the issuance of $22.4 million of Operating Partnership Units (""OP Units""). The acquisition is expected to provide an unlevered IRR 200-basis points or higher than our cost of capital, driven by the implementation of the AIR Edge.DispositionsThere were no dispositions in the first quarter of 2023.Balance SheetWe seek to increase financial returns by using leverage with appropriate caution. We limit risk through our balance sheet structure, employing low leverage and primarily long-dated debt. We target a Net Leverage to Adjusted EBITDAre ratio between 5.0x and 6.0x but anticipate the actual ratio will vary based on the timing of transactions. We maintain financial flexibility through ample unused and available credit, holding properties with substantial value unencumbered by property debt, maintaining an investment grade rating, and using partners’ capital when it enhances financial returns or reduces investment risk. We seek to minimize refunding and repricing risk.Components of LeverageOur leverage includes AIR’s share of long-term, non-recourse property debt secured by our apartment communities, together with outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility, term loans, unsecured notes payable, and preferred equity.MARCH 31, 2023($ in millions and represent AIR share)*AmountWeighted-Avg.Maturity (Yrs.)Weighted-Avg.Term Before Repricing (Yrs.)Fixed rate loans payable$1,8449.19.1Floating rate loans payable793.80.8Non-recourse property debt1,9238.98.8Term loans8002.84.2Unsecured notes payable4007.27.2Revolving credit facility borrowings2453.03.2Preferred equity**799.89.8Total Leverage$3,4486.97.2Cash and restricted cash(97)Net Leverage$3,350Net Leverage to Adjusted EBITDAre***6.8x* Amounts are presented on a rounded basis and the sum of the individual amounts may not foot; please refer to Supplemental Schedule 5.** AIR’s Preferred equity is perpetual in nature; however, for illustrative purposes, we have computed the weighted-average maturity of our preferred OP Units assuming a 10-year maturity, and of our preferred stock assuming it is called at the expiration of its no-call period.*** AIR plans to reduce leverage to its target of &lt; 6x by completion of pending sales and property NOI growth.During the three months ended March 31, 2023, and on a leverage neutral basis, AIR borrowed $320 million using 10-year fixed rate financing, bearing interest at 4.9%. We used the proceeds to refinance a floating-rate loan and to reduce by $230 million borrowings on our revolving credit facility. This transaction reduced floating-rate debt not subject to interest rate caps or swaps to $120 million, 4% of outstanding leverage, net of cash on-hand, and increased our weighted-average maturity by nine months. As a result of these transactions, AIR has no debt maturing before the second quarter of 2025. As a result of the Fannie Mae facility described below, AIR has established funding sources that could be used to repay all debt maturing before 2030.LiquidityWe use our revolving credit facility for working capital and other short-term purposes, and to secure letters of credit. At March 31, 2023, our share of cash and restricted cash, excluding amounts related to tenant security deposits, was $97 million (invested in interests in federal government obligations) and we had the capacity to borrow up to $751 million on our $1 billion revolving credit facility.In April, we established a secured credit facility with Fannie Mae that provides for up to $1 billion of committed property level financing, on an as needed basis. This facility has minimal upfront costs, a 10-year duration, allows for the removal and substitution of properties, and is priced based on the Fannie Mae grid, which usually and today is lower than public and private bond pricing. After consideration of the secured facility, total liquidity is approximately $1.8 billion.We manage our financial flexibility by maintaining investment grade ratings that enhance access to debt capital markets, and holding communities unencumbered by property debt that provide access to secured lenders and, in particular, the attractive availability and pricing of Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac. As of March 31, 2023, we held apartment communities unencumbered by debt with an estimated fair market value of approximately $7.1 billion.Dividend and Equity Capital MarketsOn April 25, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.45 per share of Common Stock. This amount is payable on May 30, 2023, to shareholders of record on May 19, 2023. In setting AIR’s 2023 dividend, our Board of Directors targeted a dividend level of approximately 75% of full year FFO per share (83% of expected AFFO).We expect that the after-tax dividend will benefit from AIR's refreshed tax basis. In 2022, approximately 86% of our dividend was taxable at capital gain rates, with the remainder taxable at ordinary income rates. We believe the tax characteristics of our dividend makes our stock more attractive to taxable investors, such as foreign investors, taxable individuals, and corporations, than dividends paid by peer REITs whose dividends are taxed at higher rates. For example, AIR’s dividend characteristics in 2022 compare favorably to a peer average of approximately 19% at capital gains rates (vs. AIR at 86%), 71% at ordinary income rates (vs. AIR at 14%), and 10% treated as return of capital. As a result, an investor in AIR common shares would retain after tax approximately 39% more of its dividend than would be retained after tax by an investor in the average of peer shares.Corporate Responsibility UpdateDuring the first quarter, AIR was named a Kingsley Excellence Elite Five multifamily company and a winner of the 2023 Kingsley Excellence Awards for customer service. Of the winners, AIR ranked second among all operators, and first among publicly traded REITs. AIR is committed to world-class customer service, which we deliver through listening to, learning from, and responding to our residents every day. We also benefit from the support of great leadership, contributions from exceptional teammates, and a strong culture. These strengths are confirmed by such awards as AIR's 2023 Top Workplaces USA Award (the second consecutive year), a 10 time winner of Top Workplace in Colorado (by the Denver Post), Top Workplace in Philadelphia (by The Philadelphia Inquirer), as well as Built in 2023 Best Places to Work in Colorado, Los Angeles, Miami, and Washington, DC. We take seriously our responsibility to care for our customers, our neighbors, and each other as teammates. We are grateful for these recognitions and consider them confirmation of our success.2023 OutlookAIR reaffirms its full year Same Store Operations guidance and has narrowed its 2023 Pro Forma FFO per share expectations by $0.02 per share, while maintaining the $2.41 midpoint:YEAR-TO-DATEMarch 31, 2023FULL YEAR 2023($ amounts represent AIR share)Net loss per share$(0.08)($0.18) to ($0.06)Pro forma FFO per share$0.55$2.36 to $2.46Pro forma FFO per share at the midpoint$2.41Same Store Operating ComponentsRevenue change compared to prior year10.1%7.0% to 9.0%Expense change compared to prior year3.3%5.0% to 6.5%NOI change compared to prior year12.7%7.3% to 10.3%Other EarningsValue of property acquisitions$298M$298MProceeds from dispositions of real estate—$50MAIR Share of Capital EnhancementsCapital Enhancements$15M$80M to $90MBalance SheetNet Leverage to Adjusted EBITDAre6.8x≤6.0xIn the second quarter of 2023, AIR anticipates Pro forma FFO between $0.55 and $0.59 per share.Earnings Conference Call InformationLive Conference Call:Conference Call Replay:Tuesday, May 2, 2023 at 1:00 p.m. ETReplay available until July 31, 2023Domestic Dial-In Number: 1-833-470-1428Domestic Dial-In Number: 1-866-813-9403International Dial-In Number: Global Dial-In NumbersInternational Dial-In Number: +44-204-525-0658Passcode: 749836Passcode: 495809Live Webcast: Webcast LinkSupplemental InformationThe full text of this Earnings Release and the Supplemental Information referenced in this release is available on AIR’s website at investors.aircommunities.com.Glossary &amp; Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial and Operating MeasuresFinancial and operating measures found in this Earnings Release and the Supplemental Information include certain financial measures used by AIR management that are measures not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (""GAAP"").

This compares to earnings of $0.47 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 14.71%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this engineered products maker would post earnings of $0.22 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.27, delivering a surprise of 22.73%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Kennametal , which belongs to the Zacks Manufacturing - Tools &amp; Related Products industry, posted revenues of $536.04 million for the quarter ended March 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.14%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $512.26 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Kennametal shares have added about 7.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 8.6%.What's Next for Kennametal?While Kennametal has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Kennametal: mixed.

(NYSE:SWK) should leave a lot of investors scratching their heads. The company has a strong brand and solid economic moat, albeit in the less sticky consumer goods market.Reintroducing Stanley Black &amp; DeckerStanley Black &amp; Decker is a leading global manufacturer of tools, hardware and security solutions with a history dating back to the 1840s. The present incarnation was formed in 2010 through the merger of Stanley Works and Black &amp; Decker Corp. Together, Stanley Black &amp; Decker operates in three primary business segments.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 11 Warning Signs with SWK. Click here to check it out. SWK 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of SWKPeter Lynch Chart of SWKThe Tools and Storage segment includes a wide range of products such as power tools, hand tools, accessories and storage solutions under various well-known brands like Stanley, Black+Decker, Dewalt and Craftsman. These products cater to both professional and consumer markets, including the construction, woodworking and automotive repair industries.The Industrial segment focuses on providing engineered fastening solutions and infrastructure products for various industries, including automotive, aerospace, electronics and construction. Some of the brands in this segment include Stanley Engineered Fastening, POP and Nelson.The Security segment offers electronic security solutions, mechanical security products and automatic doors for commercial, institutional and residential applications. Brands in this segment include Stanley Security, BEST and Sargent &amp; Greenleaf.Strong brands, good financialsAs previously noted, Stanley Black &amp; Decker owns and operates many well-known brands across multiple categories.Black &amp; Decker was founded in 1910 and offers a wide range of power tools, hand tools and home improvement products. Dewalt is the leading brand in its portfolio of power tools, specializing in cordless drills, impact drivers and other power tools with about 15% of market share. Craftsman specializes in power and hand tools as well, plus outdoor equipment, and dates its history back to 1927. Tthe 176-year-old Stanley brand also offers hand tools and storage solutions, mainly for professionals. Collectively, these brands dominate the space with more than 30% share. Across all of its products, the company produced more $16.9 billion in sales and more than $1 billion in net income last year. This is up from $10.9 billion in sales and $490 million in profit during 2013.Story continuesThat said, there is room for improvement. On a per-employee basis, the company looks more like a service firm rather than a manufacturer of brand name products. The company produces $312,000 in sales and just $19,600 in net profit per hire. With around 54,000 employees, the cost of revenue per employee is pretty high at $231,273. Despite that, Stanley Black &amp; Decker has been able to more than double its net income and book nearly $6 billion in retained earnings since 2013, albeit at zero gain in market value. The stock trades at basically the same value as it did in 2013, down 63% from its May 2021 highs.In fact, the company reported its first quarterly loss in years at the end of 2022. That report was actually slightly better than expectations, which is why the stock price seems to have stabilized, up slightly year to date.Stanley Black &amp; Decker: A Turnaround StoryTransformation in progressStanley Black &amp; Decker is not sitting idle. In the third quarter of last year, the company began to cut costs by streamlining and reducing inventory. The ultimate goal is to promote long-term growth, further enhance profitability and generate healthy cash flow. By the end of the year, Stanley Black &amp; Decker had achieved $135 million in savings thanks to a further reduction in workforce and lower indirect spending, with global cost reduction program reaching $200 million in total savings.Fast forward, and the company is on track to save north of $1 billion by the end of this year and around $2 billion by 2025. This is why paying a high multiple today is likely worth it. So while the outlook for 2023 remains uncertain, as the company navigates a extremely challenging retail environment, long term it should get back to the financial consistency it has been known for. This is why paying a high multiple today is likely worth it long term.Mr. Market is trading the stock at a discountOn May 11, 2021, the stock price was $217. Today, it is trading below $90, putting its market capitalization around $14 billion. Will its recent efforts translate back into a $35 billion market cap? Only time will tell, but from a brand standpoint alone, the company has enough runway to make it work.One thing is for sure, there are few businesses with the level of staying power and financial consistency as Stanley Black &amp; Decker. The company has provided investors with both 54 straight years of dividends and 54 straight years of dividend growth. This year it is looking to pay out $3.20, a 3.7% yield. Historically, this yield has been closer to 2.25%.More importantly, the company is almost assuredly returning to higher profitability. One disappointing year financially may kill smaller, less-known brands, but all this has done was make Stanley Black &amp; Decker more valuable long term for today's shareholders. It is trading at 0.75 times sales, where historically that has been nearly double at around 1.47.On these accounts, the stock looks like a bargain.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

However, these delayed upgrades are likely to occur later in the year and act as a catalyst for the growth of the PC market, as stated by the research firms.

CAH is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2023 results on May 4, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 16.81%. The bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters and missed the same twice, the average surprise being 6.43%.Q3 EstimatesFor the fiscal third quarter, the consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $1.48 per share, indicating an improvement of 2.1% from the prior-year quarter’s figure. The same for revenues stands at $49.42 billion, implying growth of 10.2% from the year-ago reported number.Factors to NoteCardinal Health's Pharmaceutical segment is the second largest pharmaceutical distributor in the United States. In the second quarter, pharmaceutical revenues amounted to approximately $47.7 billion, up 15% on a year-over-year basis. The performance reflects branded pharmaceutical sales growth in the Pharmaceutical Distribution and Specialty Solutions segment. This momentum is likely to have continued in the fiscal third quarter.The company’s generics program sales were also strong during the last reported quarter and its upcoming results are expected to gain from this trend.Last year, Cardinal Health announced the addition of a new distribution center in the Columbus, OH area, lending support to its at-Home Solutions business.These developments are likely to have favored the company's fiscal third-quarter performance. However, rising supply-chain costs might have curtailed growth rate.Cardinal Health, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseCardinal Health, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseCardinal Health, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Cardinal Health, Inc. QuoteFor the Medical segment, decrease in product and distribution volumes led to a decline in revenues in the previously reported quarter. Earnings were also hit by net inflationary impacts. The trend is expected to have continued in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.However, demand for CAH’s at-Home Solutions remained strong during the second quarter. The company had launched a supply-chain network and last-mile fulfillment solution — Velocare — for providing critical products and services required for hospital-level care at home. This strong performance is likely to have continued in the fiscal third quarter.Story continuesEarnings Beat LikelyOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Cardinal Health this time around.

354,28dcf7f7-474e-38a4-a919-11b11319464a,MCK,2023-05-02,McKesson (MCK) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mckesson-mck-earnings-expected-grow-140102132.html,1682949662,STORY,"['MCK', 'CAH']","[The market expects McKesson (MCK) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 8, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis prescription drug distributor is expected to post quarterly earnings of $7.13 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +22.3%.Revenues are expected to be $67.93 billion, up 2.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.45% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for McKesson?For McKesson, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.22%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that McKesson will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that McKesson would post earnings of $6.34 per share when it actually produced earnings of $6.90, delivering a surprise of +8.83%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.McKesson appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Medical - Dental Supplies industry, Cardinal Health (CAH), is soon expected to post earnings of $1.48 per share for the quarter ended March 2023.

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. McKesson (MCK) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $7.22 a share seven days away from its upcoming earnings release on May 8, 2023.MCK has an Earnings ESP figure of 1.22%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $7.22 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.13.MCK is part of a big group of Medical stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at GSK (GSK) as well.GSK is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on July 26, 2023. GSK's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.84 a share 86 days from its next earnings release.For GSK, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.83 is 0.8%.Because both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, MCK and GSK could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Story continuesFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

In 2021, America spent 17.8% of its gross domestic product on healthcare, nearly twice as much as the average among OECD nations.Health spending per person in the U.S. was $12,914 in 2021, which was about $5,000 more than any other developed country. All told, the U.S. spends more than $4 trillion each year on healthcare, making it one of the leading sectors of the world’s biggest economy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe size of the healthcare market in America, and the sheer amount of money spent makes healthcare stocks an excellent investment.

In the last 20 years, McKesson has increased its annual revenue by an average of 8.9% per year and has been profitable nearly all that time.Looking ahead, McKesson recently raised its guidance for 2023, citing operational momentum in its pharmaceutical and medical device distribution business.Investors no doubt also like that McKesson has raised its quarterly dividend for 15 consecutive years, including a 14.8% increase in 2022. MCK stock dividend currently pays shareholders 54 cents a share each quarter, which equates to a yield of 0.59%.The stock got a lift last year after the company paid $7.4 billion to settle lawsuits related to the distribution of opioids, putting the case behind it.Abbott Laboratories (ABT)Abbott (ABT) sign with lighting behind lettersSource: testing / Shutterstock.comAbbott Laboratories’ (NYSE:ABT) stock has proven itself to be a long-term winner, having gained 85% in the last five years and 200% over the past decade.ABT stock has also gained 12% in the last six months, fueled by a string of better-than-expected earnings. The medical device company just reported its latest earnings beat that sent its share price up nearly 10% in a single trading session.The company’s earnings per share beat consensus estimates by four cents.The latest results from Abbott Labs were especially impressive as the company overcame a big slowdown in sales of its Covid-19 tests.

(NYSE: TRV), the country’s largest workers compensation insurer, today released its 2023 Injury Impact Report, which examined more than 1.2 million workers compensation claims from 2016 to 2020. The findings show that an employee’s time spent in a particular role and their age were driving factors in injury frequency and cost of claims, respectively.""The data clearly highlights two populations to watch when it comes to workplace injuries: new and aging employees,"" said Rich Ives, Vice President of Business Insurance Claim, Travelers. ""As employers navigate turnover and a multigenerational workforce, it’s important that they stay aware of the risks that come with changing worker demographics so they can help keep employees safe and businesses running.""Employees in their first year on a job, regardless of their age or industry experience, represented more than one-third (34%) of all claims and accounted for nearly 7 million missed workdays due to injury. Though they were injured less often than most other age groups, employees ages 60 and older had higher average costs per claim, totaling nearly 15% more than employees between the ages of 35 and 49 and approximately 140% more than those ages 18 to 24.Other highlights from the report include:The most common injuries – At 38%, strains and sprains accounted for the most injuries, followed by fractures (13%); contusions (8%); inflammation (7%); and dislocations (7%).The most common causes of injury – Overexertion caused the most claims (29%), followed by slips, trips and falls (23%); being struck by an object (13%); motor vehicle accidents (5%); and caught-in or caught-between hazards (5%).The costliest common claims – Dislocations were the costliest of the most common injuries, coming in at almost three times the average cost per claim. Slips, trips and falls were among the most common causes of injuries and cost 35% more than the average claim, closely followed by motor vehicle accidents (33%).Workdays missed due to injury – On average, the injuries analyzed resulted in 71 missed workdays.Story continuesThe construction industry had the highest average number of lost workdays per injury (99 workdays), followed by transportation (77 workdays).Injured employees from small businesses missed an average of 79 workdays.Slips, trips and falls caused employees to miss an average of 83 workdays, followed by motor vehicle accidents (79 workdays); overexertion (71 workdays); and being struck by an object (67 workdays).As for the outliers, amputations led to some of the most expensive claims, costing nearly five times the average, followed by electric shock and multiple trauma injuries, such as breaking multiple bones at once. Together, these injuries accounted for slightly more than 1% of claims.Ives added, ""After an injury, an employee’s road back to work can be difficult, and the longer they remain out, the harder it can be for them to return – especially if they’re dealing with a psychosocial barrier, such as fear or worry. That’s why a holistic approach to recovery is so critical, and why we recommend employers promptly file claims after an incident – so that injured workers can immediately receive the help they need.""To read the full report, visit Travelers.com/injuryimpactreport.About the 2023 Injury Impact ReportTravelers analyzed more than 1.2 million workers compensation claims it received between 2016 and 2020 from a variety of industries and business sizes.

It will also be Alberta's first commercial-scale hydrogen refueling station.This station is the next stage in Air Products' commitment to Edmonton and the province of Alberta. It will serve as a model that can be developed across Canada to foster the hydrogen economy, reduce emissions and support Canada in achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. The hydrogen refueling station is partially funded by Natural Resources Canada's Zero Emission Vehicle Infrastructure Program.The new station will have two hydrogen refueling lanes with dispensers for heavy-duty vehicles, such as commercial and municipal trucks, alongside Air Products' own truck fleet, with a filling time comparable to conventionally fueled heavy-duty trucks.The station will also feature two spots for light-duty hydrogen fuel cell vehicles to refuel. The advanced, high-capacity, high-efficiency station will be available to retail consumers and is slated to open in early 2025. The station will have a daily capacity of up to six tons of hydrogen using registered compression technology. It will be located in Northeast Edmonton near Air Products' transformative new net-zero hydrogen energy complex.The facility will make use of cutting-edge process technology that makes it possible to effectively capture more than 90% of carbon emissions for permanent sequestration safely underground. Additionally, the project includes a power generation unit that runs entirely on hydrogen to avoid the indirect emissions linked to using grid electricity. This enormous unit powers the manufacturing complex and provides clean energy to the Alberta grid.With the assistance of innovative engineering, the complex will also be connected with Imperial Oil Limited's new facility for producing renewable diesel locally. Using an approach that produces a biogenic renewable off-gas (ROG) by-product, Imperial will produce renewable diesel from locally obtained non-petroleum feedstocks. This ROG can substitute natural gas and improve the overall carbon emissions profile by being utilized as a feedstock in the Air Products hydrogen complex. The remaining 10% required to reach net-zero at the new hydrogen production facility is more than offset by the use of a renewable feedstock and power export.In order to aid customers in the refining and petrochemical industries in lowering the carbon intensity of their operations and products, the net-zero facility will connect to Air Products' current 55-kilometer pipeline network in the Alberta Heartland.Air Products, one of the major players in the chemicals space, along with Eastman Chemical Company EMN, Celanese Corporation CE and PPG Industries, Inc. PPG, currently operates three hydrogen production facilities in Alberta. It also has a hydrogen production facility, a 30-kilometer pipeline network and a liquefaction facility in Sarnia, Ontario.Additionally, Air Products has made plans to establish a new project delivery office in Edmonton. The engineering, product, process gas and air separation unit product line functions will all be housed in the Global Engineering and Manufacturing Technology Equipment office.Air Products, on its fiscal first-quarter call, said that it expects full-year fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $11.20-$11.50, indicating 9-12% year-over-year growth. For the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the company expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $2.50-$2.70, suggesting a rise of 7-15% from the year-ago quarter.Another prominent chemical maker, Eastman Chemical, recently delivered forecast-topping earnings performance in the first quarter. EMN’s adjusted EPS of $1.63 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.22. The company expects adjusted EPS for full-year 2023 to grow between 5% and 15%.PPG Industries’ first-quarter adjusted EPS of $1.82 also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.55, aided by pricing growth across segments, improved manufacturing efficiencies and overall cost discipline. PPG projects adjusted earnings of $6.95-$7.25 per share for 2023.Celanese is slated to report first-quarter earnings on May 9. CE, on its fourth-quarter call, said that it expects adjusted earnings of $1.50-$1.75 per share for the first quarter of 2023.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:FOX) has not been having the best time lately with all of its public relations disasters. The stock's performance in recent times has been unsatisfactory due to persistent legal risks and ongoing legal battles. Despite the company's low price-earnings ratio of 11, many investors remain hesitant on the stock due to these risks.Fox's Short-Term Issues Reveal Value OpportunityWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with FOX. Click here to check it out. FOX 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of FOXPeter Lynch Chart of FOXAlthough the company has significant financial resources, Fox's legal battles will undoubtedly negatively impact its performance in the short term. However, I believe the selloff is still overblown. Just because Fox knowingly lies about some things on the news doesn't mean people will suddenly stop wanting to watch its programs. Fox's news and sports programming are still among the most popular on cable TV, and the company's Tubi streaming platform is growing rapidly. Tubi's revenue has quadrupled since Fox acquired it in 2020, and its current viewership of over 60 million could potentially double Fox's current annual revenue within the next five years according to the company's estimates. As such, I believe Fox is worth considering for value investors with a long-term view.Fox is in the legal hot seatFox settled with Dominion Voting Systems for $787.5 million in one of the largest defamation suit payouts in U.S. history on Sept. 28, 2023. The Dominion settlement was significant, amounting to more than 50% of the trailing 12-month net income of $1.507 billion. While the settlement amount is easily covered by Fox's $4.058 billion in cash reserves, the company faces the risk of further lawsuits in the future. Such lawsuits could create a black cloud hanging over the company, despite its top-rated cable status and loyal following.The Dominion settlement was undoubtedly better for Fox shareholders than the $1.6 billion Dominion sought. However, the settlement came late, with the jury already seated. Fox was facing the possibility of having its top anchors testify in court about election fraud. A pre-trial settlement was likely the best way out for Fox, rather than risking damage to the company's reputation.Story continuesFox is also facing a $2.7 billion defamation lawsuit from Smartmatic, a voting technology company, and other defendants. The Dominion settlement sets a precedent, making Fox more likely to have to write another significant check.There are also potential class action suits against Fox by shareholders seeking to make management liable for these costs that would have been avoidable if Fox didn't knowingly report false information.What are the advertisers thinking?Fox's ongoing legal battles may cause advertisers to rethink their partnerships with the company. Advertisers generally avoid controversy and try to appeal to a broad spectrum of consumers. Although Fox's sports and news programming are some of cable TV's biggest draws, it is important to evaluate the potential impact of these legal issues carefully.High-profile exits such as Tucker Carlson's departure from Fox News may also impact the company's brand and overall perception in the market, albeit not necessarily immediately or significantly. The financial impact may depend on Carlson's replacement and their success.Tubi is a key reason to remain optimisticFox's unique entry into the streaming space with Tubi is growing at an impressive rate and could double its annual revenue within the next five years, according to the company's estimates. The ad-supported streaming platform, which Fox acquired in 2020, has quadrupled its own revenue since then, and it has only begun to scratch the surface of its potential.While Fox's cable TV programming, particularly sports and news, has always been a reliable revenue producer, Tubi has proven a worthy addition to the company's portfolio. With over 60 million regular viewers, Tubi is among the top free ad-supported television platforms and contributed to 1% of the total time spent on streaming content in February.Integrating Tubi's tech with VideoAmp's Premium Video Planning Tool, LiveRamp TV Activation's platform and Comscore's measurement tool has bolstered the platform's appeal to advertisers, allowing them to plan their spending and forecast the results of ad campaigns better.Although the profitability of Tubi remains uncertain, Fox's traditional television business has proven to be a reliable revenue and profit producer. The company's savvy approach to picking or producing content that attracts advertisers, coupled with the growth potential of Tubi, makes it an overlooked gem in the media industry.Fox still has good ratingsAlthough Fox's network broadcast generally ranks fourth among the nation's four major names, most of the most-watched cable news shows in the U.S. are Fox programs. Thus, Fox's programming stands out as some of the most widely viewed on television, thanks to the success of its network-broadcast shows such as The Simpsons, The Masked Singer and 9-1-1, along with its other offerings.Fox's success extends to sports broadcasting as well. The company aired this year's Super Bowl, which drew the largest audience for the big game since 2017, the last time Fox produced it. In addition, Fox led viewership for the recent regular season of college basketball and performed well with baseball.Although Fox pays a considerable amount for the broadcasting rights of these prestigious events, such as the 2022 World Series, the investment is justified due to the company's reputation as one of the most reliable revenue and profit producers in the TV industry. Despite the fluctuating advertising market, Fox's financial results are resilient. With its ability to offer top-rated TV content that consistently generates viewership and ad revenue, Fox is a formidable force in the industry.TakeawayDespite Fox's ongoing legal battles and the potential impact on its performance in the short term, the company's balanced portfolio of traditional TV and on-demand platforms, including its streaming platform Tubi, make it an overlooked gem in the media industry in my opinion.With its proven ability to attract advertisers through its reliable ratings and popular programming, combined with the growth potential of Tubi, Fox has great long-term potential that I belive is well worth the risk given the low valuation.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

AND SUBSIDIARIESSEGMENT INFORMATION(Unaudited)REORGANIZATION WITHIN CERTAIN SEGMENTS, REBRANDING A SEGMENT AND TRANSFER OF A JOINT VENTURE BETWEEN SEGMENTSBeginning in the first quarter of 2023, we realigned certain businesses and regions within our reportable segments to be consistent with how our segment managers monitor the performance of our segments. We reorganized the businesses within our Components segment to carve out the electronics business into the newly formed software and electronics business and combined the turbo technologies and fuel systems businesses into the newly formed engine components business. Our Components segment now consists of the following businesses: axles and brakes, emission solutions, engine components, filtration, automated transmissions and software and electronics. As a result of the indefinite suspension of operations in Russia, we reorganized the regional management structure of our Distribution segment and moved all Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) sales into the Europe and Africa and Middle East regions. The Russian portion of prior period CIS sales moved to the Europe region. In March 2023, we rebranded our New Power segment as ""Accelera"" to better represent our commitment to zero-emission technologies. In addition, we moved our NPROXX joint venture from the Accelera segment to the Engine segment, which adjusted both the equity, royalty and interest income from investees and segment EBITDA line items for the current and prior year. We started to report results for the changes within our operating segments effective January 1, 2023, and reflected these changes in the historical periods presented. These changes had no impact on our consolidated results. Descriptions of the new Components' businesses and adjusted prior period balances for all segments are shown below:Components SegmentEngine components - We design, manufacture and market turbocharger, valvetrain and fuel system technologies for light-duty, mid-range, heavy-duty and high-horsepower markets across North America, Europe, China and India.Software and electronics - We develop, supply and remanufacture control units, specialty sensors, power electronics, actuators and software for on-highway, off-highway and power generation applications. We primarily serve markets in the Americas, China, India and Europe.Adjusted balances for the Components' businesses are shown in the ""SEGMENT SALES DATA"" section below under ""Components Segment Sales by Business.""External sales in 2022 and 2021 for our Components segment by business, as adjusted, were as follows:2022In millionsQ1Q2Q3Q4YTDAxles and brakes$—$—$732$1,147$1,879Emission solutions8087677487633,086Engine components240223239244946Filtration3083193223101,259Automated transmissions134143159157593Software and electronics2725201284Total sales$1,517$1,477$2,220$2,633$7,8472021In millionsYTDEmission solutions$3,142Engine components1,019...Filtration1,171Automated transmissions481Software and electronics119Total sales$5,932Distribution SegmentTotal segment sales in 2022 and 2021 for our Distribution segment by region, as adjusted, were as follows:2022In millionsQ1Q2Q3Q4YTDNorth America$1,367$1,494$1,512$1,575$5,948Asia Pacific2462422602681,016Europe281248182218929China83999281355Africa and Middle East50617961251Latin America41565855210India49535662220Total sales$2,117$2,253$2,239$2,320$8,9292021In millionsYTDNorth America$4,912Asia Pacific906Europe966China330Africa and Middle East278Latin America182India198Total sales$7,772External sales in 2022 and 2021 for our Distribution segment by region, as adjusted, were as follows:2022In millionsQ1Q2Q3Q4YTDNorth America$1,371$1,491$1,512$1,574$5,948Asia Pacific2442422582671,011Europe275246181212914China82998981351Africa and Middle East50617960250Latin America41565855210India48525562217Total sales$2,111$2,247$2,232$2,311$8,9012021In millionsYTDNorth America$4,902Asia Pacific901Europe962China323Africa and Middle East278Latin America182India194Total sales$7,742Accelera Segment NPROXX joint venture move to Engine SegmentThe move of our NPROXX joint venture from our Accelera segment to Engine segment resulted in adjustments to prior period balances as follows:20222021In millionsQ1Q2Q3Q4TotalTotalEngineEquity, royalty and interest income from investees, as disclosed$44$59$28$35$166$340NPROXX loss adjustment(2)(1)(1)(2)(6)(5)Equity, royalty and interest income from investees, as adjusted$42$58$27$33$160$335Segment EBITDA, as disclosed$392$422$363$364$1,541$1,411NPROXX loss adjustment(2)(1)(1)(2)(6)(5)Segment EBITDA, as adjusted$390$421$362$362$1,535$1,406Investments and advances to equity investees, as disclosed$590$742NPROXX investment adjustment2729Investments and advances to equity investees, as adjusted$617$771AcceleraEquity, royalty and interest (loss) income from investees, as disclosed$(3)$(4)$(5)$4$(8)$(3)NPROXX loss adjustment211265Equity, royalty and interest (loss) income from investees, as adjusted$(1)$(3)$(4)$6$(2)$2Segment EBITDA, as disclosed$(67)$(80)$(96)$(97)$(340)$(223)NPROXX loss adjustment211265Segment EBITDA, as adjusted$(65)$(79)$(95)$(95)$(334)$(218)Investments and advances to equity investees, as disclosed$60$49NPROXX investment adjustment(27)(29)Investments and advances to equity investees, as adjusted$33$20Summarized financial information regarding our reportable operating segments for the three months ended, including adjusted prior year balances for the changes noted above, is shown in the table below:In millionsComponentsEngineDistributionPower SystemsAcceleraTotal SegmentsIntersegment Eliminations (1)TotalThree months ended March 31, 2023External sales$3,043$2,252$2,399$679$80$8,453$—$8,453Intersegment sales514734766451,924(1,924)—Total sales3,5572,9862,4061,3438510,377(1,924)8,453Research, development and engineering expenses91134146348350—350Equity, royalty and interest income (loss) from investees21652413(4)119—119Interest income6372—18—18EBITDA (2)507(3)457335219(94)1,424(63)1,361Depreciation and amortization (4)12351282914245—245EBITDA as a percentage of total sales14.3%15.3%13.9%16.3%NM13.7%16.1%Three months ended March 31, 2022External sales$1,517$2,049$2,111$683$25$6,385$—$6,385Intersegment sales471704647761,664(1,664)—Total sales1,9882,7532,1171,160318,049(1,664)6,385Research, development and engineering expenses76109136436298—298Equity, royalty and interest income (loss) from investees2842(5)1611(1)96—96Interest income1421—8—8Russian suspension costs632(6)10020—158—158EBITDA (2)32039011090(65)845(90)755Depreciation and amortization (4)435128317160—160EBITDA as a percentage of total sales16.1%14.2%5.2%7.8%NM10.5%11.8%""NM"" - not meaningful information(1)Includes intersegment sales, intersegment profit in inventory eliminations and unallocated corporate expenses.

AND SUBSIDIARIESFINANCIAL MEASURES THAT SUPPLEMENT GAAP(Unaudited)Reconciliation of Non GAAP measures - Earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and noncontrolling interests (EBITDA)We believe EBITDA is a useful measure of our operating performance as it assists investors and debt holders in comparing our performance on a consistent basis without regard to financing methods, capital structure, income taxes or depreciation and amortization methods, which can vary significantly depending upon many factors. We believe EBITDA excluding special items is a useful measure of our operating performance without regard to the costs associated with the planned separation of our filtration business and indefinite suspension of Russian operations. This statement excludes forward looking measures of EBITDA where a reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available due to the variability, complexity and limited visibility of non-cash items that are excluded from the non-GAAP outlook measure.EBITDA is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) and may not be consistent with measures used by other companies. It should be considered supplemental data; however, the amounts included in the EBITDA calculation are derived from amounts included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Net Income.

(NYSE:CMI) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 85%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cummins-inc-nyse-cmi-favorite-140018308.html,1682949618,STORY,['CMI'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Cummins' stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisionsA total of 23 investors have a majority stake in the company with 51% ownership Insiders have sold recently If you want to know who really controls Cummins Inc. (NYSE:CMI), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 85% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Cummins. Check out our latest analysis for Cummins ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Cummins?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Cummins. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Cummins' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Cummins. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.3% of shares outstanding. With 8.2% and 4.4% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 23 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of CumminsWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Cummins Inc.. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$149m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 14% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Cummins better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Cummins   you should know about.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

(AP Photo/John Raoux, File)Quotable: DeSantis’ board wants to undo Disney’s deal with its “puppet government”“In an effort to stymie Florida’s elected representatives, Disney covertly cobbled together a series of eleventh- hour deals with its soon-to-be-replaced puppet government. [...] But perhaps out of haste or arrogance, Disney’s deals violate basic principles of Florida constitutional, statutory, and common law. As a result, they are null and void—not even worth the paper they were printed on.” —Central Florida Tourism Oversight District board’s lawsuit against DisneyCentral Florida Tourism Oversight District’s lawsuit against Disney, by the digits188: Pages in the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District’s complaint, where it seeks to render Disney’s eleventh-hour development agreement with the Reedy Creek Improvement District as unenforceable, null, and void. They’re also trying to erase the royal clause from the agreement, which effectively makes it last in perpetuity.55: Years Disney has been in charge of levying taxes, administering its own police and fire departments, and running its water and sewage systems, among other things. The arrangement has been in place since 1967, when the Florida legislature created the Reedy Creek Improvement district.Story continues27,000 acres: Land that came under the Disney-affiliated board’s purview for all these decades.70,000+: Jobs Disney creates in Florida, which former the home state of South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, who is also a contender for the Republican presidential nomination, “will happily accept” if Disney wants to leave Florida, according to Haley’s April 26 tweet. “SC’s not woke, but we’re not sanctimonious about it either,” she added.$1.146 billion: How much Disney World paid in state and local taxes in 2022, as Central Florida’s “largest single taxpayer.”$17 billion: How much Disney plans to invest in Walt Disney World over the next decade.Person of interest: Possible Republican presidential contender Ron DeSantisPicking a fight with Disney, a massive source of economic growth and job creation in the state, is not a good look for DeSantis. The Republican who is rumored to declare his presidency run any day now is facing criticism for his own party over it.Former president Donald Trump—who still remains a favorite presidential candidate even as he faces criminal charges over a hush money case—labeled the feud a “political stunt.”Trump isn’t the only critic. Former New Jersey governor Chris Christie of New Jersey, at a recent event hosted by news outlet Semafor, said that DeSantis’s actions towards Disney went against conservative ideology. “Where are we headed here now that, if you express disagreement in this country, the government is now going to punish you? To me, that’s what I always thought liberals did, and now all of a sudden here we are participating in this with a Republican governor,” he said.A brief timeline of the tussle between Disney and DeSantis’s boardMar. 2022: Florida passes the so-called “Don’t Say Gay” bill, which then-Disney CEO Bob Chapek condemns after facing backlash for his silence on the matter.Apr. 2022: Florida legislation passes a bill that would dissolve Disney’s special tax district by June 1, 2023, if DeSantis signs it into law. The idea is shelved because it would burden local governments in central Florida with more than $1 billion in bond debt.Feb. 8, 2023: The outgoing Disney-controlled board, the Reedy Creek Improvement District, approves a long-term development agreement that lets Disney retain maximum developmental power. It will leave just the maintenance of the roads and basic infrastructure to DeSantis’s new board.Also Feb. 8: The Florida House votes to put the governor in charge of Disney’s special district.Feb. 27: DeSantis replaces Disney-allied board members with five Republicans he handpicked on Feb. 27.Mar. 29: The new board seeks legal representation after realizing Disney has quietly retained control of most developmental processes.Apr. 3: In a letter to Florida’s chief inspector general Melina Miguel, DeSantis accuses the Reedy Creek Improvement District board of “collusive and self-dealing arrangements,” asking Miguel to kickstart a “thorough review and investigation” into the development agreement reached earlier this year by the outgoing Disney board.Apr. 26: Disney sues DeSantis, board chair Martin Garcia and other board members, acting secretary of the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity Meredith Ivey, and the district’s administrator. The entertainment giant said it “regrets that it has come to this, but having exhausted efforts to seek a resolution, the company is left with no choice but to file this lawsuit to protect its cast members, guests, and local development partners from a relentless campaign to weaponize government power against Disney in retaliation for expressing a political viewpoint unpopular with certain State officials.”May 1: The Central Florida Tourism Oversight District votes to countersue in the morning, and files the lawsuit in circuit court in Orange County by afternoon.Related stories🗣️ Disney sues Ron DeSantis on First Amendment grounds🎢 Disney’s feud with Florida’s Ron DeSantis keeps escalating⚖️ Florida’s battle with Disney, explainedMore from QuartzThe world’s biggest banknote printer said the demand for cash hit a two-decade lowWhat were the world's busiest airports in 2022?Sign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

It’s also a standout among top ETFs, having run from $25.50 in 2011 to a peak of $80 last year.

For one, AAP announced on Feb. 28 that its CEO would retire. However, shareholders need not worry since the company has a succession plan and is searching for a replacement.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIn addition, just last year the company invested in inventory to meet its customer needs. This will expand profitability as demand from the professional installer and do-it-yourself customer markets improve. Also, CEO Greco said that AAP is working through its strategic plan from 2024 through 2026. Before that, it will have the integration work completed, benefiting from the realized transformation cost reduction.At the moment, AAP carries a dividend yield of 4.84%.Altria Group (MO)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockWith a yield of 7.96%, Altria Group (NYSE:MO) is pivoting from smoking and tobacco to non-nicotine products. After all, profitability and revenue from the former are on the decline. So, it’s now betting on non-nicotine products to lift its bottom line.  For example, at its Investor Day on March 24, it introduced Swic, a heated tobacco product, where consumers may inhale a cigarette-like capsule. It also introduced On Plus, Altria’s newest oral tobacco innovation.Altria’s purchase of NJOY expands the product pipeline considerably. NJOY is a pod-based e-vapor product sold at around 33,000 U.S. retail stores. It has strong growth potential ahead once Altria expands its currently small sales force. By increasing the limited distribution and visibility of NJOY’s Ace product line, investors will recognize the newfound growth in the company. NJOY’s products include the e-vapor device and five various pods with unique tobacco flavors.Story continuesFord Motor (F)The word ""dividend"" highlighted in a dictionary.Source: ShutterstockWith a dividend yield of 5.14%, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) is in transition as it migrates out of the gas-powered sedan market. In fact, the Vice President of Product Development, Jim Baumbick, said the company can manage its core business while transforming into the electric vehicle market. In the electric vehicle space, Ford has the Mustang Mach-E, F-150 Lightning, and E-Transit. The latter two products will increase its market share in the commercial space.Kellogg (K)dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockWith a yield of 3.45%, Kellogg (NYSE:K) is a food manufacturing company. For 2023, the company expects to grow net sales by 5% to 7%. Demand for snacks will continue. In addition, Kellogg will benefit from strong performance in emerging markets.CEO Steven Cahillane said that noodle sales thrived in Africa. Snack and cereal sales grew across the EMEA and Latin American geographies. The company offset the negative impact of high input costs by achieving productivity. It also managed through the supply bottleneck and shortages.Kellogg may continue to face profit margin pressure from inflation. However, it has strong pricing power. While it negotiates with customers on price, the company may offer consumer promotions to sustain its sales momentum.Merck (MRK)sheet of paper marked ""dividends"" with a $20 bill on top of it to represent dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockWith a yield of 2.57%, Merck(NYSE:MRK) announced a significant improvement in eight of nine measures for Sotatercept. This is a biologic that treats adult patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Side effects of the drug are not a concern. The President of Merck Human Health U.S., Carter Gould, said that subjects did not have side effects that resulted in discontinuation during the trial.The strong efficacy of Sotatercept is a welcome development for MRK stock. Although shares trade near all-time highs, Merck has a rich pipeline. For example, in cardiovascular, the pipeline has a $10 billion commercial revenue potential by the mid-2030s.Keytruda is another revenue growth generator. Between now and 2025, Jannie Oosthuizen said that drugs treating breast and melanoma will become 25% of Keytruda’s revenue. This drug treats triple-negative breast cancer.ONEOK (OKE)image of hands holding small money bag symbolizing dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockWith an impressive yield of 5.81%, ONEOK (NYSE:OKE) is focused primarily on the natural gas industry. The company not only posted strong growth in the fourth quarter but expects higher 2023 results.In the last quarter, ONEOK posted adjusted EBITDA growing by 14% Y/Y. For 2023, it expects adjusted EBITDA of $4.575 billion at the midpoint. This year, it will support its growth by allocating its capital to high-return organic projects. CEO Pierce Norton said that those projects will lead to higher earnings as the company realizes high returns. This enables ONEOK to increase its dividend.The company faced weak prices for gas like ethane in the last quarter. However, it already contracted prices and the price spread. This allows ONEOK to find opportunities as gas prices fall. When demand strengthens locally and internationally, the firm’s profit margins will rise. The company may apply stronger cash flow to pay down its debt.PepsiCo (PEP)A stock market ticker tape projects the word ""DIVIDENDS"" in white text. representing dividend stocks to buySource: ShutterstockFinally, with a dividend yield of 2.44%, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) has strong branding power that investors may sleep well at night holding shares. In the last quarter, the company earned $1.67 a share. Its revenue grew by 10.9% Y/Y to $28 billion. For 2023, Pepsi expects to grow organic revenue by 6%.As one of the largest food and beverage companies, Pepsi thrives from its healthy portfolio of brands that consumers recognize. 68% of its business is from convenience foods while the rest is in beverages. Pepsi has a competitive advantage through its agriculture ingredient sourcing. Customers who buy Pepsi are getting ingredients from over 60 countries that create over 100,000 agricultural jobs.Consumers may cut back on spending, as their disposable income falls. However, it’s a good bet they won’t stop buying junk foods like Doritos, Cheetos, and Lays for comfort.On the date of publication, Chris Lau did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

And for those interested in a more conservative approach in the near-term, considering low-beta stocks could be a beneficial strategy.Three top-ranked low-beta stocks – PepsiCo PEP, General Mills GIS, and Colgate-Palmolive CL – have all provided solid gains over the last three months, as we can see illustrated below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, all three reside in the Zacks Consumer Staples sector, an area that companies have been able to utilize their pricing power and deliver better-than-expected quarterly results.PepsiCoConsumer Staples titan PepsiCo posted strong quarterly results in its latest release just on April 25th, providing upbeat guidance and delivering a positive 9.5% EPS surprise. PEP’s top line results were also strong, with revenue growing 10% year-over-year.The market took the quarterly results in stride, with PEP shares finding plenty of buyers post-earnings and closing 2.5% higher.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUndoubtedly impressive, the company is a member of the elite Dividend Kings club, reflecting a commitment to increasingly rewarding shareholders with steady payouts. Currently, PEP’s dividend yields 2.4% annually, a few ticks below the Zacks Consumer Staples sector average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAnd for the cherry on top, the company is forecasted to continue grow steadily, with earnings estimated to climb 7% in its current fiscal year (FY23) and a further 8% in FY24. The projected earnings growth comes on the back of forecasted revenue growth of 4.5% in FY23 and 5% in FY24.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPricing power leading to strong quarterly results, a shareholder-friendly nature, and steady forecasted growth all make PEP a stock worthy of a watchlist spot.General MillsGeneral Mills reported its FY23 Q3 results back in late March. Results came in better-than-expected, with the company raising its FY23 guidance and delivering a beat on the top and bottom line partly thanks to pricing power.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs we can see in the chart below by the green arrow circled, investors cheered on the results.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchShares could appear a bit stretched from a valuation perspective, with the current 19.9X forward twelve-month earnings multiple sitting well above the 16.1X five-year median and a few ticks above the Zacks Consumer Staples sector average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAnd perhaps to the surprise of some, GIS shares have been visibly strong over the last five years, penciling in a sizable 150% gain and crushing the S&amp;P 500’s performance.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchColgate-PalmoliveColgate-Palmolive is a global leader in the oral care hygiene market. Analysts have pushed their earnings estimates higher across all timeframes as of late, indicating an optimistic near-term outlook.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLike most Consumer Staples stocks, CL rewards its shareholders via its dividend that currently yields 2.4% annually. While the yield is below the Zacks sector average, the company’s 2.6% five-year annualized dividend growth rate helps bridge the gap.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineWith a looming FOMC meeting and a schedule packed full of earnings, investors will have plenty to remain busy this week.And as we’ve all witnessed over the last year, FOMC meetings have regularly brought increased volatility into the market.Of course, we’ll have to wait for the final decision, but it remains likely for the Fed to raise rates a further 25bps.For those interested in a more conservative approach in the near-term, all three low-beta stocks above – PepsiCo PEP, General Mills GIS, and Colgate-Palmolive CL – would be great considerations.All three sport an improved earnings outlook and have recently provided better-than-expected results, with pricing power helping lead the way.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. So while Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) has a high ROCE right now, lets see what we can decipher from how returns are changing.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Colgate-Palmolive:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.28 = US$3.3b ÷ (US$16b - US$4.4b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Therefore, Colgate-Palmolive has an ROCE of 28%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Household Products industry average of 13%. See our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive roceIn the above chart we have measured Colgate-Palmolive's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.So How Is Colgate-Palmolive's ROCE Trending?In terms of Colgate-Palmolive's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. To be more specific, while the ROCE is still high, it's fallen from 43% where it was five years ago. However it looks like Colgate-Palmolive might be reinvesting for long term growth because while capital employed has increased, the company's sales haven't changed much in the last 12 months. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayIn summary, Colgate-Palmolive is reinvesting funds back into the business for growth but unfortunately it looks like sales haven't increased much just yet. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 43% over the last five years. However, unless these underlying trends turn more positive, we wouldn't get our hopes up too high.One more thing to note, we've identified   3 warning signs  with Colgate-Palmolive and understanding these should be part of your investment process.If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

No such deal could ever be contemplated by this membership.""The WGA had been negotiating with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which bargains on behalf of studios including Netflix, Amazon, Apple, Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery NBCUniversal, Paramount, and Sony.Writers Guild of America (WGA) writers and others strike against the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) in a rally at Fox Plaza in Los Angeles' Century City district on Nov. 9, 2007. (AP Photo/Reed Saxon, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)The 6-week talks centered on pay concerns brought on by the streaming boom, in addition to other fundamental changes within entertainment like the recent wave of cost-cutting that has prompted media giants from Disney (DIS) to Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) to enact mass layoffs and shelve multiple projects.""The AMPTP presented a comprehensive package proposal to the Guild last night which included generous increases in compensation for writers as well as improvements in streaming residuals,"" the AMPTP said in a statement. ""The AMPTP also indicated to the WGA that it is prepared to improve that offer, but was unwilling to do so because of the magnitude of other proposals still on the table that the Guild continues to insist upon.""Story continuesYahoo Finance reached out for additional comment from the major Hollywood studios engaged in the talks but did not immediately hear back.How we got hereThe TV and movie industry today is being dramatically reshaped by the impact of streaming services.Streaming shows often have fewer episodes and less residual income compared to traditional network television, which often means less money in the pockets of writers.At the same time, the majority of studios are no longer just ""pure play"" production houses. Rather, they have their own streaming divisions, which have brought on a new set of challenges as direct-to-consumer losses mount.""Whether this is a blip on the radar or a prolonged strike like in 2007 remains to be seen,"" Scott Purdy, US media industry leader at KPMG, told Yahoo Finance. ""In the near term though, consumers should prepare for some of their favorite TV shows to be delayed and to potentially enter a period where there’s a limited amount of new content to watch. We’ll be watching to see how this impacts subscription decisions with inflation-pinched consumers who were already reassessing their spending habits.""Late night television shows will be the first to feel the impact.Seth Meyers, who hosts NBC's ""Late Night"" show, said over the weekend said these changes don't ""just affect the writers, [they affect] all the incredible non-writing staff on these shows. ... What the writers are asking for is not unreasonable.""Host Seth Meyers during the monologue on May 1, 2023. (Photo by: Lloyd Bishop/NBC via Getty Images) (NBC via Getty Images)Studio executives have said they have enough scripted content banked to prevent disruptions to the content pipeline.""We have a large base of upcoming shows and films from around the world, so we could probably serve our members better than most,"" Netflix (NFLX) co-CEO Ted Sarandos said during the company's quarterly earnings call last month.Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav echoed similar sentiments during the company's Max streaming launch presentation last month, telling reporters, ""We've got ourselves ready. We've had a lot of content that's been produced and we are launching a product on May 23. So, we are ready to go guns blazing in terms of our product and our platforms around the world.""The box office should also be safe, according to industry executives: ""For films coming out this year, the strike really doesn't have an impact,"" IMAX (IMAX) CEO Richard Gelfond told Yahoo Finance Live on Monday. ""It's a question of how long it goes on for and what happens next year.""The writers' strike will likely have serious economic implications, as the last strike demonstrated.According to estimates from the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp., that strike, which lasted 100 days from November 2007 to February 2008, cost the Los Angeles County economy a whopping $2.5 billion.""I don't think you want a writers' strike,"" Citi's Jason Bazinet previously told Yahoo Finance Live.

The company's shares saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s examine Comcast’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. See our latest analysis for Comcast What's The Opportunity In Comcast?Great news for investors – Comcast is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $62.50, but it is currently trading at US$41.64 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. What’s more interesting is that, Comcast’s share price is theoretically quite stable, which could mean two things: firstly, it may take the share price a while to move to its intrinsic value, and secondly, there may be less chances to buy low in the future once it reaches that value. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.Can we expect growth from Comcast?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Comcast's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since CMCSA is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on CMCSA for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy CMCSA. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed buy.So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

Start your free 7-day trial to get on board.Shares gained around 10% on Thursday after the company reported its Q1 results, with both EPS and revenues coming in better than the consensus estimates.According to BofA Securities, stronger-than-anticipated results in Content &amp; Experiences (C&amp;E), a net increase in broadband subscribers, and solid cost control/reductions at Connectivity &amp; Platforms (C&amp;P) drove the beat. The firm sees Comcast at a turning point, with promising prospects for a robust media operations turnaround, and its connectivity business enjoying low churn, substantial ARPU growth, and solid growth in Business Services.Zillow upgraded to Market Perform ahead of the Q1 earnings announcement Bernstein upgraded Zillow (NASDAQ:ZG) to Market Perform from Underperform and raised its price target to $45.00 from $35.00. This follows the firm’s May 2022 coverage initiation which expressed concerns about negative revision risks in revenues and profits. Since then, revenue and adjusted EBITDA forecasts have dropped significantly.According to the firm, the easing of comps and signs of a bottomed core business have increased its optimism about Zillow's prospects. However, to warrant an Outperform rating, the firm seeks more visibility on the recovery curve and acknowledges that the revenue outlook is still uncertain and the stock isn't particularly cheap.The company is set to report its Q1/23 earnings on Wednesday after the market close.General Motors upgraded to Overweight Morgan Stanley upgraded General Motors (NYSE:GM) to Overweight from Equalweight and raised its price target to $38.00 from $35.00, noting it believes the stock is “oversold” and offers an attractive risk-reward.Story continuesThe firm emphasized last week’s Q1 beat-and-raise results and the internal combustion franchise that has shown more strength and resilience than originally anticipated. The firm anticipates a slower decline in the use of internal combustion engines in the U.S. market than previously predicted, as well as a significant increase in the conversion of free cash flow over the course of the internal combustion runoff vs. history. This is due to a reduced investment burden and a more targeted/premium approach.2 more upgradesNorthland Capital Markets upgraded Power Integrations (NASDAQ:POWI) to Outperform from Market Perform with a price target of $82.00, noting it estimates strong quarter-over-quarter growth in Q2 and Q3, up 15% and 25%, respectively. “These numbers could prove to be low relative to a potential Q1 beat and Q2 raise,” added the firm.Shares gained 3% today.The company will report its Q1/23 earnings on Thursday after the market close.Stifel upgraded Scotts Miracle-Gro (NYSE:SMG) to Buy from Hold and raised its price target to $80.00 from $65.00, outlining an attractive near-term set-up for the shares with a margin recovery enabling outsized EPS growth alongside advantaged long-term growth prospects it believes are undervalued at current levels.The stock has experienced fluctuations in price, and there has been a lot of attention paid to the negative impact of weather conditions in March. While a headwind, Stifel believes the outsized attention is misplaced with April weather of greater consequence and favorable. More importantly, the firm believes the recent update on the company's leverage suggests a more robust margin outlook, providing added flexibility to achieve 2023 profit guidance.Shares rose more than 5% today.The company is set to report its Q2/23 earnings on Wednesday before the market opens.Related Articles5 big analyst picks: Comcast upgraded to Buy following ‘super quarter’ | Pro RecapWall Street near flat after First Republic news, awaiting FedMorgan Stanley to cut 3,000 jobs in second quarter - source]"

AIZ, Prudential Financial PRU, Unum Group UNM, RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd. RNR and American Financial Group, Inc. AFG, which are due to report tomorrow. However, an active catastrophe level and inflationary pressure are likely to have weighed on their performance.Improved pricing, solid retention and exposure growth across business lines are likely to have aided premiums. An active catastrophe environment accelerated the policy renewal rate and aided in better pricing in the first quarter. Per a report by MarketScout, commercial property and casualty insurance rates in the United States increased more than 5% in the to-be-reported quarter.The first quarter of 2023 bore the brunt of March storms. Aon estimates insured losses in the first quarter to be $15 billion, while economic losses are estimated to be $63 million. Nonetheless, better pricing, reinsurance arrangements, portfolio repositioning, reinsurance covers, favorable reserve development and prudent underwriting are likely to drive an improvement in underwriting results.Increased travel across the world is likely to have induced higher auto premiums. A stronger mortgage market is likely to have favored mortgage insurance premiums. A low unemployment rate is likely to have aided commercial insurance and group insurance.Insurers, being beneficiaries of an improving rate environment, are likely to witness improved investment results. The first quarter witnessed one rate hike by the Fed. A larger investment asset base, higher reinvestment rate and alternative investments in private equity, hedge funds and real estate among others are expected to have aided net investment income.Accelerated digitalization is expected to have saved costs, thus aiding margins. A solid capital position is likely to have aided insurers in strategic mergers and acquisitions to sharpen their competitive edge, build on a niche, expand geographically and diversify their portfolio, apart from enhancing shareholders value via share buybacks and raising dividends.Let’s take a sneak peek into how the abovementioned insurers are poised prior to their first-quarter 2023 earnings on May 2.According to the Zacks model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Assurant’s first-quarter revenues are likely to have benefited from improved net earned premiums, higher fees and other income and net investment income. Earnings for the first quarter are expected to grow year over year, mainly driven by improved performance in Global Housing, as well as more modest growth in Global Lifestyle. Total benefits, losses and expenses might have escalated because of higher policyholder benefits, underwriting, selling, general and administrative expenses, goodwill impairment and interest expense. Continued share buybacks are likely to have aided the bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter.

New research from PGIM DC Solutions, the retirement solutions provider of PGIM, finds that 7 in 10 DC plan sponsors report taking steps to solve the retirement income challenge, but there is more work to be done.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230501005080/en/Mikaylee O’Connor, Principal, Senior Defined Contribution Strategist, PGIM DC Solutions (Photo: Business Wire)""As DC plans continue to evolve from savings vehicles to true retirement plans, retirement income will become a more pertinent focus area for plan sponsors, requiring more research and action,"" said Mikaylee O’Connor, senior defined contribution strategist, PGIM DC Solutions. ""Plan sponsors don’t need to face this journey alone — they should continue to leverage experts and lean on strategic partners for guidance.""Additional findings include:Plan sponsors are in various stages of their retirement income journey: A plurality (34%) is studying retirement income approaches, and 15% are in the process of evaluating or implementing a solution. However, 27% of plan sponsors admit retirement income is not currently a topic of interest or need.Stable value funds are the most common solution: When it comes to products and solutions designed to support retirement income, plan sponsors cite stable value (70%) and the income fund in a target-date series (46%) as the most offered vehicles.Annuity consideration is on the rise: Products most likely to be considered for future inclusion in 401(k) plans include annuities, long-duration fixed income funds, and managed accounts that support decumulation.PGIM’s research, conducted in partnership with Coalition Greenwich, is based on a survey of 155 DC plan sponsors and sought to better understand the evolving DC landscape, including 401(k) menu design, retirement income solutions, and the use of environmental, social and governance (ESG) investments.Story continuesAre alternative investments on the rise in 401(k)s?More DC plan sponsors report offering alternative investment options on their 401(k) menu, with 21% indicating they offer at least one option in 2022 compared to only 9% in 2020.* Alternative investment options were defined in the survey as liquid alternatives, real estate private equity, real estate private debt, private credit or hedge funds.Despite their popularity in institutional portfolios, alternatives to traditional stocks and bonds are still not commonplace in 401(k) plans or within target-date funds. Plan sponsors’ top reasons for not adding alternatives to the investment menu or target-date fund series include the need for participant education, operational challenges, cost, and litigation risk.Retirement plans less interested in ESGOn the hot-button issue of ESG investing, plan sponsor views are mixed, with only 1 in 4 (28%) plan sponsors reporting at least one ESG fund on their 401(k) menu, and 12% offering an ESG target-date fund series. For 36% of respondents, ESG is not a topic of interest.O’Connor added, ""ESG continues to be an evolving area with differing views, changing definitions, a variety of approaches, and regulatory impacts. Our research indicates most plan sponsors are in one of three camps: those who have taken action, those who are still evaluating, and those who are not considering ESG for their 401(k) plan at all.""More detailed findings on the survey can be found here: The Evolving DC LandscapeABOUT THE SURVEYThe research was conducted by Coalition Greenwich from May 23 to Aug. 26, 2022, using an online, quantitative approach with 155 DC plan sponsors who have at least one 401(k) plan and at least $100 million in 401(k) assets.

KMPR.Industry: Insurance - MultilineLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2087026/5-stocks-to-watch-from-the-thriving-multiline-insurance-industryProduct diversification helps Zacks Multiline Insurance industry players to lower concentration risk, ensure uninterrupted revenue generation and improve retention ratio. Better pricing, prudent underwriting, increased exposure, faster economic recovery on the receding impact of the pandemic and increased vaccinations should benefit MetLife Inc., American International Group Inc., Prudential Financial Inc., CNO Financial Group and Kemper Corp. Accelerated digitalization will help in the smooth functioning of the industry.The solid capital level of the multiline insurers will fuel merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activities. With one rate hike already this year and more to come in the future, investment income should improve further as insurers are beneficiaries of a rising rate environment.About the IndustryThe Zacks Multiline Insurance industry comprises companies that provide single insurance coverage, bundling automobile, homeowner, long-term care, life and health insurance to individuals and businesses. The insured pays a single premium and is covered for many things through a single contract.These companies cover commercial and personal properties, automobiles, marine, livestock, aviation, personal accident, life, including permanent and term insurance, supplemental accident and health insurance, workers’ compensation, annuity products, private mortgage insurance, et al. The industry participants also provide risk management services. Since the companies offer single insurance coverage for multiple products, customer retention improves. The insured stands to benefit from lower premium payment compared to paying individual premiums for insuring varied products.Story continues3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Multiline Insurance IndustryDiversified portfolio lowers concentration risk: Given the nature of the business, multiline insurers’ product and service portfolios are diversified. This lowers concentration risk. Increased awareness, driving higher demand for protection products, should benefit sales and premiums for life insurance operations. Continued improvement in pricing and an increase in exposure should support premium growth.Also, per Deloitte Insights, the transition to green energy and related insurance products, as well as exposure to intangible assets, offers growth opportunities. Per Deloitte Insights, life insurance premium is estimated to increase 1.9% in 2023 while non-life premiums are expected to increase 2.2%. The report also stated that trends like commercial lines witnessing growth at a faster pace than personal lines and homeowners’ premiums improving at a better rate than personal auto are likely to continue in 2023.Merger and acquisitions: Consolidation in the multi-line insurance industry is expected to continue as players look to diversify their operations into new business lines and geographies. Buying businesses along the same lines is driven by the players’ need to gain a fair market share and grow in their niche areas. However, with high inflation and a rise in interest rate (the Fed has already made one rate hike this year), momentum in the M&amp;A environment is likely to slow down. The first half of 2022 witnessed 427 deals per Deloitte.Increased adoption of technology: Digitalization has increased by leaps and bounds, especially amid pandemic-induced restrictions. The industry is witnessing greater use of technology like blockchain, AI, advanced analytics, telematics, cloud computing and robotic process automation to expedite business operations and save costs.Many life insurers have started selling policies online that appeal to the tech-savvy population. At the same time, the use of real-time data is making premium calculation easier and reducing risk. The P&amp;C industry, in particular, also witnessed the emergence of insurtech — technology-led insurers — sparking competition for incumbent players.Insurers remain focused on ramping up data and analytics capabilities as well as realizing the benefit of the technological infrastructure per Deloitte Insights. Moreover, the adoption of technology has helped in seamless underwriting and claims processing. However, the adoption of technology comes with the risk of cyber threats.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates solid prospects in the near term.

398,09880c55-d172-375e-b6fb-d4242755141b,DVN,2023-05-02,Is Weakness In Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) Stock A Sign That The Market Could be Wrong Given Its Strong Financial Prospects?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/weakness-devon-energy-corporation-nyse-110049704.html,1683025249,STORY,['DVN'],"[With its stock down 16% over the past three months, it is easy to disregard Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN). However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Specifically, we decided to study Devon Energy's  ROE in this article.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. View our latest analysis for Devon Energy How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Devon Energy is:53% = US$6.0b ÷ US$11b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.53 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Devon Energy's Earnings Growth And 53% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that Devon Energy has a significantly high ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 30% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. Under the circumstances, Devon Energy's considerable five year net income growth of 54% was to be expected.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Devon Energy's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 18%.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is DVN fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Devon Energy Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?The three-year median payout ratio for Devon Energy is 46%, which is moderately low. The company is retaining the remaining 54%. By the looks of it, the dividend is well covered and Devon Energy is reinvesting its profits efficiently as evidenced by its exceptional growth which we discussed above.Moreover, Devon Energy is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 31% over the next three years. Regardless, the future ROE for Devon Energy is predicted to decline to 25% despite the anticipated decrease in the payout ratio. We reckon that there could probably be other factors that could be driving the forseen decline in the company's ROE.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that Devon Energy's performance has been quite good. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future.

This move lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.04%. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.14%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 2.14%.Heading into today, shares of the oil and gas exploration company had gained 5.57% over the past month, outpacing the Oils-Energy sector's gain of 4.67% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 5.1% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Devon Energy as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be May 8, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Devon Energy to post earnings of $1.42 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 24.47%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $3.98 billion, up 4.34% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $6.56 per share and revenue of $16.76 billion, which would represent changes of -21.06% and -12.58%, respectively, from the prior year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Devon Energy should also be noted by investors. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 1.52% lower within the past month. Devon Energy is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Story continuesIn terms of valuation, Devon Energy is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 8.15. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 6.82, so we one might conclude that Devon Energy is trading at a premium comparatively.Investors should also note that DVN has a PEG ratio of 0.16 right now. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. DVN's industry had an average PEG ratio of 0.35 as of yesterday's close.The Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry is part of the Oils-Energy sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 202, putting it in the bottom 20% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.To follow DVN in the coming trading sessions, be sure to utilize Zacks.com.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

400,a5565f21-228c-3d43-a892-764cb2f48fe2,DVN,2023-05-02,Earnings Preview: Devon Energy (DVN) Q1 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-devon-energy-dvn-140102822.html,1682949662,STORY,"['DVN', 'CPE']","[The market expects Devon Energy (DVN) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 8, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis oil and gas exploration company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.42 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -24.5%.Revenues are expected to be $3.98 billion, up 4.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.58% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Devon Energy?For Devon Energy, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.93%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Devon Energy will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Devon Energy would post earnings of $1.75 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.66, delivering a surprise of -5.14%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Devon Energy doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry, Callon Petroleum (CPE) is soon expected to post earnings of $2.07 per share for the quarter ended March 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -39.7%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $533.06 million, down 31.4% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Callon has been revised 6.9% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.37%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Callon will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

401,7fc4ad54-9b11-33a4-a29b-d77daad3c08b,DVN,2023-05-02,"Growth, Value, and Dividend Yield: 3 Of the Best Options to Buy Now",InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/growth-value-dividend-yield-3-103038279.html,1682677838,STORY,"['PEP', 'DVN', 'QSR']","[Over the past decade, investing in growth stocks has been the thing to do. These companies outperformed dividend-paying companies, or those with attractive valuations, by a rather wide margin.However, as we continue on a year of consolidation, the broad view of investors appears to be shifting. Many are now focusing on high-quality companies providing total returns, over those simply searching for scorching growth.This means that companies that provide value, growth, and dividend yields may be preferable. For those looking to create a portfolio that’s truly balanced, there are several great options to choose from.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsLet’s dive into the three I think are among the best to buy right now.QSRRestaurant Brands$69.56DVNDevon Energy$52.25PEPPepsiCo$189.94Restaurant Brands (QSR)Source: ShutterstockRestaurant Brands (NYSE:QSR) is a company best known as a fast-food giant. Its banners include Burger King, Tim Horton’s, Popeye’s Lousiana Kitchen, and the recently acquired Firehouse Subs. Thus, this is a well-diversified name in the space, with a range of options suitable for a diverse clientele.That’s one reason to like this stock. Its defensive nature, and relatively attractive valuation multiple of 21-times earnings (at least relative to its historical levels) means this stock is worth considering on its own.However, this is more than just a defensive play. Restaurant Brands showed some impressive performance in its recent quarterly results. Comparable same-store sales were 8.5% higher year-over-year.The company’s Popeye’s and Burger King banners saw respective growth rates of 180 bps and 40 bps in their comparable sales year-over-year.Future growth will probably come from the company’s continued expansion into new markets, particularly in Asia. Thus, I think this is a company that’s poised to become a cash flow machine.What will it do with all that cash flow? Well, the company currently distributes a significant portion of its earnings to shareholders.Story continuesCurrently, QSR stock yields 3.2%, and I think its distribution will continue to rise for years to come. So, for those seeking value, growth, and yield, this stock has it all.Devon Energy (DVN)The logo for Devon Energy (DVN) is displayed on a sign outside an office.Source: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comDevon Energy (NYSE:DVN) has had a relatively attractive valuation multiple for a very long time. In fact, I’d put the company’s 5.7-times earnings multiple in the deep value bucket, something that the other stocks on this list are nowhere near.This extremely low multiple bleeds into the company’s very high dividend yield of nearly 10%. Typically, yields of this size are unsustainable. Investors steer clear of companies like Devon over dividend cut worries.The thing is, Devon is one of the few companies that offers a fixed and variable dividend. That is, a portion of its dividend is fixed, and gets raised from time to time.However, the company also pays out 50% of its cash flow to shareholders. That means in boom times (like now), the profits flow directly to shareholders.A rising commodity price environment has led to this boom, which appears to have legs. Given the ongoing geopolitical climate, I expect oil prices to remain elevated for some time.For Devon, this means higher profitability and a great chance of growth.Again, this stock has it all. And while oil prices could drop, and this stock could falter, at these levels, investors are still getting a bargain. I think there’s an effective floor under this name, and it’s one of my top picks right now.PepsiCo (PEP)Cans of PepsiCo's Pepsi soda are in a bucket of ice.Source: suriyachan / Shutterstock.comA leader in the food and beverage sector, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) is renowned for its consistency as a stock. Pepsi has a tightly knit company strategy, which is robust and varied.In addition, having control over its product line allows PepsiCo to maintain low costs. This has been demonstrated by its consistently gross solid and EBITDA margins, even during market weakness, in the past year.In addition, PepsiCo has recently joined the group of Dividend Kings, having continuously paid dividends for 50 years, highlighting its strong standing in the industry. Last year, the company performed well in the stock market with a 7% return. Over the last decade, the stock has seen a remarkable 129% growth, establishing its reputation as a top wealth generator.PepsiCo’s recent financial report indicates that the company is not facing growth-related issues. The company’s organic sales showed strong growth at the end of the year, with a 15% increase in the fourth quarter and a 14% increase throughout the entire year of 2022.However, the stock strikes a good balance between growth and income without placing investors at significant risk. This blend of features is helpful in any market, particularly in the uncertain economic landscape.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald has a position in QSR.

By migrating to an integrated customer billing and meter data management cloud platform, the utility created a foundation for enhanced service offerings that will also support its smart meter rollout. EPE teamed up with Oracle Consulting Services as a major participant in the implementation.(PRNewsfoto/Oracle)""El Paso Electric's mission is to transform the energy landscape, and technology helps us drive efficiency, customer experience and security to capture opportunities in our evolving industry,"" said Cheryl Mele, VP of Customer Care and Communications, El Paso Electric. ""EPE selected Oracle's SaaS technology to provide the flexible scale to support our smart meter rollout while realizing value from the massive data sets that come with a smart, connected network. With the Oracle Utilities Customer Cloud Service integrated solution, we expect to regularly leverage new functionality to drive our business and process optimization strategies.  While a typical technology migration of this nature can require up to six months to return to pre-migration customer call handling times, we returned to near normal times in under one month with an intuitive tool and outstanding contact center representatives.""EPE is a regional energy provider engaged in generation, transmission, and distribution. It powers approximately 460,000 customers in a 10,000 square mile area of the Rio Grande Valley in West Texas and Southern New Mexico. The utility's smart meter project launches this month and is expected to fully replace all existing meters by 2025.Story continuesFollowing a 'true' cloud approachAs part of its Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) rollout, EPE needed a meter data management (MDM) system to support and process interval meter data. Instead of installing a separate MDM system, the utility decided migrating to Oracle Utilities Customer Cloud Service for an integrated customer and MDM platform was the best option. The utility now benefits from a clear, consistent view of its customers' energy use to help ensure it can continue to deliver the most reliable electric services.With the implementation, EPE is also benefitting from automated patching and product and security upgrades. All of this is reducing costs and IT burden to allow EPE's Customer Information System and IT personnel to focus more time on implementing incremental functionality that will benefit the business.""With Oracle's modern SaaS meter-to-cash solution featuring an advanced MDM and intuitive dashboards, El Paso Electric has streamlined its operations. As El Paso Electric moves forward with their meter transition, they will benefit from reduced service rep training time, faster call resolution, and improved overall service levels,"" said Dave De Maio, senior vice president and general manager, Oracle Client Services for Industries.

NDSN.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:Top Research Reports for American Express, Enbridge and MicronThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 12 major stocks, including American Express Co., Enbridge Inc. and Micron Technology, Inc. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of American Express have outperformed the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry over the past six months (+7.6% vs. -2.5%). The company has adopted several growth initiatives, such as launching new products, reaching new agreements and forging alliances, boosting its revenues. We expect the top line at $60.8 billion in 2023.Consumer spending on T&amp;E, which carry higher margins for AmEx, is advancing well. Its balance sheet looks strong with manageable debt. Solid cash-generation abilities enable the pursuit of business investments and capital deployment.However, with higher utilization of the company’s cards, expenses in the form of card member services and card member rewards are likely to strain the margins. Also, marketing and business development expenses are expected to rise. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on American Express here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Enbridge’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Production and Pipelines industry over the past six months (+4.3% vs. +4.1%). The company has the longest and most sophisticated oil and liquids pipeline system in the world, which spreads across 17,809 miles. Hence, a significant portion of the midstream operator’s earnings is generated from transportation operations, driven by a string of long-term contracts.ENB sanctioned C$8 billion of organic growth projects in 2022, bringing its total backlog to C$17 billion. The firm expects to put more than C$10 billion growth projects into service in 2024 and beyond. This is expected to generate significant EBITDA growth in the coming years.However, ENB’s significant debt exposure is concerning. ENB reported weak fourth-quarter results due to lower contributions from the Renewable Power Generation segment. Also, it has mostly been yielding lower dividends than the industry.  As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on Enbridge here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Micron Technology have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor Memory industry over the past six months (+17.0% vs. +14.9%). The company is witnessing growing demand for memory chips from cloud-computing providers and acceleration in 5G (fifth-generation) cellular network adoptions.Rising mix of high-value solutions, 5G adoption in Internet of Things devices and wireless infrastructure, enhancement in customer engagement and improvement in cost structure are growth drivers.Nonetheless, Micron near-term prospects look gloomy as weakening consumer spending is negatively impacting demand for memory chips used in personal computers (PCs) and smartphones. Bit shipments for the DRAM and NAND memory chips may decline in the near-term as PC makers are adjusting their inventory due to weakened demand.(You can read the full research report on Micron Technology here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. and Nordson Corp.Story continuesWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

Reported EPS is $2.63, expectations were $2.33.Operator: Hello, and welcome to McDonald's First Quarter 2023 Investor Conference Call. At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. Following today's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session for investors. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Cieplak, Investor Relations Officer for McDonald's Corporation. Mr. Cieplak, you may begin.Mike Cieplak: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on the call today are President and Chief Executive Officer, Chris Kempczinski; and Chief Financial Officer, Ian Borden. As a reminder, the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments on the call today. Both of those documents are available on our website as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call, along with their corresponding GAAP measures. Following prepared remarks this morning, we will take your questions. Today's conference call is being webcast and is also being recorded for replay via our website. And now I'll turn it over to Chris.Chris Kempczinski: Thanks Mike and good morning, everyone. You know ordinarily in a global business like ours, for a quarterly earnings call, you're prepping to memorize all the different sets of numbers. What's notable about this earnings call is McDonald's consistency, consistency in the strength of our numbers, consistency in the powerful drivers of our business, and consistency in the excitement that exists across the system about the opportunities that lie in front of us. Let's start with the numbers. At the top line, you only need to know one number, 12.6%. US comparable sales, 12.6%, IOM comparable sales, 12.6%, IDL comparable sales, 12.6%, and global comparable sales, you guessed it, 12.6%. These results reflects strong consumer demand for McDonald's that we are seeing around the world despite a challenging operating environment and historically low consumer sentiment in many markets.Story continuesIt is clear that our Accelerating the Arches strategy is working and we are operating from a position of strength. Each of our MCD growth pillars is contributing to our strong balanced performance and importantly, what we've talked in the past about the noise associated with the guest count metric, it is encouraging to see guest counts grow in every segment. In just the last few months, I have visited with our McDonald's teams in France, Japan, the Philippines, UAE and Israel. It's been inspiring to see the dedication of all three legs of the stool. Our teams are proud of what they've accomplished and are performing at a high level. For me, it's been energizing to hear their ideas for how we can do even more to take care of our customers. That's what I love most about the McDonald's system, our restless ambition.While we feel good about our current strategy, our success is driving us to do even more to lay a foundation for the future. Back in January, we announced the evolution of Accelerating the Arches. We're continuing to double down on our existing growth pillars while advancing two new initiatives. The first is accelerating restaurant development. Our strong performance has earned us the right to open new restaurants at a faster rate than we have historically. We're focused this year on determining the best path forward to meet customer demand and look forward to sharing more at our Investor Day later this year. The second newer element of our strategy is fundamentally rethinking how we as a company can work better together to become faster, more innovative, and more efficient.We're calling this Accelerating the Organization. In March, we convened our Annual Leadership Summit with top leaders from across the globe. Part of this meeting, we discussed three changes to our ways of working that will enable us to leverage our scale more effectively to meet the needs of our system and customers and unlock significant growth potential. The first is implementing horizontal ways of working. For years, our organization like many others was too siloed, whether that be geographically siloed or functionally siloed, and yet our biggest challenges and opportunities are rarely limited to just one market. They can't be solved by only one function. They require collaborating across the organization to bring the full breadth of McDonald's skills and experiences to devise the best system solution that can be scaled globally.In other words, they need to be solved horizontally. With Accelerating the Organization, we're now structured to work much more seamlessly in a horizontal fashion to solve these problems once and then scale solutions across markets, for example, is our app offering a seamless and personalized user experience. We're continuing to increase our speed of service. Those are opportunities across every single market and require the expertise of multiple functions. To support our ambition, to scale innovations with greater agility and collaborate more effectively, our second key shift is adopting One McDonalds Way to standardize the common processes we use to drive consistency and enable speed. We're an innovative entrepreneurial organization, but once a part of our system somewhere has solved a problem or developed a novel idea, we need to stop the work elsewhere.We don't need every market to invent its own light bulbs, so to speak. This approach allows us to use our size and scale for the greatest impact. For example, we're already seeing success in how our marketing teams are implementing common processes to quickly scale great creative such as the Raise Your Arches' campaign, which Ian will talk more about. Finally, we're making strategic investments in digitizing our organization and implementing new tools and platforms that make it easier for employees to access information to gain insights and drive performance. Ultimately, this will allow our market teams to spend more time in the restaurants, understanding the needs of customers, franchisees, and crew. Key to operationalizing all three areas of our internal transformation is our Enterprise Global Business Services Organization, also known as GBS.In 2023, GBS will focus on building a long-term strategy that ultimately provides a better experience for all three legs of the stool. GBS will be a key enabler to digitizing our organization, driving efficiency and providing value back to the business for our people, our franchisees, and our suppliers. Harnessing the power of our scale, our ability to strategically invest and the versatility of our system is the secret sauce that will empower us to provide even more memorable customer experiences for generations to come. To expand further on how we are optimizing the business and our growth strategy. I will now turn it over to Ian.10 Easiest Fast Food Jobs to Get in Americasaknakorn / Shutterstock.comIan Borden: Thanks Chris. The first quarter of 2023 was yet another demonstration of McDonald's at its best. We entered the year with global momentum and remained laser focused on executing against our strategic growth pillars. Though challenging macro dynamics are still evident across many parts of the world, each of our segments and our global comp sales grew nearly 13% for the quarter. This demonstrates that no matter the operating environment, our customers continue to rely on McDonald's as an affordable destination for the delicious food they love delivered with the great service that they expect. Throughout the quarter, we showcased our iconic core menu equities while further scaling emerging equities across markets. I'll share a couple of examples of this in our chicken portfolio where we continue to expand and grow market share and an area where there is strong opportunity for growth.The U.S. leveraged learnings from the U.K., Canada, and Germany by relaunching its Crispy Chicken Sandwich under the McCrispy global equity umbrella. While there was no change to the core product, compelling creative, along with a new flavor offering supported demand, and help drive double-digit sales growth in the market, in fact, we now offer the McCrispy in 10 of our largest markets around the world, adding to our portfolio of billion dollar brands. Another example was in China where in March we featured the McSpicy Chicken Sandwich through a creative campaign that included a partnership with a popular streetwear brand tapping into local cultural relevance. The campaign generated significant social buzz, an increased brand relevancy with a younger generation.It's worth noting that China and Hong Kong originally introduced customers to McSpicy nearly 20 years ago, and it's now part of our core menu in 17 markets reflecting consumers growing preference for spicy across the globe. And while I'm on the topic of China, I want to point out that we saw steady recovery in the market with China posting positive comp sales growth for the quarter. Chicken was also critical to Canada's strong results. With the successful execution of the Chicken Big Mac promotion, a popular limited time offering that had significant success in the U.K. last year. By creating these fresh takes on our classic menu items, we've continued to build affinity and have consistently gained share across our top markets in the growing chicken category over the last few years.In parallel, we continue to maintain our market share leadership in beef, making our core menu offerings even better through enhanced cooking procedures and other slight changes such as improved buns. Now in over 50 markets around the globe, these improvements are resulting in hotter, juicier and tastier burgers. We're seeing improved taste perception scores across markets, giving customers yet another reason to eat at McDonald's. We recently began to introduce these changes to our U.S. customers through a rolling deployment, and the initial reaction has been positive. The Big Mac was also prominently featured across many markets this quarter with strong activations in both Canada and France. While each campaign came to life in its own way, the resulting lift in beef sales across both markets shows that this iconic menu item which became popular more than 50 years ago still resonates with consumers today.As I've mentioned before, rising costs continue to pressure consumer spending across markets. Our ability to meet customer needs in challenging times makes McDonald's value proposition even more important to highlight. In Germany, for example, the launch of the new McSmart Menu refreshed our everyday value bundles, providing smaller, more affordable meals to our consumers, and contributing to Germany's eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit comp sales growth. Our marketing excellence was also on full display during the quarter, demonstrating our position as an affordable destination with iconic equities and strong execution. The Raise Your Arches campaign in the U.K. was a prime example of our marketing excellence in action, bringing to life the true power of the McDonald's brand in a new and unique way.This campaign did not feature our food or our restaurants. Yet by illustrating a simple gesture, the raising of eyebrows, our customers instantly recognize the semblance of the Golden Arches, and the engagement was remarkable. In fact, within the first weekend alone, Raise Your Arches reached millions of people and our customers reacted on social media more than 30,000 times. As the campaign quickly scaled to more than 30 markets across the globe, Raise Your Arches drove brand affinity around the world and once again proved the true power of the McDonald's brand. This is an example of how one singular idea can drive impact when shared across our markets. This is the One McDonalds Way that Chris mentioned earlier. MyMcDonald's Rewards is yet another example of how we've tapped into our marketing engine to deploy our loyalty platform throughout the system.Now in 50 markets, loyalty is building even stronger relationships with our customers, and the results continue to shine. In our top six markets, digital sales now represent almost 40% of system-wide sales, or nearly $7.5 billion growth of more than 30% over the last year. We have nearly 50 million, 90 day active members across these top markets, and our relationship with them continues to grow. We're learning when they visit, how they visit and what they buy. With more and more of our sales coming through identified channels than ever before, we're also continuing to improve our customers' mobile app experience with new initiatives that provide a more seamless interaction. The U.S. market, for example is piloting a new way of ordering through our app.Using existing location data, it allows our crew to start assembling a customer's order prior to their arrival at the restaurant, ultimately delivering hot, fresh food when customers arrive to pick up their order. While it's still early days deploying this new digital enhancement, initial results are already pointing to improve service times and elevated customer satisfaction scores. Australia and Canada enhanced the digital customer experience by officially integrating the ability to order and pay for McDelivery, all within the McDonald's app. This not only brings added choice and convenience for our customers but also allows them to earn loyalty points while they enjoy McDelivery at their doorstep and ensures that we maintain that direct connection.Across our digital and marketing initiatives, McDonald's continues to put the customer at the center of our strategy, driving top line growth and further strengthening the brand. Turning to the P&amp;L. Strong sales performance across each of our segments drove adjusted earnings per share of $2.63 for the quarter, an increase over the prior-year of nearly 20% in constant currencies. This excludes restructuring charges of about $180 million primarily consisting of employee termination benefits and lease termination costs as we look to become faster, more innovative and more efficient as part of Accelerating the Organization. Our company-operated margins remained hampered this quarter by continued pressure from elevated commodities and wages. As we look to the remainder of the year, consistent with the expectations we communicated in January, we expect macro headwinds will continue with the potential for a recessionary environment across both the U.S. and Europe.Total restaurant margin dollars grew by over $375 million in constant currencies or more than 10% for the quarter driven by higher franchise margin dollars. One of the benefits of our franchise business model is the predictability and stability of our franchise margins particularly in a strong comp sales environment. As expected, strong franchise sales performance across our markets was offset by increased franchisee assistance as elevated cost inflation continued to put significant pressure on restaurant cash flows, particularly for our European franchisees. As I've mentioned before, we're providing targeted and temporary support, investing proactively to maintain focus on driving long-term growth during this challenging time. We still anticipate these efforts will have an impact of between $100 million to $150 million for the year.G&amp;A for the quarter decreased slightly primarily driven by prior-year costs incurred for our worldwide convention last April, and our adjusted effective tax rate was nearly 21% for the quarter. Adjusted operating margin was 46% for the first quarter, a reflection of the strong top line growth. As we've said before, we expect to gain leverage on operating margin over time. And while this will not necessarily be linear based on a strong start to the year, we're pleased with our operating efficiency in quarter 1. Based on current exchange rates, we expect foreign exchange to reduce both the second quarter and full-year earnings per share by about $0.03 to $0.05. As always, this is directional guidance only as rates will likely change as we move through the year.Despite the economic uncertainty that may persist, we are well positioned with the unique strength and scale that only the McDonald's system can provide. As Chris talked about upfront, we are focused on how we can even further leverage this advantage in the future. With our strong underlying momentum and aligned focus on the right strategies moving forward, I remain confident that we will continue to deliver long-term growth for our system and for our shareholders. And with that, let me turn it back over to Chris.Chris Kempczinski: Thanks, Ian. Our brand has never been more relevant than it is today, a testament to our Accelerating the Arches strategy and the over 2 million people in our system who bring it to life with our franchisees in the restaurants every single day. As part of our Accelerating the Arches strategy, we've been particularly focused on revving up our world-class marketing engine with our agency partners and internal teams. We have expectations of what creative excellence should look like, and we're certainly proud of the progress we've made. Others are echoing this sentiment, and the industry is taking notice. Recently, McDonald's topped The WARC Effective 100 for the fourth year running, a ranking of the world's most awarded campaigns and companies for effectiveness.This is in addition to earning the #2 spot on Fast Company's World's Most Innovative Companies List of 2023. While we are pleased with where our brand is today, we know there is still more opportunity ahead, particularly as we change our ways of working through Accelerating the Organization, which I discussed at the outset. As I've said before, as goes our brands, so goes the economic health of the company and our nearly 5,000 franchisees globally. As Ray Kroc once famously said, we're not in the hamburger business, we're in show business. This showcases the importance of marketing our brand, which is more than just the food that we serve. The McDonald's franchise business model has provided a significant on-ramp for so many to work hard and prosper.And we want to ensure that the opportunity exists for generations to come. In fact, our franchisees are generating significant returns over the life of their 20-year agreements, far exceeding their cost of capital and relevant benchmarks. At its core, Accelerating the Arches is about us continuing to set up the company and our franchisees to prosper in the long-term. To that end, we'll continue to marshal the weight of the company's resources so that the business model endures. Ray Kroc would often say that we cannot grow without trying new things or without taking risks. Together as a system, we have an extraordinary opportunity to lay the foundation for our future to maintain an unwavering bond with customers. We'll achieve this through continuous innovation, building digital relationships and delivering personalized experiences with ease, no matter how our customers choose to enjoy McDonald's.As I told our internal teams earlier this month, as we adapt to our new organization and new ways of working, the most important thing we can do is to keep taking care of our customers, our system and each other. As we face a dynamic operating environment and changing customer demand, I'm confident that Accelerating the Arches is the right playbook, combined with the actions we're taking to accelerate the organization to keep McDonald's best positioned to be there for our customers and navigate the next chapter of our growth. I want to acknowledge that the path to continuously improving how we innovate for customers in the system involves difficult decisions, and saying goodbye to valued colleagues is never easy. What gives me confidence in our path forward is how the people in our system time and again have shown up for each other to realize the full potential of the opportunity ahead.Thanks again to our incredible employees, franchisees and suppliers for your continued dedication and commitment.

413,c2a0b014-d9f8-3ea2-b50a-9d5ffd3f30cb,MCD,2023-05-02,Investing in McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) five years ago would have delivered you a 102% gain,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-mcdonalds-nyse-mcd-five-130019819.html,1682946019,STORY,['MCD'],"[Stock pickers are generally looking for stocks that will outperform the broader market. And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. To wit, the McDonald's share price has climbed 79% in five years, easily topping the market return of 48% (ignoring dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 23% , including dividends .Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. View our latest analysis for McDonald's To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During five years of share price growth, McDonald's achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 7.1% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 12% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, McDonald's' TSR for the last 5 years was 102%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that McDonald's shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 23% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 15% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand McDonald's better, we need to consider many other factors.

Then in October 2018, the company filed for bankruptcy and CEO Eddie Lampert stepped down.When Sears emerged from bankruptcy in late 2022, it had just about 15 stores left, Business Insider reported. However, there are rumblings in Southern California that Sears could be attempting to reopen its store at the Burbank Town Center.

In its most recent quarterly report, Coca-Cola said net revenues had grown by 7% to $10.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022. Still, earnings per share declined by 16%.

For more cities, head on over to 5 Most Expensive U.S. Cities For Renters. Real estate is one of the biggest and most lucrative industries on the planet. Diving straight into multiple market research reports, we can gauge just how valuable the real estate industry is. A research report from Allied Markets Research shows that the global real estate market was worth a whopping $28 trillion in 2021. As if this weren't enough, the research firm adds that from then until 2031, the sector will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.3% to be worth an estimated $48.9 trillion by the end of the forecast period. A report from Grand View Research has more conservative revenue estimates for the industry. The report shares that in 2021 the sector was worth $3.69 trillion and will grow at a CAGR of 5.2% until 2030 to sit at an estimated $5.85 trillion worth. Within the industry, Asia Pacific is the fastest growing region as its rapid economic progress opens up the need for all types of buildings, both residential and commercial. Within Asia, China is the dominant player as it accounts for more than half of the market share.As the real estate industry booms, rents are going up as well. The U.S., as well as other developed economies, are facing historic inflation these days which picked off last year. The Russian invasion of Ukraine came just when expansionary fiscal policies to counter the coronavirus pandemic's devastating impact on the economy were seeing their after effects in the market. Stimulus packages and historically low interest rates led to trillions of dollars of cash sloshing around the American economy. This led to more purchases and aggressive business spending. While all these are good for economic growth, they also lead to inflation, and the Russian invasion turbocharged this by also shaking up the global energy markets.Story continuesHowever, while the impact of high energy prices on inflation has started to come recede, rent continues to drive inflation up. According to the Department of Labor's report for inflation in March 2023, inflation was 5% in the month. However, for March, out of all the items that are used to calculate the inflation reading, shelter prices were among the fastest growth. Month over month, they rose at 0.6%, joining the costs of food away from home and medical care commodities.Commenting on the growth in rent costs, the Labor Department stated:The index for all items less food and energy rose 0.4 percent in March after rising 0.5 percent in February. The shelter index increased 0.6 percent over the month after rising 0.8 percent in February. The index for rent and the index for owners’ equivalent rent both rose 0.5 percent in March following larger increases in the previous month. The index for lodging away from home increased 2.7 percent in March.The shelter index was the dominant factor in the monthly increase in the index for all items less food and energy.Some of the largest real estate companies in the U.S., such as Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD), Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O), and AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (NYSE:AVB) are bathing in money. For instance, Prologis, the largest American real estate firm in terms of market capitalization, raked in $5.9 billion in revenue in 2022, marking a cool $1.2 billion growth over the previous year's results. Realty Income, a commercial property lessor, brought in $3.3 billion in revenue, for a $1.3 billion annual growth. And finally, AvalonBay, which owns apartment buildings, saw its revenue grow by $300 million in 2022.As to what's happening in the rental market right now, management of AvalonBay shared more details during the firm's analyst earnings call for last year's fourth quarter, where they shared:The output of our modes is a forecast of market rent growth of 3% during the year. In a year in which we will need to be prepared for a wider set of potential outcomes than usual, there are a number of attributes of our portfolio, and particularly our concentration in suburban coastal markets, that we expect to serve as a ballast in a potentially softening economic environment. As shown on slide 8, the cost of a median-priced home relative to median income in our markets continues to serve as a barrier to home ownership and support demand for our apartment communities. This is in addition to the repercussions of today's higher mortgage rates, which make the economics of renting significantly more attractive. The other side of the equation is supply.In softening times, having an existing asset that is in direct competition with a recently built nearby project and lease-up can be particularly challenging. Our portfolio has some of the lowest levels of directly competitive new supply across the peer group at only 1.4% of stock, which we believe positions us well. And with that, I'll turn it to Kevin to detail our 2023 guidance.With these details in mind, let's take a look at the most expensive cities in the U.S. for rent.Most Expensive US Cities For RentersPhoto by sean pollock on UnsplashOur MethodologyTo compile our list of the most expensive cities in the U.S. to rent, we used data from Zumper, an online portal that connects landlords with renters.

While there’s nothing wrong with targeting companies that everybody else likes, the enterprises that enjoy mass support tend to feature some elements of reliability or predictability. Thus, in the end, the net profitability might not turn out to be so impressive.On the flip side, electing the best under-the-radar stocks for growth may deliver better-than-expected gains because of the lack of predictability. Put another way, because hardly anyone expects these down-in-the-mud enterprises to do anything special, they offer discounted rates. Should they make good, investors can pat themselves on the back for a job well done.In particular, under-the-radar stocks with a competitive advantage that goes over the head of the masses present possibly lucrative opportunities. To be sure, this arena features high risks. Still, if you can handle some volatility, these less-heralded companies can possibly offer some smiles.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsRHIRobert Half$70.63FOXAFox Corp.$32.47SBSWSibanye Stillwater$8.69SIRISirius XM$3.65WRBYWarby Parker$10.23UBERUber Technologies$29.68WEWeWork$0.41Robert Half (RHI)An image of a street sign post with directions labeled ""Buy"", ""Hold"", and ""Sell""Source: PX Media / ShutterstockAt a cursory glance, staffing services specialist Robert Half (NYSE:RHI) seems risky and irrelevant. Despite the ebb and flow, the overall performance of the labor market has been robust. Further, with unemployment being so low, theoretically, anybody that seriously wants a job can find one. Against such a powerful backdrop, jobseekers don’t need to reward middlemen entities for something they can easily do themselves.Because of the skyrocketing inflation that materialized last year, layoffs also accelerated but primarily in the technology sphere. Recently, though, the job cuts impacted myriad other industries. Perhaps most worryingly, consumer goods giant Clorox (NYSE:CLX) announced layoffs. In other words, consumers are spending less on discretionary goods (expected behavior) and necessities (not-so-expected).Story continuesAll told Robert Half may benefit due to a rise in jobseeker desperation as the pink slips start flying. Fundamentally, that’s why RHI ranks among the under-the-radar stocks to buy in 2023. For now, RHI is a consensus hold with a price target implying only 5% growth. Still, because it trades at only 11.91 times trailing earnings, RHI represents one of the under-the-radar stocks with a low valuation.Fox Corp (FOXA)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockWhile I wouldn’t classify Fox Corp (NASDAQ:FOXA) as a lesser-known enterprise, in my opinion, it ranks among the under-the-radar stocks with a competitive advantage because of its underappreciated upside potential. Sure, at the moment, all anyone can focus on is Fox Corp.’s Fox News cut ties with host Tucker Carlson. Given how popular he is with conservative audiences, losing Carlson seems to be bad for business.It very well could be. However, over time, Fox Corp may have the potential to be one of the under-the-radar stocks with strong earnings. Here’s the deal. It’s easy to be a conservative firebrand because the core values of social harmony and respect represent universally appealing attributes. Therefore, being more harmonious and more respectful appears rather dull.However, if you go on air and deliberately broadcast outlandish views, it will shock people. And some segments of the population will feel a release that finally, they can “be themselves.” Therefore, pushing the needle further may inspire more shock and therefore, more viewers.Never underestimate the power of appealing to the lowest common denominator. Right now, analysts peg FOXA as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target hits $37.60, implying 16% upside potential.Sibanye Stillwater (SBSW)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comA multinational metals and mining firm located in resource-rich South Africa, Sibanye Stillwater (NYSE:SBSW) features a diverse portfolio of mining and processing operations and projects across five continents. Easily one of the under-the-radar stocks to buy in 2023, few people believe in SBSW at the moment. It’s not their fault. Since the January opener, shares tumbled nearly 19%. In addition, they’re down more than 36% in the trailing year.Fundamentally, what makes Sibanye an underappreciated name among the best under-the-radar stocks for growth centers on palladium. A leading producer of silvery metal, palladium features heavily in catalytic converters. Of course, we’re talking about combustion-powered cars, which then brings up the electric vehicle narrative.While EVs may be the future of transportation, no one really knows when that future will arrive. Plus, few want to discuss the current limitations of EVs. For that, I recommend reading this op-ed published by the Los Angeles Times. Basically, the broader EV industry still has some ways to go before it’s truly convenient for the average driver. Thus, combustion-car-related assets could still be relevant, boding well for SBSW stock.Sirius XM (SIRI)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7On the surface, Sirius XM (NASDAQ:SIRI) might seem too beneath the surface for under-the-radar stocks to buy in 2023. A broadcasting company, Sirius provides satellite radio and online radio services. However, much of its relevancy got taken away due to the Covid-19 disaster. With people working from home, fewer folks needed Sirius for their morning and evening commutes.Not surprisingly, SIRI represents one of the stocks that has yet to reach its pre-pandemic February 2020 heights. What’s more, since the January opener, SIRI slipped more than 36%. And in the trailing-year period, shares stumbled 39%.However, daring contrarians might target SIRI as one of the best under-the-radar stocks for growth. Specifically, Sirius maintains an impressive three-year revenue growth rate of 10.2%, above 77.5% of its peers. Also, the market prices SIRI at a trailing multiple of 12.3, noticeably lower than the sector median of 16.13 times.Finally, with more people returning to the office, the morning commute could return to normal, as rising vehicle miles traveled data suggests. While analysts peg SIRI as a hold, they also anticipate 45% upside potential.Warby Parker (WRBY)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comIf you happen to follow securities that feature the most short interest, you’ll find that Warby Parker (NYSE:WRBY) presently inks its name on the dubious list. For those that aren’t contrarians, you generally don’t want to see bears pile into the negative side of the trade. Unfortunately for longtime stakeholders of the prescription glasses retailer, WRBY hasn’t been able to generate much positive traction. Since the start of the year, shares fell nearly 28%.At the same time, scientists project that by 2050, about 4.76 billion people will suffer from myopia. Therefore, on a cynical basis, Warby Parker may continue to see an expanding addressable market. Here’s just my speculation. With so many people having their heads buried in devices, myopia trends may even accelerate beyond what the experts project. Again, that may benefit WRBY as one of the under-the-radar stocks with a competitive advantage.Financially, though, we’ve got to be real. Warby Parker could use some serious work. Currently, one of the biggest problems is that the company suffers from a three-year revenue growth rate of 46.1% below parity. Also, its trailing-year profit margins also sit in negative territory. Still, analysts peg WRBY as a consensus moderate buy. On average, their price target lands at $15.88, implying over 53% upside potential.Uber Technologies (UBER)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comSince making its debut in 2019, ride-sharing giant Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) finds itself down nearly 29%. From this context alone, you might not think that UBER ranks among the under-the-radar stocks with strong earnings. However, in its most recent fourth-quarter 2022 report, the enterprise beat on both the top and bottom lines. It will next release its Q1 results in early May so this status might change.Still, if it’s true that Generation Z prioritizes experiences over tangible products and traditional attainments, then UBER might also be one of the under-the-radar stocks to buy in 2023. Retail investors appear to be placing their bets, sending shares up to the tune of almost 17% since the start of Jan.However, investors do need to be cautious. Financially, Uber has some vulnerabilities, particularly a soft balance sheet. As well, its trailing-year profit margins sit in negative territory, clouding its forward viability. Nevertheless, a major positive is its three-year revenue growth rate of 15.7%, above 68.26% of the competition. In closing, analysts peg UBER as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target pings at $48.19, implying nearly 63% upside potential.WeWork (WE)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comFor the last idea on this list of under-the-radar stocks to buy in 2023, WeWork (NYSE:WE) comes with a major caveat. You only open your wallet for this bad boy as a roll of the dice at the craps table – nothing more, nothing less. If you’re betting money that you’ll miss, just pretend that this coworking space provider never existed in the first place.I’m warning you now because buying WE could put your portfolio six feet under. In fact, it already did for early believers. As Business Insider mentioned, WeWork frittered away $46.7 billion in value. That’s impressive in an extremely macabre sense. Also, its financials signal distress in terms of its balance sheet, operations, and profitability. Since the start of the year, WE cratered by almost 69%.However, it’s also possible that the burgeoning gig economy could also benefit WeWork in the long run. After all, head execs of major corporations probably won’t permit work from home forever. Once recalled, employees will have a choice: return or join the gig economy. Some will surely choose the latter. Interestingly, analysts peg WE as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target stands at $2.25, implying over 411% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

(NASDAQ:NWL) Shares Could Be 44% Below Their Intrinsic Value Estimate,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/newell-brands-inc-nasdaq-nwl-105024501.html,1683024624,STORY,['NWL'],"[Key InsightsNewell Brands' estimated fair value is US$19.14 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityNewell Brands' US$10.81 share price signals that it might be 44% undervaluedOur fair value estimate is 27% higher than Newell Brands' analyst price target of US$15.04Does the May share price for Newell Brands Inc. (NASDAQ:NWL) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Newell Brands Is Newell Brands Fairly Valued?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$495.9mUS$611.2mUS$823.4mUS$928.0mUS$1.03bUS$1.10bUS$1.16bUS$1.22bUS$1.26bUS$1.30bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x2Analyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 7.15%Est @ 5.62%Est @ 4.56%Est @ 3.81%Est @ 3.29% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 14% US$436US$473US$561US$556US$541US$510US$474US$436US$398US$362(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$4.7bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 14%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.3b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (14%– 2.1%) = US$11bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$11b÷ ( 1 + 14%)10= US$3.2bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$7.9b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$10.8, the company appears quite undervalued at a 44% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Newell Brands as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 14%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.954. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Newell BrandsStrengthDebt is well covered by .Dividend is in the top 25% of dividend payers in the market.WeaknessInterest payments on debt are not well covered.OpportunityExpected to breakeven next year.Good value based on P/S ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Paying a dividend but company is unprofitable.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

BYD, PACCAR Inc. PCAR, Meta Platforms, Inc. META, PulteGroup, Inc. PHM and Life Time Group Holdings, Inc. LTH.5 Excellent Stocks to Ride on Relative Price StrengthClosing out last week, the Fed’s favored inflation report — Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) — came in line with estimates. Among other economic positives, the regional bank failures of last month are likely in the rear-view mirror, while the labor market continues to be resilient.At the same time, we should avoid painting an overly optimistic picture by overstating the improvements. While we are well off the peaks we saw in 2022, we have apparently hit a bed of resistance. In other words, inflation is indeed coming down, but too slowly. It means a near-certainty that another quarter-point rate hike is in the cards.We believe that more visibility regarding the future market direction will only be available post first-quarter 2023 earnings season, along with management guidance and business outlook.Till then, investors who want to stay exposed to the equity setup should focus on good investment opportunities. One of the ways such potential plays could be identified is to look for signs of relative price strength.Relative Price Strength StrategyInvestors generally gauge a stock’s potential returns by examining earnings growth and valuation multiples. At the same time, it’s essential to measure the performance of such a stock relative to its industry or peers, or an appropriate benchmark. If you see that a stock is underperforming on fundamental factors, it would be prudent to move on and find a better alternative. However, those outperforming their respective sectors in terms of price should be selected because they stand a better chance of providing considerable returns. Then again, it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength. Stocks delivering better than the S&amp;P 500 for 1 to 3 months at least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy.Story continuesFinally, it is crucial to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings of these companies. In order to do this, we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter’s (Q1) earnings to our screen. When a stock undergoes an upward revision, it leads to additional price gains.Here are five of the 10 stocks that made it through the screen:Boyd Gaming Corp.: This is a multi-jurisdictional gaming company, which owns and operates gaming entertainment properties in several states.

Reported EPS is $2.25, expectations were $1.81.Operator: Good morning, and welcome to PACCAR's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All lines will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. I would like to introduce Mr. Ken Hastings, PACCAR's Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Hastings, please go ahead.Ken Hastings: Good morning. We would like to welcome those listening by phone and those on the webcast. My name is Ken Hastings, PACCAR's Director of Investor Relations. And joining me this morning are Preston Feight, Chief Executive Officer; Harrie Schippers, President and Chief Financial Officer; and Michael Barkley, Senior Vice President and Controller. As with prior conference calls, we ask that any members of the media on the line participate in a listen-only mode. Certain information presented today will be forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties, including general economic and competitive conditions that may affect expected results. For additional information, please see our SEC filings and the Investor Relations page of paccar.com. I would now like to introduce Preston Feight.Preston Feight: Hi, good morning. Harrie Schippers, Michael Barkley, Ken Hastings and I will update you on our first quarter results and our business highlights. PACCAR achieved record revenues and excellent net income in the first quarter due to continued strong global demand for trucks, aftermarket parts and financial services. PACCAR's revenues increased 31% to $8.47 billion and net income was $734 million, including an after-tax non-recurring charge of $446 million. The charge release to civil claims in Europe was previously reported in an 8-K last week and is the total estimated cost. Excluding the non-recurring charge, first quarter adjusted net income was $1.180 million, up from $600 million in the first quarter of last year.Story continuesIn the first quarter, Truck, Parts and Other gross margins expanded to a record 19.3%, compared to 15.9% in the fourth quarter of last year. PACCAR is benefiting from investments in new truck models, global growth and PACCAR Parts continued expansion. PACCAR Parts first quarter revenues increased by 17% to a record $1.62 billion. Parts pretax profits were a record $439 million or 29% higher than the same period last year. PACCAR Financial had an excellent quarter, achieving pretax income of $149 million, which is similar to the same quarter of last year. I appreciate PACCAR's outstanding employees, who delivered these excellent financial results and the highest quality trucks and transportation solutions in the industry. Their commitment to the company and to our customers is foundational to our success.Looking at the U.S. economy, GDP is estimated to grow modestly. Freight tonnage continues to be good, and customers are updating their vehicles with new, high-performing Peterbilt and Kenworth trucks. This continues to be a favorable operating environment, and we're increasing our forecast for the U.S. and Canadian Class 8 market to 280,000 to 320,000 trucks. European economies are also experiencing modest growth. DAF's excellent new trucks are providing customers with the latest technology and best operating efficiencies. We have raised our 2023 European above 16 tonne market projection to a range of 280,000 to 320,000 trucks. The South American above 16 tonne truck market is expected to be in the range of 115,000 to 125,000 vehicles this year.In Brazil, DAF achieved a record 8.6% share in the first quarter. DAF Brazil is celebrating its 10th year of operations. DAF trucks are highly desired by customers in South America, and the region is an important part of PACCAR's growth and success. PACCAR's industry-leading truck lineup, highly efficient operations, best-in-class parts and financial services companies and the continued development of advanced technologies, position the company well for an excellent year. Harrie Schippers will now provide an update on PACCAR Parts, PACCAR Financial Services and other business highlights. Harrie?IT Support Specialist, softwarechristina-wocintechchat-com-FVgECvTjlBQ-unsplashHarrie Schippers: Thanks, Preston. PACCAR delivered 51,000 trucks during the first quarter. The supply chain is improving, but there are some periodic supplier shortages affecting production. In the second quarter of 2023, deliveries are forecast to increase to a range of 51,000 to 54,000 trucks. Truck parts and other gross margins increased to 19.3% in the first quarter. We anticipate second quarter gross margins to be strong and in the range of 18% to 19%. PACCAR Parts had an outstanding first quarter, with Parts gross margins expanding to a record 32.2%. PACCAR Parts business model is based on the application of technology to provide our customers excellent access to high-quality parts. PACCAR Parts is expanding the use of technologies such as e-commerce and leveraging data from PACCAR's connected trucks.PACCAR Parts expanding network of 18 parts distribution centers serves more than 2,000 dealer locations and 250 independent ERP stores, which provides best-in-class uptime for our customers. PACCAR Parts is a high-growth and high-margin recurring revenue business. We estimate part sales to grow by 10% to 12% in the second quarter of this year, compared to the same quarter last year. PACCAR Financial Services benefited in the first quarter from a larger portfolio, excellent portfolio quality and good used truck business. Pretax income improved to $149 million. PACCAR Financials’ 13 used truck facilities worldwide contribute to higher price realization, compared to wholesale channels. Used truck prices have moderated, but remain historically strong.With its larger portfolio and superb credit quality, PACCAR Financial is having another very good year. PACCAR has invested over $4 billion in new and expanded facilities, innovative products and new technologies during the past five years. These investments have created the newest and most impressive lineup of trucks in the industry, as well as highly efficient factories and distribution centers. PACCAR is continuing its investments in clean diesel, zero emissions, autonomy and connected vehicle programs. Capital expenditures are projected to be $600 million to $650 million and research and development expenses are estimated to be $380 million to $420 million this year. Customer demand is strong for PACCAR's industry-leading trucks and transportation solutions in all markets.We expect 2023 to be an excellent year. Thank you.Preston Feight: So as we complete our comments, I'd like to thank our Senior Vice President and Controller, Michael Barkley, who'll be retiring at the beginning of June after a wonderful 32-year career.

Among other economic positives, the regional bank failures of last month are likely in the rear-view mirror, while the labor market continues to be resilient.At the same time, we should avoid painting an overly optimistic picture by overstating the improvements. While we are well off the peaks we saw in 2022, we have apparently hit a bed of resistance. In other words, inflation is indeed coming down, but too slowly. It means a near-certainty that another quarter-point rate hike is in the cards.We believe that more visibility regarding the future market direction will only be available post first-quarter 2023 earnings season, along with management guidance and business outlook.Till then, investors who want to stay exposed to the equity setup should focus on good investment opportunities. One of the ways such potential plays could be identified is to look for signs of relative price strength.Relative Price Strength StrategyInvestors generally gauge a stock’s potential returns by examining earnings growth and valuation multiples. At the same time, it’s essential to measure the performance of such a stock relative to its industry or peers, or an appropriate benchmark. If you see that a stock is underperforming on fundamental factors, it would be prudent to move on and find a better alternative. However, those outperforming their respective sectors in terms of price should be selected because they stand a better chance of providing considerable returns. Then again, it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength. Stocks delivering better than the S&amp;P 500 for 1 to 3 months at least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy.Finally, it is crucial to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings of these companies. In order to do this, we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter’s (Q1) earnings to our screen. When a stock undergoes an upward revision, it leads to additional price gains.Story continuesScreening ParametersRelative % Price change – 12 weeks greater than 0Relative % Price change – 4 weeks greater than 0Relative % Price change – 1 week greater than 0(We have considered those stocks that have been outperforming the S&amp;P 500 over the last 12 weeks, four weeks and one week.)% Change (Q1) Est. over 4 Weeks greater than 0: Positive current-quarter estimate revisions over the last four weeks.Zacks Rank equal to 1: Only Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks — that have returned more than 26% annually over the last 26 years and surpassed the S&amp;P 500 in 23 of the last 26 years — can get through. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Current Price greater than or equal to $5 and Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50,000: A minimum price of $5 is a good standard to screen low-priced stocks, while a high trading volume would imply adequate liquidity.VGM Score less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy), offer the best upside potential.Here are five of the 10 stocks that made it through the screen:Boyd Gaming Corporation BYD: This s a multi-jurisdictional gaming company, which owns and operates gaming entertainment properties in several states.

In comparison with Q1 2022, the annualized effective fee rate was primarily driven by a mix shift toward lower fee asset classes and vehicles as a result of overall market declines and net outflows over the last twelve months.Administrative, distribution, and servicing fees decreased primarily due to lower transfer agent servicing activities provided to the T.

Comparatively, the Q1 2022 amount of $44.4 million includes $57.6 million in additional accrued carried interest, partially offset by $13.2 million in non-cash amortization. A portion of the capital allocation-based income is passed through as compensation and recognized in compensation and related costs with the unpaid amount reported as non-controlling interest on the consolidated balance sheet. For detail of the quarterly change in accrued carried interest, which is reported as part of investments on the consolidated balance sheet, and related non-controlling interest, see the applicable tables at the end of this release.Operating ExpensesThree months ended(in millions)3/31/20233/31/2022 % Change12/31/2022% ChangeCompensation, benefits, and related costs$       593.3$          595.9(.4) %$          624.5(5.0) %Acquisition-related retention agreements14.219.2(26.0) %15.9(10.7) %Capital allocation-based income compensation3.517.5n/m10.4n/mSupplemental savings plan42.5(51.0)n/m36.9n/mTotal compensation and related costs653.5581.612.4 %687.7(5.0) %Distribution and servicing71.585.9(16.8) %70.02.1 %Advertising and promotion25.823.410.3 %28.2(8.5) %Product and recordkeeping related costs72.180.4(10.3) %67.86.3 %Technology, occupancy, and facility costs146.6133.99.5 %148.7(1.4) %General, administrative, and other107.598.88.8 %102.15.3 %Change in fair value of contingent consideration(49.6)(45.5)9.0 %(35.5)39.7 %Acquisition-related amortization and impairment costs26.027.1(4.1) %202.1(87.1) %Total operating expenses$   1,053.4$          985.66.9 %$       1,271.1(17.1) %Total adjusted operating expenses(1)$   1,022.5$       1,039.1(1.6) %$       1,073.2(4.7) %(1)  See the reconciliation to the comparable U.S. GAAP measures at the end of this earnings release.Operating expenses were $1,053.4 million, an increase of 6.9% compared with Q1 2022 and a decrease of 17.1% compared with Q4 2022. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted operating expenses in Q1 2023 were $1,022.5 million, a 1.6% decrease over Q1 2022 and a 4.7% decrease compared with Q4 2022.Compensation, benefits, and related costs in Q1 2023 of $593.3 million were in line with Q1 2022 as higher salaries and related benefits were offset by a lower interim bonus accrual and stock-based compensation expense. Compensation, benefits, and related costs in Q1 2023 declined $31.2 million from Q4 2022, primarily reflecting lower stock-based compensation expense related to the firm's annual equity grant as well as the absence of severance and other costs associated with the workforce reduction action recognized in Q4 2022. These lower Q1 2023 costs were offset in part by a higher interim bonus accrual as Q4 2022 reflected the final accrual needed to recognize the annual bonus to be paid. The firm employed 7,837 associates at March 31, 2023, a decrease of .4% from the end of 2022 and an increase of 3.5% from March 31, 2022.Distribution and servicing costs in Q1 2023 of $71.5 million, declined $14.4 million from Q1 2022, primarily driven by lower average AUM of certain share classes of the U.S. mutual funds and of the firm's international products, including the Japanese Investment Trusts (ITMs) and certain SICAV share classes.Technology, occupancy, and facility costs in Q1 2023 of $146.6 million, increased $12.7 million from Q1 2022, primarily due to higher depreciation from the firm's ongoing investment in its technology capabilities, and increased office facility costs, mainly related to higher rent expense.Non-operating income (loss)(in millions) Three months ended3/31/20233/31/202212/31/2022Net gains (losses) from non-consolidated T.

The net investment gains on this portfolio totaled $30.8 million in Q1 2023, compared with net investment losses of $23.8 million in the 2022 period, and net investment gains of $33.7 million in Q4 2022.Income taxesThe following reconciles the statutory federal income tax rate to the firm's effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2023 and 2022:Three months ended3/31/20233/31/2022Statutory U.S. federal income tax rate21.0 %21.0 %State income taxes for current year, net of federal income tax benefits(1)3.03.3Net (income) losses attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests(2)(.4).3Net excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation plans activity(.4)(.6)Other items, including valuation allowances5.5.2Effective income tax rate28.7 %24.2 %(1) State income tax benefits are reflected in the total benefits for net income attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests and stock-based compensation plans activity.(2) Net income attributable to redeemable non-controlling interest represents the portion of earnings held in the firm's consolidated investment products, which are not taxable to the firm despite being included in pre-tax income.The firm's non-GAAP tax rate was 30.3% for Q1 2023, compared with 24.2% for Q1 2022. The Q1 2023 non-GAAP effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by an increase in valuation allowances recorded against certain foreign-based deferred tax assets. These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by a lower state effective tax rate as a result of favorable state tax liability settlements.The firm estimates that its effective tax rate for the full year 2023 will be in the range of 26% to 30%, on a U.S. GAAP basis, and 26.5% to 29.5%, on a non-GAAP basis.Other MattersThe financial results presented in this release are unaudited.

Management believes adjusting for these charges helps the reader's ability to understand the firm's core operating results and to increase comparability period to period.(2)     This non-GAAP adjustment removes the transaction costs incurred related to the acquisition of OHA. Management believes adjusting for these charges helps the reader's ability to understand the firm's core operating results and to increase comparability period to period.(3)   This non-GAAP adjustment removes the compensation expense impact from market valuation changes in the supplemental savings plan liability and the related net gains (losses) on investments designated as an economic hedge against the related liability. Amounts deferred under the supplemental savings plan are adjusted for appreciation (depreciation) of hypothetical investments chosen by participants. The firm uses T. Rowe Price investment products to economically hedge the exposure to these market movements. Management believes it is useful to offset the non-operating investment income (loss) realized on the economic hedges against the related compensation expense and remove the net impact to help the reader's ability to understand the firm's core operating results and to increase comparability period to period.(4)   These non-GAAP adjustments remove the impact that the consolidated sponsored investment products have on the firm's U.S. GAAP consolidated statements of income. Specifically, the firm adds back the operating expenses and subtracts the investment income of the consolidated sponsored investment products. The adjustment to operating expenses represents the operating expenses of the consolidated products, net of the elimination of related management and administrative fees. The adjustment to net income attributable to T. Rowe Price represents the net income of the consolidated products, net of redeemable non-controlling interests. Management believes the consolidated sponsored investment products may impact the reader's ability to understand the firm's core operating results.(5)   This non-GAAP adjustment represents the other non-operating income (loss) and the net gains (losses) earned on the firm's non-consolidated investment portfolio that are not designated as economic hedges of the supplemental savings plan liability and that are not part of the cash and discretionary investment portfolio. Management retains the investment gains recognized on the non-consolidated cash and discretionary investments as these assets and related income (loss) are considered part of the firm's core operations. Management believes adjusting for these non-operating income (loss) items helps the reader's ability to understand the firm's core operating results and increases comparability to prior years. Additionally, management does not emphasize the impact of the portion of non-operating income (loss) removed when managing and evaluating the firm's performance.(6)   The income tax impacts were calculated in order to achieve an overall non-GAAP effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 of 30.3% and 24.2%, respectively. The firm estimates that its effective tax rate for the full-year 2023 on a non-GAAP basis will be in the range of 26.5% to 29.5%.(7)   This non-GAAP measure was calculated by applying the two-class method to adjusted net income attributable to T. Rowe Price Group divided by the weighted-average common shares outstanding assuming dilution. The calculation of adjusted net income allocated to common stockholders is as follows: Three months ended3/31/20233/31/202212/31/2022Adjusted net income attributable to T.

(UPS) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-parcel-inc-ups-attracting-130001981.html,1682946001,STORY,['UPS'],"[United Parcel Service (UPS) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this package delivery service have returned -7.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +5.1% change. The Zacks Transportation - Air Freight and Cargo industry, to which UPS belongs, has lost 1.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, UPS is expected to post earnings of $2.49 per share, indicating a change of -24.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -9.1% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.89 points to a change of -15.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -4.9%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.46 indicates a change of +5.2% from what UPS is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for UPS.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for UPS _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of UPS, the consensus sales estimate of $23.05 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -6.9%. The $96.38 billion and $99.25 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -4% and +3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUPS reported revenues of $22.93 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -6%. EPS of $2.20 for the same period compares with $3.05 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.94 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.05%. The EPS surprise was +0.46%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.UPS is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about UPS. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: American Express Co. AXP, Enbridge Inc. ENB, Micron Technology, Inc. MU, Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. ODFL and Nordson Corp. NDSN.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:Top Research Reports for American Express, Enbridge and MicronThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 12 major stocks, including American Express Co., Enbridge Inc. and Micron Technology, Inc. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of American Express have outperformed the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry over the past six months (+7.6% vs. -2.5%). The company has adopted several growth initiatives, such as launching new products, reaching new agreements and forging alliances, boosting its revenues. We expect the top line at $60.8 billion in 2023.Consumer spending on T&amp;E, which carry higher margins for AmEx, is advancing well. Its balance sheet looks strong with manageable debt. Solid cash-generation abilities enable the pursuit of business investments and capital deployment.However, with higher utilization of the company’s cards, expenses in the form of card member services and card member rewards are likely to strain the margins. Also, marketing and business development expenses are expected to rise. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on American Express here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Enbridge’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Production and Pipelines industry over the past six months (+4.3% vs. +4.1%). The company has the longest and most sophisticated oil and liquids pipeline system in the world, which spreads across 17,809 miles. Hence, a significant portion of the midstream operator’s earnings is generated from transportation operations, driven by a string of long-term contracts.ENB sanctioned C$8 billion of organic growth projects in 2022, bringing its total backlog to C$17 billion. The firm expects to put more than C$10 billion growth projects into service in 2024 and beyond. This is expected to generate significant EBITDA growth in the coming years.However, ENB’s significant debt exposure is concerning. ENB reported weak fourth-quarter results due to lower contributions from the Renewable Power Generation segment. Also, it has mostly been yielding lower dividends than the industry.  As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on Enbridge here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Micron Technology have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor Memory industry over the past six months (+17.0% vs. +14.9%). The company is witnessing growing demand for memory chips from cloud-computing providers and acceleration in 5G (fifth-generation) cellular network adoptions.Rising mix of high-value solutions, 5G adoption in Internet of Things devices and wireless infrastructure, enhancement in customer engagement and improvement in cost structure are growth drivers.Nonetheless, Micron near-term prospects look gloomy as weakening consumer spending is negatively impacting demand for memory chips used in personal computers (PCs) and smartphones. Bit shipments for the DRAM and NAND memory chips may decline in the near-term as PC makers are adjusting their inventory due to weakened demand.(You can read the full research report on Micron Technology here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. and Nordson Corp.Story continuesWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

On a year-over-year basis, earnings declined 13.6% but revenues increased 7.8%.Vulcan Materials’ earnings topped the consensus mark in two of the last four quarters and missed the same on two occasions, with the average negative surprise being 0.6%.Vulcan Materials Company Price and EPS SurpriseVulcan Materials Company Price and EPS SurpriseVulcan Materials Company price-eps-surprise | Vulcan Materials Company QuoteTrend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings per share has been revised downward to 64 cents from 65 cents over the past 30 days. The estimated figure indicates a decrease of 12.3% from the year-ago quarter. The consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.58 billion, suggesting 2.6% year-over-year growth.Factors to NoteThe slowing residential demand, wet weather, rail freight bottlenecks and cement shortages are expected to reflect in first-quarter aggregates volumes of the companies like Vulcan, Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. MLM and others. Higher wet conditions in some regions compared with the year-ago very dry condition must have been reflected in the quarterly results.West Coast states, mainly California, received more rainfall and were cold, while the Southeast witnessed above-average rainfall. Overall, tough year-over-year comparisons with respect to weather are expected to act as a headwind in the quarter. Notably, in the year-ago period, the weather was dry, contributing to the company’s quarterly performance.Nonetheless, higher non-residential construction activities and incremental federal funding from the recently enacted Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act should have acted as a tailwind for first-quarter 2023. Also, resilient pricing — given the growth in all product lines — is expected to have supported growth for Vulcan.Higher spending from a number of states that it serves is likely to have aided revenues. The aggregates business (including crushed stone, sand, and gravel, along with other aggregates) has been a major contributor to revenue growth. Efforts to enhance operational excellence, acquisition synergies and cost-control measures are expected to have aided the bottom line to some extent.However, higher repair &amp; maintenance costs and supply &amp; contract costs may have been risks. Inflation from hydrocarbons, rising liquid asphalt costs, insurance and labor might have added to the negatives.We expect net sales from the Aggregates segment (accounting for 72% of total revenues) to grow 2.4% to $1,148.6 million from a year ago.Net sales from the Concrete segment (accounting for 13.8% of total revenues) are expected to decline 5.4% to $340.9 million from a year ago.Our models suggest net sales from the Asphalt Mix segment (14% of total revenues) to be $216.2 million, indicating 29.4% growth from $167.1 million a year ago.The Calcium segment’s net sales are expected to be $1.7 million, suggesting a decline from $1.9 million a year ago.Story continuesWhat Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Vulcan this time around. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

The consensus estimate for products and services revenues is pegged at $1.19 billion, indicating a year-over-year rise of 3.3%.Factors to NoteMartin Marietta’s quarterly revenues are expected to have witnessed year-over-year growth in the first quarter, given the strong pricing gains in aggregates and strength in public construction. Improved visibility in non-residential construction and contributions from acquisitions are also likely to have been the positives.The business and earnings of MLM have been sensitive to changes in construction spending, particularly housing and public construction in Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida as well as Iowa. Infrastructure construction, particularly for aggregates-intensive highways and roads and streets, might have also contributed to its performance in the quarter, as contractors advanced projects that have been awarded and funded.However, the slowdown in single-family residential construction and wet weather might have weighed on the quarterly volumes. Higher wet conditions in some regions compared with the year-ago very dry condition must have been reflected in the quarterly results.

Cement pricing is also expected to decrease 6.6% to $120.62 per ton.Also, inflation from hydrocarbon, rising liquid asphalt and diesel fuel costs, more transportation costs and insurance and labor cost may have impacted the bottom line of Martin Marietta and its peers like Vulcan Materials Company VMC. Also, higher repair &amp; maintenance costs, supply and contract costs and supply-chain bottlenecks are added concerns.We expect the Building Material segment revenues (product and services), which comprise 95% of total revenues, to grow 4.1% year over year to $1,121.1 million.Our model suggests Magnesia Specialties revenues (product and services) to decline 17.6% year over year to $58.3 million.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Martin Marietta this time around.

Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term financial health, we decided to study the company’s fundamentals to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study Martin Marietta Materials'  ROE in this article.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. Check out our latest analysis for Martin Marietta Materials How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Martin Marietta Materials is:12% = US$856m ÷ US$7.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.12.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.A Side By Side comparison of Martin Marietta Materials' Earnings Growth And 12% ROETo start with, Martin Marietta Materials' ROE looks acceptable. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 13%. This certainly adds some context to Martin Marietta Materials' moderate 5.4% net income growth seen over the past five years.Story continuesWe then compared Martin Marietta Materials' net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 15% in the same period, which is a bit concerning.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for MLM? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Martin Marietta Materials Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Martin Marietta Materials has a low three-year median payout ratio of 20%, meaning that the company retains the remaining 80% of its profits. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business.Besides, Martin Marietta Materials has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 13% over the next three years. Regardless, the ROE is not expected to change much for the company despite the lower expected payout ratio.SummaryIn total, we are pretty happy with Martin Marietta Materials' performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. As a result, the decent growth in its earnings is not surprising.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Computer Hardware Stocks To Buy Now. According to The Business Research Company's ""Computer Hardware Global Market Report 2022,"" the size of the computer hardware market increased from $1,129.39 billion in 2021 to $1,235.28 billion in 2022, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.4%. It is projected that the computer hardware market will reach $1,517.99 billion in 2026, growing at a CAGR of 5.3%. In 2022, North America held the position of the largest region in the computer hardware market, while Asia-Pacific ranked as the second largest region in terms of market size. The computer hardware market encompasses the sale of computer hardware and associated services, including a wide range of products such as personal computers (PCs), laptops, tablets, computer storage devices, peripheral equipment, servers, and processors. In recent years, the IT hardware industry has experienced significant technological advancements, particularly in areas like graphics processing and virtual reality. Looking ahead, virtual reality is set to become more accessible and successful in the mainstream computer hardware market, as many of its challenges are being addressed and improved, according to TechNavio. The firm observed that a notable obstacle in the PC gaming peripherals market has been the high cost associated with virtual reality. Until now, VR headsets have been prohibitively expensive, and the additional expense of the necessary PC hardware to support them has compounded the issue.Don't Miss: Biggest Computer Hardware Companies In the WorldOn January 11, Reuters cited research firms IDC and Canalys, which predicted that global shipments of personal computers are anticipated to increase from late 2023 onwards. The growth is expected to be accelerated by a new cycle of system upgrades, which were previously delayed by customers due to concerns about inflation and recession. However, these delayed upgrades are likely to occur later in the year and act as a catalyst for the growth of the PC market, as stated by the research firms. Canalys analyst Ishan Dutt further suggested that the recovery will be supported by a surge in demand from the education sector in major markets, as the devices deployed during the peak of the pandemic reach the end of their life cycle.Story continuesSome of the best computer hardware stocks to invest in include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Our Methodology We scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds and picked the top 10 companies that operate in the computer hardware sector with the highest number of hedge fund investors.

The stock has experienced a surge in value due to optimistic expectations of a market rebound and rumors about the possible separation or sale of Western Digital's NAND business. The analyst believes that even without these factors, Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC)’s valuation is still attractive, indicating potential for continued outperformance based on cyclical recovery alone.

restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives; acquisition, integration, divestiture and related; and certain legal and tax matters.  We have not provided quantitative reconciliations of these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures because the excluded items are not available on a prospective basis without unreasonable efforts.  For example, the timing of certain transactions is difficult to predict because management's plans may change.  In addition, the Company believes such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision and certainty that could be confusing to investors.  It is probable that these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures may be materially different from the corresponding GAAP financial measures.Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding financial guidance, the continuation, recovery and/or stabilization of the COVID-19 pandemic and macro pressures, including the impact on our business, and any statements about our forecasts, expectations, plans, intentions, strategies or prospects.

Inventory and manufacturing-related charges include excess and obsolete inventory charges on certain product lines we intend to discontinue and other inventory and manufacturing-related charges or gains.(2)  We exclude intangible asset amortization as well as deferred tax rate changes on our intangible assets from our non-GAAP financial measures because we internally assess our performance against our peers without this amortization.  Due to various levels of acquisitions among our peers, intangible asset amortization can vary significantly from company to company.(3)  In December 2019 and 2021, we initiated global restructuring programs that included a reorganization of key businesses and an overall effort to reduce costs in order to accelerate decision-making, focus the organization on priorities to drive growth and to prepare for the spinoff of ZimVie.  Restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives also include other cost reduction and optimization initiatives that have the goal of reducing costs across the organization.  The costs include employee termination benefits; contract terminations for facilities and sales agents; and other charges, such as consulting fees, project management expenses, retention period salaries and benefits and relocation costs. (4) We addressed inspectional observations on Form 483 and a Warning Letter issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (""FDA"") following its previous inspections of our Warsaw North Campus facility, among other matters.  This quality remediation required us to devote significant financial resources.  The majority of the expenses were related to consultants who helped us to update previous documents and redesign certain processes.(5)  The acquisition, integration, divestiture and related gains and expenses we have excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures resulted from various acquisitions, post-separation costs we have incurred related to ZimVie and gains related to a transition services agreement for services we provide to ZimVie and a transition manufacturing and supply agreement for products we supply to ZimVie for a limited period. (6) We are involved in patent litigation, product liability litigation, commercial litigation and other various litigation matters.  We review litigation matters from both a qualitative and quantitative perspective to determine if excluding the losses or gains will provide our investors with useful incremental information.  Litigation matters can vary in their characteristics, frequency and significance to our operating results.  The litigation charges and gains excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures in the periods presented relate to patent litigation.  Once the litigation matter has been excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures in a particular period, any additional expenses or gains from changes in estimates are also excluded, even if they are not significant, to ensure consistency in our non-GAAP financial measures from period-to-period.(7)  The European Union Medical Device Regulation imposes significant additional premarket and postmarket requirements.  The new regulations provided a transition period until May 2021 for previously-approved medical devices to meet the additional requirements.  For certain devices, this transition period can be extended until May 2024.  A conditional extension of the transition period has been implemented until December 2027 and 2028 depending on the legacy medical device's risk class.  We are excluding from our non-GAAP financial measures the incremental costs incurred to establish initial compliance with the regulations related to our previously-approved medical devices.  The incremental costs primarily relate to temporary personnel and third-party professionals necessary to supplement our internal resources.(8)  We have incurred other various expenses from specific events or projects that we consider highly variable or that have a significant impact to our operating results that we have excluded from our non-GAAP measures.  These include costs related to contract terminations and gains and losses from changes in fair value on our equity investments including our investment in ZimVie, among other various costs.(9)  Other certain tax adjustments are related to certain significant and discrete tax adjustments including intercompany transactions between jurisdictions, ongoing impacts of tax only amortization resulting from certain restructuring transactions, impacts of significant tax reform including Swiss reform and certain favorable tax audit settlements. ZIMMER BIOMET HOLDINGS, INC.RECONCILIATION OF NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES FROMCONTINUING OPERATIONS TO FREE CASH FLOW FROM CONTINUING

Since its inception in March, the fund has generated over $357,000 to help support shelter animals affected by disasters such as floods, fires, hurricanes and tornadoes.""Our hearts break for the communities and shelter animals that have been impacted by recent devastating weather events, including tornadoes, storms and flooding,"" said Kimberley Gardiner, chief marketing officer at Tractor Supply. ""In partnership with MuttNation, we've been able to quickly deploy our first Relief for Rescues grants and provide life-changing support to shelters and shelter animals in their time of greatest need. This meaningful impact underlines Tractor Supply's passion for caring for and protecting pets and animals.""In late March, as record snowpack began to melt and rainstorms approached, severe flooding swept through California’s Central Valley. Central California Animal Disaster Team, a nonprofit organization focused on assisting emergency response agencies with animal evacuation, emergency sheltering, search and rescue and animal reunification, has been on the ground assisting homeless animals. With Relief for Rescue funding, they have been able to provide food and medical care for these animals, while also keeping pets and pet parents together by housing them at the same facility.During another March storm, a violent EF4 tornado swept through Mississippi, devastating the area and its community. Amory Humane (Amory, Mississippi) and South Delta Animal Rescue (Rolling Fork, Mississippi) were among the damaged structures. Relief for Rescue funds have been earmarked to assist these shelters with food, medical supplies and materials needed to rebuild.Story continuesMuttNation and Tractor Supply will disperse additional grants to these and other organizations as needs continue to arise.""My heart goes out to everyone in the communities that have been hit so hard by the recent tornadoes over these past few weeks,"" adds Lambert. ""I am so grateful, especially now, to the hundreds of thousands of animal lovers who generously supported the launch of our MuttNation-Tractor Supply Relief For Rescues Fund, showing they care as deeply as I do about helping with the recovery process and proving, once again, we are always strongest when we work together.""In celebration of the initiative’s launch, from March 6-12, Tractor Supply invited customers to donate to the Relief for Rescues Fund at checkout in-store, online at TractorSupply.com or via the Tractor Supply mobile app. The inspiration for the fund came after Lambert witnessed the impact of 2017’s Hurricane Harvey on shelter pets while on the ground in Houston during recovery efforts. In addition to providing funding via Relief for Rescues, MuttNation also works directly with transport partners to assist and relocate animals during times of natural disaster.To learn more about Relief for Rescues and MuttNation, visit MuttNation.com.About Tractor Supply CompanyFor 85 years, Tractor Supply Company (NASDAQ: TSCO) has been passionate about serving the needs of recreational farmers, ranchers, homeowners, gardeners, pet enthusiasts and all those who enjoy living Life Out Here.

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 58% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Occidental Petroleum, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Occidental Petroleum?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Occidental Petroleum. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Occidental Petroleum, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Occidental Petroleum. Our data shows that Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is the largest shareholder with 24% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 10% and 6.8% of the stock.Story continuesOur research also brought to light the fact that roughly 52% of the company is controlled by the top 5 shareholders suggesting that these owners wield significant influence on the business.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Occidental PetroleumThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Occidental Petroleum Corporation. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$126m worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 18% stake in Occidental Petroleum. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Public Company OwnershipIt appears to us that public companies own 24% of Occidental Petroleum. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company.

The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company presents these non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by the Company’s management to evaluate operating performance and formulate business plans. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures help identify underlying trends in the Company’s business, provide further information about the Company’s results of operations and enhance the overall understanding of the Company’s past performance and future prospects.The non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. The Company’s non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect all items of income and expense that affect the Company’s operations and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Furthermore, these non-GAAP measures may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited. The Company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company’s performance. The Company encourages investors and others to review the Company’s financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.The Company defines non-GAAP operating income as operating income excluding share-based compensation expenses, non-GAAP net income as net income excluding recurring item of share-based compensation expenses and non-recurring item of provision for equity litigants, and non-GAAP net income attributable to the Company’s ordinary shareholders as net income attributable to the Company’s ordinary shareholders excluding recurring item of share-based compensation expenses and non-recurring item of provision for equity litigants.For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures to the Most Directly Comparable GAAP Measures” set forth at the end of this earnings release.EXCHANGE RATE INFORMATIONThis earnings release contains translations of certain RMB amounts into U.S. dollars (“US$”) at specified rates solely for the convenience of the reader.

This compares to earnings of $3.52 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3.39%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this drugmaker would post earnings of $3.53 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.76, delivering a surprise of 6.52%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Vertex , which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, posted revenues of $2.37 billion for the quarter ended March 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.02%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.1 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Vertex shares have added about 18% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 8.6%.What's Next for Vertex?While Vertex has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Vertex: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $3.58 on $2.38 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $14.01 on $9.64 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Medical - Biomedical and Genetics is currently in the top 37% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the same industry, Paratek Pharmaceuticals (PRTK), has yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2023.This pharmaceutical company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.30 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +14.3%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Paratek Pharmaceuticals' revenues are expected to be $33.78 million, up 35.9% from the year-ago quarter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

""Over the course of this year, we look forward to continuing to expand our leadership in CF; preparing for near-term launches, including exa-cel; and advancing multiple potentially transformative medicines through mid- and late-stage clinical trials.""First Quarter 2023 ResultsProduct revenue increased 13% to $2.37 billion compared to the first quarter of 2022, primarily driven by the strong uptake of TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO in multiple countries internationally and continued performance of TRIKAFTA in the U.S. Net product revenue in the first quarter of 2023 increased 3% to $1.40 billion in the U.S. and increased 33% to $971 million outside the U.S., compared to the first quarter of 2022.Combined GAAP and Non-GAAP R&amp;D, Acquired IPR&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses were $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, compared to $818 million and $687 million, respectively, in the first quarter of 2022. The increases were due to higher acquired IPR&amp;D expenses, increased investment in support of multiple programs that have advanced in mid- and late-stage clinical development, and the costs to support launches of Vertex's therapies globally.Story continuesGAAP effective tax rate was 21.5% compared to 20.2% for the first quarter of 2022.Non-GAAP effective tax rate was 21.3% compared to 21.5% for the first quarter of 2022. Please refer to Note 1 for further details on our GAAP to Non-GAAP tax adjustments.GAAP and Non-GAAP net income decreased by 8% and 12%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2022, primarily driven by higher acquired IPR&amp;D expenses, increased investment in our mid- and late-stage clinical pipeline, and the costs to support launches of Vertex’s therapies globally, partially offset by strong revenue growth and increased interest income.Cash, cash equivalents and total marketable securities as of March 31, 2023 were $11.5 billion, compared to $10.9 billion as of December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily driven by strong revenue growth and operating cash flow, partially offset by our upfront payments to Entrada Therapeutics, CRISPR Therapeutics and other collaboration partners, repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program, and income tax payments.Full Year 2023 Financial GuidanceVertex today reiterated its full year 2023 financial guidance, including CF product revenue guidance of $9.55 to $9.7 billion. Vertex’s CF product revenue guidance includes expectations in the U.S. for continued performance of TRIKAFTA in ages 6+ and the launch of TRIKAFTA in the 2-5 age group, as well as continued uptake of KAFTRIO/TRIKAFTA in ages 6+ in countries outside the U.S., including those with recent reimbursement agreements. This guidance includes an approximately 150-basis-point negative impact from changes in foreign currency rates, inclusive of our foreign exchange risk management program.Vertex’s financial guidance is summarized below:Current FY 2023Previous FY 2023CF product revenuesUnchanged$9.55 to $9.7 billionCombined GAAP R&amp;D, Acquired IPR&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses (2)Unchanged$4.35 to $4.6 billionCombined Non-GAAP R&amp;D, Acquired IPR&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses (2)Unchanged$3.9 to $4.0 billionNon-GAAP effective tax rateUnchanged21% to 22%Key Business HighlightsCystic Fibrosis (CF) Marketed ProductsVertex anticipates the number of CF patients taking our medicines will continue to grow, including through new approvals and reimbursement for the treatment of younger patients. Recent progress includes:Vertex received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the use of TRIKAFTA in children 2 to 5 years of age with at least one F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene or a mutation in the CFTR gene that is responsive to TRIKAFTA. With this approval, approximately 900 children are newly eligible for TRIKAFTA. Vertex has also completed regulatory submissions with the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the United Kingdom, Health Canada, and the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) in Australia for the use of KAFTRIO/TRIKAFTA in children 2 to 5 years of age.Vertex received a positive opinion from the EMA Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) for the use of ORKAMBI in children 1 to &lt;2 years of age with two copies of the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene. If this label extension is approved by the European Commission, nearly 300 children with CF will be eligible for the first time for a medicine to treat the underlying cause of their disease.Vertex has also submitted an sNDA to the FDA and Marketing Authorization Applications (MAAs) to the EMA, MHRA, and Health Canada for the use of KALYDECO in children from 1 month to &lt;4 months of age. The FDA granted Priority Review designation and assigned a PDUFA date of May 3, 2023.Potential Near-Term Launch OpportunitiesVertex is preparing for the following near-term potential new product launches:Exagamglogene autotemcel (exa-cel), formerly known as CTX001, in severe sickle cell disease (SCD) and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (TDT):Vertex completed the rolling submission of its biologics licensing applications (BLAs) in the U.S. The BLAs include requests for Priority Review, which if granted, would shorten the FDA’s review of the application to eight months from the time of submission versus a standard review timeline of 12 months. In the U.S., exa-cel has been granted Fast Track, Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT), Orphan Drug and Rare Pediatric Disease designations.In December 2022, Vertex completed regulatory submissions for exa-cel with the EMA and MHRA in the EU and the U.K., respectively. Both the EMA and the MHRA have validated the MAAs, indicating acceptance of the marketing applications and initiation of the review. Exa-cel has been granted Priority Medicines (PRIME) and Orphan Drug designation in the EU. In the U.K., exa-cel has been granted an Innovation Passport under the Innovative Licensing and Access Pathway (ILAP) from the MHRA.Vanzacaftor/tezacaftor/deutivacaftor, the next-in-class triple combination, in cystic fibrosis: In the fourth quarter of 2022, Vertex completed enrollment in the pivotal SKYLINE 102 and SKYLINE 103 trials, which evaluate the efficacy and safety of vanzacaftor/tezacaftor/deutivacaftor relative to TRIKAFTA in patients with CF 12 years of age and older. Vertex expects to complete the SKYLINE studies by the end of 2023. In parallel, Vertex has initiated a study of vanzacaftor/tezacaftor/deutivacaftor in children with CF 6 to 11 years of age, known as the RIDGELINE study, and the company also expects to complete this study by the end of 2023.VX-548 in acute pain: Vertex continues to enroll the Phase 3 pivotal program for its lead compound, VX-548, for the treatment of moderate to severe acute pain and expects to complete the pivotal program in late 2023 or early 2024. VX-548 has been granted Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designations in the U.S. for moderate to severe acute pain.R&amp;D PipelineVertex is delivering on a diversified pipeline of potentially transformative small molecule, mRNA, cell and genetic therapies aimed at serious diseases. Recent and anticipated progress for programs in clinical development is summarized below.Cystic FibrosisVertex continues to pursue next-in-class, small molecule CFTR modulator therapies as well as an mRNA therapy for the approximately 5,000 patients who cannot benefit from CFTR modulators alone.Vertex is developing VX-522, a CFTR mRNA therapeutic, in collaboration with Moderna. The goal of this therapy is to treat the underlying cause of CF by programming cells in the lungs to produce functional CFTR protein, and it is aimed at the treatment of the approximately 5,000 people with CF who do not produce any CFTR protein. Vertex has initiated a single ascending dose (SAD) clinical trial for VX-522 in people with CF, which is active and enrolling patients at multiple sites. Vertex expects to complete the SAD and initiate a multiple ascending dose (MAD) study in 2023. In the U.S., the FDA has granted Fast Track designation for VX-522.Beta Thalassemia and Sickle Cell DiseaseExa-cel is a non-viral ex vivo CRISPR gene-editing therapy, which is being developed as a potential functional cure for TDT and SCD. Vertex is developing exa-cel in collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics.Dosing in the Phase 1/2/3 CLIMB-111 and CLIMB-121 studies continues, as does the CLIMB-131 long-term follow-up study in patients 12 years of age and older.Two additional Phase 3 studies of exa-cel continue to enroll patients 5 to 11 years of age with TDT or SCD.Neuropathic Pain (NaV1.8)Vertex has discovered multiple selective small molecule inhibitors of NaV1.8 with the objective of creating a new class of pain medicines that have the potential to provide effective pain relief, without the limitations of opioids and other currently available medicines.Vertex continues to enroll and dose patients in a Phase 2 dose-ranging study of VX-548 in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, a common form of peripheral neuropathic pain.Vertex expects to complete this study in late 2023 or early 2024.APOL1-Mediated Kidney Disease (AMKD)Vertex has discovered multiple oral, small molecule inhibitors of APOL1 function, pioneering a new class of medicines that target an underlying genetic driver of kidney disease.In March, the New England Journal of Medicine published results from preclinical studies and a Phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of inaxaplin (VX-147) on top of standard-of-care in people with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and two APOL1 variants, a form of AMKD. The results from the Phase 2 study of inaxaplin demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful mean reduction in proteinuria of 47.6% at 13 weeks compared to baseline. Inaxaplin was generally well tolerated in the study.Vertex continues to enroll and dose patients in the pivotal program for inaxaplin, a single Phase 2/3 clinical trial in patients with AMKD, and expects to complete the Phase 2B dose-ranging portion of the study in 2023.Inaxaplin was granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA for FSGS, as well as Orphan Drug and PRIME designations by the EMA for AMKD.Type 1 Diabetes (T1D)Vertex is evaluating cell therapies using stem-cell derived, fully differentiated, insulin-producing islet cells to replace the endogenous insulin-producing islet cells that are destroyed in people with T1D, with the goal of developing a potential functional cure for this disease. Vertex has three programs that use these fully differentiated cells.VX-880, fully differentiated cells with standard immunosuppression: Vertex has completed enrollment and dosing in Part B of the Phase 1/2 study of VX-880. Vertex expects to present updated clinical data, including data from more patients and with longer duration of follow-up from the VX-880 study at scientific congresses in 2023, including the American Diabetes Association Scientific Sessions in June. Next, Vertex intends to begin Part C of the study with concurrent dosing. In March 2023, VX-880 was granted PRIME designation by the EMA.VX-264, fully differentiated cells encapsulated in immunoprotective device: The Investigational New Drug (IND) application in the U.S. and the Clinical Trial Application (CTA) in Canada for VX-264, the cells plus device program, have been cleared, and Vertex plans to begin enrollment and dosing in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in the near term.Edited fully differentiated cells: Vertex’s hypoimmune cell research program continues to progress.In addition, a Phase 1/2 study of VCTX-211, a hypoimmune cell program using ViaCyte cells that originated under the CRISPR Therapeutics and ViaCyte collaboration, is active and enrolling patients.Alpha-1 Antitrypsin DeficiencyVertex is working to address the underlying genetic cause of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency by developing novel small molecule correctors of Z-AAT protein folding, with a goal of increasing the secretion of functional AAT into the blood and addressing both the lung and the liver aspects of AAT deficiency.Vertex initiated a 48-week Phase 2 study of VX-864, a first-generation AAT corrector, to assess the impact of longer-term treatment on polymer clearance from the liver, as well as the resultant levels of functional AAT (fAAT) in the plasma. This Phase 2 trial continues to enroll and dose patients.Additionally, Vertex continues to enroll and dose healthy volunteers with VX-634, a follow-on small molecule AAT corrector. VX-634 is the first in a series of next-wave investigational molecules with significantly improved potency and drug-like properties compared to previous Vertex AAT correctors.Additional Earlier Stage R&amp;D ProgramsConsistent with its overall strategy, Vertex takes a portfolio approach to all of its programs, with additional assets in CF, SCD, TDT, pain, AMKD, T1D and AATD in earlier stages of development.Vertex is also advancing preclinical assets in new disease areas, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). Additionally, Vertex is working on preclinical molecules with the potential to expand our leadership in existing disease areas, including assets targeting gentler conditioning for exa-cel and NaV1.7 in pain.Investments in External InnovationConsistent with its strategy to develop transformative medicines for serious diseases, in the first quarter of 2023, Vertex announced a new licensing agreement for the use of CRISPR Therapeutics’ gene editing technology, known as CRISPR/Cas9, to accelerate the development of Vertex’s hypoimmune cell therapies for T1D. Under this agreement, Vertex made an upfront payment of $100 million to CRISPR in the first quarter of 2023.In addition, the previously announced global research collaboration with Entrada Therapeutics, focused on therapeutics for DM1, has closed. Under the terms of the agreement, upon closing, Vertex made an upfront payment of approximately $225 million to Entrada, as well as an equity investment of approximately $25 million.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresIn this press release, Vertex's financial results and financial guidance are provided in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) and using certain non-GAAP financial measures. In particular, non-GAAP financial results and guidance exclude from Vertex's pre-tax income (i) stock-based compensation expense, (ii) gains or losses related to the fair value of the company's strategic investments, (iii) increases or decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration, (iv) acquisition-related costs, and (v) other adjustments. The company's non-GAAP financial results also exclude from its provision for income taxes the estimated tax impact related to its non-GAAP adjustments to pre-tax income described above and certain discrete items. These results should not be viewed as a substitute for the company’s GAAP results and are provided as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures help indicate underlying trends in the company's business, are important in comparing current results with prior period results and provide additional information regarding the company's financial position that the company believes is helpful to an understanding of its ongoing business. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures to establish budgets and operational goals that are communicated internally and externally, to manage the company's business and to evaluate its performance. The company’s calculation of non-GAAP financial measures likely differs from the calculations used by other companies. A reconciliation of the GAAP financial results to non-GAAP financial results is included in the attached financial information.The company provides guidance regarding combined R&amp;D, Acquired IPR&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses and effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis. Unless otherwise noted, the guidance regarding combined GAAP and non-GAAP R&amp;D, Acquired IPR&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses does not include estimates associated with any potential future business development transactions, including collaborations, asset acquisitions and/or licensing of third-party intellectual property rights. The company does not provide guidance regarding its GAAP effective tax rate because it is unable to forecast with reasonable certainty the impact of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and the possibility of certain discrete items, which could be material.Vertex Pharmaceuticals IncorporatedConsolidated Statements of Income(in millions, except per share amounts)(unaudited)Three Months Ended March 31,20232022Product revenues, net$2,374.8$2,097.5Costs and expenses:Cost of sales266.9245.8Research and development expenses742.6601.1Acquired in-process research and development expenses347.12.0Selling, general and administrative expenses241.1215.2Change in fair value of contingent consideration(1.9)(7.5)Total costs and expenses1,595.81,056.6Income from operations779.01,040.9Interest income122.61.6Interest expense(11.4)(14.9)Other income (expense), net1.3(72.8)Income before provision for income taxes891.5954.8Provision for income taxes191.7192.7Net income$699.8$762.1Net income per common share:Basic$2.72$2.99Diluted$2.69$2.96Shares used in per share calculations:Basic257.4255.1Diluted260.3257.9Vertex Pharmaceuticals IncorporatedProduct Revenues(in millions)(unaudited)Three Months Ended March 31,20232022TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO$2,096.7$1,761.6Other CF products278.1335.9Product revenues, net$2,374.8$2,097.5Vertex Pharmaceuticals IncorporatedReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Information(in millions, except percentages)(unaudited)Three Months Ended March 31,20232022GAAP cost of sales$266.9$245.8Stock-based compensation expense(1.9)(2.2)Non-GAAP cost of sales$265.0$243.6GAAP research and development expenses$742.6$601.1Stock-based compensation expense(76.3)(80.4)Acquisition-related costs (3)(2.8)(2.8)Non-GAAP research and development expenses$663.5$517.9Acquired in-process research and development expenses$347.1$2.0GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses$241.1$215.2Stock-based compensation expense(44.2)(47.7)Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses$196.9$167.5Combined non-GAAP R&amp;D, Acquired IPR&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses$1,207.5$687.4GAAP other income (expense), net$1.3$(72.8)(Increase) decrease in fair value of strategic investments(6.4)75.6Non-GAAP other (expense) income, net$(5.1)$2.8GAAP provision for income taxes$191.7$192.7Tax adjustments (1)22.756.2Non-GAAP provision for income taxes$214.4$248.9GAAP effective tax rate21.5%20.2%Non-GAAP effective tax rate21.3%21.5%Vertex Pharmaceuticals IncorporatedReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Information (continued)(in millions, except per share amounts)(unaudited)Three Months Ended March 31,20232022GAAP operating income$779.0$1,040.9Stock-based compensation expense122.4130.3Decrease in fair value of contingent consideration(1.9)(7.5)Acquisition-related costs (3)2.82.8Non-GAAP operating income$902.3$1,166.5Three Months Ended March 31,20232022GAAP net income$699.8$762.1Stock-based compensation expense122.4130.3(Increase) decrease in fair value of strategic investments(6.4)75.6Decrease in fair value of contingent consideration(1.9)(7.5)Acquisition-related costs (3)2.82.8Total non-GAAP adjustments to pre-tax income116.9201.2Tax adjustments (1)(22.7)(56.2)Non-GAAP net income$794.0$907.1Net income per diluted common share:GAAP$2.69$2.96Non-GAAP$3.05$3.52Shares used in diluted per share calculations:GAAP and Non-GAAP260.3257.9Vertex Pharmaceuticals IncorporatedCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets(in millions)(unaudited)March 31, 2023December 31, 2022AssetsCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$10,414.1$10,778.5Accounts receivable, net1,547.81,442.2Inventories535.1460.6Prepaid expenses and other current assets468.7553.5Total current assets12,965.713,234.8Property and equipment, net1,111.71,108.4Goodwill and intangible assets1,691.61,691.6Deferred tax assets1,359.91,246.9Operating lease assets336.3347.4Long-term marketable securities1,081.5112.2Other long-term assets427.5409.6Total assets$18,974.2$18,150.9Liabilities and Shareholders' EquityAccounts payable and accrued expenses$2,649.2$2,430.6Other current liabilities377.0311.5Total current liabilities3,026.22,742.1Long-term finance lease liabilities417.6430.8Long-term operating lease liabilities371.6379.5Other long-term liabilities726.5685.8Shareholders' equity14,432.313,912.7Total liabilities and shareholders' equity$18,974.2$18,150.9Common shares outstanding257.5257.0Notes and Explanations1: In the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, ""Tax adjustments"" included the estimated income taxes related to non-GAAP adjustments to the company's pre-tax income and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.2: The difference between the company’s full year 2023 combined GAAP R&amp;D, Acquired IPR&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses and combined non-GAAP R&amp;D, Acquired IPR&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses guidance relates primarily to $440 million to $575 million of stock-based compensation expense.

If you don't want to get into details, then you can feel free to skip to the Top 5 Railroad Companies in the World. Railroad companies play a vital role in the global supply chain, transporting goods and materials across long distances efficiently and quickly. With the increasing demand for transportation services, the railroad industry has become one of the most important sectors in the world.  According to a report by IEA, today, most of the world's traditional rail networks are found in North America, Europe, China, Russia, India, and Japan. Around 90% of all passenger movements on conventional rail occur in these regions, with India leading the pack with 39%, followed by China with 27%, Japan with 11%, and the European Union with 9%.   The Revival Of the Railroad Industry   The current situation of railroad supply chains is influenced by various factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, increasing demand for transportation services, and pressure to reduce carbon emissions. Despite these challenges, railroad companies continue to play a critical role in the global supply chain, facilitating the movement of goods and materials between countries and regions.  During the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for rail transport increased, as companies sought alternative ways to move goods across borders amid restrictions on air and sea transport. According to Allied Market Research, the market for railway systems worldwide, which was valued at $27.2 billion in 2021, is anticipated to increase at a CAGR of 4.6% from 2022 to 2031 to reach $42.4 billion.   These companies have implemented various measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on their operations, such as implementing safety protocols. Importantly, they have also taken steps to reduce their carbon footprint by adopting more sustainable practices and investing in eco-friendly technologies, alternative fuels, and investing in more efficient locomotives and railcars.    Story continuesAs the world continues to face various economic, environmental, and social challenges, the role of railroad companies in the global supply chain will only become more important. Even though it transports 7% of the world's freight and 8% of its passengers, rail represents only 2% of the overall energy demand for transportation.  Rail transport can also be integrated with other modes of transport such as trucks, ships, and planes, to create a multi-modal transportation system that provides end-to-end supply chain solutions. This integration can help optimize the supply chain by combining the strengths of each mode of transport to achieve greater efficiency, speed, and cost-effectiveness.   Top 15 Railroad Companies in the WorldPixabay/Public DomainOur Methodology    We have listed the top 15 railroad companies in the world in ascending order according to their trailing twelve-month revenue for their latest fiscal years, for which the data is publicly available. To acquire deeper knowledge about these companies, we gathered the information using a data-driven approach, incorporating relevant statistics to support the analysis.

Ellen Gordon, the chair of Tootsie Roll Industries, said the gain was due, in part, to higher demand and strong seasonal and marketing programs.Enthusiasm, however, was tempered by higher costs for ingredients, packaging materials, freight and delivery, and manufacturing costs.

These obstacles are notably different from the time when people stocked up their pantries during the pandemic. The price increases implemented in 2022 and subsequently felt by consumers have already had an impact on their purchasing behavior. Despite spending more on food and beverage products than in previous years, households in the United States are buying less food for consumption at home compared to pre-COVID estimations.Food Business News reported that a majority of food and beverage industry executives who participated in a survey conducted by Marcum LLP in December 2022 expressed optimism for the upcoming year. The survey, which involved executives from food manufacturers, restaurants, distributors, retailers, and agriculture producers, covered various aspects crucial to the industry's well-being. The findings revealed that 69% of respondents held a positive outlook for the industry in the next year, while 20% expressed a neutral outlook, and 16% expressed a negative outlook. Approximately 70% of participants reported an increase in revenues in 2022 compared to 2021, with 48% indicating a revenue growth of 10% or higher.According to the survey, it is not just revenues that had seen an increase. 45% of food and beverage executives reported expanding their workforce by 5% or more in the last year, while 20% indicated a workforce growth of 10% or more. Additionally, nearly half of the respondents expressed their expectation to expand their workforce in 2023. As per Louis Biscotti, national leader of Marcum’s food and beverage group: “There is much optimism regarding the future of food and beverage companies. Honestly, this was a bit surprising to me considering the many challenges facing the industry.” Story continuesDon’t Miss: 15 Countries That Produce the Most AlcoholOn January 4, Food Processing Magazine cited Danny Edsall, grocery leader for consulting firm Deloitte, who said:“Perception is reality when it comes to consumers. Fair or not, more than half of consumers believe prices are going up more than needed in order to increase company profits. Our research also suggests that when consumers start to feel this way, they pull back on their spending intentions. It’s a matter of eroding trust and creates a tricky situation for food &amp; beverage companies facing pressure of their own from much higher input costs.”The vanishing of grocery promotions such as coupons, special discounts, and package deals has emerged as a highly apparent consequence of inflation. This matter has sparked disagreements between processors and retailers. Julie Oxner, senior vice president for business intelligence at consultancy Acosta, told Food Processing Magazine:“We believe that there is absolutely a sweet spot for processors and retailers to work together to alleviate some of the cost pressures shoppers experience. We’d recommend that the first step is to analyze current promotions to see which are a win-win for both the processor and the retailer.”Some of the best beverage stocks to invest in include PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST), and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO). Our Methodology We scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds and picked the top 10 companies that operate in the beverage sector with the highest number of hedge fund investors. These are the best beverage stocks to buy according to hedge funds.10 Best Beverage Stocks To BuyPhoto by Gio Bartlett on UnsplashBest Beverage Stocks To Buy10. Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 23Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) specializes in the production, marketing, and sale of alcoholic beverages. Their product portfolio includes a wide range of spirits such as scotch, whisky, gin, vodka, rum, tequila, and brandy. Some of their well-known brands include Johnnie Walker, Guinness, Tanqueray, Baileys, Smirnoff, Captain Morgan, and Crown Royal. The company's H1 2022 revenue reached £9.4 billion, showing an increase of 18.4%. This growth can be attributed to strong organic net sales and favorable effects from foreign exchange, mainly due to the strengthening of the US dollar. The reported operating profit also saw a notable growth of 15.2% to £3.2 billion. On April 18, Morgan Stanley analyst Pinar Ergun raised the firm's price target on Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) to 3,700 GBp from 3,600 GBp and maintained an Equal Weight rating on the shares.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 23 hedge funds were bullish on Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO), compared to 20 funds in the last quarter. Tom Gayner’s Markel Gayner Asset Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 1.35 million shares worth $240.6 million. Like PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST), and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) is one of the best beverage stocks to invest in. Here is what ClearBridge Aggressive Growth Strategy has to say about Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Diageo is a leading global distiller and brewer which addresses the large ($500 billion-plus) and fragmented market for spirits. With its portfolio of premium products, we see Diageo as a steady compounder poised for sustained, above industry growth. The company’s margins remain below pre-COVID levels in a number of geographies and should continue to recover as channels reopen, though we also see opportunities for consistent margin expansion beyond this period of rebound. The spirits category is not immune to weaker consumer spending nor inflation; however the majority of Diageo’s profits are from the U.S. market, which has historically been more resilient. Additionally, the company has a number of margin levers to help combat rising input costs.”9. The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (NYSE:SAM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 23The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (NYSE:SAM) is a US-based company that specializes in producing and selling alcoholic beverages. Their most well-known beer is Samuel Adams Boston Lager. They offer a variety of beers, hard ciders, flavored malt beverages, and hard seltzers under different brand names. The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (NYSE:SAM) is one of the best beverage stocks to invest in. On April 25, RBC Capital analyst Nik Modi kept a Sector Perform rating and a $300 price target on The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (NYSE:SAM) ahead of its Q1 results. The analyst noted that there is limited visibility for the company and anticipates significant pressure on shipments, depletions, margins, and earnings. This quarter will also be affected by the comparison to the launch of Truly Margarita a year ago. The analyst's research note indicates that Truly, one of The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (NYSE:SAM)’s brands, continues to struggle, with volumes declining over 30% in the March quarter and a further deceleration in two-year trends.According to Insider Monkey’s database, 23 hedge funds were bullish on The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (NYSE:SAM) at the end of December 2022, compared to 18 funds in the prior quarter. GLG Partners is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 44,365 shares worth $14.6 million. Here is what Artisan Mid-Cap Fund has to say about The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (NYSE:SAM) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“We ended our campaigns in Boston Beer Company. Boston Beer Company sells a focused portfolio of alcoholic beverage brands. In recent years, the company has emerged as one of the leaders in the hard seltzer category, which has grown over 150% in each of the past three years (2018-2020). Boston Beer’s Truly brand, the second-largest seller of hard seltzer, has benefited from this growth and was core to our investment thesis. However, the hard seltzer category’s growth has recently slowed to single digits, falling short of high investor expectations and pressuring Boston Beer’s earnings upside. Truly’s growth was core to our investment thesis, and a recovery is uncertain; thus, we ended our investment campaign.”8. MGP Ingredients, Inc. (NASDAQ:MGPI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25MGP Ingredients, Inc. (NASDAQ:MGPI) specializes in the production and distribution of distilled spirits, branded spirits, and food ingredients. Their operations are divided into three segments – Distillery Solutions, Branded Spirits, and Ingredient Solutions. On February 23, MGP Ingredients, Inc. (NASDAQ:MGPI) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $1.01 and a revenue of $191 million, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.16 and $7.14 million, respectively. In fiscal 2023, sales are projected to be in the range of $815 million to $835 million, versus an $823.95 million consensus. MGP Ingredients, Inc. (NASDAQ:MGPI) expects adjusted basic earnings per common share to be in the $5.05 to $5.20 range, compared to a $5.11 consensus. On February 2, Wells Fargo analyst Marc Torrente reiterated an Overweight rating on MGP Ingredients, Inc. (NASDAQ:MGPI) but lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $118 from $128. Wells Fargo acknowledged that the stock has declined due to concerns about the normalization of the category. However, the firm believes that MGP Ingredients, Inc. (NASDAQ:MGPI) has the potential to be more resilient than it is currently given credit for, thanks to its strategic positioning. Consequently, while Wells Fargo has moderated its price target and sales outlook considering this uncertainty, they still have confidence in MGP's ability to perform well.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 25 hedge funds were bullish on MGP Ingredients, Inc. (NASDAQ:MGPI), compared to 19 funds in the prior quarter. Richard Driehaus’ Driehaus Capital is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 477,203 shares worth $50.7 million. Here is what Harding Loevner specifically said about MGP Ingredients, Inc. (NASDAQ:MGPI) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“By region, our performance was aided by a renewed market preference for higher-quality small caps in the US, where the portfolio had its best stock selection. Shares of discount retailer Ollie’s Bargain Outlet rebounded from their first-quarter decline while shares of MGP Ingredients, Inc. (NASDAQ:MGPI) reached an all-time high. Ollie’s expects to benefit from the excess inventory at other retailers given its focus on closeout merchandise. MGP Ingredients posted record growth and margin expansion on strong demand for its aged whiskey as well as specialty wheat starches and proteins used in food products.”7. Molson Coors Beverage Company (NYSE:TAP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29Molson Coors Beverage Company (NYSE:TAP) is involved in the production, marketing, and distribution of beer and other malt beverage products across different regions such as the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Asia Pacific. In the fourth quarter, there was a significant 59.3% increase in underlying net income, considering constant currency rates. This positive result demonstrates Molson Coors Beverage Company (NYSE:TAP)’s ability to meet its bottom-line guidance for the full year. It is one of the best beverage stocks to invest in. On April 14, Lauren Lieberman, an analyst at Barclays, increased the price target for Molson Coors Beverage Company (NYSE:TAP) from $50 to $52. Despite this adjustment, Lieberman maintained an ""Equal Weight"" rating for the company's shares as they anticipate the release of the Q1 results. When considering the firm's staples universe, the analyst has a preference for companies that have a clearer path to volume growth. This can be achieved either through increased exposure to the relevant market category or through unique and specific factors that positively impact the company's performance.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 29 hedge funds were bullish on Molson Coors Beverage Company (NYSE:TAP), compared to 34 funds in the prior quarter. Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with nearly 2 million shares worth $99 million. Here is what Argosy Investors has to say about Molson Coors Beverage Company (NYSE:TAP) in its Q2 2021 investor letter:“TAP (+52% from August 2020 purchase to sale) was never intended to be a core position. I expected a couple of years of deleveraging and perhaps some excitement around the hard seltzer category, but the stock price increased faster than I expected. I have not fully exited these positions as I rarely do all in one trade, but hopefully this gives some perspective into my thinking on selling so quickly.”6. Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 31Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP) is a beverage company that operates both within the United States and internationally. The company is divided into four distinct segments – Coffee Systems, Packaged Beverages, Beverage Concentrates, and Latin America Beverages. On April 27, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.

(NASDAQ:KDP) as the company prepares to release its Q1 results. According to the analyst's research note, the analyst expects Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP) to surpass the consensus expectations.

(NASDAQ:KDP), compared to 23 funds in the prior quarter. Harris Associates is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 3.17 million shares worth $113.25 million. In addition to PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST), and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Keurig Dr Pepper Inc.

(NASDAQ:KDP) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“We sold the remainder of our Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP) shares in the quarter. As a consumer staples company, Keurig’s shares have held up very well in a difficult market and, as a result, its relative valuation was no longer as compelling as other investment opportunities.

""Furthermore, in Q1 we made a decision to focus our development efforts on eight programs that have high potential value for us and discontinued six other programs. This allows us to optimize our allocation of resources on programs that can have a high impact for patients and for Incyte.""Key Product Sales PerformanceJakafi:Net product revenues of $580 million:Net product revenues grew 7% compared with the first quarter of 2022, driven by strong underlying patient demand growth (+7% Y/Y) including an 8% growth in new patients. Total patients grew across myelofibrosis (MF), polycythemia vera (PV) and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).Net product revenues were unfavorably impacted by:Higher gross-to-net deductions, compared to fourth quarter of 2022, as a result of the Medicare coverage gap and higher commercial patient deductibles at the beginning of the plan year, as well as an increase in 340B orders.Lower than normal levels of channel inventory at the end of Q1, representing an $11 million impact.Story continuesOpzelura:Net product revenues of $57 million:Net product revenues grew 343% compared with the first quarter of 2022, driven by growth in patient demand and expansion in payer coverage as the launch in atopic dermatitis (AD) and vitiligo continues.Compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, net product revenues were unfavorably impacted by:Increase in co-pay assistance due to higher commercial patient deductibles at the beginning of the plan year, consistent with first quarter dynamics and higher Medicaid utilization volume.Acceleration of refills in December 2022 driven by patient demand in advance of annual deductible reset or health plan changes that negatively impacted refills during the months of January and February this year.Pipeline UpdatesMPNs and GVHD – key highlightsLIMBER (Leadership In MPNs and GVHD BEyond Ruxolitinib): Our LIMBER development program encompasses multiple monotherapy and combination strategies, with the goal of improving upon the standard of care in MF, PV, GVHD and now, essential thrombocythemia (ET).Combination trials of ruxolitinib BID with zilurgisertib (ALK2) and INCB57643 (BET) are ongoing and progressing well.In early development, INCA33989 (mCALR) is on track for initiating first-in-human study in MF and ET in 2023. Additionally, a Phase 1 study evaluating ruxolitinib BID in combination with Cellenkos' CK0804 in MF is continuing to recruit patients.AGAVE-201, a global pivotal Phase 2 trial of axatilimab in patients with cGVHD is ongoing and results are on track for mid-2023. A Phase 1/2 combination trial of axatilimab in combination with ruxolitinib is being planned.The Phase 3 LIMBER-304 trial, evaluating parsaclisib in combination with ruxolitinib BID in suboptimal responders in MF and the Phase 3 LIMBER-313 trial, evaluating parsaclisib in combination with ruxolitinib BID in first-line MF, were discontinued following results of interim analyses that indicated that the studies were unlikely to meet their primary endpoints in the intent-to-treat patient population. The studies were not stopped due to safety.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a complete response letter for ruxolitinib extended-release (XR) tablets for once-daily (QD) use in the treatment of certain types of MF, PV and GVHD. Incyte will work with the FDA to determine appropriate next steps.Indication and statusRuxolitinib XR (QD)(JAK1/JAK2)Myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera and GVHDRuxolitinib + zilurgisertib(JAK1/JAK2 + ALK2)Myelofibrosis: Phase 2Ruxolitinib + INCB57643(JAK1/JAK2 + BET)Myelofibrosis: Phase 2Ruxolitinib + CK08041(JAK1/JAK2 + CB-Tregs)Myelofibrosis: Phase 1 (LIMBER-TREG108)Axatilimab (anti-CSF-1R)2Chronic GVHD: Pivotal Phase 2 (third-line plus therapy) (AGAVE-201)Ruxolitinib + axatilimab2(JAK1/JAK2 + anti-CSF-1R)Chronic GVHD: Phase 1/2 in preparationINCA33989(mCALR)Myelofibrosis, essential thrombocythemia: Entering clinic in 20231 Development collaboration with Cellenkos, Inc.2 Clinical development of axatilimab in GVHD conducted in collaboration with Syndax Pharmaceuticals.Other Hematology/Oncology – key highlightsZynyz™ (retifanlimab-dlwr) approved for Merkel cell carcinoma in the U.S.: Zynyz, a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1), received accelerated approval for the treatment of adults with metastatic or recurrent locally advanced Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in the U.S. This represents the first regulatory approval for Incyte's PD-1 inhibitor, which is also being evaluated in pivotal trials in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal (SCAC).Monjuvi® (tafasitamab-cxix)/Minjuvi® (tafasitamab): Minjuvi continues to launch in new ex-US markets, having gained reimbursement in two additional countries this quarter, bringing the total of launch markets to six. At the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR), final five-year follow-up data from the Phase 2 L-MIND study were presented, which showed that Monjuvi plus lenalidomide followed by Monjuvi monotherapy provided prolonged, durable responses in adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).Pemazyre® (pemigatinib) continues to expand in ex-U.S. markets in cholangiocarcinoma and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MLNs): Pemazyre was approved in Japan by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) for the treatment of MLNs with FGFR1 fusion. MLNs are a rare, aggressive group of cancers characterized by an over-production of myeloid cells, or bone tissue, with the tendency to rapidly progress to an acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The launch of Pemazyre in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is ongoing in 10 key markets in Europe. In clinical development, FIGHT-210, evaluating pemigatinib in NSCLC, was discontinued.Parsaclisib in warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (wAIHA): Based on the challenging regulatory landscape associated with the PI3K class, development of parsaclisib in wAIHA has been discontinued.Indication and statusPemigatinib (Pemazyre®)(FGFR1/2/3)Myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms (MLN): approved in the U.S. and JapanCholangiocarcinoma (CCA): Phase 3 (FIGHT-302)Glioblastoma: Phase 2 (FIGHT-209)Tafasitamab (Monjuvi®/Minjuvi®)1(CD19)Relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL): Phase 3 (B-MIND)First-line DLBCL: Phase 3 (frontMIND)Relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) and relapsed or refractory marginal zone lymphoma (MZL): Phase 3 (inMIND)Retifanlimab (Zynyz™)2(PD-1)Merkel cell carcinoma: approved in the U.S.Squamous cell anal cancer (SCAC): Phase 3 (POD1UM-303)Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): Phase 3 (POD1UM-304)MSI-high endometrial cancer: Phase 2 (POD1UM-101, POD1UM-204)INCB99280(Oral PD-L1)Solid tumors: Phase 1KRASG12C-mutated solid tumors: Phase 1/1b in combination with adagrasib3, in preparationINCB99318(Oral PD-L1)Solid tumors: Phase 11 Development of tafasitamab in collaboration with MorphoSys.2 Retifanlimab licensed from MacroGenics.3 Clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with Mirati Therapeutics.Inflammation and Autoimmunity (IAI) – key highlightsDermatologyOpzeluraOpzelura approved for vitiligo in Europe: Opzelura was approved by the European Commission for the treatment of non-segmental vitiligo with facial involvement in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older. The EC decision is based on data from two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials (TRuE-V1 and -V2), which showed treatment with Opzelura resulted in significant improvements in facial and total body repigmentation versus vehicle at Week 24 and among completers of an open-label extension at Week 52. Opzelura was well-tolerated with no serious treatment-related adverse events related to ruxolitinib cream.Opzelura 104-week safety and efficacy data in vitiligo provide insights into the value of long-term treatment: 104-week results from the long-term extension of the Phase 3 TRuE-V study were presented at the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) Annual Meeting. The data demonstrated that many patients who achieved a high level of facial repigmentation (≥F-VASI90) at Week 52 were able to maintain durable response one year following withdrawal of treatment. In patients who did not achieve ≥F-VASI90 at Week 52 and continued treatment with Opzelura, improvements in facial and total body repigmentation, as shown by greater proportions of patients reaching F-VASI75 and T-VASI50, were observed through Week 104.Ruxolitinib cream in pediatric atopic dermatitis (AD): A Phase 3 trial of ruxolitinib cream in pediatric AD has completed enrollment with results expected by end of year. There are an estimated 2-3 million pediatric AD patients (ages 2-11) in the United States.Ruxolitinib cream in other indications: Incyte continues to expand the development of ruxolitinib cream into new indications as we seek to maximize the potential opportunity with the franchise. Phase 2 trials evaluating ruxolitinib cream in mild to moderate hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), lichen planus (LP) and lichen sclerosus (LS) are ongoing. Additionally, two Phase 3 trials evaluating ruxolitinib cream in prurigo nodularis (PN) were initiated.PovorcitinibPhase 2 results in hidradenitis suppurativa: 52-week results from the Phase 2 study evaluating povorcitinib (15mg QD, 45mg QD, 75mg QD) in HS were presented as an oral presentation at the European Hidradenitis Suppurativa Foundation (EHSF) Annual Meeting. The data demonstrated that continuation of treatment with povorcitinib 75 mg resulted in sustained and durable efficacy across all treatment arms, and importantly, 22-29% of patients treated for 52-weeks achieved HiSCR100, which is defined as a 100% reduction from baseline in total abscess and nodule (AN) count with no increase from baseline in abscess or draining tunnel count. Povorcitinib is currently in two Phase 3 studies in moderate to severe HS.Phase 2 results in vitiligo: 36-week results from the Phase 2b study evaluating povorcitinib in patients with extensive vitiligo were presented as an oral late-breaking presentation at the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) Annual Meeting. The data demonstrated that treatment with oral povorcitinib was associated with substantial total body repigmentation in patients with extensive nonsegmental vitiligo, as measured by total Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (T-VASI) scores. Specifically, the study met its primary endpoint, and patients receiving povorcitinib experienced statistically superior improvements in T-VASI at Week 24 compared to placebo (povorcitinib 15 mg, –19.1%; 45 mg, –17.8%; 75 mg, –15.7% vs. placebo, +2.3%; least squares mean [LSM] difference, P&lt;0.01). Incyte plans to move into Phase 3 development for povorcitinib in vitiligo, pending FDA regulatory discussions.Studies planned for asthma and chronic spontaneous urticaria: Incyte announced the expansion of povorcitinib development into other inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, including planning for two Phase 2 trials in asthma and chronic spontaneous urticaria.Indication and statusRuxolitinib cream (Opzelura®)1(JAK1/JAK2)AD: Phase 3 pediatric study (TRuE-AD3)Vitiligo: Phase 3 (TRuE-V1, TRuE-V2); approved in the U.S. and EuropeLichen planus: Phase 2Lichen sclerosus: Phase 2Hidradenitis suppurativa: Phase 2Prurigo nodularis: Phase 3 initiated (TRuE-PN1, TRuE-PN2)Ruxolitinib cream + UVB(JAK1/JAK2 + phototherapy)Vitiligo: Phase 2Povorcitinib(JAK1)Hidradenitis suppurativa: Phase 2b; Phase 3 (STOP-HS1, STOP-HS2)Vitiligo: Phase 2; Phase 3 plannedPrurigo nodularis: Phase 2Asthma: PoC plannedChronic spontaneous urticaria: PoC plannedAuremolimab(anti-IL-15Rβ)Vitiligo: Phase 1 in preparation1 Novartis’ rights to ruxolitinib outside of the United States under our Collaboration and License Agreement with Novartis do not include topical administration.Discovery and other early development – key highlightsINCB123667 (CDK2) oral presentation at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) 2023: INCB123667 is a selective and potent CDK2 kinase inhibitor, which has been shown to suppress tumor growth as monotherapy and in combination with standard of care, in Cyclin E amplified tumor models, in vivo. At AACR, Incyte presented data demonstrating INCB123667 exhibited significant single-agent activity in vivo in CCNE1high breast cancer xenograft and patient-derived xenograft models. INCB123667 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with advanced malignancies including CCNE1high TNBC and HR+HER2- tumors post-CDK4/6 inhibitors.INCA33890 (TGFβR2xPD-1) in clinical development: INCA33890 is a TGFβR2xPD1 bispecific antibody which has been engineered to avoid the known toxicity of broad TGFβ pathway blockade. INCA33890 has higher affinity for PD1 than TGFβR2, and blocks TGFβ-signaling specifically in cells co-expressing PD-1, thus potentially sparing tissues where TGFb-signaling is important for normal function. Preclinical in vivo data presented at AACR show that INCA33890 has a greater anti-tumor effect than either individual benchmark antibodies or a simple combination of these.Development of the adenosine program (including INCB106385 and INCA00186), INCAGN1876 (GITR) and INCB81776 (AXL/MER) has been discontinued based on early efficacy data.ModalityCandidatesSmall moleculesINCB123667 (CDK2)Monoclonal antibodiesINCAGN2385 (LAG-3)1, INCAGN2390 (TIM-3)1Bi-specific antibodiesINCA32459 (LAG-3xPD-1)2, INCA33890 (TGFβR2xPD-1)21 Discovery collaboration with Agenus.2 Development in collaboration with MerusPartnered – key highlightsIndication and statusRuxolitinib1(JAK1/JAK2)Acute and chronic GVHD: approved in Europe; J-NDA under reviewBaricitinib2(JAK1/JAK2)AD: approved in Europe and JapanSevere AA: approved in the U.S., Europe and JapanCapmatinib3(MET)NSCLC (with MET exon 14 skipping mutations): approved in the U.S., Europe and Japan1 Ruxolitinib (Jakavi®) licensed to Novartis ex-U.S. for use in hematology and oncology excluding topical administration.2 Baricitinib (Olumiant®) licensed to Lilly: approved as Olumiant in multiple territories globally for certain patients with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis; approved as Olumiant in EU and Japan for certain patients with atopic dermatitis.3 Capmatinib (Tabrecta®) licensed to Novartis.2023 First Quarter Financial ResultsThe financial measures presented in this press release for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 have been prepared by the Company in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP""), unless otherwise identified as a Non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes that Non-GAAP information is useful for investors, when considered in conjunction with Incyte’s GAAP disclosures. Management uses such information internally and externally for establishing budgets, operating goals and financial planning purposes. These metrics are also used to manage the Company’s business and monitor performance. The Company adjusts, where appropriate, for expenses in order to reflect the Company’s core operations. The Company believes these adjustments are useful to investors by providing an enhanced understanding of the financial performance of the Company’s core operations. The metrics have been adopted to align the Company with disclosures provided by industry peers.Non-GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and should only be used in conjunction with and to supplement Incyte’s operating results as reported under GAAP. Non-GAAP measures may be defined and calculated differently by other companies in our industry.As changes in exchange rates are an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, Management believes the presentation of certain revenue results on a constant currency basis in addition to reported results helps improve investors’ ability to understand its operating results and evaluate its performance in comparison to prior periods. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. The Company calculates constant currency by calculating current year results using prior year foreign currency exchange rates and generally refers to such amounts calculated on a constant currency basis as excluding the impact of foreign exchange or being on a constant currency basis. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as the Company presents them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not measures of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.Financial HighlightsFinancial Highlights(unaudited, in thousands, except per share amounts)Three Months Ended March 31,20232022Total GAAP revenues$808,673$733,235Total GAAP operating income24,770116,540Total Non-GAAP operating income89,729172,147GAAP net income21,70337,992Non-GAAP net income84,577122,867GAAP basic EPS$0.10$0.17Non-GAAP basic EPS$0.38$0.56GAAP diluted EPS$0.10$0.17Non-GAAP diluted EPS$0.37$0.55Revenue DetailsRevenue Details(unaudited, in thousands)Three Months Ended March 31,%Change(as reported)%Change(constantcurrency)120232022Net product revenues:Jakafi$579,969$544,4647%7%Iclusig27,68526,0696%12%Pemazyre22,47518,03225%29%Minjuvi6,5564,50246%51%Opzelura56,55212,754343%343%Total net product revenues693,237605,82114%15%Royalty revenues:Jakavi76,69270,8678%16%Olumiant34,15548,064(29%)(16%)Tabrecta4,1773,48320%NAPemazyre412—NMNMTotal royalty revenues115,436122,414(6%)Total net product and royalty revenues808,673728,23511%Milestone and contract revenues—5,000(100%)(100%)Total GAAP revenues$808,673$733,23510%NM = not meaningfulNA = not available1.Percentage change in constant currency is calculated using 2022 foreign exchange rates to recalculate 2023 results.Product and Royalty Revenues Product and royalty revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2023 increased 11% over the prior year comparative period as a result of net product revenues increasing 14% year-over-year, primarily driven by increases in Jakafi and Opzelura net product revenues. The increase in Jakafi net product revenues was primarily driven by growth in patient demand across all indications and was partially offset by higher gross-to-net deductions for Medicare and commercial co-pay assistance consistent with historical prior years' first quarters, as well as an increase in 340B volumes. The quarter was also impacted by lower weeks on hand channel inventory than normal due to timing of certain customer purchases. Opzelura net product revenues for the quarter were $57 million, representing a 343% increase year-over-year driven by increased patient demand and expanded coverage. The quarter was negatively impacted by an increase in co-pay assistance due to higher commercial patient deductibles at the beginning of the plan year and higher Medicaid utilization volume. In addition, volume was negatively impacted by an acceleration of refills in December 2022 driven by patient demand in advance of annual deductible reset or health plan changes. Jakavi and Olumiant royalties for the quarter were impacted by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, while Olumiant royalties were also impacted by a decrease in net product sales of Olumiant for use as a treatment for COVID-19.Operating ExpensesOperating Expense Summary(unaudited, in thousands)Three Months Ended March 31,%Change20232022GAAP cost of product revenues$56,822$42,61433%Non-GAAP cost of product revenues150,66936,61938%GAAP research and development406,641353,37315%Non-GAAP research and development2375,620327,04515%GAAP selling, general and administrative315,606209,58451%Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative3294,017192,68253%GAAP loss on change in fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration6,1966,382(3%)Non-GAAP loss on change in fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration4———%GAAP (profit) and loss sharing under collaboration agreements(1,362)4,742(129%)1 Non-GAAP cost of product revenues excludes the amortization of licensed intellectual property for Iclusig relating to the acquisition of the European business of ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and the cost of stock-based compensation.2 Non-GAAP research and development expenses exclude the cost of stock-based compensation.3 Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses exclude the cost of stock-based compensation.4 Non-GAAP loss on change in fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration is null.Cost of product revenues GAAP and Non-GAAP cost of product revenues for three months ended March 31, 2023 increased 33% and 38%, respectively, compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to product related costs for our commercial products including Opzelura.Research and development expenses GAAP and Non-GAAP research and development expense for three months ended March 31, 2023 increased 15%, compared to the same period in 2022 primarily due to continued investment in our late stage development assets and timing of certain expenses.Selling, general and administrative expenses GAAP and Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2023 increased 51% and 53%, respectively, compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to expenses related to promotional activities to support the launch of Opzelura for the treatments of atopic dermatitis and vitiligo and timing of certain expenses.Other Financial InformationOperating income GAAP and Non-GAAP operating income for the three months ended March 31, 2023 decreased 79% and 48%, respectively, compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to expenses related to promotional activities to support the launch of Opzelura for the treatments of atopic dermatitis and vitiligo and timing of certain expenses.Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities position As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $3.1 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively. The decrease from December 31, 2022 is due a reduction of our accounts payable balance at March 31, 2023.2023 Financial GuidanceIncyte is tightening its full year 2023 guidance for Jakafi net product revenues as a result of its strong first quarter performance.

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. See our latest analysis for Incyte The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$647.0mUS$1.12bUS$1.62bUS$1.52bUS$1.64bUS$1.74bUS$1.82bUS$1.89bUS$1.96bUS$2.01bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x3Analyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 5.84%Est @ 4.71%Est @ 3.92%Est @ 3.36%Est @ 2.98% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.8% US$606US$980US$1.3kUS$1.2kUS$1.2kUS$1.2kUS$1.1kUS$1.1kUS$1.1kUS$1.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$11bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.0b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.8%– 2.1%) = US$43bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$43b÷ ( 1 + 6.8%)10= US$22bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$33b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$75.3, the company appears quite good value at a 49% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Incyte as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for IncyteStrengthCurrently debt free.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

These data were featured in a poster presentation (Poster #396) at the Revolutionizing Atopic Dermatitis (RAD) Conference, held from April 29-May 1 in Washington, D.C.Results showed that patients with AD treated with Opzelura experienced a rapid and substantial improvement in itch, which was sustained and further improved through 28 days of treatment. Specifically, the study met its primary endpoint with Opzelura-treated patients experiencing a mean (SE) –3.4 (0.28) reduction in itch from baseline at Day 2 as measured by the peak pruritus numerical rating scale (PP-NRS; an 11-point scale evaluating the peak intensity of itch over the course of 24 hours). Itch reduction was observed beginning as early as 15 minutes (2.3 [0.35]) as measured by modified PP-NRS (a measurement for the current intensity of itch), and the change from baseline, observed at four hours after the first application of Opzelura, was 4.2 mPP-NRS [0.31].""AD is a chronic, immune-mediated skin condition that can be difficult to manage and causes disruptive and persistent symptoms like itch that can greatly affect patients’ everyday lives,"" said Jim Lee, M.D., Ph.D., Group Vice President, Inflammation &amp; AutoImmunity, Incyte. ""We are pleased that the SCRATCH-AD results further emphasize the rapid impact of Opzelura on itch reduction and reinforce its profile as an effective, well-tolerated topical non-steroidal treatment for AD.""Additional key findings from SCRATCH-AD include:Story continuesAt 12 hours post-Opzelura application, improvement in itch was sustained, with a mean (SE) change from baseline in mPP-NRS of –3.1 (0.31).Further improvement in itch was seen with continued Opzelura treatment, as evidenced by the mean (SE) change from baseline in PP-NRS increasing through Day 29 (–5.7 [1.60]).Overall improvement in AD symptoms reported with Opzelura treatment increased over time. The mean (SE) change from baseline in Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) score – a five-point scale measuring the overall severity of AD – on Days 8, 15 and 29 were –1.4 (0.11), –2.0 (0.13) and –2.2 (0.14), respectively.Opzelura was well tolerated with no serious treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) during the 28-day study period (n=49). All TEAEs were mild or moderate, with the most common being COVID-19 (6.1%), back pain (4.1%), headache (4.1%), nasopharyngitis (4.1%) and upper respiratory tract infection (4.1%). One patient presented with a treatment-related TEAE (grade 1 application site acne). No patients discontinued treatment due to a TEAE.""The intense itch caused by AD can lead to an itch-scratch cycle which increases inflammation, further damages the skin barrier and worsen symptoms,"" said Robert Bissonnette, M.D., FRCPC, lead investigator of the SCRATCH-AD study and Chief Executive Officer and Medical Director at Innovaderm Research. ""I am encouraged by these results showing rapid and substantial itch reduction among AD patients treated with Opzelura, and its potential to quickly alleviate this burdensome symptom for patients.""More information regarding the 8th RAD Conference can be found at https://revolutionizingad.com/conference.About Atopic DermatitisAtopic dermatitis (AD) – the most common type of eczema – is a chronic skin disease affecting more than 21 million people aged 12 years and older in the U.S. and is characterized by inflammation and itch1. Signs and symptoms include irritated and itchy skin that can cause red lesions that may ooze and crust. People with AD are also more susceptible to bacterial, viral and fungal infections2.About SCRATCH-AD (NCT04839380)SCRATCH-AD is a single-site Phase 2 open-label, single-arm study evaluating the safety and efficacy of Opzelura® (ruxolitinib) cream 1.5% in adult patients (age 18 to 65 years) with atopic dermatitis (AD), with a particular focus on understanding the short-term clinical benefits of Opzelura to control pruritus (itching) and reduce AD severity.The study enrolled 49 patients diagnosed with AD for ≥6 months, and with chronic itch related to AD for ≥3 months, who had 1%–20% affected body surface area (BSA; excluding palms, soles, scalp, genitals, and folds), an Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) of ≥2, and a peak pruritus numerical rating scale (PP-NRS) score ≥4 at baseline. The primary analysis included 46 patients in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population. For 28 days, patients applied Opzelura 1.5% cream twice daily (BID) approximately 12 hours apart to all lesions identified at baseline and any new lesions.The primary endpoint is change from baseline in PP-NRS on Day 2 (24 hours after the first application of Opzelura). Secondary endpoints included change from baseline in modified PP-NRS (mPP-NRS; current itch intensity) at 15 and 30 minutes and at 1-, 2-, 4-, 6- and 12-hours post-treatment on Day 1, as well as change from baseline in PP-NRS from Days 3 through 29, change from baseline in IGA at Days 8, 15, and 29, and safety.For more information about this Phase 2 study, please visit: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04839380.About Opzelura® (ruxolitinib) Cream 1.5%Opzelura, a novel cream formulation of Incyte’s selective JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib, approved by the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration for the topical treatment of nonsegmental vitiligo in patients 12 years of age and older, is the first and only treatment for repigmentation approved for use in the United States. Opzelura is also approved in the U.S. for the topical short-term and non-continuous chronic treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis (AD) in non-immunocompromised patients 12 years of age and older whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies, or when those therapies are not advisable. Use of Opzelura in combination with therapeutic biologics, other JAK inhibitors, or potent immunosuppressants, such as azathioprine or cyclosporine, is not recommended.In Europe, Opzelura (ruxolitinib) cream 15mg/g is approved for the treatment of non-segmental vitiligo with facial involvement in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age.Incyte has worldwide rights for the development and commercialization of ruxolitinib cream, marketed in the United States as Opzelura.Opzelura and the Opzelura logo are registered trademarks of Incyte.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONOPZELURA is for use on the skin only.

Ruxolitinib belongs to a class of medicines called Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. JAK inhibitors are medicines that affect your immune system. JAK inhibitors can lower the ability of your immune system to fight infections. Some people have had serious infections while taking JAK inhibitors by mouth, including tuberculosis (TB), and infections caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses that can spread throughout the body. Some people have been hospitalized or died from these infections. Some people have had serious infections of their lungs while taking OPZELURA. Your healthcare provider should watch you closely for signs and symptoms of TB during treatment with OPZELURA.OPZELURA should not be used in people with an active, serious infection, including localized infections. You should not start using OPZELURA if you have any kind of infection unless your healthcare provider tells you it is okay. You may be at a higher risk of developing shingles (herpes zoster) while using OPZELURA.Increased risk of death due to any reason (all causes): Increased risk of death has happened in people 50 years of age and older who have at least 1 heart disease (cardiovascular) risk factor and are taking a medicine in the class of medicines called JAK inhibitors by mouth.Cancer and immune system problems: OPZELURA may increase your risk of certain cancers by changing the way your immune system works. Lymphoma and other cancers have happened in people taking a medicine in the class of medicines called JAK inhibitors by mouth. People taking JAK inhibitors by mouth have a higher risk of certain cancers including lymphoma and lung cancer, especially if they are a current or past smoker. Some people have had skin cancers while using OPZELURA. Your healthcare provider will regularly check your skin during your treatment with OPZELURA. Limit the amount of time you spend in the sunlight. Wear protective clothing when you are in the sun and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen.Increased risk of major cardiovascular events: Increased risk of major cardiovascular events such as heart attack, stroke, or death have happened in people 50 years of age and older who have at least 1 heart disease (cardiovascular) risk factor and taking a medicine in the class of medicines called JAK inhibitors by mouth, especially in current or past smokers.Blood clots: Blood clots in the veins of your legs (deep vein thrombosis, DVT) or lungs (pulmonary embolism, PE) can happen in some people taking OPZELURA. This may be life-threatening. Blood clots in the vein of the legs (deep vein thrombosis, DVT) and lungs (pulmonary embolism, PE) have happened more often in people who are 50 years of age and older and with at least 1 heart disease (cardiovascular) risk factor taking a medicine in the class of medicines called JAK inhibitors by mouth.Low blood cell counts: OPZELURA may cause low platelet counts (thrombocytopenia), low red blood cell counts (anemia), and low white blood cell counts (neutropenia). If needed, your healthcare provider will do a blood test to check your blood cell counts during your treatment with OPZELURA and may stop your treatment if signs or symptoms of low blood cell counts happen.Cholesterol increases: Cholesterol increase has happened in people when ruxolitinib is taken by mouth.

The bottom line also improved 8.6% year over year.GAAP EPS was $1.54, up 83.3% from that recorded in the prior-year quarter.Revenue DetailsReported revenues were $4.8 billion, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.55 billion by 5%. The top line improved 11.8% on a year-over-year basis and 14% at constant currency (cc). Sales were up 13.6% organically, indicating 12.9% growth in unit volume and 0.7% due to higher prices.Revenues by GeographyRevenues in the United States were $3.51 billion, up 13.1% year over year. International sales increased 8.2% to $1.27 billion. International sales were up 16.5%, excluding the negative impact of currency. Strong growth in Europe, Canada, Australia and Japan drove International sales during the quarter.Segmental AnalysisMedSurg and Neurotechnology: This segment reported sales of $2.69 billion, up 11% year over year and 13.1% at cc. Double-digit growth in the Surgical Technology business as well as Endoscopy and Medical businesses primarily drove sales. Strong performances in Europe, Australia, Canada and Japan also boosted revenues. Per management, the segment witnessed 12.4% organic growth in the reported quarter.Orthopedics and Spine: Sales in the segment amounted to $2.09 billion, up 12.7% year over year and 15.1% at cc. The top line increased 15.2% organically. This upside can be attributed to continued procedural growth, strong uptake of the Insignia Hip Stem and the recent launch of Q Guidance Navigation System. Strong performances in Europe, Australia, Canada and emerging markets also boosted International sales during the quarter.Stryker Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseStryker Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseStryker Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Stryker Corporation QuoteMarginsAdjusted gross profit totaled $3.02 billion in the reported quarter, up 10.1% from the year-ago quarter’s figure. Adjusted gross margin was 63.2%, down 90 basis points (bps). The decline reflects higher manufacturing and supply-chain costs.Story continuesTotal operating expenses were $2.28 billion, down 0.3% from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to inflationary pressure.Adjusted operating income totaled $1.01 billion, up 7.7% from that reported in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted operating margin was 21.1%, down 70 bps.Financial UpdateStryker exited the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1.67 billion compared with $1.84 billion in the preceding quarter.Cumulative net cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter was $445 million compared with $203 million in the year-ago period.2023 Guidance RaisedStryker announced its updated guidance for 2023. The company now expects organic growth for total revenues to be 8-9%, up from its previous expectation of 7-8.5%. However, macroeconomic volatility is likely to persist due to alleviating supply-chain disruptions, inflationary risks and currency fluctuations. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues stands at $19.75 billion.SYK now expects adjusted EPS in the band of $10.05-$10.25, implying growth of 8.7% at the midpoint of the range. The previously guided range was $9.85-$10.15. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $10.02 for the same.The company expects unfavorable currency movement to hurt growth modestly in 2023, especially in the first half. It expects the price impact to be relatively neutral compared to its previous expectation of an impact of 0-0.5%.Wrapping UpStryker exited first-quarter 2023 on a strong note, wherein both earnings and revenues beat estimates. The company witnessed strong performance across its segments in the United States. Strong International sales also buoy optimism. It expects the momentum to continue into 2023 on the back of ongoing procedural recovery and a strong order book for capital equipment.Per management, Stryker continues to face supply-chain challenges and inflationary pressures. Moreover, ongoing negative foreign currency values are a concern. The company has taken steps to alleviate the negative price impact, which got reflected in the first quarter results.It is also taking several cost-cutting initiatives, including restructuring plans. Stryker’s prospects in 2023 seem promising on the back of strong customer demand for its existing products as well as new launches. The company’s guidance for earnings and revenues appears encouraging.However, the contraction in both gross and operating margins is disappointing. SYK continues to grapple with pricing pressure. Stiff competition in the MedTech space is a concern.Zacks RankStryker currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other Key PicksSome other stocks in the broader medical space that have announced their quarterly results are Intuitive Surgical ISRG, Chemed CHE and Edwards Lifesciences EW, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 at present.

We have reflected these changes in all historical periods presented.SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION - RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESWe supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial measures, including: percentage sales growth in constant currency; percentage organic sales growth; adjusted gross profit; adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses; adjusted research, development and engineering expenses; adjusted operating income; adjusted other income (expense), net; adjusted income taxes; adjusted effective income tax rate; adjusted net earnings; and adjusted net earnings per diluted share (Diluted EPS). We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and shareholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance. Management believes percentage sales growth in constant currency and the other adjusted measures described above are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of reportable business segments and analyzing potential future business trends in connection with our budget process and bases certain management incentive compensation on these non-GAAP financial measures.To measure percentage sales growth in constant currency, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the comparability and trend of sales. Percentage sales growth in constant currency is calculated by translating current and prior year results at the same foreign currency exchange rate. To measure percentage organic sales growth, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions and divestitures, which affect the comparability and trend of sales. Percentage organic sales growth is calculated by translating current year and prior year results at the same foreign currency exchange rate excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. To measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, we exclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings. The income tax effect of each adjustment was determined based on the tax effect of the jurisdiction in which the related pre-tax adjustment was recorded.Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported sales growth, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, research, development and engineering expenses, operating income, other income (expense), net, income taxes, effective income tax rate, net earnings and net earnings per diluted share, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures below, provide a more complete understanding of our business. We strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.The following reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures discussed above with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The weighted-average diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of non-GAAP net earnings per diluted share are the same as those used in the calculation of reported net earnings per diluted share for the respective period.STRYKER CORPORATIONFor the Three Months March 31(Unaudited - Millions of Dollars, Except Per Share Amounts)Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to the Most Directly Comparable GAAP Financial MeasuresThree Months 2023Gross ProfitSelling, General &amp;

Reported EPS is $2.66, expectations were $2.28.Operator: Good morning and welcome to Whirlpool Corporation's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Release Call. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Director of Investor Relations, Korey Thomas.Korey Thomas: Thank you and welcome to our first quarter 2023 conference call. Joining me today are Marc Bitzer, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Peters, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with a presentation available on the Investors section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com. Before we begin, I want to remind you that as we conduct this call, we'll be making forward-looking statements to assist you in better understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K, 10-Q, and other periodic reports. We also want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures outlined in further detail on Slide 3 of the presentation.We believe these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of results from our ongoing business operations. We also think the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations. Listeners are directed to the presentation and supplemental information package posted on the Investor Relations section of our website for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for analyst questions. As a reminder, we ask that participants ask no more than two questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark.Story continuesMarc Bitzer: Thanks, Korey and good morning everyone. As you will have noted in our earnings release, we did start the year with a very solid first quarter. It was the first quarter which demonstrated significant improvement from our Q4 of last year. And it was a quarter which puts us firmly on track towards our full-year guidance. If you look at the drivers of this improved performance, we did not get a lot of help from a macro environment. The global industry demand was down, but frankly that is what we expected. It was instead our consistent and disciplined execution of our operational priorities that drove its improvements. We were able to achieve meaningful cost reductions, we improved our supply chain, our product innovations drove strong consumer demand, and we gained market share both sequentially and year-over-year.In short, we did what we told you we would do. This first quarter further strengthens our confidence in our full-year guidance. While the macro environment remains challenging and volatile, we know we have the right operational priorities and demonstrate that we can execute them with rigor and discipline. Our market share gain in particular in the U.S. builder segment will continue throughout the year. Coupled with early signs of a stronger U.S. housing markets, we expect to see an improved revenue top line as the year progresses. Beyond our Q1 operational and financial performance this morning, we will also give you a short update on our portfolio transformation, which is fully on track. Turning to Slide 6, I will provide an overview of our first quarter results.Across the globe, we're still seeing lower demand due to softer consumer sentiment impacting discretionary appliance purchases, which resulted in a revenue decline of 5.5%. Our Q1 operating margin of 5.4% is 200 basis points ahead of Q4. And our North America margin improved by 420 basis points to a 10% EBIT margin. Overall, we delivered first quarter ongoing earnings per share of $2.66 in-line with our expectations and are reaffirming our ongoing EPS guidance $16 to $18. Now turning to Slide 7, I will share more details on our 200 basis points of sequential margin expansion. Our overall Q1 price mix was in-line with our expectations. The year-over-year price mix margin decline is largely driven by our limited participation and promotions during the first half of 2022.For the full-year, we continue to expect the promotional environment to be at similar levels as the second half of 2022. On a sequential basis, our price mix is slightly improved versus Q4, but frankly, this is simply a reflection of a normal seasonal promotional activities, which tend to be higher during the fourth quarter. Looking at both net cost takeout and raw materials, let me first remind you what we told you during our last earnings call. We anticipated that Q3 and Q4 marked the peak of our cost inflation and we would expect this to now turn favorable. And that is exactly what you see in the sequential cost progression where the total of net cost and raw materials show a 0.5 point of favorable cost development. As the year progresses, we do expect net cost takeout and raw materials to be key driver of margin improvements.Our cost actions are on track and we will see more seasonal volume leverage and raw materials will continue to improve even though at the low end of our raw material expectations. Finally, we had a negative impact from foreign currency of 25 basis points year-over-year ultimately delivering Q1 ongoing EBIT margin of 5.4%. Turning to Slide 8, I will provide an update on our supply chain and operational priorities. We aim for flawless supply chain executions. And while our historical supply chain model has served us very well over many decades, the last few years have shown us is that in order to succeed moving forward, we need a more responsive and adaptive supply chain. We have significantly expanded our dual sourcing of critical components and prioritized high value strategic parts and components to de-risk this part of our supply chain.AppliancesPhoto by Clayton on UnsplashAdditionally, over the past two years, we have also made significant progress in reducing our parts complexity. In the first quarter, we further reduced our active parts by approximately 5%. This is a key driver in increasing our supply chain resiliency. As a result, our overall product availability has significantly improved versus 2022, even though not yet fully to pre-pandemic levels. Turning to Slide 9, we provide an update on our cost takeouts. First, I want to put this in context. Our business saw unprecedented levels of inflation with 2 billion of cost inflation in 2022. On top an incremental 1 billion of raw material inflation in 2021. Coming into this year, we were aiming to reduce our cost base by $800 million to $900 million of its $300 million to $400 million of raw material benefits and $500 million were internal cost takeout actions.In short, we're on track. More specifically, these material cost trends would put us at the lower end of this range. While our internal net cost takeout actions of approximately $500 million are largely on track. We continue to reduce supply chain inefficiency and premium costs. Our proactive headcount management delivered an additional 1 point reduction in our global salaried workforce in the quarter, bringing our aggregate reduction to approximately 5%. Additionally, we're seeing benefits from reduced discretionary spending and other indirect costs. To summarize, our net cost actions are on track and commodity prices have eased, but at a slower pace than initially expected. As a result, we're trending towards the lower end of our 800 million to 900 million total cost takeout range.And now, I'll turn it over to Jim to review our regional results.Jim Peters: Thanks Marc, and good morning everyone. Turning to Slide 11, I'll review results for our North America region. Our share recovery efforts driven by product innovation and improved supply chain execution continue to build momentum delivering 1 point of sequential and year-over-year share gains. Consumer sentiment impacted first quarter industry demand down approximately 5.5% in-line with our full-year industry expectations of down 4% to 6%. We expect a Q2 industry decline of 5% to 10% and a second half industry decline of low to mid-single-digits, as we compare to the near double-digit demand declines experienced in the back half of last year. The region delivered over 400 basis points of sequential margin expansion and ongoing EBIT margin of 10% as our strong cost takeout actions gain traction alongside our first full quarter with InSinkErator.We remain confident in the structural strength of our North America business and continue to expect our actions to deliver very strong results, including approximately 100 basis points of sequential margin expansion in every quarter of 2023. Turning to Slide 12, I'll provide additional color around our mid-to-long term North America industry outlook. While we are experiencing short-term demand softness, we remain very optimistic about mid and long term demand trends. Replacement demand, which represents 55% of total industry will increase in the mid-to-long term. After the post financial crisis, industry volume declined from 2008 to 2011, the industry began to grow again in 2013. Further, with remote and hybrid work trends continued to drive elevated usage of well above 2x pre-pandemic levels in our cooking appliances reducing the replacement cycle by approximately two years.Combined with a very strong installed base of Whirlpool's family of appliances and two out of every three households in America supports strong replacement momentum. Additionally, housing demographics such as a moderating interest rate environment, the oldest housing stock in U.S. history, the need for household formations to catch up with population growth rates and the 2 million to 3 million unit under supply of U.S. houses supports mid-to-long term discretionary and new construction demand, which is 45% of the total industry. We feel extremely confident in our ability to capitalize on these significant tailwinds, despite the near term pressures of housing affordability and softening consumer sentiment impacting discretionary spending and have reflected all of these drivers in our mid-to-long term industry growth outlook of 3% to 4%.Turning to Slide 13, I'll review results for our Europe, Middle East, and Africa region. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and the divested Whirlpool Russia business, first quarter revenue was down approximately 8%, driven by continued industry demand weakness. EMEA benefited from cost actions alongside held for sale accounting benefits, due to reduced depreciation of approximately $30 million that will continue each quarter until the transaction closes, which is expected in the second half of 2023 subject to regulatory approvals. Turning to Slide 14, I'll review results for our Latin America region. The region saw signs of demand improvement in Mexico and improving, but still soft demand in Brazil, more than offsetting cost based pricing carryover actions.Continued inflationary pressures were partially offset by our cost takeout actions resulting in solid EBIT margins of over 5%. Turning to Slide 15, I'll review results for our Asia region. Excluding the impact of currency, revenue declined 3%, driven by consumer demand that has not yet fully recovered. The region delivered EBIT margins of 3.1%, driven by our cost takeout actions offset by negative foreign currency and price mix. We continue to believe in the long-term growth potential for the region and India in particular. Turning to Slide 17, I'll discuss our full-year 2023 guidance. We are reaffirming our ongoing EPS range of $16 to $18 and free cash flow guidance of approximately $800 million. Additionally, our net sales guidance of $19.4 billion alongside approximately 7.5% full-year ongoing EBIT margins with North America exiting at 14% remains unchanged.As we navigate a softer first half demand environment, easing inflation, and our cost takeout actions ramp, we continue to deliver 35% to 40% of our earnings in the first half of the year. We are updating our GAAP guidance to reflect charges related to our EMEA business. First, we have recorded approximately $60 million in charges related to certain EMEA legacy Legal matters. Second, held-for-sale accounting treatment effectively requires that we mark-to-market the value of our EMEA net assets through a quarterly assessment. Based on this assessment, we recorded a Q1 non-cash loss related to the transaction of $222 million, primarily due to working capital changes and the impact of foreign currency. We may have additional adjustments that increase or decrease the non-cash loss as we complete this reassessment each quarter.These items were removed from our ongoing earnings in Q1. I would like to highlight that the amount of consideration to be received for the transaction has not changed. Additionally, given EMEA's free cash flow is largely back half weighted, the timing of the transaction closing could impact our 2023 free cash flow. Turning to Slide 18, I will discuss our capital allocation priorities, which remain unchanged. We remain committed to funding innovation and growth and expect to invest over $1 billion in capital expenditures and research and development this year, including InSinkErator's largest product launch in over a decade, which Marc will discuss in a moment. Additionally, we remain confident in our ability to generate strong free cash flow.Alongside our strong cash balance, we continue to have flexibility to support our commitment to return cash to shareholders, demonstrated with nearly 70 consecutive years of cash returned to shareholders through our very strong dividend. In the near-term, we will continue to prioritize debt repayment driving an optimal capital structure and maintaining our strong investment grade credit rating. Now, I will turn the call over to Marc.Marc Bitzer: Thanks, Jim. Turning to Slide 20, let me provide an update on our portfolio transformation. Whirlpool today is a very different company from Whirlpool of the past. In the last 5 years, we have taken several significant steps to transform a company to a higher growth, higher margin business. These actions will create an even stronger and more value creating Whirlpool and position us for the future. Turning to Slide 21, I will highlight how the addition of InSinkErator is strengthening our portfolio and supports our number 1 position in the Americas. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we closed our acquisition of InSinkErator, largest manufacturer of food waste disposals in the United States. Our integration efforts are well underway and remain on track with sustained EBIT margins of above 20%, 75% replacement demand we're excited about the rich history and strong product legacy that InSinkErator adds to our portfolio.We continue to expect InSinkErator to add approximately 50 basis points to our consolidated EBIT margins. Turning to Slide 22, I'm pleased to highlight our upcoming product launch. InSinkErator already has the best-selling product line with an overall 4.7 star rating. And we're excited to launch a next gen product during the summer of 2023. This marks the biggest InSinkErator product launch over past decades. Our fully redesigned disposals bring multiple innovative new features and performance improvements, including InSinkErator’s quietest performance with SoundSeal Noise Reduction Technology and a rugged Induction Motor with enhanced multi-grind performance allowing consumers to divert in more food waste from landfills. The easiest install ever, thanks to complete redesign of a disposer, and like our current disposals, the next gen units will be manufactured in our Racine, Wisconsin facilities.The next generation disposer is expected to deliver growth and margin expansion through enhanced product offerings and manufacturing efficiencies. Now, turning to Slide 23, I will provide an update on our Europe transaction. As a reminder, in January, we agreed to contribute our European major domestic appliance business into newly formed entity with Arçelik. We expect the transaction to close during the second half of 2023 subject to regulatory approvals. We will own approximately 25% of a new company. And the new company is expected to have over of annual sales with over of cost synergies. We have a potential to unlock long-term value creation for our ability to monetize a minority interest. Coupled with our 40-year Whirlpool brand licensing agreement, we expect $750 million net present value of future cash flows.Additionally, post-closing, we expect positive impact of a transaction to our value creation metrics of a 200 basis point improvement to return on invested capital, alongside 150 basis points improvement in ongoing EBIT margins and 250 million of incremental free cash flows annually. Turning to Slide 24, let me close with a few remarks. A broader macrocycle has continued to present challenges for most industries and the impact of the recent banking crisis has renewed consumer concerns, impacting sentiment and demand. In this environment, we executed our operational priorities delivering a solid first quarter performance. And we are confident in the medium-to-long term demand dynamics, while remaining focused on operating the business in a way that allows us to benefit from rebounding demand.We expect our 2023 operation priorities to deliver 800 million to 900 million in cost take-out alongside our North America business delivering share gains, driven by product innovation and improved supply chain executions. We reaffirm our ongoing EPS guidance of $16 to $18 and continue to unlock value with our ongoing portfolio transformation efforts. A common theme we've discussed over the last 3 years is that Whirlpool has successfully navigated the fast changing environment. We expect to do it again this year with our operational priorities plus 1.4 billion of cash on hand, providing balance sheet flexibility and our expectation for mid-to-long term demand tailwind. Whirlpool is well-positioned to deliver significant value creation. Now, we will end our formal remarks and open it up for questions.See also 12 Most Promising Healthcare Stocks and 11 Most Promising Gene Editing Stocks.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Ingersoll Rand IR, Johnson Controls International JCI, Parker-Hannifin Corp. PH and Zebra Technologies ZBRA.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:4 Industrial Stocks Set to Deliver a Beat This Earnings SeasonThe first-quarter 2023 earnings season is in the nascent stage for the Zacks Industrial Products sector. The handful of companies that have reported earnings so far have put up better-than-expected performances on strength across key end markets, improving supply chains and robust price realization. However, cost inflation has played a spoilsport for these companies.Amid a softer demand environment, the latest Earnings Trends report reflects muted earnings and revenue growth for the S&amp;P 500 companies within the Industrial Products sector. First-quarter 2023 earnings are expected to increase 1.6% year over year for the sector compared with a 15.9% rise recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022. Revenues for the sector are estimated to climb 5.9% year over year compared with a 9.7% increase reported in the fourth quarter of 2022.Out of the 20% of the S&amp;P 500 companies within the Industrial Products sector that have reported earnings numbers, 60% each beat on earnings and revenues, while 40% surpassed both earnings and revenue estimates.Below we have discussed industrial companies like Ingersoll Rand, Johnson Controls International, Parker-Hannifin Corp. and Zebra Technologies that are set to trump earnings estimates this reporting cycle.Key Factors for Q1A low-demand environment, thanks to weakness in the manufacturing sector, is likely to have weighed on the first-quarter performances of sector participants. Per the Institute for Supply Management’s latest report, the Manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index touched 46.3% in March, reflecting a contraction in manufacturing activities for the fifth consecutive month. A figure below 50 indicates a contraction in manufacturing activity. The New Orders Index has remained in contraction territory for the past several months.Story continuesDespite easing, cost inflation remains a major challenge for industrial companies. An anticipated increase in raw material costs is expected to have affected the bottom-line performance of these companies. A stronger U.S. dollar might also have impacted the overseas business performance of these companies.Despite a slowdown in the manufacturing sector, strength across prominent end markets, such as life science, water &amp; wastewater, chemical, agricultural, food and energy industries, is expected to have aided performance. Cost-control measures, effective pricing and operational execution are expected to have driven the top line of industrial companies.Improving supply chains and faster deliveries, and better availability of raw materials are expected to have benefited performance in the to-be-reported quarter.How to Pick Winners?Given the large number of players operating in the transportation space, picking the right stocks is not an easy task. But our proven model makes it fairly simple. One can shortlist with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold), which increases the odds of an earnings beat.

Our research shows that for stocks with this perfect combination, the chances of a beat are as high as 70%.Our ChoicesBelow we list four industrial stocks that have the right mix of elements to pull off an earnings surprise this time around.Ingersoll Rand has an Earnings ESP of +2.32% and a Zacks Rank #1.

The company is set to release third-quarter fiscal 2023 (ended Mar 31, 2023) financial numbers on May 4.Parker-Hannifin’s fiscal third-quarter performance is expected to have benefited from strength in the Diversified Industrial segment due to broad-based growth in the North American region. The Meggitt acquisition, which has expanded PH’s presence in the UK, positioning it well to provide a broader suite of solutions for aircraft, and aeroengine components and systems, is expected to have boosted the company’s top line.

489,74cc77bf-4b93-3a54-bfa7-040f6724334e,VMC,2023-05-02,Vulcan Materials (VMC) to Post Q1 Earnings: What to Expect?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vulcan-materials-vmc-post-q1-120612419.html,1682942772,STORY,"['VMC', 'TREX', 'MLM', 'HWM']","[Vulcan Materials Company VMC is scheduled to release first-quarter 2023 results on May 4, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings and revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 16.3% and 4.8%, respectively. On a year-over-year basis, earnings declined 13.6% but revenues increased 7.8%.Vulcan Materials’ earnings topped the consensus mark in two of the last four quarters and missed the same on two occasions, with the average negative surprise being 0.6%.Vulcan Materials Company Price and EPS SurpriseVulcan Materials Company Price and EPS SurpriseVulcan Materials Company price-eps-surprise | Vulcan Materials Company QuoteTrend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings per share has been revised downward to 64 cents from 65 cents over the past 30 days. The estimated figure indicates a decrease of 12.3% from the year-ago quarter. The consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.58 billion, suggesting 2.6% year-over-year growth.Factors to NoteThe slowing residential demand, wet weather, rail freight bottlenecks and cement shortages are expected to reflect in first-quarter aggregates volumes of the companies like Vulcan, Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. MLM and others. Higher wet conditions in some regions compared with the year-ago very dry condition must have been reflected in the quarterly results.West Coast states, mainly California, received more rainfall and were cold, while the Southeast witnessed above-average rainfall. Overall, tough year-over-year comparisons with respect to weather are expected to act as a headwind in the quarter. Notably, in the year-ago period, the weather was dry, contributing to the company’s quarterly performance.Nonetheless, higher non-residential construction activities and incremental federal funding from the recently enacted Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act should have acted as a tailwind for first-quarter 2023. Also, resilient pricing — given the growth in all product lines — is expected to have supported growth for Vulcan.Higher spending from a number of states that it serves is likely to have aided revenues. The aggregates business (including crushed stone, sand, and gravel, along with other aggregates) has been a major contributor to revenue growth. Efforts to enhance operational excellence, acquisition synergies and cost-control measures are expected to have aided the bottom line to some extent.However, higher repair &amp; maintenance costs and supply &amp; contract costs may have been risks. Inflation from hydrocarbons, rising liquid asphalt costs, insurance and labor might have added to the negatives.We expect net sales from the Aggregates segment (accounting for 72% of total revenues) to grow 2.4% to $1,148.6 million from a year ago.Net sales from the Concrete segment (accounting for 13.8% of total revenues) are expected to decline 5.4% to $340.9 million from a year ago.Our models suggest net sales from the Asphalt Mix segment (14% of total revenues) to be $216.2 million, indicating 29.4% growth from $167.1 million a year ago.The Calcium segment’s net sales are expected to be $1.7 million, suggesting a decline from $1.9 million a year ago.Story continuesWhat Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Vulcan this time around. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -29.2%.

The estimated figure indicates a 153.9% increase on a year-over-year basis. The consensus estimate for products and services revenues is pegged at $1.19 billion, indicating a year-over-year rise of 3.3%.Factors to NoteMartin Marietta’s quarterly revenues are expected to have witnessed year-over-year growth in the first quarter, given the strong pricing gains in aggregates and strength in public construction. Improved visibility in non-residential construction and contributions from acquisitions are also likely to have been the positives.The business and earnings of MLM have been sensitive to changes in construction spending, particularly housing and public construction in Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida as well as Iowa. Infrastructure construction, particularly for aggregates-intensive highways and roads and streets, might have also contributed to its performance in the quarter, as contractors advanced projects that have been awarded and funded.However, the slowdown in single-family residential construction and wet weather might have weighed on the quarterly volumes. Higher wet conditions in some regions compared with the year-ago very dry condition must have been reflected in the quarterly results. West Coast states, mainly California, received more rainfall and were cold, while the Southeast witnessed above-average rainfall.Story continuesOverall, tough year-over-year comparisons with respect to weather are expected to act as a headwind in the quarter.

We expect aggregate pricing to increase to $17.93, suggesting 10.9% year-over-year growth. We expect aggregate revenues to increase 7.2% year over year to $735.3 million.We expect cement revenues to decrease 6.8% year over year to $125.2 million. Cement pricing is also expected to decrease 6.6% to $120.62 per ton.Also, inflation from hydrocarbon, rising liquid asphalt and diesel fuel costs, more transportation costs and insurance and labor cost may have impacted the bottom line of Martin Marietta and its peers like Vulcan Materials Company VMC. Also, higher repair &amp; maintenance costs, supply and contract costs and supply-chain bottlenecks are added concerns.We expect the Building Material segment revenues (product and services), which comprise 95% of total revenues, to grow 4.1% year over year to $1,121.1 million.Our model suggests Magnesia Specialties revenues (product and services) to decline 17.6% year over year to $58.3 million.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Martin Marietta this time around.

Its focus on a systematic inorganic strategy for expansion is adding to the positives. However, the higher inflationary challenges, soft single-family residential demand and adverse weather are expected to act as headwinds.The company will report its first-quarter 2023 results on May 4, 2023.

Reported EPS is $0.27, expectations were $0.14.Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to General Electric's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. . I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Steve Winoker, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.Steven Winoker: Thanks, Liz. Welcome to GE's first quarter 2023 earnings call. I'm joined by Chairman and CEO, Larry Culp; and CFO, Carolina Happe. Some of the statements we're making are forward-looking and based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our SEC filings and on our website, those elements may change as the world changes. As a reminder, similar to our fourth quarter call, our remarks will be brief today, reflecting the company we are now and we'll move more quickly to Q&amp;A. Over to Larry.Larry Culp: Steve, thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter as a new GE, a simpler and more focused GE. We are now GE Aerospace and GE Vernova, 2 industry leaders in their own rights. We're creating significant value today, underscored by strong first quarter results, 17% organic revenue growth with all segments up, more than doubling our adjusted profit with margin expansion in all segments, resulting in $0.27 of adjusted EPS and positive free cash flow. This performance reflects robust market demand for our innovative technologies and services, and we're operating leaner and more focused businesses. Services proved again they're clearly one of our best assets, representing more than 60% of revenue, given not only the resiliency and higher margins we enjoy, but the fact they keep us in daily contact with our customers.Since our investor conference in March, GE Aerospace has continued to see tremendous commercial momentum, delivering double-digit growth on the top and bottom lines. Our execution at GE Vernova is tracking well with continued signs of progress in renewable energy as Power continues to deliver. Now with GE Healthcare on its own, we're focused on launching these 2 businesses as independent investment-grade companies. Further, we also continued to simplify the balance sheet, partially monetizing our AerCap stake, closing out our Baker Hughes stake and calling half of the preferreds. We also named 2 new exceptional Board members: retired U.S. Air Force General, Darren McDew and Jessica Uhl, both of whom have deep domain expertise in Aerospace and Energy, respectively.Story continuesWe completed consultations with our European Works Council, which allows us to build the teams with both internal and external leaders for these stand-alone businesses. We're also advancing the internal rewiring to separate the businesses. This includes working through our legal entities, tax, organizational and capital structures as well as standing up Boards for both businesses. The rest assured job 1 remains our operating performance, which we'll dive into in more detail momentarily. So a big thank you to our outstanding teams, particularly our separation management office that is leading these efforts as well as the vast majority of our global employee base that's focused daily on serving customers. These businesses are ready to deliver and realize our full potential as independent industry leaders.With that, Carolina will take you through our results.Copyright: jetcityimage / 123RF Stock PhotoCarolina Happe: Thanks, Larry. Turning to Slide 3, which I'll speak to on an organic basis. In the first quarter, top line momentum was strong with robust market demand and execution driving growth. Orders increased 26%, all segments up. Equipment was up significantly led by renewables, almost doubling its order intake. Notably, grid booked 2 large HVDC orders with Tenet and U.S. Onshore Wind is seeing the initial positive impact of the Inflation Reduction Act, including higher margin orders. Services was up 12%, largely driven by commercial aerospace activity. Revenue also increased double digits with strength in both equipment and services. Aerospace was a significant driver with substantial LEAP engine deliveries and shop visit growth, and we're encouraged by equipment growth in other areas such as Gas Power and Grid.Adjusted margin expanded 330 basis points, driven by services volume, price outpacing inflation and productivity. Together, doubling operating profit and debt reduction drove substantial accretion to adjusted EPS, up $0.36 year-over-year. Free cash flow was $102 million, positive. Importantly, it was up $1.3 billion year-over-year with half of the improvement from earnings and half from working capital. From a flow perspective, this was driven by higher earnings and some AD&amp;A timing, partially offset by working capital as we build inventory to support second half growth. In addition to the strong earnings results, this was GE's first positive free cash flow in the first quarter since 2015. This achievement reflects our team's intense focus in sealing disciplined processes to enhance linearity and eliminate waste while driving operational efficiency and improved earnings and cash flow.A moment on corporate. Adjusted costs were down over 10% year-over-year, primarily driven by ongoing cost-out efforts and interest income as well as improvement in digital. For the year, we expect costs of around $600 million, half the amount in 2021 and in line with reduced corporate needs and progress setting up stand-alone cost structures. At insurance, as previously discussed, we now have adopted the industry-wide accounting standard for LDTI and we implemented first principles models. As of the end of 2022, the impact from this transition was $2.7 billion reduction in GAAP equity. These changes, including first principles, did not impact cash funding. We also funded the expected $1.8 billion during the quarter, in line with the permitted practice.Overall, we're pleased with the first quarter, delivering significant growth, margin, EPS and cash improvement. Based on this performance and market demand, we are raising the low end of our full year adjusted EPS range by $0.10 and our free cash flow range by $200 million. So we now expect adjusted EPS of $1.70 to $2 and free cash flow of $3.6 billion to $4.2 billion. And on that positive note, back to you, Larry, to discuss the businesses.Larry Culp: Carolina, thank you. Starting with GE Aerospace. As many of you heard from us just over a month ago at our customer technical education center in Cincinnati, a premier franchise with leading value propositions for propulsion and systems in both Commercial and Defense. With our highly differentiated technology and service portfolio, we're redefining flight for today, tomorrow and the future. Today, we're focused on partnering with air framers, airlines and lessors to drive stability and predictability as they ramp. For tomorrow, we're focused on roaming and optimizing our next generation of engines. Our recent proof point, our record-breaking deal with Air India with 800 LEAP 40 GEnx and 20 GE9X engines plus services.And for the future, we're developing next-generation technologies like RISE, hybrid electric and sustainable aviation fuels to better serve our customers and deliver growth. I'm extremely proud of how our team continues to make progress on these priorities, running the business with lean principles in a more decentralized manner with intensity, discipline and focus day in and day out. Looking at the market, the recovery has strengthened as the world is eager to travel, GE and CFM departures continue to improve, currently at 97% of '19 levels, and we still expect to be back to '19 levels later this year. To that end, we delivered strong results driven by this commercial momentum. Orders were up 14%. Revenue was up 25%, driven primarily by services and commercial engine deliveries.Profit improved up over 40%. And margins expanded due to services volume, pricing and productivity, which together more than offset negative mix, inflation and investments. Commercial Engines and Services performance was particularly robust with 35% revenue growth. Commercial Engines revenue grew over 30% with LEAP deliveries up over 50%. To support our customers, LEAP spare engine deliveries will be more first half loaded, but we expect this to normalize in the second half, remaining roughly in line with 2022 for the full year. Services revenue also grew over 30%. Internal shop visits increased over 30% and external spare parts was up over 20%. Favorable pricing and customer mix also contributed to the margins. We recently welcomed 2 new members of our LEAP MRO network, StandardAero and ST Engineering.Our external network for LEAP is now up to 5 partners, creating a highly competitive environment that drives a lower cost of ownership for our airline customers. Today, third-party MROs licensed by CFM service about 70% of the CFM56 shop visits. So this is a model that customers know well and trust today. In the supply chain, we saw areas of improvement with material inputs and LEAP shipments improving sequentially, thanks largely to our lean efforts. However, output continued to be impacted by material availability and supplier challenges, particularly in Defense, where revenue declined 2%. Lean is critical to improve process capabilities and increase material availability from our suppliers. In both Commercial and Defense, we use rigorous daily management with problem-solving across product lines, supply chain and engineering teams.This helped drive Commercial Engine deliveries to be up 40% year-over-year and recovery of roughly 70 engines in Defense, the first week of April. Predictability, stability and improved delivery remain key for us going forward. We're also constantly innovating for the future. Our XA100 is the only engine tested and ready to ensure the U.S. maintains air superiority this decade, especially critical as geopolitical threats grow. XA100 provides 30% more range, 20% greater acceleration and twice the thermal management capacity. This engine is the most effective -- the most cost-effective option to meet the needs of the U.S. war fighter for decades to come. Looking ahead, despite the encouraging start, as we shared in March, over the next few quarters, we'll face headwinds from tougher comps and the mix impact from equipment growth, inflation and investments.However, we continue to expect to deliver significant profit dollar growth and higher free cash flow in 2023, primarily from strong volume across engines and services, combined with better pricing and productivity. We'll share more details on our progress and our future as a stand-alone industry leader at the Paris Air Show in June. I look forward to seeing many of you there. Turning to Vernova. This business is already demonstrating how well it's positioned to support our customers through the energy transition. We're seeing favorable secular growth tailwinds underscored by IRA momentum and the need for sustainable, affordable, resilient and secure energy. This quarter at renewables, we saw continued signs of progress. We've talked about the IRA as a game changer, providing greater near-term and long-term demand certainty.We're already seeing this play out with significantly better visibility into our commercial pipeline over the next several years compared to this time just a year ago. Orders nearly doubled, led by Grid with strong growth across the businesses, including 2 large HVDC orders needed to connect new renewable sources to the Grid. Onshore equipment orders also increased with North America growing more than threefold. Revenues were up mid-single digits organically, driven primarily by Grid and Offshore Wind. Looking at services, excluding repower, core services grew again on both orders and revenue. We saw both sequential and year-over-year profit improvement driven by price and cost reduction benefits primarily at Onshore and Grid. To break it down by business, in Grid, we're clearly making progress.All 3 businesses saw strong top line growth with continued productivity gains in the first quarter, and we remain on track to achieve modest profitability for the full year. At Onshore, we're executing the strategy we shared with you in March. Focusing on select markets with a simplified range of product offerings, this in turn is yielding better margins in our backlog for longer-term profitable growth. And this quarter, we saw both sequential and year-over-year margin improvement, mostly in U.S. equipment. And we continue to drive pricing with positive price/cost. Our proactive fleet enhancement program is now roughly 20% complete. At the same time, we're still rationalizing our Onshore cost structure. As mentioned last quarter, headcount is down roughly 20% relative to last summer with more to do.And this has already begun to generate some savings. In Offshore, we're managing our existing Haliade-X backlog. This quarter, revenue more than doubled as we produced more nacelles. As discussed in March, we still expect Offshore to remain a near-term challenge as we execute our initial projects and improve our learning curve, both in terms of product cost and operational capabilities. Scott and the team are laser-focused on managing project costs and disbursements while improving our underwriting processes. Looking ahead for renewables overall, we're expecting a second quarter loss roughly in line with the first quarter. We continue to expect significant second half improvement year-over-year in Onshore Wind, which will be partially offset by Offshore Wind.As we said in March, we see an inflection to profitability from renewables in '24 from higher U.S. volume, price and continued cost out. Moving to Power. We delivered another quarter of solid growth, led by Gas Power, including both equipment and services. This business is a long-term cash generator and will help fund future growth at GE Vernova. Starting with the market, GE Gas Turbine utilization grew low single digits despite a milder winter in many markets, providing stable baseload power to customers transitioning from coal to gas or needing new power for electrification. We also continue to invest for the long term, including decarbonization pathways that will provide customers with cleaner, more reliable power. Focusing on the quarter, Power delivered solid top line growth with services up 8% organically, driven by Gas Power heavy-duty gas turbine transactional services and aero derivatives.Equipment revenue grew double digits as we shipped 5 more HDGT units compared to last year. This included 2 incremental HA units adding to our large gas installed base, which will serve us for years to come. Margins expanded despite a higher mix of HDGT equipment sales. We continue to manage inflationary pressures with price and continued productivity gains. Looking beyond the quarter, similar to last year, we see roughly 70% to 75% of Power's total year profit in the second half based on higher expected gas outage volume. Overall Power remains on track to deliver on its '23 commitments, including strong cash conversion. In summary, I'm encouraged by the progress we're making across GE Vernova. With the secular tailwinds, the impact of lean and our investments in the portfolio, I see tremendous value creation opportunity for years to come.So to wrap up on Slide 7. The GE team is off to an encouraging start in '23 and our progress continues. Our missions at both GE Aerospace and GE Vernova matter to the world, and we're crystal clear on how we plan to deliver on them. GE Aerospace has a bold vision to define the future of flight. With nearly 3 billion people flying with our engines under wing last year, this exceptional franchise is growing amidst the pronounced industry ramp. At GE Vernova, as the world looks to accelerate efforts to decarbonize and electrify, we're uniquely positioned with our solutions, which provide 30% of the world's electricity today. Our renewables business is showing continued signs of progress with clearly more to do, while Power continues to deliver solid growth.Simply put, we're improving how we operate, how we innovate and how we deliver for our customers. I couldn't be more excited about the future and where we're going. So with that, let's go to Q&amp;A.

493,4001b7e5-609d-3eeb-bb91-5eea4236da36,GE,2023-05-02,15 Most Acquisitive Public Companies in the US,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-most-acquisitive-public-companies-235715088.html,1682985435,STORY,"['GE', 'MA', 'WMT', 'PG', 'XOM', 'TSLA', 'V', 'JPM']","[In this article, we take a look at the 15 most acquisitive public companies in the US. For more on this, go to 5 Most Acquisitive Public Companies in the US.Through acquisition, companies can bring an effective pool of resources, broaden their market reach, and compete efficiently with their rivals. This article will give investors and stakeholders an insight into the 15 most acquisitive public companies in the US.Market OutlookIn 2021, the US acquisition market had the highest record of $2.9 trillion in transactions, an increase of 55% from $1.9 trillion in 2020. At this time, the U.S. acquisitions market was unparalleled (up from less than 50% in 2020). This represents over 60% of all worldwide agreements based on the stated value.In times of uncertainty or market volatility, M&amp;A tends to slow down, but those can also be the exact times when valuations improve, and opportunities present themselves. Having said that, 2022 was a year of uncertainty due to rising inflation. North America's fourth quarter of 2022 saw a dismal finish to a challenging year as corporations refrained from growing due to rising interest rates and a weakening economy.According to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence statistics, the overall value of mergers and acquisitions in the United States decreased to $1.477 trillion in 2022, down 41.4% from 2021. In 2022, there were 20,965 transactions, a 21.2% decrease from the previous year.Early in 2023, concerns about a global recession and increasing interest rates maintained a shadow over the short-term economic picture as central bankers worked to contain high inflation in several areas. So it's understandable why executives have been pushed back on their heels given the crisis in Ukraine, other geopolitical risks, supply chain interruptions, increased regulatory scrutiny, and the jittery investors still processing 2022's precipitous collapse in global stock market prices.Interest Rate - A Big Concern in 2023 for Acquisitive Public CompaniesSince the start of October 2022, businesses have been developing their budgets and business plans for 2023. Numerous changes have occurred in the economy and financial markets during this time. Two major worries are rising interest rates worldwide and how long they could stay high.Story continuesOn the ten-year bond issued by the US Department of the Treasury, interest rates are approximately the same in 2009 and 2022, ranging between 3 and 4 percent. However, credit was much more accessible back then because governments had opened the floodgates of fiscal support.US ""new money"" leveraged-loan issuance through October 2022 (i.e., not a refinancing) is down roughly a third year to date compared to 2021. A comparable metric for high-yield bonds is down by about 70% year over year, and 2021 was worse than 2020.2023 will be an incredible year for potential US acquisitive public companies. These businesses should be better protected against the hazards of an economic downturn because of their strong and adaptable balance sheets. They should also have reserves to take advantage of the worthwhile growth prospects of a recession's recovery phase.Cross-Border Acquisitions Might Get IncreasedDeal-making across international boundaries was considerably slowed down in 2022 by the COVID-19 epidemic, trade tensions between the U.S. and China, and regionally different economic situations. As a result, from 2012 through 2022, the average annual percentage of worldwide M&amp;A dollar volume is roughly 18%.Although M&amp;A was not exempt from all of this turmoil, cross-border M&amp;A remained alluring to dealmakers. In 2022, cross-border transactions accounted for 32% ($1.1 trillion) of all worldwide M&amp;A, which was in line with the average percentage for the previous ten years (35%). $217 billion in transactions were spent on acquiring American firms by non-American parties in 2022, accounting for 6% of worldwide M&amp;A activity and 19% of cross-border M&amp;A activity. Acquirers from China, India, and other emerging economies accounted for only 8% of the volume of cross-border acquisitions of U.S. targets, compared to 50% from the British, Canadian, Singaporean, Australian, and Japanese acquirers.15 Most Acquisitive Public Companies in the USPhoto by Kai Wenzel on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe have selected the most acquisitive public companies based on factors like the number of deals (acquisitions) made by an organization, the acquiring companies' total buying value, the acquirer's market capitalization, and the quality companies (potential companies) being acquired by the acquirer. After analyzing and combining all these factors, the 15 most acquisitive public companies are chosen. The main sources include Mckinsey, Companiesmarketcap, and Mergr. The companies are picked and ranked in ascending order based on the above four factors.15.

The corporation, which has a $403.97 billion market valuation as of Q1 of 2023, has completed more than 160 acquisitions since 2000.In addition to other significant purchases, 'Bank One' for $58 billion was a prospective target in 2004. At that time, JP Morgan’s market cap was approx. $113.2 billion. This makes the acquisition around 51% of the total company value. As a result, JPMorgan Chase grew its position in the Midwest and became one of the country's biggest banks because of this huge deal.12. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)The market value of UnitedHealth Group as of the first quarter of 2023, a worldwide healthcare organization, is around $458.43 billion. UnitedHealth Group, which has operations in more than 130 countries and offers a comprehensive range of healthcare goods and services.

Since 2000, the UnitedHealth Group has acquired more than 100 companies, according to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. Catamaran, Change Healthcare, and Surgical Care Affiliates, valued at $12.8 billion, $13.5 billion, and $2.3 billion, respectively, are a few of the major targets.11. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is a multinational oil and gas company. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has acquired more than 100 companies since 2000.

(NYSE:WMT)Talking about the retail sector, the giant company is always Walmart, which is notable around the world. Although the company only grabbed hold of around 20 companies since 2000 (compared to the above acquirers) and the market cap is $407.21 billion (during first quarter of 2023), Walmart’s acquisition of brands of Vudu, Asda, and Jet.com are the notable ones. One of the potential targets was 'Flipkart,' an Indian e-commerce company, where Walmart made a deal to get a 77% stake in the company. The $16 billion deal with Flipkart enabled Walmart to grow its online retail operations aggressively in India.9. Visa, Inc. (NYSE:V)As a multinational provider of financial services, Visa, Inc. (NYSE:V)'s main line of work is handling debit, credit, and prepaid card transactions for clients around the world. One of the biggest payment processors in the world as of 2021, Visa, Inc. (NYSE:V) has more than 3.5 billion credit, debit, and prepaid cards in use. The corporation, with a market value of $487.80 billion as of Q1 of 2023, has already acquired more than 30 businesses. In 2016, Visa paid $23.4 billion to buy ""Visa Europe,"" a former company that had been running independently.

494,e81dd5ff-48b3-32f5-a77e-52322ececf0c,GE,2023-05-02,Wall Street Bulls Look Optimistic About GE (GE): Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-bulls-look-optimistic-133001981.html,1682947801,STORY,['GE'],"[The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about General Electric (GE) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.GE currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.63, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 15 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.63 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 15 recommendations that derive the current ABR, nine are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 60% and 13.3% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for GEBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for GECheck price target &amp; stock forecast for GE here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying GE, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is GE a Good Investment?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for GE, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 3.2% over the past month to $2.03.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for GE. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for GE may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

496,8ccaece1-763b-4118-a334-37f72d78b08c,GE,2023-05-02,AI faces a long road ahead in healthcare — 'It lacks structure',Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-faces-a-long-road-ahead-in-healthcare--it-lacks-structure-204935219.html,1682887775,STORY,"['MSFT', 'GE', 'TSLA', 'AMZN', 'AAPL']","[The debate about the use of artificial intelligence and platforms like ChatGPT across sectors is heating up as enthusiasts tout recent breakthroughs, while critics point out AI's potential pitfalls and ways the technology could be misused.And while AI is already being deployed in some areas of the healthcare sector, there are major hurdles facing the industry as it seeks to bring the latest technological advances into the field.Geeta Nayyar, former chief medical officer at Salesforce, likened these challenges to those facing self-driving cars — not everyone is raising their hand to get into a car driven entirely by AI.""Now, the idea of a self-driving car that is a complement to someone actually sitting in the driver's seat, that becomes interesting. That's what we need in health care,"" Nayyar told Yahoo Finance in an interview.""Everyone is fixated on this, 'We won't need the doctor anymore...AI is here to save the day.' That's not so true,"" she added.The topic was a focal point at a major healthcare conference this month, where executives cautioned that there is still more to understand about machine learning and its impact on the sector.One of the biggest uptake problems facing the healthcare sector is one unique to the industry — most healthcare data is largely protected and hidden. And this privacy complicates efforts to build a data pool robust enough to deploy across the sector.REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/IllustrationThe US government has already lodged its concerns about AI's role in healthcare and determined data quality was a key area that needed improvement.""Developing or expanding access to high-quality datasets could help facilitate training and testing ML (machine learning) technologies across diverse and representative conditions,"" according to the report from the Government Accountability Office. ""This could improve the technologies' performance and generalizability, help developers understand their performance and areas for improvement, and help to build trust and adoption in these technologies.""Story continuesCurrently, more than 97% of health data being put into systems does not get used — and the volume of that data has grown in just ten years from 15% of all health information being digital to almost 98% today, GE Healthcare (GE) chief technology officer Taha Kass-Hout told Yahoo Finance.But this data isn't yet reliable, in Kass-Hout's view, because it lacks structure.""[A]nd without that you can't query and analyze it efficiently or make any decisions,"" Kass-Hout said.'Much more efficient' toolsKass-Hout is still optimistic about the use of AI in health, noting that it is already being used in radiology, for example, as well as with creating new therapies.But he said that still having a human involved in these processes is key to AI's success. Nayyar agreed, saying AI could also be used as a tool to help patients stick to their medications. She explained, drawing again on the self-driving car example.""It doesn't necessarily have to drive the car for you, but can it get you in the right car and tell you to wear your seatbelt,"" Nayyar said. ""There are many different things that AI can do to help complement that patient journey,""AI also has potential to help the drug industry be more efficient in its research and development. Moderna (MRNA), for example, used AWS (AMZN) to help identify which vaccine formula to pursue in its efforts to protect against COVID-19.""Moderna was able to reach (development) milestones so quickly due to the programmable nature of mRNA,"" said Dave Johnson, vice president of informatics, data, science and AI at Moderna.And the biotech giant just announced a new partnership with IBM (IBM) to further explore the use of AI in medicine.A vial of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is displayed on a counter at a pharmacy in Portland, Ore., on, Dec. 27, 2021. (AP Photo/Jenny Kane, File)Bill Gates also recently touted AI's capacity not only to help drug companies, but the potential this technology holds for public health in developing countries.""There is already software that can look at this data, infer what the pathways are, search for targets on pathogens, and design drugs accordingly."" the Microsoft (MSFT) founder said in a recent letter. Gates said the next generation of AI tools would be much more efficient, ""and they’ll be able to predict side effects and figure out dosing levels.""Some experts are hoping AI can help with paperwork as well, a significant burden for clinicians in the era of electronic medical records and claims, as well as on the insurer side in deciding about coverage of claims.Bad data can 'jeopardize progress'Experts are also concerned about AI's potential to produce results based on skewed data the machines learn from, a known risk with machine learning models in healthcare.Addressing these problems would also help ease concerns of clinicians, the GAO's report noted. And a familiar pathway — robust clinical trials — could be a solution.""While there is excitement and demonstrated benefits to bringing (AI) tools into clinical practice, poor data quality and prevalent biases in health care can jeopardize progress towards achieving health equity and fuel ongoing uncertainties and hesitancies about adopting these tools,"" the report stated.That's partly why the recent debate has focused on moving ahead too quickly with the technology, as highlighted in a recent letter signed by Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk and Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, among others. It doesn't call for a pause on AI development in general, but ""merely a stepping back from the dangerous race to ever-larger unpredictable black-box models with emergent capabilities"" for at least six months. ""If such a pause cannot be enacted quickly, governments should step in and institute a moratorium,"" the letter stated.The logo of OpenAI is displayed near a response by its AI chatbot ChatGPT on its website, in this illustration picture taken February 9, 2023. REUTERS/Florence Lo/IllustrationBut some, like Gates, have said calling for a pause is unrealistic. Instead, there should be responsible building, Kass-Hout said. Which is easier in the health world, thanks to the amount of regulation already in place. That makes it more likely that responsible use of AI will be top of mind, which means knowing how the models are behaving over time, how to measure outcomes, and ensuring that ""there is a human in the loop that's evaluating, correcting, editing,"" Kass-Hout added.And the data have to get to a point of being robust, or multi-modal. That includes storing a person's medical notes, texts, medical images, records, and lab results all in one place to help with analysis and diagnosis.All of which, in Kass-Hout's view, means it will take time for this technology to have a large impact on the health care sector. ""These models have never been trained on these kinds of data.""Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhemClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this oil refiner have returned -17.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +5.1% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, to which Valero Energy belongs, has lost 0.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Valero Energy is expected to post earnings of $6.98 per share, indicating a change of -38.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -4.8% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $24.69 points to a change of -15.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $16.05 indicates a change of -35% from what Valero Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.4%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Valero Energy.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for VLO _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Valero Energy, the consensus sales estimate of $38.33 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -25.8%. The $142.24 billion and $135.94 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -19.4% and -4.4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryValero Energy reported revenues of $36.44 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -5.5%. EPS of $8.27 for the same period compares with $2.31 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $28.89 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +26.14%. The EPS surprise was +14.23%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Valero Energy is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Valero Energy.

However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. In this article, we decided to focus on Valero Energy's  ROE.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. See our latest analysis for Valero Energy How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Valero Energy is:52% = US$14b ÷ US$27b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.52 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Valero Energy's Earnings Growth And 52% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Valero Energy has an impressive ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 30% the company's ROE is quite impressive. So, the substantial 27% net income growth seen by Valero Energy over the past five years isn't overly surprising.Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Valero Energy's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 18% in the same period, which is great to see.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is VLO worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether VLO is currently mispriced by the market.Is Valero Energy Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Valero Energy's three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 13%, which is quite low. This implies that the company is retaining 87% of its profits. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business as evidenced by the growth seen by the company.Besides, Valero Energy has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 40% over the next three years. Therefore, the expected rise in the payout ratio explains why the company's ROE is expected to decline to 16% over the same period.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with Valero Energy's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

During this period, the Zacks Medical - HMOs industry, which UnitedHealth falls in, has gained 6%.

The $363.59 billion and $385.24 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +12.2% and +6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUnitedHealth reported revenues of $91.93 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.7%.

In 2021, America spent 17.8% of its gross domestic product on healthcare, nearly twice as much as the average among OECD nations.Health spending per person in the U.S. was $12,914 in 2021, which was about $5,000 more than any other developed country. All told, the U.S. spends more than $4 trillion each year on healthcare, making it one of the leading sectors of the world’s biggest economy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe size of the healthcare market in America, and the sheer amount of money spent makes healthcare stocks an excellent investment.

The pandemic created a surgical backlog that is now unwinding and driving Intuitive Surgical to exceptional earnings.The company’s stock recently rose nearly 10% following a first-quarter earnings beat. Intuitive Surgical’s earnings per share climbed 8.8% higher from a year earlier to $1.23. Sales of the da Vinci surgical system rose 12% year-over-year to an installed base of 7,779 platforms globally.Story continuesThe company continues to drive sales of surgical instruments and accessories that are used with the da Vinci system for various medical procedures. Looking ahead, Intuitive Surgical’s revenue looks well-positioned for continued growth.McKesson (MCK)McKesson headquarters in Irving, TXSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comPharmaceutical distributor McKesson (NYSE:MCK) is another of the healthcare stocks that has an impressive long-term track record.The company, which employs about 80,000 people and distributes a third of all pharmaceuticals used in North America, has seen its share price rise 15% in the last 12 months and 130% over the past five years.Its stock has succeeded thanks to steady and continuous growth. In the last 20 years, McKesson has increased its annual revenue by an average of 8.9% per year and has been profitable nearly all that time.Looking ahead, McKesson recently raised its guidance for 2023, citing operational momentum in its pharmaceutical and medical device distribution business.Investors no doubt also like that McKesson has raised its quarterly dividend for 15 consecutive years, including a 14.8% increase in 2022. MCK stock dividend currently pays shareholders 54 cents a share each quarter, which equates to a yield of 0.59%.The stock got a lift last year after the company paid $7.4 billion to settle lawsuits related to the distribution of opioids, putting the case behind it.Abbott Laboratories (ABT)Abbott (ABT) sign with lighting behind lettersSource: testing / Shutterstock.comAbbott Laboratories’ (NYSE:ABT) stock has proven itself to be a long-term winner, having gained 85% in the last five years and 200% over the past decade.ABT stock has also gained 12% in the last six months, fueled by a string of better-than-expected earnings. The medical device company just reported its latest earnings beat that sent its share price up nearly 10% in a single trading session.The company’s earnings per share beat consensus estimates by four cents.The latest results from Abbott Labs were especially impressive as the company overcame a big slowdown in sales of its Covid-19 tests. The slowdown in Covid tests was offset by robust sales in Abbott’s medical devices unit, which rose 9% from a year earlier to $3.9 billion.Abbott’s glucose-monitoring device, Freestyle Libre, remains a bestseller, earning $1.2 billion in Q1 revenue. Given its track record, this healthcare stock has huge return potential for long-term investors.Moderna (MRNA)Moderna logo is seen at the entrance to its headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Moderna, Inc., (MRNA) is an American pharmaceutical and biotechnology company.Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comInvestors looking for a buy-the-dip opportunity should consider biopharmaceutical company Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA).A winner  during the pandemic, MRNA stock has pulled back substantially over the last 18 months. Since peaking at $450 a share in September 2021, Moderna’s share price has fallen 70%.While disheartening, the drop should be welcome news for long-term investors who are willing to stick with the stock for several years.Moderna’s pipeline of new medications, which include a vaccine that protects against both Covid-19 and influenza, has analysts excited.Moderna is also working on several new cancer treatments that employ its MRNA technology. Analysts also agree that with a price-earnings ratio of only 6.73, MRNA stock looks woefully undervalued at current levels.The consensus view among 15 analysts who cover Moderna is to “buy” the stock. The median price target on the shares is 54% higher than where they currently trade.UnitedHealth Group (UNH)The UnitedHealth (UNH) headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comAs the largest healthcare company by revenue and the largest insurance company by net premiums in the world, UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) has a sizable protective moat around it.The company specializes in both individual and group health insurance, and it is the world’s seventh biggest company with annual revenues of nearly $300 billion.Given its size and importance, it should come as no surprise that UNH stock has been a success for long-term investors, having gained 105% in the last five years.Some analysts even call UNH stock “recession-proof” as businesses and consumers are likely to prioritize paying their health insurance premiums during an economic downturn such as the one we’re currently experiencing.That helps to explain why UNH stock has consistently outperformed among S&amp;P 500 stocks and beaten many other healthcare securities. The 24 analysts who cover the company have a median price target on the stock that is 22% above current levels.Danaher (DHR)image of laptop screen displaying danaher (DHR) websiteSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comFew if any healthcare stocks have a better long-term track record than medical device company, Danaher (NYSE:DHR).In the past 20 years, DHR stock has outperformed the benchmark S&amp;P 500 Index by more than 1,000%. In the last decade, the stock has gained more than 400%.Like many other companies on this list, Danaher’s medical and scientific equipment, which is widely used in labs and hospitals, is considered essential.Danaher has enjoyed strong sales growth for many years, which has driven DHR stock to new heights.The good news for long-term investors looking to buy low and eventually sell high is that Danaher’s most recent quarter missed Wall Street expectations, sending the company’s shares down to a fresh 52-week low.Rather than fret, investors should buy Danaher stock while it is on sale, keeping in mind that the company’s Q1 2023 results beat on both the top and bottom lines. It was the forward guidance that spooked traders.Eli Lilly (LLY)Eli Lilly and Company World Headquarters. Lilly makes Medicines and Pharmaceuticals XISource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comLong-term investors looking to cash in on explosive growth should consider a stake in Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY).The pharmaceutical company has a massive catalyst emerging: a medication that treats obesity. The weight-loss drug, called “Tirzepatide,” is in the final stages of approval with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Some analysts are saying it could end up being the biggest blockbuster prescription drug ever to hit the market.Eli Lilly is working overtime preparing for the obesity medication’s approval, expanding existing facilities so that it can manufacture and get Tirzepatide to consumers as quickly as possible. While exciting, Tirzepatide isn’t the only thoroughbred in Eli Lilly’s stable. The company has an impressive roster of other blockbuster drugs, including antipsychotic medication Zyprexa and diabetes treatment Trulicity.

This makes the dividend yield about the same as the industry average at 1.9%. See our latest analysis for LKQ LKQ's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsWe like a dividend to be consistent over the long term, so checking whether it is sustainable is important. Before making this announcement, LKQ was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 7.6%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 23% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendLKQ Is Still Building Its Track RecordWithout a track record of dividend payments, we can't make a judgement on how stable it has been. This doesn't mean that the company can't pay a good dividend, but just that we want to wait until it can prove itself.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. It's encouraging to see that LKQ has been growing its earnings per share at 19% a year over the past five years. LKQ definitely has the potential to grow its dividend in the future with earnings on an uptrend and a low payout ratio.LKQ Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that LKQ is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 3 warning signs for LKQ that investors need to be conscious of moving forward. Is LKQ not quite the opportunity you were looking for?

507,a8074da6-98e5-3c55-8cb5-0334f5675aa0,EL,2023-05-02,Inter Parfums (IPAR) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inter-parfums-ipar-earnings-expected-140102541.html,1682949662,STORY,"['IPAR', 'EL']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Inter Parfums (IPAR) reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 8, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis perfume maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.39 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +26.4%.Revenues are expected to be $311.96 million, up 24.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 9.11% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Inter Parfums?For Inter Parfums, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #1.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Inter Parfums will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Inter Parfums would post earnings of $0.34 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.71, delivering a surprise of +108.82%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Inter Parfums doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerEstee Lauder (EL), another stock in the Zacks Cosmetics industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.49 for the quarter ended March 2023. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -74.2%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $3.72 billion, down 12.5% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Estee Lauder has been revised 0.1% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 3.26%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that Estee Lauder will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

508,4001b7e5-609d-3eeb-bb91-5eea4236da36,PG,2023-05-02,15 Most Acquisitive Public Companies in the US,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-most-acquisitive-public-companies-235715088.html,1682985435,STORY,"['GE', 'MA', 'WMT', 'PG', 'XOM', 'TSLA', 'V', 'JPM']","[In this article, we take a look at the 15 most acquisitive public companies in the US. For more on this, go to 5 Most Acquisitive Public Companies in the US.Through acquisition, companies can bring an effective pool of resources, broaden their market reach, and compete efficiently with their rivals. This article will give investors and stakeholders an insight into the 15 most acquisitive public companies in the US.Market OutlookIn 2021, the US acquisition market had the highest record of $2.9 trillion in transactions, an increase of 55% from $1.9 trillion in 2020. At this time, the U.S. acquisitions market was unparalleled (up from less than 50% in 2020). This represents over 60% of all worldwide agreements based on the stated value.In times of uncertainty or market volatility, M&amp;A tends to slow down, but those can also be the exact times when valuations improve, and opportunities present themselves. Having said that, 2022 was a year of uncertainty due to rising inflation. North America's fourth quarter of 2022 saw a dismal finish to a challenging year as corporations refrained from growing due to rising interest rates and a weakening economy.According to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence statistics, the overall value of mergers and acquisitions in the United States decreased to $1.477 trillion in 2022, down 41.4% from 2021. In 2022, there were 20,965 transactions, a 21.2% decrease from the previous year.Early in 2023, concerns about a global recession and increasing interest rates maintained a shadow over the short-term economic picture as central bankers worked to contain high inflation in several areas. So it's understandable why executives have been pushed back on their heels given the crisis in Ukraine, other geopolitical risks, supply chain interruptions, increased regulatory scrutiny, and the jittery investors still processing 2022's precipitous collapse in global stock market prices.Interest Rate - A Big Concern in 2023 for Acquisitive Public CompaniesSince the start of October 2022, businesses have been developing their budgets and business plans for 2023. Numerous changes have occurred in the economy and financial markets during this time. Two major worries are rising interest rates worldwide and how long they could stay high.Story continuesOn the ten-year bond issued by the US Department of the Treasury, interest rates are approximately the same in 2009 and 2022, ranging between 3 and 4 percent. However, credit was much more accessible back then because governments had opened the floodgates of fiscal support.US ""new money"" leveraged-loan issuance through October 2022 (i.e., not a refinancing) is down roughly a third year to date compared to 2021. A comparable metric for high-yield bonds is down by about 70% year over year, and 2021 was worse than 2020.2023 will be an incredible year for potential US acquisitive public companies. These businesses should be better protected against the hazards of an economic downturn because of their strong and adaptable balance sheets. They should also have reserves to take advantage of the worthwhile growth prospects of a recession's recovery phase.Cross-Border Acquisitions Might Get IncreasedDeal-making across international boundaries was considerably slowed down in 2022 by the COVID-19 epidemic, trade tensions between the U.S. and China, and regionally different economic situations. As a result, from 2012 through 2022, the average annual percentage of worldwide M&amp;A dollar volume is roughly 18%.Although M&amp;A was not exempt from all of this turmoil, cross-border M&amp;A remained alluring to dealmakers. In 2022, cross-border transactions accounted for 32% ($1.1 trillion) of all worldwide M&amp;A, which was in line with the average percentage for the previous ten years (35%). $217 billion in transactions were spent on acquiring American firms by non-American parties in 2022, accounting for 6% of worldwide M&amp;A activity and 19% of cross-border M&amp;A activity. Acquirers from China, India, and other emerging economies accounted for only 8% of the volume of cross-border acquisitions of U.S. targets, compared to 50% from the British, Canadian, Singaporean, Australian, and Japanese acquirers.15 Most Acquisitive Public Companies in the USPhoto by Kai Wenzel on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe have selected the most acquisitive public companies based on factors like the number of deals (acquisitions) made by an organization, the acquiring companies' total buying value, the acquirer's market capitalization, and the quality companies (potential companies) being acquired by the acquirer. After analyzing and combining all these factors, the 15 most acquisitive public companies are chosen. The main sources include Mckinsey, Companiesmarketcap, and Mergr.

At that time, JP Morgan’s market cap was approx. $113.2 billion. This makes the acquisition around 51% of the total company value. As a result, JPMorgan Chase grew its position in the Midwest and became one of the country's biggest banks because of this huge deal.12. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)The market value of UnitedHealth Group as of the first quarter of 2023, a worldwide healthcare organization, is around $458.43 billion.

Although the company only grabbed hold of around 20 companies since 2000 (compared to the above acquirers) and the market cap is $407.21 billion (during first quarter of 2023), Walmart’s acquisition of brands of Vudu, Asda, and Jet.com are the notable ones. One of the potential targets was 'Flipkart,' an Indian e-commerce company, where Walmart made a deal to get a 77% stake in the company. The $16 billion deal with Flipkart enabled Walmart to grow its online retail operations aggressively in India.9. Visa, Inc. (NYSE:V)As a multinational provider of financial services, Visa, Inc. (NYSE:V)'s main line of work is handling debit, credit, and prepaid card transactions for clients around the world. One of the biggest payment processors in the world as of 2021, Visa, Inc. (NYSE:V) has more than 3.5 billion credit, debit, and prepaid cards in use. The corporation, with a market value of $487.80 billion as of Q1 of 2023, has already acquired more than 30 businesses.

The uncertainty, exhaustion, health concerns, and additional care required can take a toll on families, even during the transition from hospital to home.Some of that additional care includes protecting a premature baby's skin. Preterm babies' skin can be up to two times thinner than full-term babies, making it extra sensitive to touch and irritants1.That's why selecting the right diaper is so important for premature babies with heightened sensitivity to skin irritation. A few years ago, as the #1 Canadian Pediatrician Recommended Brand, Pampers partnered with NICU nurses to develop a special diaper designed for babies weighing as little as one pound, the first major diaper brand to do so.Following their donation during November's Prematurity Awareness Month, Pampers® Canada is partnering with the Canadian Premature Babies Foundation (CPBF) and Préma-Québec once more to continue supporting families with premature babies across May and June.""We know that having a premature baby can be overwhelming and stressful for many Canadian families.

The CPBF is dedicated to helping them through peer support programs, resources, and research leading to improved outcomes and experiences for babies and families. Through these generous donations from Pampers® Canada, we will be able to continue this support for Canadian families,"" said Fabiana Bacchini, Executive Director, Canadian Premature Babies Foundation.Those who would like to donate to the CPBF and Préma-Québec through this initiative, can purchase Pampers® Swaddlers diaper packs in store at any Walmart location in Canada.For more information, please visit pampers.ca.About Pampers®For more than 50 years, parents have trusted Pampers® to care for their babies.

511,5da4af59-d6a4-38f7-bbd7-bca4821fa71c,VNO,2023-05-02,Vornado (VNO) Q1 FFO Miss Estimates,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vornado-vno-q1-ffo-miss-221510200.html,1682979310,STORY,['VNO'],"[Vornado (VNO) came out with quarterly funds from operations (FFO) of $0.60 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.62 per share. This compares to FFO of $0.79 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an FFO surprise of -3.23%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this real estate investment trust would post FFO of $0.67 per share when it actually produced FFO of $0.72, delivering a surprise of 7.46%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus FFO estimates three times.Vornado , which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry, posted revenues of $445.92 million for the quarter ended March 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.49%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $442.13 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Vornado shares have lost about 27.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 8.6%.What's Next for Vornado?While Vornado has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's FFO outlook. Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Vornado: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus FFO estimate is $0.67 on $449.25 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $2.60 on $1.79 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, REIT and Equity Trust - Other is currently in the top 46% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.One other stock from the same industry, Innovative Industrial Properties (IIPR), is yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2023. The results are expected to be released on May 8.This company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.04 per share in its upcoming report, which represents no change from the year-ago quarter. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Innovative Industrial Properties' revenues are expected to be $70.8 million, up 9.8% from the year-ago quarter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude net gains from sales of certain real estate assets, real estate impairment losses, depreciation and amortization expense from real estate assets and other specified items, including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries. FFO and FFO per diluted share are non-GAAP financial measures used by management, investors and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions. The Company also uses FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions, as adjusted for certain items that impact the comparability of period to period FFO, as one of several criteria to determine performance-based compensation for senior management. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a performance measure or cash flow as a liquidity measure. FFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition to FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions, we also disclose FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions, as adjusted. Although this non-GAAP measure clearly differs from NAREIT’s definition of FFO, we believe it provides a meaningful presentation of operating performance. Reconciliations of net income attributable to common shareholders to FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions are provided on the following page.

As properties are bought and sold based on NOI at share - cash basis, we utilize this measure to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of our assets to that of our peers.

And on the buyback announcement, it noted:If cash preservation is so critical, we wonder why implementing a $200m stock buyback program is a good use.Shares ended last week down 1.8%, having partially recovered from their big downward spike Thursday.

MANH.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:Top 5 Momentum Stocks for May Amid Fed's FOMC MeetingWall Street completed last month on a positive note despite volatility. In April, the Dow advanced 2.5%, marking its best month since January. The S&amp;P 500 gained 1.5%, finishing the second positive month in a row.The Nasdaq Composite also rose marginally despite a weak start. The tech-heavy index regained momentum last week supported by strong first-quarter earnings of big techs. Last week, the Nasdaq Composite ended 1.3% higher, while the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 rose 0.9% each.The momentum of the U.S. stock markets is likely to sustain in May. The major driver of this month will be the Fed’s FOMC meeting and the first-quarter 2023 earnings season.Fed’s May FOMC MeetingThe Fed is scheduled to meet its FOMC meeting on May 2 and 3. In the post-FOMC statement in March, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that the central bank is approaching the end of its ongoing interest rate hike regime. The terminal rate is likely to be 5.125%, which means just one 25 basis-point rate hike from the existing range of 4.75-5%.Per the CME FedWatch, there exists an 85.5% probability of a 25-basis point rate hike while a 14.5% probability for the central bank to maintain the status quo for the benchmark lending rate.

515,01cc3e90-7c0c-4969-98d4-3fbbb0dc49d0,DHI,2023-05-02,This is now the biggest problem in the housing market,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/this-is-now-the-biggest-problem-in-the-housing-market-192851522.html,1682969331,STORY,"['DHI', 'PHM']","[Last year mortgage rates dominated the housing narrative. Now the main actor appears to be inventory.That’s the takeaway from a host of data points revealed in the last week such as the unexpected increase in home prices and the unforeseen drop in pending sales. Add to that home builders’ first-quarter results, which surprised on the upside.Underpinning all those metrics is a housing market devoid of enough homes for sale.The result? A profitable break for home builders — and their stock investors. More misery for the homebuyers still hunting for a deal before everyone else.""It's supply and demand,” Sean Dycus, real estate agent Mainstreet Properties, told Yahoo Finance. “What happens when the supply is low and the demand is there? You know what's going to happen.""A for sale sign is posted in front of a home on March 22, 2023 in San Anselmo, California. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) (Justin Sullivan via Getty Images)How bad is the shortage?New listings of homes for sale fell 22.4% nationwide from the previous year during the four weeks ended April 23—one of the largest declines since the start of the pandemic, according to Redfin. Similarly, Realtor.com found the number of homes newly listed for sale dropped 20% versus a year ago in March.""Put another way, the number of homeowners deciding to sell homes in March 2023 was roughly on par with the number in April 2020, when early-pandemic uncertainty caused many to put off major housing-related decisions,” Realtor.com Chief Economist Danielle Hale told Yahoo Finance.Of course, mortgage rates play a significant role in the inventory story. A big reason there aren’t enough homes for sale is because current homeowners are deciding against listing their houses. They don’t want to give up the lower mortgage rate they have now.Approximately 82% of potential move-up buyers said they felt trapped by their current low mortgage rate, a Realtor.com poll of over 1,200 potential sellers in February found.“The challenge for the sellers is if they sell today, they're likely to have to take a higher interest rate if they're going to buy another house,” Doug Duncan, chief economist at Fannie Mae, previously told Yahoo Finance. “If they have to use any mortgage, then they're probably gonna give away some of the equity they take out in the higher payment because mortgage rates are up.”Story continuesInventory: Bad for homebuyersWhat that means for buyers is that they will have an even harder time finding a house to buy. The latest stats bear this out.Pending home sales for March dropped by 5.2% from the previous month, a bigger drop than expected, according to the National Association of Realtors. The group’s chief economist called the dearth of properties “a major constraint to rising sales.”Meanwhile there's a feeding frenzy for homes on the market.The NAR found that a third of listings are getting more than one bidder and 28% of homes are selling above their list price. Altos Research found that the median price for new listings—and for homes in contract last week—increased from a week ago.That syncs with two separate indexes last week showing national home prices unexpectedly rose month over month in February.""There's still many areas of the country where there are multiple offers being made, which is part of the reason that you don't see house prices declining further than they do,” Duncan said. “There's still pent-up demand…there just isn't the supply out there.""Inventory: Good for home buildersThe crushing environment for homebuyers is a boon for home builders.Sentiment among home builders is on the rise, for instance, climbing in April for the fourth straight month amid inventory woes, according to the National Association of Home Builders.""Currently, one-third of housing inventory is new construction, compared to historical norms of a little more than 10%,"" NAHB Chief Economist Robert Dietz.D.R. Horton (DHI) and PulteGroup (PHM) both reported better than expected results in the first three months of the year. D.R. Horton CEO David Auld said the spring selling season was “off to an encouraging start” and the builder recorded a 73% increase in net sales from the previous quarter.""Although higher interest rates and economic uncertainty may persist for some time, the supply of both new and existing homes at affordable price points remains limited, and demographics supporting housing demand remain favorable,” D.R. Horton’s Auld wrote in the press release.PulteGroup also reported stabilizing cancellation rates, a decline in purchase contracts that was smaller than forecast, and an 18% increase in net new orders from first-time buyers.PulteGroup President and CEO Ryan Marshall credited a change in “buyer psychology” that allowed the builder to pull back on incentives and post moderate price increases during the quarter.“And then the biggest thing as I go back to, we’ve got a housing shortage in this country, and that hasn’t changed,” Marshall said on the company’s earnings calls. “And so in the places where we’ve been able to demonstrate value … we’re seeing some nice momentum on the sales floor…And that’s allowed us to be optimistic and bullish with our forward start projections and some of the things that we’re anticipating to be able to do for the balance of the year.”Gabriella is a personal finance reporter at Yahoo Finance.

The finish line is in sight,"" American Airlines said in a statement.Separately, a majority of the estimated 4,500 pilots who fly for Canada’s largest carrier voted 84% for a March agreement to merge with the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), the two unions said in a statement confirming earlier reporting by Reuters.A merger with ALPA, the world’s largest pilots union with more than 60,000 members, is seen as beneficial, in part, for providing additional bargaining resources. Air Canada pilots are not currently in negotiations.ALPA's executive board would first need to ratify the merger on May 17. American Airlines pilots are also considering a merger with ALPA, with discussion to be raised in early June, an Allied spokesperson said. North American pilots are pressing for better salaries and working conditions as carriers struggle to staff up to meet soaring travel demand after COVID-19. But some airline executives warn hefty raises will inflate fixed costs and make it tougher to repair debt-laden balance sheets.Story continuesCanada’s second largest carrier WestJet Airlines, which announced it completed its acquisition of leisure carrier Sunwing Airlines on Monday, is facing bargaining pressure from its pilots who have authorized strike action as early as May 16.By contrast, it would be hard for American Airlines pilots to walk off the job because of a complex labor process in the U.S. that makes it difficult for airline workers to strike.In March, Delta Air Lines pilots ratified a new contract that includes $7 billion in cumulative increases in pay and benefits over four years.American's chief executive has said the carrier is prepared to match the pay rates and profit-sharing formula that rival Delta provided in its new contract.(Reporting By Allison Lampert in Montreal and Priyamvada C in Bengaluru; Editing by Subhranshu Sahu and Josie Kao)]"

Congress and the president can also act to prevent a strike if one appears imminent.Airline unions like to take strike votes, however, which they believe increase their leverage at the bargaining table. American, Southwest and United Airlines are under pressure to match or beat terms that rival Delta Air Lines accepted with its pilots, who earlier this year won 34% raises over a four-year contract that will cost Delta about $7 billion.Some smaller airlines have experienced pilot shortages, and the largest carriers have all strained to hire and train enough new pilots to meet surging travel demand. That gives the unions more bargaining power than usual.At American Airlines, the Allied Pilots Association said Monday that more than 96% of its 15,000 members voted, and among those who did, 99% favored authorizing the union to call for a strike.A spokeswoman for the Fort Worth, Texas-based airline said American is confident that it can reach an agreement with the union quickly.“We understand that a strike-authorization vote is one of the important ways pilots express their desire to get a deal done, and we respect the message of voting results,” said the spokeswoman, Sarah Jantz.The American pilots’ union said it is also seeking scheduling changes that union officials say will improve efficiency and prevent the kind of widespread delays and cancellations seen last summer.“The summer travel season is almost here, and we’re all wondering whether this will be another summer of uncertainty for American Airlines,” union President Ed Sicher said.Story continuesAmerican pilots planned to picket later Monday at airports around the country.Members of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association began voting Monday on a strike-authorization measure that is expected to pass easily.Adam Carlisle, Southwest's president of labor relations, said the vote will not affect the Dallas-based airline's operations. He said negotiations are scheduled to resume this week with help from federal mediators, and the airline hopes to reach an agreement with pilots that ""places them competitively in the industry.”]"

Higher rates and global economic slowdown are other concerns. However, due to the ebbing pandemic, easing of travel restrictions and pent-up demand in the leisure sector, most carries have come up with upbeat outlook. Capacity growth is expected ahead.Investors should keep a close eye on the industry as it continues to navigate the post-pandemic landscape. Notably, most U.S. airlines have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy). Pure-play airlines ETF U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) was down about 2% during the earnings reporting of those key U.S. airlines (as of Apr 27, 2023).Delta Misses Overall, Upbeat GuidanceOn Apr 13, Delta Air Lines DAL initiated the first-quarter 2023 earnings season for the airline space. This Atlanta-based carrier reported lower-than-expected earnings per share and revenues. However, investors were impressed by the upbeat outlook for second-quarter 2023.Delta’s first-quarter 2023 earnings (excluding 82 cents from non-recurring items) of 25 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 29 cents. Volatile fuel price and unfavorable weather conditions led to this downtick. Revenues of $12,759 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12,767.4 million. Driven by higher air-travel demand, total revenues increased 36.49% on a year-over-year basis.For second-quarter 2023, DAL, expects capacity to increase 17% from second-quarter 2022 actuals. Backed by strong booking trends for summer, the company expects June quarter revenues (adjusted) to increase in the 15-17% band from second-quarter 2022 actuals.United Airlines Beats OverallMeanwhile, United Airlines UAL United Airlines incurred first-quarter 2023 loss (excluding 4 cents from non-recurring items) of 63 cents per share, which was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 73 cents. In the year-ago quarter, UAL had incurred a loss of $4.24 per share when air-travel demand was not as buoyant as in the current scenario. Operating revenues of $11,429 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11,420.9 million. UAL’s revenues increased 51.1% year over year owing to upbeat air-travel demand.Story continuesFor the second quarter of 2023, United Airlines expects capacity to improve 18.5% from the year-ago reported figure. Revenues for the June quarter are anticipated to grow 14-16% year over year. Riding on upbeat air-travel demand, UAL expects to be profitable in second-quarter 2023.

In the year-ago quarter, JBLU incurred a loss of 80 cents per share.  Operating revenues of $2,328 million climbed 34.1% year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,322.5 million. The double-digit year-over-year jump reflected improving air-travel demand.For second-quarter 2023, capacity is anticipated to increase in the 4.5-7.5% range.

The finish line is in sight,"" American Airlines said in a statement.Separately, a majority of the estimated 4,500 pilots who fly for Canada’s largest carrier voted 84% for a March agreement to merge with the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), the two unions said in a statement confirming earlier reporting by Reuters.A merger with ALPA, the world’s largest pilots union with more than 60,000 members, is seen as beneficial, in part, for providing additional bargaining resources. Air Canada pilots are not currently in negotiations.ALPA's executive board would first need to ratify the merger on May 17. American Airlines pilots are also considering a merger with ALPA, with discussion to be raised in early June, an Allied spokesperson said.North American pilots are pressing for better salaries and working conditions as carriers struggle to staff up to meet soaring travel demand after COVID-19. But some airline executives warn hefty raises will inflate fixed costs and make it tougher to repair debt-laden balance sheets.Canada’s second largest carrier WestJet Airlines, which announced it completed its acquisition of leisure carrier Sunwing Airlines on Monday, is facing bargaining pressure from its pilots who have authorized strike action as early as May 16.Story continuesBy contrast, it would be hard for American Airlines pilots to walk off the job because of a complex labor process in the U.S. that makes it difficult for airline workers to strike.In March, Delta Air Lines pilots ratified a new contract that includes $7 billion in cumulative increases in pay and benefits over four years.American's chief executive has said the carrier is prepared to match the pay rates and profit-sharing formula that rival Delta provided in its new contract.(Reporting By Allison Lampert in Montreal and Priyamvada C in Bengaluru; Editing by Subhranshu Sahu and Josie Kao)]"

(NASDAQ:PFG) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $0.64 per share on the 30th of June. Based on this payment, the dividend yield on the company's stock will be 3.5%, which is an attractive boost to shareholder returns. Check out our latest analysis for Principal Financial Group Principal Financial Group's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsWhile it is great to have a strong dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is sustainable. However, prior to this announcement, Principal Financial Group's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to fall by 52.9% over the next year. If the dividend continues along the path it has been on recently, we estimate the payout ratio could be 33%, which is comfortable for the company to continue in the future.historic-dividendPrincipal Financial Group Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $0.72, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $2.56. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 14% per annum over that time. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. It's encouraging to see that Principal Financial Group has been growing its earnings per share at 17% a year over the past five years. Principal Financial Group definitely has the potential to grow its dividend in the future with earnings on an uptrend and a low payout ratio.Principal Financial Group Looks Like A Great Dividend StockIn summary, it is good to see that the dividend is staying consistent, and we don't think there is any reason to suspect this might change over the medium term. The earnings easily cover the company's distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. We should point out that the earnings are expected to fall over the next 12 months, which won't be a problem if this doesn't become a trend, but could cause some turbulence in the next year. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Story continuesIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

The company continues to make needed investments to replace aging infrastructure, comply with water quality and environmental regulations and meet customers’ water and wastewater service needs. If approved, new rates reflecting these investments would not go into effect until February 2024.""This rate request provides for recovery of our investment from 2020 to present and seeks to facilitate future system investments into 2025,"" said Robert Burton, president of West Virginia American Water. ""The rates established in our last request did not recognize more than $48 million in system investments we had made by the time those rates took effect. Today’s filing seeks to remedy this investment recovery delay and to create long-term rate stability for our customers by accounting for the investment occurring throughout our water and wastewater systems.""Recognizing the needs of our most vulnerable customers, the company is proposing a new Low-Income Tariff as part of this filing. This expanded, four-tiered proposal will better tailor rates to different levels of household income. Under this expanded tariff, eligible households would receive monthly bill discounts of between 15 and 65 percent for water and wastewater service. In addition to the proposed tariff, the current Department of Health and Human Resources 20 percent discount program and other customer assistance programs would continue.""As a company, we believe that the service we provide must be safe, complying with all Environmental Protection Agency regulations and Safe Drinking Water Act standards; reliable, demonstrating resiliency in the face of adverse conditions; and affordable,"" continued Burton. ""With this in mind, we are pleased to expand our low-income options with our proposed tariff that will reduce rates for qualifying customers.""Story continuesIf West Virginia American Water’s proposed rates are approved as requested in today’s filing, the monthly water bill for the average residential customer using 3,000 gallons per month would increase approximately $15 per month after factoring in the current Distribution System Improvement Charge (DSIC) currently appearing on customer bills. The average residential wastewater bill of 3,000 gallons would increase approximately $19 per month. New rates will not take effect until February 2024, following a 300-day statutory review by the PSC.The PSC’s rate review process offers multiple opportunities for customer involvement. Customers can participate through written comments, attendance at public hearings, and consumer advocacy organizations that participate in the proceedings.

And for those interested in a more conservative approach in the near-term, considering low-beta stocks could be a beneficial strategy.Three top-ranked low-beta stocks – PepsiCo PEP, General Mills GIS, and Colgate-Palmolive CL – have all provided solid gains over the last three months, as we can see illustrated below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, all three reside in the Zacks Consumer Staples sector, an area that companies have been able to utilize their pricing power and deliver better-than-expected quarterly results.PepsiCoConsumer Staples titan PepsiCo posted strong quarterly results in its latest release just on April 25th, providing upbeat guidance and delivering a positive 9.5% EPS surprise. PEP’s top line results were also strong, with revenue growing 10% year-over-year.The market took the quarterly results in stride, with PEP shares finding plenty of buyers post-earnings and closing 2.5% higher.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUndoubtedly impressive, the company is a member of the elite Dividend Kings club, reflecting a commitment to increasingly rewarding shareholders with steady payouts. Currently, PEP’s dividend yields 2.4% annually, a few ticks below the Zacks Consumer Staples sector average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAnd for the cherry on top, the company is forecasted to continue grow steadily, with earnings estimated to climb 7% in its current fiscal year (FY23) and a further 8% in FY24. The projected earnings growth comes on the back of forecasted revenue growth of 4.5% in FY23 and 5% in FY24.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPricing power leading to strong quarterly results, a shareholder-friendly nature, and steady forecasted growth all make PEP a stock worthy of a watchlist spot.General MillsGeneral Mills reported its FY23 Q3 results back in late March. Results came in better-than-expected, with the company raising its FY23 guidance and delivering a beat on the top and bottom line partly thanks to pricing power.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs we can see in the chart below by the green arrow circled, investors cheered on the results.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchShares could appear a bit stretched from a valuation perspective, with the current 19.9X forward twelve-month earnings multiple sitting well above the 16.1X five-year median and a few ticks above the Zacks Consumer Staples sector average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAnd perhaps to the surprise of some, GIS shares have been visibly strong over the last five years, penciling in a sizable 150% gain and crushing the S&amp;P 500’s performance.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchColgate-PalmoliveColgate-Palmolive is a global leader in the oral care hygiene market. Analysts have pushed their earnings estimates higher across all timeframes as of late, indicating an optimistic near-term outlook.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLike most Consumer Staples stocks, CL rewards its shareholders via its dividend that currently yields 2.4% annually. While the yield is below the Zacks sector average, the company’s 2.6% five-year annualized dividend growth rate helps bridge the gap.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineWith a looming FOMC meeting and a schedule packed full of earnings, investors will have plenty to remain busy this week.And as we’ve all witnessed over the last year, FOMC meetings have regularly brought increased volatility into the market.Of course, we’ll have to wait for the final decision, but it remains likely for the Fed to raise rates a further 25bps.For those interested in a more conservative approach in the near-term, all three low-beta stocks above – PepsiCo PEP, General Mills GIS, and Colgate-Palmolive CL – would be great considerations.All three sport an improved earnings outlook and have recently provided better-than-expected results, with pricing power helping lead the way.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

535,47a1688c-cd42-3eb8-b106-aa63192cff08,PEP,2023-05-02,Wall Street Bulls Look Optimistic About PepsiCo (PEP): Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-bulls-look-optimistic-133001776.html,1682947801,STORY,['PEP'],"[The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about PepsiCo (PEP) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.PepsiCo currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.77, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 13 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.77 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 13 recommendations that derive the current ABR, eight are Strong Buy, representing 61.5% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for PEPBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for PEPCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for PepsiCo here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying PepsiCo, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is PEP a Good Investment?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for PepsiCo, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 1% over the past month to $7.29.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for PepsiCo. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for PepsiCo may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.Nick Baker, CoinDesk deputy editor-in-chiefBeing a Consensus newbie this year, I am like a small-town yokel blown away by how big and impressive this event has been. Here are a couple of my takeaways:One, the level of optimism people have about crypto is very high, which is a surprise given just how bad the regulatory outlook is. And I know it's partly self-selection bias at work: People who are going to pay a lot of money to attend this event are going to be optimistic about the space. Still, that juxtaposition of existential questions and lots of optimism is striking to me.Two, the people I know best are from traditional finance and they, too, remain quite high on the future of crypto and moving TradFi stuff to crypto or crypto-adjacent infrastructure. Now, of course, they’ve been trying for years to show progress along those lines and have little to show for it. But they’re undeterred. This point rhymes with my first point.Ben Schiller, head of Consensus MagazineSomething that really struck me arose from what Kate Brady, head of communications for Web3 at PepsiCo, said on stage. As you know, PepsiCo is a very mainstream American brand. It's not part of the crypto industry by any means, but it’s looking to get into Web3. And one of the things she said on stage was that she was being stymied in her work and PepsiCo has been stymied in its work by the lack of regulatory clarity, and I thought that was interesting because obviously this is something the industry says a lot that we need to do. There are guidelines from Washington, D.C., from lawmakers and from policymakers. And we think that that conversation or that that issue only affects people in the relatively small world of crypto.Read the full story here:Important eventsMicroStrategy World 2023Web Summit Rio 20238:30 a.m. HKT/SGT(12:30 a.m. UTC): Jibun Bank Manufacturing PMI (April)CoinDesk TVIn case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:Consensus 2023: SEC's Gensler Releases Another Video Dig at Crypto Industry; Yuga Labs CEO on Future of NFTsOn the third day of Consensus 2023, ""First Mover"" guests included a16z crypto head of policy Brian Quintenz, Yuga Labs CEO Daniel Alegre, Fidelity Digital Assets Research Analyst Jack Neureuter, and Blockchain Australia Chair Michael Bacina.HeadlinesMastercard Launches Crypto Credential Service for Cross-Border Transfers: The set of verification standards uses technology from CipherTrace, the well-known blockchain analytics platform Mastercard agreed to acquire in late 2021.DeFi Needs More Than ‘Synthetic High-Yield Products’: Dragonfly’s Haseeb Qureshi: The venture capitalist discusses non-ZIRP monetary policy, rebooting crypto’s market structure and why Ponzi bubbles always burst.Bitcoin Use Cases Are Seeing ‘Explosive Growth,' Trust Machines Says: ""Bitcoin is fun again because there's a place to build again,"" said Muneeb Ali, CEO of Trust Machines and co-founder of Stacks, on StageX at Consensus 2023.Bye-Bye Bitcoin Bear: No investor or financial advisor has a crystal ball that can predict the movement of an asset, including bitcoin, with total certainty.

(NASDAQ: REGN) today announced the presentation of new and updated data from its diverse oncology and hematology pipeline at the 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting, taking place from June 2-6 in Chicago, IL. Data presentations from 10 abstracts will include insights on four approved or investigational treatment regimens, showcasing the expanding potential of Regeneron’s portfolio and commitment to harnessing combination approaches to address the unmet need of patients with difficult-to-treat cancers.“Our clinical data at ASCO showcases our progress in addressing difficult-to-treat cancers with two foundational and synergistic approaches – PD-1 inhibition with Libtayo and our investigational bispecific antibodies,” said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., Co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron. “Notably, we look forward to sharing longer-term results for our BCMA-targeting bispecific linvoseltamab in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, as well as first-of-its-kind results for our LAG-3 inhibitor fianlimab in combination with Libtayo in advanced melanoma patients previously treated with adjuvant PD-1 therapy.”The new and updated data for linvoseltamab as well as fianlimab in combination with Libtayo will be featured in two oral presentations at ASCO. The linvoseltamab presentation will include more mature data from the pivotal Phase 2 trial in heavily pre-treated patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. The presentations on fianlimab in combination with Libtayo will provide safety and efficacy data from three independent confirmatory cohorts of advanced melanoma patients, along with a subgroup analysis including advanced melanoma patients who had received prior PD-1 adjuvant treatment and high-risk melanoma patient populations. Additional ASCO presentations will share updated clinical results for Libtayo as monotherapy for advanced stages of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer, and in advanced HPV16-positive oropharyngeal cancer.Story continuesRegeneron presentations at ASCO: MedicineAbstract titleAbstractLead AuthorPresentation date/time(all CET)Blood cancerLinvoseltamabLINKER-MM1 study: Linvoseltamab (REGN5458) in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma#8006Oral abstract session –Hematologic Malignancies – Plasma Cell DyscrasiaHans C.

Together, they provide us with unique combinatorial flexibility to develop potentially synergistic treatments for a wide range of solid tumors and blood cancers.If you are interested in learning more about our clinical trials, please contact us (clinicaltrials@regeneron.com or 844-734-6643) or visit our clinical trials website.About LibtayoLibtayo is a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1 on T cells and was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology. By binding to PD-1, Libtayo has been shown to block cancer cells from using the PD-1 pathway to suppress T-cell activation. In the U.S. and other countries, Libtayo is indicated in certain patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma (BCC), advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) and advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as well as in advanced cervical cancer in the European Union (EU), Canada and Brazil. As of July 1, 2022, Regeneron is responsible for the development and marketing of Libtayo globally.In the U.S., the generic name for Libtayo in its approved indications is cemiplimab-rwlc, with rwlc as the suffix designated in accordance with Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products Guidance for Industry issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Outside of the U.S. the generic name of Libtayo in its approved indications is cemiplimab.The extensive clinical program for Libtayo is focused on difficult-to-treat cancers. Libtayo is currently being investigated in trials as a monotherapy, as well as in combination with either conventional or novel therapeutic approaches for other solid tumors and blood cancers. These potential uses are investigational, and their safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. FDA-approved IndicationsLibtayo is a prescription medicine used to treat:People with a type of skin cancer called cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) that has spread or cannot be cured by surgery or radiation.People with a type of skin cancer called basal cell carcinoma (BCC) when your BCC cannot be removed by surgery (locally advanced BCC) or when it has spread (metastatic BCC) and have received treatment with hedgehog pathway inhibitor (HHI), or cannot receive treatment with a HHI.Adults with a type of lung cancer called NSCLC:Libtayo may be used in combination with chemotherapy that contains a platinum medicine as your first treatment when your lung cancer has not spread outside your chest (locally advanced lung cancer) and you cannot have surgery or chemotherapy with radiation, OR your lung cancer has spread to other areas of your body (metastatic lung cancer), AND your tumor does not have an abnormal “EGFR”, “ALK” or “ROS1” gene.Libtayo may be used alone as your first treatment when your lung cancer has not spread outside your chest (locally advanced lung cancer) and you cannot have surgery or chemotherapy with radiation, OR your lung cancer has spread to other areas of your body (metastatic lung cancer), AND your tumor tests positive for high ""PD-L1"", AND your tumor does not have an abnormal ""EGFR"", ""ALK ""or ""ROS1"" gene.It is not known if Libtayo is safe and effective in children.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR U.S. PATIENTSWhat is the most important information I should know about Libtayo?Libtayo is a medicine that may treat certain cancers by working with your immune system. Libtayo can cause your immune system to attack normal organs and tissues in any area of your body and can affect the way they work. These problems can sometimes become severe or life-threatening and can lead to death. You can have more than one of these problems at the same time. These problems may happen anytime during treatment or even after your treatment has ended.Call or see your healthcare provider right away if you develop any new or worsening signs or symptoms, including:Lung problems: cough, shortness of breath, or chest painIntestinal problems: diarrhea (loose stools) or more frequent bowel movements than usual, stools that are black, tarry, sticky or have blood or mucus, or severe stomach-area (abdomen) pain or tendernessLiver problems: yellowing of your skin or the whites of your eyes, severe nausea or vomiting, pain on the right side of your stomach area (abdomen), dark urine (tea colored), or bleeding or bruising more easily than normalHormone gland problems: headache that will not go away or unusual headaches, eye sensitivity to light, eye problems, rapid heartbeat, increased sweating, extreme tiredness, weight gain or weight loss, feeling more hungry or thirsty than usual, urinating more often than usual, hair loss, feeling cold, constipation, your voice gets deeper, dizziness or fainting, or changes in mood or behavior, such as decreased sex drive, irritability, or forgetfulnessKidney problems: decrease in your amount of urine, blood in your urine, swelling of your ankles, or loss of appetiteSkin problems: rash, itching, skin blistering or peeling, painful sores or ulcers in mouth or nose, throat, or genital area, fever or flu-like symptoms, or swollen lymph nodesProblems can also happen in other organs and tissues.

REGN is scheduled to release first-quarter 2023 results on May 4, before the opening bell.The company has an impressive track record, beating on earnings in all the past four quarters. In the last reported quarter, it beat earnings expectations by 29.75%. It surpassed earnings estimates by 20.44%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseRegeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. QuoteWhat Our Model PredictsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Regeneron this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP for REGN is +4.41% as the Zacks Consensus Estimate currently stands at $9.25 per share and the Most Accurate Estimate is currently pegged at $9.66. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Factors at PlayA major chunk of Regeneron’s revenues comes from the sales of its lead drug, Eylea, which is approved for various ophthalmology indications (neovascular age-related macular degeneration, diabetic macular edema and macular edema, among others). Eylea was developed in collaboration with Bayer AG.Regeneron records net product sales of Eylea in the United States, while Bayer records net product sales of the drug outside the country. Regeneron also records its share of profits/losses in connection with sales of Eylea outside the United States.Eylea's sales have been strong and it has maintained momentum for the company in the past few quarters. However, sales were negatively impacted in the fourth quarter due to a short-term shift to off-label use of Avastin, a temporary closing in the fourth quarter of 2022 of a not-for-profit fund that provides patient co-pay assistance and an increase in sales-related deductions. Regeneron stated that it has substantially recovered from the issue in the fourth quarter, but Eylea’s sales in the first quarter have most likely faced competitive pressure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Eylea’s sales in the United States is pegged at $1.52 billion.Story continuesApart from Eylea, investors will focus on the asthma drug Dupixent’s performance, sales of which are recorded by Sanofi SNY. Regeneron has a collaboration agreement with Sanofi for drugs like Dupixent and Kevzara. While Sanofi records sales, Regeneron records its share of profits/losses in connection with global sales of Dupixent and Kevzara. Profits from Dupixent sales have been REGN’s primary growth driver in the last few quarters.Sales of Dupixent were up 39.7% in the first quarter, as recorded by Sanofi and hence Regeneron is likely to have recorded incremental profits in the yet-to-be-reported quarter. Dupixent has maintained its stellar performance, driven by continued strong demand in the approved indications, atopic dermatitis (AD), asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), eosinophilic esophagitis and prurigo nodularis. The label expansion of the drug in the past few months has boosted sales further and is likely to have resulted in incremental revenues for Regeneron in the first quarter.Investors will focus on the performance of Libtayo and the PCSK9 inhibitor Praluent. Effective Jul 1, 2022, Regeneron records net product sales of Libtayo and will pay Sanofi a royalty on such sales. Increased sales of Libtayo on-label expansions have most likely boosted the top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Libtayo’s sales is pegged at $166 million.Regeneron records net product sales of Praluent in the United States. Sanofi records net product sales of the drug outside the United States and pays Regeneron a royalty on such sales. Total sales in the previous quarter witnessed a 30% increase. However, it’s mostly unlikely for the first quarter to have recorded such growth.In January 2022, the FDA revised the authorizations for a few monoclonal antibody treatments, including Regeneron’s REGEN-COV (casirivimab and imdevimab), as data indicated that these treatments are highly unlikely to be active against the Omicron variant. REGEN-COV is a cocktail of two monoclonal antibodies (casirivimab and imdevimab, also known as REGN10933 and REGN10987, respectively). Therefore, REGEN-COV is currently unauthorized for use in U.S. states, territories or jurisdictions. Hence, this revision dented sales in 2022 from this stream and sales are likely to be negligible in the first quarter.Recent UpdatesIn March 2023, the FDA approved Evzeeka (evinacumab-dgnb) as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering therapies to treat children aged 5 to 11 with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH). The approval extends Evkeeza to children aged 5 to 11 with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), an inherited condition characterized by extremely high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).The European Commission (EC) approved Libtayo (cemiplimab) in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy for first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with ≥1% PD-L1 expression.Share Price PerformanceRegeneron’s shares have gained 11.1% in the year so far against the industry’s decline of 6.2%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOther Stocks to ConsiderHere are some more drug/biotech stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this season.Akero Therapeutics AKRO has an Earnings ESP of +6.45% and a Zacks Rank #2.

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 81% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Union Pacific. Check out our latest analysis for Union Pacific ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Union Pacific?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Union Pacific does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Union Pacific, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Union Pacific. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.9% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 6.9% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.5% of the company stock.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Union PacificThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Union Pacific Corporation in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$232m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 19% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Union Pacific. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company.

544,d904b8ff-2440-3871-86c2-f1ffd2aee3bd,AMP,2023-05-02,Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP) Could Be A Buy For Its Upcoming Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ameriprise-financial-nyse-amp-could-121642964.html,1682857002,STORY,['AMP'],"[Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE:AMP) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. In other words, investors can purchase Ameriprise Financial's shares before the 5th of May in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 19th of May.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.35 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$5.40 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Ameriprise Financial stock has a trailing yield of around 1.8% on the current share price of $305.12. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. See our latest analysis for Ameriprise Financial If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Ameriprise Financial paid out a comfortable 26% of its profit last year.Companies that pay out less in dividends than they earn in profits generally have more sustainable dividends. The lower the payout ratio, the more wiggle room the business has before it could be forced to cut the dividend.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. For this reason, we're glad to see Ameriprise Financial's earnings per share have risen 16% per annum over the last five years.Story continuesThe main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Ameriprise Financial has delivered an average of 14% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. It's exciting to see that both earnings and dividends per share have grown rapidly over the past few years.The Bottom LineShould investors buy Ameriprise Financial for the upcoming dividend? Companies like Ameriprise Financial that are growing rapidly and paying out a low fraction of earnings, are usually reinvesting heavily in their business. This is one of the most attractive investment combinations under this analysis, as it can create substantial value for investors over the long run. We think this is a pretty attractive combination, and would be interested in investigating Ameriprise Financial more closely.In light of that, while Ameriprise Financial has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for Ameriprise Financial you should be aware of.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see. Here's a curated list of interesting stocks that are strong dividend payers.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

Dr Hope will discuss how climate data reveals the human influence on our extreme weather and share her passion for climate knowledge, the outdoors and her expertise in climate models.Starting outI studied science and mathematics at school and university. The options were wide - I could study biology, physics, chemistry, psychology - and I did. I was interested in how our bodies worked, so I majored in physiology. Still, something was missing. I missed maths. So the next year, I also majored in applied mathematics. And I discovered maths that could be applied to the real world - how fluid flows, and long equations that could describe our weather.During my Honours year my supervisor introduced me to the world of climate studies - how can we integrate weather systems together to reveal underlying patterns over the whole Southern Hemisphere? What did those patterns look like in the 1950s? What do they look like now? The study required huge amounts of data from weather stations, and statistics and coding. My Honours thesis was titled ""Variability of the Southern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation"", and my Ph.D in 2005 was titled ""The weather and climate of Australia at the Last Glacial Maximum"".Story continuesCodingIn first year University we all learnt Fortran. And everyone failed the test. I was astonished that everyone (including me) just didn't ""get it"". But somehow over time, as I used coding in my assignments and for my Honours research project, something clicked. Then I couldn't understand how anyone could not ""get it"". It was just there, as obvious as reading.Years later, I was reminded of my process of learning coding as I watched my children learn to read. At first it was impenetrable. Then, they just ""got it"".When I reflect on the skills I've used to do what I do, I wonder how these will change over the coming years?Early careerI loved thinking of ways to code up solutions to novel questions, interrogating data to explore the signals that we might draw from it. Really figuring out what was going on by combining those answers with my understanding of weather systems and the large-scale transfer of heat from the tropics to the poles.In my first job after university undergraduate studies, I was given the opportunity to play with a general circulation model - otherwise known as a global climate model. It was a huge computer program that created weather by solving the equations of motion of air around the globe, and parameterising processes like clouds and rainfall. Fun things I did included:Doubling the number of vertical levels up through the atmosphere (and crashed the model - clouds are tricky!).Adding a dune-building module to compare with the fixed dunes of Australia, which are indicators of past winds.Adding an enormous permanent lake into the arid centre of Australia.Blocking evaporation over parts of the ocean to see where our rain derived its water from.Altering the temperature gradients across the tropical Pacific Ocean and moved the winds over Australia north or south.Trying to grab as many nodes on the university's supercomputer as I could. Sometimes at 2 o'clock in the morning.Building my passionAs fun as it is to ""play"" in a virtual world, I began to realise that my work had real-world applications in the here and now. Results from my work could help guide policy and make Australia a better place.When I started work at the Bureau of Meteorology, I was very keen to be part of an operational institution, working with real-life people who had real-life concerns - like running out of water. I worked closely with government departments across southern Australia - where a drying signal emerged in the late 1960s in the west and the late 1990s in the east - to help them understand why, and whether the wet years would return.RecognitionAlong the way, I have been recognized for my efforts - usually as a part of a much larger group. As an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) author, IPCC was the co-laureate of the 2022 Gulbenkian Prize for Humanity. Also, the Victorian Climate Initiative received the Australian Water Association Research Innovation Award (Victoria) in 2019, where I was a key lead.I received a Bureau of Meteorology Australia Day Achievement Medallion in 2018 for outstanding leadership of major projects and representation of the Bureau and Australia at significant national and international forums. And I also received a Bureau of Meteorology Community Award - Positive Working Culture, State of the Climate co-editor 2016.Interacting with other people in the climate and weather community was a big part of my education - I was a Committee Member for ""Women in Australian Weather and Climate Research"" from 2013 to 2019. And Chair of Melbourne Centre of Australian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society (AMOS) and Member of AMOS National Council from 2003 to 2005 - despite one member saying I couldn't be, because I was too young. I initiated and edited the AMOS policy on global warming during that time.NowI now work as a Principal Climate Scientist at The Bureau of Meteorology in Australia, which provides daily weather forecasts and multi-week to seasonal forecasts every two days. For research, we have access to major super-computing infrastructures where we can run global forecast experiments to understand the impacts of climate change on extreme weather events.Working with the IPCC, I trust that my sharing of how we can quantify the human influence on climate trends and extremes will continue to help guide policy on the world stage and make the world a better place.View original content here.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-inc Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/752321/Playing-With-the-Earth-One-Womans-Journey-to-Becoming-a-Climate-Scientist]"

Cisco Systems (CSCO), which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Networking industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This seller of routers, switches, software and services has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 2.35%.For the last reported quarter, Cisco came out with earnings of $0.88 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.86 per share, representing a surprise of 2.33%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.84 per share and it actually produced earnings of $0.86 per share, delivering a surprise of 2.38%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor Cisco, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Cisco currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.59%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on May 17, 2023.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.
