Here are three banks that can make solid additions to your portfolio today.', ""Citigroup (NYSE: C) is one of the United States' largest banks, holding nearly $1.7 trillion in assets. But despite its size and scale, it has failed to keep pace with its larger peers. Citigroup's sprawling global business has proven to be a headache, making it difficult to analyze and manage risks. As a result, the bank has underperformed its peers in profitability measures like return on equity (ROE)."", ""In 2021, Jane Fraser became Citigroup's CEO. Upon assuming the top role, Fraser laid out plans to boost the bank's operating efficiency and profitability. To achieve this, Citigroup announced it would wind down or sell 14 consumer franchises, including its profitable business in Mexico. It would also reduce its workforce and flatten its management structure, eliminating 300 senior management roles."", 'Citigroup has historically underperformed, which is a big reason why it trades at a 29% discount to its tangible book value. In comparison, peers Bank of America and Wells Fargo trade at a 47% and 62% premium to tangible book value.', ""Citigroup's restructuring is well underway. In March, it had sold or wound down 9 of its 14 consumer franchises. It also said its Mexico consumer business was on track for a planned initial public offering (IPO) by 2025. Citigroup continues to make progress, and a cheap valuation makes it an appealing opportunity for value-focused investors today."", 'When interest rates began rising two years ago, volatile market conditions put a lid on one of the hottest IPO markets ever.

However, green shoots are emerging, which could be a good sign for Goldman and its investment banking heavy business.', 'In the first quarter, Goldman saw its investment banking fees grow 32% from last year, thanks to strong growth across its advisory (mergers and acquisitions), equity underwriting (IPOs), and debt underwriting segments. CEO David Solomon told investors that large IPOs, including Reddit, were well received and showed an increased appetite for risk from investors.', 'Solomon also sees improving conditions for debt issuance and financing for acquisitions and expects ""solid levels of debt underwriting activity to continue this year.""

One key part of its performance is its reliance on low-cost deposits. This has magnified Schwab's strong performance over the past decade and a half, but it has also posed a problem during times of rising interest rates."", 'Because Schwab relies heavily on low-cost deposits, its business feels it when those deposits are moved into higher interest-earning assets, which it calls ""client cash sorting."" Its cash sorting problem was pronounced in 2022 during the Federal Reserve\'s aggressive interest rate hiking campaign.', ""From August 2022 through April 2023, Schwab's total bank account deposits fell by 32% as clients moved their cash into higher-yielding alternatives. As a result, the company had to tap available lending facilities, such as the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB), to ensure it had enough capital and prevent a liquidity problem for the bank."", 'Schwab is now paying down some of those higher-cost debt arrangements and has seen its deposit outflows slow to a much more manageable pace.', ""It should also benefit from falling interest rates.

Maybe too high. Several leading microchip and semiconductor stocks have taken big hits recently after they posted first-quarter financial results that beat Wall Street expectations but still managed to disappoint investors who have come to anticipate meteoric growth from the sector. Fueled by demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips, semiconductor stocks have been red hot over the last 18 months. Now it seems that a cooldown period is taking place. This makes it a great time to go after these must-buy semiconductor stocks.', 'The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH) declined nearly 10% in April after running up 75% during 2023. Much of the growth has been led by semiconductor giant Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) which currently produces about three-quarters of the world’s AI chips. Other names also joined the rally and rose at lightning fast speed over the past year.

However, despite the miss, Super Micro Computer’s revenue was up 200% in Q1 from a year earlier.', 'For all of this year, the company is forecasting revenue growth of nearly 600%.

Like Super Micro Computer, Advanced Micro Devices’ long-term growth story remains solid. As part of its Q1 results, AMD said that revenue at its Data Center unit grew 80% year over year to $2.3 billion due to strong sales of its latest MI300 series AI microchips. The company has sold more than $1 billion of the AI chips since they launched late in 2023.

Since bottoming last Halloween, the legacy semiconductor company’s stock has risen 25%. It’s a big reversal for TXN stock, which has long been a laggard among chipmakers. Texas Instruments got a further boost after the company issued better-than-expected financial results for this year’s first quarter, sending its share price up 7% in a day. Texas Instruments reported earnings per share $1.20, which topped Wall Street forecasts of $1.07.', 'Revenue during the first three months of the year totaled $3.66 billion, ahead of analyst estimates of $3.60 billion. Looking forward, Texas Instruments said it expects Q2 revenue of $3.65 billion to $3.95 billion and profits of $1.05 to $1.25 per share. The company’s Q2 guidance aligned with Wall Street forecasts.

Its share price is already up an impressive 113% in the last twelve months. It's also good to see the share price up 23% over the last quarter. This could be related to the recent financial results, released recently - you can catch up on the most recent data by reading our company report. The longer term returns have not been as good, with the stock price only 4.9% higher than it was three years ago."", ""Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Western Digital ', ""Western Digital isn't currently profitable, so most analysts would look to revenue growth to get an idea of how fast the underlying business is growing.

So we would not have expected the share price to rise 113%. This is a good example of how buyers can push up prices even before the fundamental metrics show much growth. It's quite likely the revenue fall was already priced in, anyway."", 'You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).', 'Western Digital is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth.

14,817fa029-6695-332f-a79f-f7b3b853a115,WMT,2024-05-08,Insiders reveal why Walmart pulled the plug on Sam Walton’s dream to ’get the hospitals and doctors in line’,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insiders-reveal-why-walmart-pulled-172525559.html,1715102725,STORY,['WMT'],"['“They’re skinnin’ us alive.”', 'That was Sam Walton in 1991, a year before the Walmart founder and capitalist king of rural America succumbed to cancer.', 'In a room full of Walmart employees gathered for a regular Saturday morning leadership meeting, Walton made an impassioned plea for his company to use its size and power to rein in medical costs. Walton had recently discovered how much a hospital was marking up the imaging exam he had just undergone and the contrast injected into his veins, and he was furious about it.', '“We’ve got to get the hospitals and doctors in line,” he told the audience of Walmart employees. “We’ve got to get those charges under control.”', '“And if we don’t get it done this year,” he added. “I’m gonna get real upset. I mean real upset.”', 'Walton’s company didn’t hit his goal but, for the better part of the past two decades, different Walmart leaders have been trying, albeit with varying levels of commitment and investment. They launched a series of initiatives aimed at providing more affordable and convenient medical care to Walmart customers, either right from within Walmart stores or at nearby company-run clinics.', 'All along, and especially in recent years, the experiments were cheered on, if not encouraged, by members of the Walton family—Sam’s daughter, Alice, chief among them.', 'But last week, the company announced that it was shuttering its latest attempt to see through a version of Walton’s vision: Walmart Health, a chain of 51 clinics—health care supercenters if you will—that offered medical and dental appointments, plus X-rays and lab work, all under the same roof. Walmart also said it was shutting down its virtual medical service, which it had spun up after acquiring a stand-alone telehealth company in 2021.', 'While the company blamed “a challenging reimbursement environment and escalating operating costs” as reasons for pulling the plug on Walmart Health, the reality was likely more complicated, as the five-year experiment was also plagued by leadership turnover and at times internal politics, according to multiple sources familiar with its operations. It also faced a miscalculation of how many patients would be willing to pay in cash.', 'At the same time, no matter the full cocktail of ingredients responsible for Walmart Health’s demise, important questions remain: If this Fortune 500 company couldn’t find a successful model to make health care cheaper and more transparent, despite many years and significant investments, who can? Or, like its retail sector rival Amazon, will Walmart end up making a splashy multibillion-dollar acquisition to resurrect Sam’s vision and give it one more go?', 'In the early 2000s, Walmart cycled through several iterations of partnerships that saw third-party health care companies operate urgent-care–type practices within Walmart Supercenter stores, but the economics of those facilities were difficult to overcome.', '“The money is in chronic illness,” Marcus Osborne, a former Walmart Health executive, told me in my book, Winner Sells All. “A diabetic who comes back every month makes you more money than somebody who has strep throat once a year.”', 'A decade later, in 2014, there was a renewed effort when Walmart created and ran its own medical facilities inside its stores for the first time. Dubbed Care Clinics, these medical offices were run by nurse practitioners. They were designed at first to bring more affordable care closer to Walmart employees in health care–starved communities from Texas to Georgia where residents were often likely to hold off on regular doctor visits until a more serious issue sent them to an emergency room and an often costly hospital stay.', 'That model began by offering visits to Walmart employees for just $4, thanks to the belief that the Care Clinic would get internal credit for the cost savings that Walmart’s benefits division experienced from a decrease in hospital visits by Walmart employees. But former Walmart U.S. CEO Greg Foran disregarded those savings, instead pushing the clinics to hit profitability on their own. So the clinics felt forced to pursue relationships with insurance providers that eliminated the low-cost differentiator that Walmart hoped would serve as the main attraction to prospective patients. Walmart called it quits on the idea after just 19 openings.', 'But under current Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, the company took one more shot. In 2019, with\xa0a strong push from the Walton family, Walmart surveyed its customers and found that more than 40% of them saw the cost of care as the biggest impediment to seeking treatment. At the time, conversations around health care disruption were popular at CEO circuit events such as Davos.', '“I think he was partially influenced by the family, who had started to get more interested and … believed there was opportunity,” Osborne said of McMillon in Winner Sells All. “But I also think he was being influenced by his peers.”', 'That same year, Walmart unveiled Walmart Health facilities, which it pitched as “the first to put primary and urgent care, labs, X-ray and diagnostics, counseling, dental, optical, and hearing services all in one facility.”', 'These mini-supercenters of medical care promised transparent and affordable pricing, just as Walton had requested at the Saturday morning meeting nearly 30 years before. Walmart Health focused its initial pitch on the affordability of its services for those without good insurance; doctor visits would cost $40 and dental appointments $50. But it didn’t take long for fissures in the model to emerge.', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNs6cDUKl7Y', 'Karissa Price, Walmart Health’s former VP of marketing, told Fortune that it quickly became clear in some Walmart Health communities that there weren’t enough prospective patients who would want to pay in cash, which she says was supposed to be the backbone of how Walmart differentiated its model: charge low prices in cash to those without quality health insurance and eventually make up the difference in volume.', 'Price pointed to a Walmart Health opening in Chicago in the fall of 2020. She said it quickly became clear that the clinic wasn’t going to hit its appointment goals, in part because so many people in the community turned out to be on Medicaid. Unlike with Walmart Health’s first openings in Georgia, where deep market research was done on the pool of residents who might pay in cash, the same wasn’t true for the Chicago location, according to Price. The reason? Walmart CEO Doug McMillon wanted to quickly open a facility there to support a community that had been ravaged by unrest in the wake of George Floyd’s murder.', 'Price agreed with the CEO’s move, but said that the launch marked one of the first proof points that the cash model wasn’t going to work for Walmart Health facilities across the board. Walmart spokesperson Marilee McInnis told Fortune in a statement that the “main goal in opening a Chicago Walmart Health center was to try and serve a community in need,” and that “timing for the opening of the center was business and community driven.” McInnis added that Walmart Health clinics also accept some insurance, but Price told Fortune that Medicaid or Medicare were not accepted on day one.', 'From there, executive turnover should have been another sign that things weren’t going as planned. First, Walmart Health’s initial leader and main architect, Sean Slovenski, departed only a year after launch. Speaking a month later, he cited the challenge of Walmart’s bigness: “I’m not a big-company animal,” he said. “As soon as I get to the point where bureaucracy is the rule of the day … I stop doing well in that environment.”', 'It was not uncommon for Walmart Health leaders to spend many hours in retail leadership meetings that had little impact on the health care business.', 'Next, Walmart hired Dr. Cheryl Pegus, a former cardiologist who held chief medical officer roles at Walgreens and the insurance company Cambia Health Solutions. When I interviewed Doug McMillon for Winner Sells All in early 2022, he was confident that Walmart had found its leadership answer in Pegus.', '“She’s able to articulate a plan in a way that feels more understandable and complete to us,” he said.', 'But eight months later, Pegus was gone herself, leaving for a new health unit at JPMorgan Chase.', '“Walmart Health’s biggest threat is Walmart,” Osborne, the former Walmart Health leader, said in Winner Sells All, citing the revolving door of health executives and what he believed was “wildly inconsistent commitment” from top Walmart leaders.', 'Walmart eventually replaced Pegus with her division’s CFO, Brian Setzer, a former longtime health insurance executive. Under his leadership, Walmart had announced plans to open a total of 75 Walmart Health clinics by the end of 2024, but never surpassed 51. Still, Walmart isn’t alone among U.S. mass retailers struggling with health care pursuits. Walgreens, for example, announced recently that it was closing 160 locations of VillageMD, the primary care operator in which it owns a majority stake. The drugstore chain also announced a $5.8 billion write-down related to VillageMD. (Walmart still operates more than 4,000 pharmacies in its stores, as well as 3,000 vision centers, where customers can get an eye exam and shop for glasses.)', 'Christina Farr, a health care investor and author of the Second Opinion newsletter, said that while some industry observers may choose to focus on Walmart’s failure, she’s more concerned with what it says about how entrenched incumbents are in the U.S. health care system despite rising costs and medical care outcomes that trail those of other countries.', '“No one is truly acting in the best interest of the patient right now,” Farr told Fortune. “I’m not happy about this news.”', 'Price, the former Walmart Health marketing chief, said her first reaction to hearing the news was sadness.', '“There was so much opportunity to bring access to affordable health care to rural and underserved America,” she told Fortune, “and it’s gone.”', 'It is now. But for good? That’s one outstanding question. One source familiar with Walmart Health’s operations said they’d be shocked if this is the last we hear of Walmart’s ambitions in medical care. Rather, Walmart could pursue one or more acquisitions to make an impact in health care like its retail rival Amazon did when it acquired One Medical, an operator of primary care offices and telehealth services, for nearly $4 billion in 2023.', 'Last year, for example, Walmart considered purchasing a majority stake in the seniors-focused primary care chain ChenMed. Walmart had also looked at a deal for Oak Street, another primary care chain that CVS spent more than $10 billion to acquire, according to the former marketing leader Price.', '“The idea that Walmart is just going to give up,” the source familiar with Walmart Health’s operations said, “and not fire a missile equivalent to One Medical, seems impossible to me.”', 'Until then, one of Sam Walton’s last goals remains unfulfilled.', 'Are you a current or former Walmart employee with thoughts on this topic or a tip to share?

The Fed maintained the federal funds rate at 5.25% to 5.5% and said that while the economic activity has been solid, with robust consumer spending and job gains, inflation remains a concern. The unemployment rate remains low at 3.8%, but the GDP growth moderated from 3.4% in the fourth quarter of 2023 to 1.6% in the first quarter of 2024. The market remained strong after the Fed meeting as the S&P 500 was 2.21% higher between May 1 and May 3 market close."", 'Billionaire Leon Cooperman of Omega Advisors believes that the current US debt levels could be too high to manage. He expressed concern about the growing debt crisis in the United States in a CNBC interview on April 23, adding that leadership has failed to address it effectively. Cooperman referenced past endorsements of the Simpson-Bowles report by political figures like Mitt Romney and Senator Joe Manchin, emphasizing that the problem has only worsened since then. He believes that deficits do matter and warns that the country is heading towards a financial crisis due to the lack of action on this issue.', ""The Simpson-Bowles report refers to the recommendations put forward by the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform in 2010 to address the United States' fiscal challenges. The growing debt problem was one of the main concerns of the commission, and their report proposed a comprehensive set of measures to reduce the deficit through a combination of spending cuts, tax reforms, and changes to entitlement programs."", 'If we take Leon Cooperman’s warnings into consideration, investors are more likely to favor defensive sectors like consumer defensive, health care, and utilities. Major companies from these sectors thrived during the financial crisis of 2007-2009. During that crisis, the S&P 500 lost over 56% of its value. On the other hand, between the start of 2007 and the end of 2009, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) share price gained nearly 13%. Moreover, the healthcare company, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) was nearly 14.7% higher during the same period.', 'Walmart Inc.

Furthermore, the company has been increasing its dividends for 52 years and has a dividend yield of 1.39%, as of May 3. At its latest earnings call, Walmart Inc.’s (NYSE:WMT) CEO, Doug McMillon made the following comments:', '“We were strong in the U.S., Mexico, Canada, and India, where we had the best Big Billion Days ever, and we continued the strong performance in China with the start of Chinese New Year. Typically, we see some of our customer experience scores dip during the high-volume hours and days we experience during the holidays. But during Q4, the Walmart U.S. team delivered three-year high customer scores in our stores for pickup and delivery from stores and for those orders that flow directly from our e-commerce fulfillment centers.', ""I'm excited about the omnichannel net promoter score trends the team is driving. Across countries, we continue to see a customer that's resilient but looking for value.

His sentence was handed down in federal court by U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee, who also ordered Sibella to pay a fine of $9,500, plus a $100 special assessment.', 'Gee said Sibella “turned a blind eye” to behavior he knew was potentially illegal. But in deciding against prison time, Gee said she took into consideration that Sibella fully cooperated with investigators and had no previous criminal history.', 'Before the sentencing, Sibella apologized to his family, friends and former employers. He told the judge, “You will never see me in your court again.”', 'Sibella had faced up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. His attorneys had asked the judge to consider probation. They submitted more than 80 testimonial letters of support, including one from Clark County Sheriff Kevin McMahill, the elected head of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.', 'The MGM Grand and nearby Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas previously settled a related case stemming from a U.S. Justice Department money laundering probe. The resorts agreed to pay a combined $7.45 million, submit to an external review and step up their anti-money laundering compliance programs.', 'Separately, Nevada casino regulators are considering revoking or suspending Sibella’s state gambling license and fining him up to $750,000.

If we know, we can’t allow them to gamble. I didn’t ask, I didn’t want to know I guess because he wasn’t doing anything to cheat the casino.”', ""In a written statement provided by his attorneys after Wednesday's sentencing, Sibella said he takes full responsibility for his actions and reiterated that he “gained no benefit — neither personal, professional or financial,” from his crime."", 'Sibella was president and chief operating officer of the MGM Grand for eight years and then president of Resorts World Las Vegas until 2023.', 'His sentencing comes as the Justice Department undertakes a wide-ranging investigation into illegal sports gambling operations in Southern California laundering money through Las Vegas casinos. The most notable case involves Ippei Mizuhara, Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani’s former interpreter. Federal prosecutors say Mizuhara transferred money he stole from the Japanese superstar in a scheme to pay off debts to illegal bookmakers.', 'Sibella held top executive positions at The Mirage and Treasure Island casinos on the Las Vegas Strip before becoming president of the more than 6,800-room MGM Grand in 2011.

Eric, you may begin.', 'James Eric Bjornholt', ""Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.In attendance with me today are Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and CEO; Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Executive Chair; Rich Simoncic, Microchip's COO; and Sajid Daudi, Microchip's Head of Investor Relations. I will comment on our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2024 financial performance, Ganesh will then provide commentary on our results and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance, and Steve will provide an update on our cash return strategy. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.We are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, and included reconciliation information in our earnings press release, which we believe you will find useful when comparing our GAAP and non-GAAP results. We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and our leverage metrics on our website.I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. Other than net sales, I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis which is based on expenses prior to the effects of our acquisition activities, share-based compensation and certain other adjustments as described in our earnings press release and in the reconciliations on our website.Net sales in the March quarter were $1.326 billion, which was down 24.9% sequentially. We have posted a summary of our net sales by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 60.3%, including capacity underutilization charges of $32 million, operating expenses were at 27.4% and operating income was 32.9%. Although our operating income was better than the midpoint of our guidance, our cash taxes came in higher than forecasted. Non-GAAP net income was $310.3 million, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.57 and at the midpoint of our guidance.On a GAAP basis, in the March quarter, gross margins were 59.6%. Total operating expenses were $536.4 million and included acquisition intangible amortization of $151.2 million, special income of $16.9 million, which was primarily driven by the settlement of an unclaimed property audit at a value that was less than what we had accrued for. Share-based compensation of $37.4 million and $1.1 million of other expenses. GAAP net income was $154.7 million, resulting in $0.28 in diluted earnings per share.For fiscal 2024, net sales were $7.634 billion and were down 9.5% from net sales in fiscal year 2023. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 65.8%, operating expenses were 22% of sales and operating income was 43.9% of sales. Non-GAAP net income was $2.698 billion, and EPS was $4.92 per diluted share.On a GAAP basis, gross margins were 65.4%, operating expenses were 31.8% of sales and operating income was 33.7% of sales. Net income was $1.907 billion, EPS was $3.48 per diluted share.Our non-GAAP cash tax rate was 18.8% in the March quarter and 14.5% for fiscal year 2024. Our non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal year 2025 is expected to be about 13%, which is exclusive of the transition tax and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years. We are still hopeful that the tax rules requiring companies to capitalize R&D expenses will be pushed out or repealed. If this were to happen, we would anticipate about a 200 basis point favorable adjustment to Microchip's non-GAAP tax rate in future periods.Our inventory balance at March 31, 2024, was $1.316 billion. We had 224 days of inventory at the end of the March quarter, which was up 39 days from the prior quarter's level and in line with our expectations given the difficult revenue quarter we experienced. At the midpoint of our June 2024 quarter guidance, we would expect inventory dollars to be up modestly and days of inventory to increase based on the lower cost of goods sold driven by the depressed revenue levels at which we believe is the low point of the current cycle for Microchip.We also continue to invest in building inventory for long-lived, high-margin products whose manufacturing capacity is being end of life by our supply chain partners and these last time buys represented 14 days of inventory at the end of March. Inventory at our distributors in the March quarter were at 41 days, which was up 4 days from the prior quarter's level. Distribution took down their inventory in the March quarter as distribution sell-through was about $125 million higher than distribution sell in. The inventory days increased as this is reflective of the much lower cost of sales for Microchip in the March quarter that is used in this calculation.Our cash flow from operating activities was $430 million in the March quarter. Our adjusted free cash flow was $389.9 million in the March quarter. As of March 31, our consolidated cash and total investment position was $319.7 million. Our total debt increased by $312 million in the March quarter, our net debt increased by $273.3 million.Our adjusted EBITDA in the March quarter was $503 million and 37.9% of sales. Our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was $3.623 billion, and our net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 1.57 at March 31, 2024, up from 1.45 at March 31, 2023. Capital expenditures were $40.1 million in the March quarter and $285.1 million for fiscal year 2024. Our expectation for capital expenditures for fiscal year 2025 is about $175 million. Depreciation expense in the March quarter was $45.8 million.I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the March quarter as well as our guidance for the June quarter. Ganesh?"", 'Ganesh Moorthy', ""Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon everyone. Our March quarter results were consistent with our guidance, with net sales down 24.9% sequentially and down 40.6% from the year ago quarter as we endured through a major inventory correction. Non-GAAP gross margin came in as expected at 60.3% and non-GAAP operating margin was better than expected, 32.9% due to the strong expense control programs we had in place. However, as Eric mentioned, our tax rate was higher than expected, and as a result, our consolidated non-GAAP diluted EPS only met expectations at $0.57 per share.Our revenue decline resulted in March quarter EBITDA dropping. And as a result, our net leverage ratio rose to 1.57x. We expect our net leverage to rise modestly for a few quarters as trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA drops when replacing stronger prior year quarters with weaker current year quarters. However, our cash generation capability remains strong, and we are committed to our capital return plan.Our capital return to shareholders in the June quarter will increase to 87.5% of our March quarter adjusted free cash flow as we continue on our path to return 100% of our adjusted free cash flow to shareholders by the March quarter of calendar year 2025.Reflecting on our fiscal year '24 results, it was a roller coaster year with a positive start that was followed by a major inventory correction. As compared to fiscal year '23, revenue declined 9.5% to $7.6 billion. Non-GAAP operating margin was resilient at 43.9% as we took the actions required to respond to the major inventory correction. Capital return to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buybacks in fiscal '24 was $1.89 billion, representing a 15.4% growth as compared to fiscal year '23.My thanks to our worldwide team for their support, hard work and diligence as we navigated a difficult environment and focus on actions that we believe position us well to thrive in the long term.Taking a look at our fiscal year '24 net sales from a product line perspective, our Mixed-Signal Microcontroller net sales were down 10.2% and represented 56% of Microchip's overall revenue. Our Analog net sales were down 15.2% and represented 26.4% of Microchip's overall revenue. While we don't normally break out our FPGA product line results, it is noteworthy that our fiscal year '24 FPGA revenue exceeded $670 million and set another record. FPGA revenue grew over 22% as compared to fiscal '23 and delivered operating margins of north of corporate average. We deliver market-leading mid-range FPGA solutions with best-in-class low power, reliability and security and are especially well suited for the fast emerging opportunities around artificial intelligence at the edge. Our overall FPGA design win momentum is strong across multiple end markets.A few other product line notes are significant. Early in April, we closed our acquisition of Seoul, Korea-based VSI and ADAS and digital cockpit connectivity pioneer to extend our automotive networking market leadership. This acquisition adds automotive SerDes Alliance Motion Link technology, otherwise known as ASA-ML to Microchip's broad Ethernet and PCIe automotive networking portfolio to enable next-generation software-defined vehicles.With the anticipated increase in the adoption of advanced camera-based driver assistance systems, in-cabin monitoring, safety and convenience features and multiscreen digital cockpits for next-generation software-defined vehicles, there is a growing requirement for a more highly asymmetric raw data and video links and higher bandwidth with the ASA Motion Link open-standard supports.Also last month, we closed our acquisition of Neuronix AI Labs whose innovative software technology enhances AI-enabled intelligent edge solutions and increases neural networking capabilities. This technology expands our capabilities for power-efficient AI-enabled edge solutions deployed in FPGAs. Neuronix AI Labs provides neural network sparsity optimization technology that enables the reduction in power, size and calculation for tasks such as image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation while maintaining high accuracy.Finally, in July, we expect to announce our entry into the 64-bit embedded microprocessor market with a suite of products, development tools and other support requirements to address high-performance embedded processing applications including AI-enabled edge solutions. This will extend our strong 32-bit embedded microprocessor portfolio to higher performance and increased capabilities while preserving Microchip's historically strong ecosystem of leading development tools to make adoption easy for embedded system design engineers.Microchip is the only company to offer the widest embedded control and processing platform from 8-bit to 64-bit as well as FPGAs with a common development tool ecosystem that's empowering customers to innovate and reuse their work across a wide spectrum of markets and applications.Now for some color on the March quarter and the general business environment. All regions of the world and most of our end markets with the exception of Aerospace and Defense and the Artificial Intelligence subset of data centers were weak. We believe that our product shipments were significantly lower than the end market consumption of our products as our distribution channels drained inventory during the quarter.Our broad base of customers continued to lower their inventory and adjust their business plans in the midst of a weak macro environment and an uncertain outlook. With no major supply constraints, coupled with very short lead times and a weak macro environment, we believe there is inventory destocking as well as reduction in target inventory levels that is underway at multiple levels. At our direct customers and distributors who buy from us, our indirect customers who buy through our distributors and in some cases, our customers' customers.We are, however, also seeing early signs of green shoots in our business. First, the level of request the cancellations and pushouts has started to subside. Second, our bookings have started to pick up, albeit from low levels. February bookings were the highest in 8 months. March bookings were the highest in all of fiscal '24 and April bookings were higher than March. Third, the new bookings are aging over a shorter period of time; and fourth, the number of expedites and shipment pull-in requests are growing. Collectively, these green shoots, we believe, are pointing to the formation of a bottom.Our average lead times continue to be 8 weeks or less. During a period of business uncertainty, we believe short lead times are the best way to help customers navigate the environment successfully and improve the quality of backlog placed with us. However, the significant reduction in lead time is also resulting in reduced near-term visibility for our business.Given the severity of the inventory correction, our factories around the world are running at lower utilization rates and our 3 major fabs will take another 2-week shutdown in the June quarter in order to help control the growth of inventory.Our internal capacity expansion actions remain [poised]. We expect our capital investments in fiscal year '25 will be low, even as we prepare for the long-term growth of our business.On the CHIPS Act front, we have nothing new to report. The CHIPS office has completed their diligence for the grants we are seeking and we are working towards an agreement.At this stage of a major inventory correction, we believe that the days of inventory metric whether for Microchip or for our distributors can be [deceptive] as this is a backward-looking indicator measuring off of a baseline that is well below where we believe end market consumption is at. For inventory planning, we are, therefore, focused on where we believe consumption is running and will likely run in the coming quarters. We continue to work with our distribution partners to attempt to find the right balance of inventory required to serve their customers, manage through their cash flow requirements and be positioned for the eventual strengthening of business conditions.The operating expense reduction efforts we implemented last quarter, including broad-based salary sacrifices are continuing this quarter. The shutdown for manufacturing team members and pay cuts for non-manufacturing team members are consistent with our long-standing culture of shared sacrifices and down cycles and shared rewards and up cycles. Our culture of shared sacrifice protects our valuable employees from layoffs, helps enable us to support customers and maintain our design win momentum, helps ensure that manufacturing capacity can be turned on quickly as business conditions strengthen and helps enable our product development teams to maintain their pace of new solution introductions.Now let's get into the guidance for the June quarter. While we see a number of green shoots in our business indicators, we still need turns orders within the quarter to meet our guidance. Operating in a high turns environment has historically been normal for Microchip. It is just not a position we have found ourselves in over the last few years due to a supply-constrained high backlog environment we and the industry experience.Taking all the factors we have discussed on the call today into consideration, we expect our net sales for the June quarter to be between $1.22 billion and $1.26 billion. We believe that the June 2024 quarter marks the bottom of the cycle for Microchip and our business will return to sequential revenue growth in the September 2024 quarter. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 59% and 61% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 28.25% and 28.75% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating profit to be between 30.25% and 32.75% of sales, and we expect our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $0.48 and $0.56.We believe that the fundamental characteristics of growth, profitability and cash generation of our business remain intact. We are confident that our solutions remain the engine of innovation for the applications and end markets we serve. Our focus on total system solutions and key market megatrends continue to fuel strong design win momentum, which we expect will drive above-market long-term growth. We remain committed to executing our Microchip 3.0 strategic imperatives, which we believe will deliver sustained results and substantial shareholder value.Last but not least, a month ago, we appointed Rich Simoncic as Chief Operating Officer. Rich is a Microchip lifer who has been with us for 35 years in many different capacities. Rich has been expanding his role over the last few years, and he and I will jointly lead the Microchip global enterprise so that we can apply our combined leadership capacity to engage the opportunities and challenges that are ahead of us.With that, let me pass it back on to Steve to talk more about our cash return to shareholders. Steve?"", 'Stephen Sanghi', 'Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. I would like to provide you with a further update on our cash return strategy. The Board of Directors approved an increase in the dividend of 18% from the year ago quarter to a record $0.452 per share. During the last quarter, we purchased a record $387.4 million of our stock in the open market. We also paid out a record $242.5 million in dividends. Thus, the total cash return was a record $629.9 million. This amount was 82.5% of our actual adjusted free cash flow of $763.4 million during the December 2023 quarter. Our net leverage at the end of March 2024 was 1.57x.Ever since we achieved an investment-grade rating for our debt in November 2021 and pivoted to increasing our capital return to shareholders, we have returned a total of $4.23 billion to shareholders through March 31, 2024, by a combination of dividends and share buybacks. During this period, our share buyback in the open market was approximately 30.4 million shares, representing approximately 5.7% of our shares outstanding.In the current June quarter, we will use the adjusted free cash flow level from the March quarter to target the amount of cash returned to shareholders. The adjusted free cash flow excludes amounts we collected from our customers for long-term supply assurance payments. These payments are refundable when purchase commitments are fulfilled.Our adjusted free cash flow for the March quarter was $389.9 million, so our target return to shareholders would be 87.5% or $341.2 million of that amount. However, as Ganesh mentioned, we did complete 2 small acquisitions in this June quarter. So we are reducing our share buyback amount to reflect the cash outlay for those deals. Thus, in the June quarter, our cash return to shareholders is expected to be $315.3 million, out of which dividends are expected to be approximately $243 million and our expected stock buyback will be approximately $72.3 million.Going forward, we plan to continue to increase our adjusted free cash flow to return to shareholders by 500 basis points every quarter until we reach 100% of adjusted free cash flow returned to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. That will take 3 more quarters, and we expect that dividends over time will represent approximately 50% of our cash returns.With that, operator, will you please poll for questions.', 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities.', 'Vivek Arya', ""Ganesh, you were suggesting June to be the bottom end for September to grow sequentially because of green shoots. But to be fair, green shoots were suggested on the last call also. So what's the difference between the last call and this call and if you could help us maybe quantify what has been maybe the pace of bookings increase year-on-year or quarter-on-quarter so far, so we can get a sense for the pace of recovery into September.And then maybe if I could also ask, Eric, on a related note is, 60% also the trough for gross margin, if June is the bottom, does it also mean 60% is the trough for gross margins?"", 'Ganesh Moorthy', ""Great. Thank you, Vivek. I don't think we mentioned green shoots at the last earnings call, but we did say in one of our banking sessions that we were at. And that was the first time we began to see it was in the March timeframe. And the momentum is picking up, right, as we go through March and April and May. I mentioned what the bookings were doing on a relative basis over that time, we can see how many more people are asking for pull-ins and expedites and all of that.So it's a qualitative view looking at how we integrate the last 2 or 3 months of where momentum is coming in, where the customer feedback is coming in that reflects our view that if the June quarter is the bottom and September quarter is growth."", 'James Eric Bjornholt', ""And then a follow-up question for me on that was on gross margin. And would I expect if June is the trough in revenue if gross margin would bottom out. And I believe that to be the case. I mean, obviously, we haven't given guidance yet, and there's factors that apply to that, that we don't know yet in terms of product mix and where we'll be running our factories. But I think that we are bouncing along the bottom on gross margin."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Chris Caso with Wolfe Research.', 'Christopher Caso', ""I guess the question is if there's any difference that you're seeing from any of the different end markets? I mean, you talked about some of the booking stabilization improvement that you've seen. How would you characterize that among the different end markets?"", 'Ganesh Moorthy', ""I don't -- on the stabilization, I can't really point to a particular end market doing better or not. I said in the aggregate, Aerospace and Defense and the AI segment of data center are both doing well. And so that part is pulling it up. On the others, there can be some industrial customers who are still seeing weakness, others who are beginning to see the bottom and trying to come back in with rush orders, that goes into the other end markets as well. So no particular end market trend that is distinguishable on the bottoming out of where their inventories are."", 'Christopher Caso', 'As a follow-up, Eric, you talked about perhaps if things go well, June is the trough and then June is likely the bottom for gross margins as well. As you go forward, as we pull our way out of this, what do you think would be the trajectory of gross margins? And I guess I asked that taking consideration the fact that your internal inventory is still high. So how would we think about gross margins in the context of recovery as you have to bring your own inventories down to normal?', 'James Eric Bjornholt', ""So it does depend on the revenue trajectory and then how we would run our factories to respond to that. And so it's not a question that I can 100% answer today. But our cost structures are still in good shape. Average selling prices are absolutely hanging in there. So with that, we have confidence in our long-term model and our ability to get back there, but the trajectory and how we get there is going to very much be revenue dependent, which will drive certain actions to increase output from our factories. So I know that's not specifically answering your question, but I think that's the best we can do right now."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.', 'Harlan L. Sur', ""Can you just talk about channel sell-through dynamics from your global distributors? In March, you mentioned sell-through $125 million higher versus sell-in. Is that a similar delta here in the June quarter, and if excess inventories at end customer of distributors are coming down, I would assume that distribution sell-through is starting to grow. Are you seeing that this quarter? And is this maybe what's also giving you confidence that June is the bottom?"", 'Ganesh Moorthy', ""So Harlan, thanks for the question. The level of inventory that is past what our distributors had that is in with our customers is not always visible to us. I think we can get some sense of that from what the distribution sell-through is. But there's also a second factor, which is some of those customers are also reducing the months of inventory they want to carry. So it's a multipronged answer to it. But what we can see is that distribution is part of the placing of additional orders on us.So they are seeing how they are managing their end customers, their inventory and placing incremental orders on us. So that must have some relevance to how they're viewing things, but I don't have a definitive answer on where sell-through is going to end up versus sell-in here in the June quarter, at least not at this time."", 'Harlan L. Sur', ""And then just a quick follow-up. So direct customer shipments were almost 30%. We're down almost 30% sequentially, while disti shipments were only down 20% sequentially in March. Does that suggest that excess inventories are maybe a bit more pronounced at your direct customers? And if your lead times are sub 8-weeks, you guys only have visibility through the end of this quarter. So what gives the Microchip team confidence that shipments to direct customers post June will be growing sequentially as you aren't booking beyond that and you don't really have visibility into their sell-through dynamics?"", 'Ganesh Moorthy', ""So we know -- and customers are placing backlog into the September quarter, into the December quarter. So there's not a single answer that everybody is following. And we can see that as the bookings are rising, they are placing them into the next 3 to 6-months on a more predominant basis. So that level of where the momentum is coming in or how backlog is coming in is what gives us a sense of where the bottom is and how things are going to be as we move into the September and December quarters."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo.', 'Gary Wade Mobley', ""I know you guys communicated that you held the OpEx lower than expected. And I think it's today, what, $355 million on a non-GAAP basis. My question is, how long can you hold that down? And is there any clawback provisions for the loss wages during this temporary salary cut? And I'm just trying to get a sense of how we should think about the OpEx increasing as revenue increases?"", 'James Eric Bjornholt', ""I'll start with the response and Ganesh can add to it if he wants to. So there is not a clawback in terms of what we're doing from a salary sacrifice for our employees. We have the shared sacrifice, share reward program. And in the past, when we have implemented something like this that has worked out well for our employees, that we keep everybody working on the things that are important to drive the revenue growth as the cycle turns upward, and we've gained market share through that.And so we've had great financial results coming out of it and then been able to share those rewards with employees through higher bonuses and taking away the pay cuts at the appropriate time. So we're going to have to see how this plays out from a topline revenue perspective. It would be my perspective that we will achieve the same types of results this go around with the actions that we've taken, but there's no promise to employees that they're going to get this money back. There's no retroactive clawback that would be implemented."", 'Ganesh Moorthy', ""This is a part of our culture that is not always as easily appreciable from an investor community. We have 98% of employees around the world that are participating in this voluntary. We have another 700 employees who have volunteered for a higher salary reduction than what we have requested from them. It's very difficult to quantify how powerful culture plays the role in these type of difficult situations and how much that the employees are part of the solution. And of course, they are part of the shared rewards that come up as we get into better times as well. So this is very much of a program that has worked many times in the past and this is another time we're applying it, and we expect it to be successful."", 'James Eric Bjornholt', ""I think the other thing that I'd add is we know this is difficult for employees. The inflation still exists, and this is a challenge for employees. So it's not that we want to keep these in place. But at the time, with where we're guiding revenue for the current quarter of revenue and earnings, it's appropriate. And we hope that we can restore these things back to normal salary levels as soon as possible."", 'Gary Wade Mobley', ""Thank you for that color, as my follow-up, I wanted to perhaps strike a more positive chord and ask about design win metrics for the fiscal year. I don't know if you have those stats on handy with you, but maybe if you can just give us some qualitative or quantitative measure of the lifetime value of the design wins."", 'Ganesh Moorthy', ""So we don't usually break that out and we have slightly different ways in which we look at this. What we do constantly look at is how is the design pipeline progressing. And in the course of 2023 in addition to all the work that we did, we also saw customers shifting their priorities from doing triage for some of the shortages that they were running into bringing back the innovation program that they had put on hold. And so if you put all of that together, the design win pipeline is strong.There's a lot more design-in activity in the last 12 months than there was in the prior 12 months, just simply because customer bandwidth was there to be able to run the development program that they were progressing with."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Carlos Coronado with UBS.', 'Timothy Michael Arcuri', ""It's Tim on. So Ganesh, can you give us a sense of book-to-bill. It sounds like it was below 1 for March, but I just wanted to confirm that. And I know that you did say that orders are getting better month by month. But is the message that you think book-to-bill could be above 1 for the June quarter. So I'm just wondering if you can talk about book-to-bill?"", 'Ganesh Moorthy', ""So book-to-bill was below 1. However, book-to-bill has never been an indicator for us of where the business is going as much as an indicator of where our lead times are. During the 2021, 2022 shortages, we had book-to-bill in many, many multiples of where they were at, reflecting the long lead times. Right now with short lead times that we have, we expect book-to-bill will be lower. But the bookings are rising, and I can't quite tell what May and June are going to complete. So I don't have anything. We don't really look at book-to-bill as necessarily an indicator of where the growth is going to be. It's more a reflection of as lead times get short, people replace the booking consistent with the shorter lead times."", 'Timothy Michael Arcuri', ""Got it. Okay. And then, Eric, one for you. So inventory was a little higher coming out of March and I think some of us thought it would be. Can you talk about loadings in the factory and sort of how you're thinking about loadings into June? Are you just kind of drawing the line, I understand where you plan to bring down inventory on the balance sheet in June? And yes, just kind of talk about that and its impact on gross margin."", 'James Eric Bjornholt', ""Yes. So I'm honestly not quite sure where The Street had us modeled. We had talked about in our last conference call that inventory days are expected to be between about 225 to 230-days at the midpoint. We came in at 224. So I think we kind of delivered on what we told The Street we were going to do. In terms of utilization in the current quarter, we have been having some attrition in our factories. And because of that, we can start less wafers on a monthly basis than we can because we have a fewer number of employees.But it's -- in the big picture, things are relatively modest. I don't think utilization will be significantly different than it was in the March quarter, maybe just modestly lower."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Tore Svanberg with Stifel.', 'Tore Egil Svanberg', ""Let me move on from cyclical questions. And I have a question on 64-bit microcontrollers. You also had an AI acquisition in the quarter. Just trying to understand, Ganesh, your conversations with customers, we hear AI at the edge a lot, but it's hard for us to get true visibility on that. So -- when will Edge AI become a much more meaningful part of your revenues, what you think?"", 'Ganesh Moorthy', ""Our target markets for Edge AI predominantly in industrial, smaller extent, automotive, some in medical. The medical segment of industrial factory automation, all that. So they are designs in progress and they've been taking place over the last 6 to 12-months. They probably will just take over 24 to 30-months of time. So it's in that time. There's some of it -- small amounts that are already taking place, but I think it becomes a more and more meaningful part as time goes on.And each of these either product line announcement or some of the acquisitions which give us specific technologies, just accelerate where those designs can go and how our solutions can be differentiated from others providing similar solutions."", 'Tore Egil Svanberg', ""Great. And as my follow-up, you said that you're basically shipping below consumption. You're about $1 billion from your trough. Obviously, you're running inventory at a certain level. So you must have some idea where the consumption is. Is that a number you can share with us?"", 'Ganesh Moorthy', ""Not With any level of precision. I think any form of a -- take a 4-quarter revenue divided by 4 starts to get you into the ballpark. But even that is unclear, right? So I think that number will get clearer as people begin to book and buy at a level that they need to -- excluding any growth just to get back to consumption. But there's not an easy way to make that number determinable. It's clearly between where our peak a year ago was in the June quarter to where you're seeing the guidance for this quarter."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.', 'Toshiya Hari', ""I had two quick ones. First, on inventory, maybe for Eric. So how should we think about inventory management through cycle or longer term? I know you've got strategic inventory. I know you want to better service your customers on the way up. But when you think 12 months out, 18 months out, whether be in dollars or days, what are you managing the business to?And then quick follow-up on pricing. I think you mentioned that in the near term, pricing is holding up. But as you think about calendar '25, I think some of your peers have talked about pricing trends potentially reverting to pre-pandemic patterns down, call it, low singles. Is that a view that you would agree with or share? Or do you feel or think differently on pricing?"", 'James Eric Bjornholt', ""Okay. All right. So on inventory days, longer term, our model is, and this really hasn't changed from what we shared back in our Analyst and Investor Day that we're targeting 130 to 150 days. Now we're a long way from that today, and I'm not going to put a time horizon on when we will get there, but that's still the goal, right? We think with that level in a more normalized environment, we can have short lead times and support our customers appropriately with that level. So I'll turn the pricing question over to Ganesh."", 'Ganesh Moorthy', ""And I would add one more thing, which is we also have these last time buys that we put into place on very high gross margin product lines, those will be additive and they are situational depending on when we're faced with that kind of situation.On the pricing itself, our pricing is predominantly a function of what we have to compete with at the point of design. And so in the near term, pricing is really driven by where designs were historically, what we won them at. And a lot of these are products going into applications that have long life cycles and they don't really change or like a consumer electronics or other end markets, they don't really every 9, 12 months change things out.We have products that have been in designs for 5, 7, 9, 10 years in many cases as well. We are being competitive on new designs with pricing where we need to be, but we also have new products that we compete with. And so the most competitive new products are what we use to go fight in the most price-sensitive new design applications. And that's been historically how -- explains it's not something new. And if we go back and look at 20 years of Microchip, that's how we've done it.And we have a lot of business that continues, that will be existing business at existing prices for a long, long time to come. And then we'll have new business at new pricing. And at new pricing, we expect we'll have good gross margins as time goes on."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Joshua Buchalter with TD Cowen.', 'Joshua Louis Buchalter', ""I guess to start, maybe I can follow up on the previous one. You mentioned pricing hanging in overall, but competing more on new design wins. Have those -- are you observing those new design wins becoming any more price sensitive or more price competitive as the shortages of ease and we've entered this correction mode? Or sort of still normal operating in and competitive conditions?"", 'Ganesh Moorthy', ""New designs have always been highly competitive. It's where people are trying to work on winning platforms with multiyear implications. So it's in the couple of years of constraints, there were fewer new platforms, new designs that customers are doing. But in the sense of having to be competitive and the competitive intensity for new designs, yes, it's different from the last 2 or 3-years, but it is consistent with what it has been over 20-years before that."", 'Joshua Louis Buchalter', ""That's clear. I appreciate the color there. And then for my follow-up, the CapEx guidance is obviously down meaningfully off of what was likely a peak 2-years ago. Could you maybe just speak to your confidence in having enough capacity both internally and perhaps more importantly, investment from your foundry partners at across geometries that you ship your products on?"", 'Ganesh Moorthy', ""Yes. So when we say -- it's a plan that we look at consistently, both short, medium and long term. We feel very confident with the internal capacity, both what is installed and underutilized, what is available and ready to go and then eventually what we might add to it. And then we work with our partners, both the foundries as well as the OSATs on their capacity planning across the horizon that they have. We're obviously a small piece of a much bigger pie there that they're running.But we don't have any particular capacity constraints that we're concerned about. It may change as demand begins to come back, and if, in fact, there is a much sharper rise as some people are predicting. But for the moment, we're quite confident both in our internal as well as our partner capacity for the business we're running."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our next question is from Chris Danely with Citibank.', 'Christopher Brett Danely', ""So now that we're yet another quarter into the correction and hopefully coming out of it, if we look at your total drop in terms of revenue, it's probably going to be like 45% or something like that. And that's worse than most of your competitors. So I guess, why do you think that is? Do you think that the PSP program encouraged a little double ordering? Is there some geographic or something else going on? Just looking for some -- for your take on why that's happened?"", 'Ganesh Moorthy', ""No, great question, Chris. When you look at peak to trough, it all is a question of when does it start? And when does it bottom out, right? You've seen one of our peer group companies that try to do a peak trough in one quarter. And you could say, boy, that was one way to do it. Our objective has always been to try to respond as the business is changing. And so we've had different end markets responding at different times. We had a lot of automotive and industrial. They were later in the cycle. And our mix is higher in some of those markets as well.And in this case, the downturn substantially deeper than what anybody had expected on that. And that's probably a component of PSP that may have amplified some of those things, et cetera. But a lot of it has to do with we started later, and we are correcting stronger. And the end markets that we are predominantly represented in were the ones with the later in the cycle correction than perhaps those that are more consumer or phone or PC, that kind of exposure."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho Securities.', 'Vijay Raghavan Rakesh', 'Just a quick question on the competitive landscape, I guess, especially as you look at kind of China supply. Is there any worry around them being aggressive on the microcontroller supply coming out from there? What are you seeing in those trends?', 'Ganesh Moorthy', ""China has always been a competitor in many of the spaces that we're in. Their approach is a little bit different. They have a lot of their attention going into things that can be faster to market quicker. And those tend to take them into places like consumer electronics and the other areas that are faster design-in cycle, a lot of the power supplies for cell phones and those kind of things.Clearly, they are also making products that can go into other end applications. And that's a competitive environment that is not different today. You could argue perhaps that there's a lot of attention and priority that they have. But we win with new products, we win with competitive solutions that we have. And we win by providing the customer with a solution that is better than what they can get otherwise. And that remains the way in which we've gone to market, and we'll continue to fight for new business in China and anywhere else."", 'Vijay Raghavan Rakesh', ""Got it. And then as you look at the utilization, I don't know if we gave a hard number there. But how do you see that playing out through the rest of the year? I know there's a lot of moving parts to that. But any way to look at what utilization looks like? I know you cut CapEx pretty significantly too so that should help?"", 'James Eric Bjornholt', ""Yes. So we don't break out a specific utilization in total, we have -- it varies very much by factory. We have had some attrition in employee headcount, which I mentioned in response to an earlier question that just makes it as we go by the months and aren't rehiring, that capacity utilization would come down modestly. I'm not expecting a huge change from March to June, maybe just a little bit lower. And then obviously, actions depending on what our outlook is on revenue and inventory will drive what the rest of the year looks like as we gain a little bit more confidence in understanding where the business is heading over the coming months."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from William Stein with Truist Securities.', 'William Stein', ""Great. It was interesting to see a couple of tuck-in acquisitions this quarter. I'm wondering if you could talk about the relative focus of that approach to capital deployment or, let's say, product development going forward relative to internal development?"", 'Ganesh Moorthy', ""So we have an internal development that works on the model that we have provided, which over the long term is the 68% gross margin, 23% operating expense, 45% operating margin. That allows for the prioritization of our internal activities and where we want to apply it for different opportunities that we have in front of us. From time to time, we find our external opportunities where the speed at which we could do something or the time that it would involve in trying to get to a solution can be a lot longer if we were to do it just organically.And there, we have applied these tuck-in acquisitions as a way to speed up what we're able to do, consistent with the direction that we are interested in or have been following for a while. And we've done about 6 or 8 of them now in the last 4 or 5 years of time ever since. Microsemi was the last major public acquisition we did. We've done about 6 to 8 smaller ones since then.And it all is to speed up our agenda with a very tactical and a pinpoint strike on what the acquisition can do for the areas that we're driving growth in. And we will do more of those as we continue on as well. Let's say -- we've always -- we've been public. That's an essential part of our strategy."", 'William Stein', ""As a follow-up, it does sound that while you anticipate revenue to grow in September, I would imagine the inventory burn isn't done at the end of June. I wonder if you can maybe help us understand when we should expect a situation where your revenue is approximately the same as in demand? In other words, when the inventory reductions will be mostly done? Do you think that's -- have I misread you and that actually does happen in June? Or do you think it's more like September or even further out?"", 'James Eric Bjornholt', ""So I'll start with the response here. I mean I think the bottom line is, well, with 125,000 customers, it is impossible to know when all customers or majority of customers have kind of corrected their inventory, to what they think the right level is and that's somewhat a moving target as lead times adjust based on whatever point in the cycle that we're at. So we don't have a good answer to be able to answer your question there.Obviously, give guidance for the next quarter, and we'll have more information that we can share at that time. But I think that for some customers, this inventory correction is going to last beyond this quarter. I think that absolutely is the case."", 'Ganesh Moorthy', ""Yes. I think many customers made their own mistakes on how they viewed their business, what they thought the prospects were. Many other customers were very thoughtful, continue to be strong players and where they're at. And as we gave you some indications of certain end markets where there's strength as well. So it's all over the place. And just as a preponderance of people who are done with their inventory correction and are now going back into buying for their consumption and/or into growth that they may be seeing. The weighted average begins to shift, and that's the weighted average that begins to shift in September."", 'Operator', ""Our next question is from David O'Connor with BNP."", ""David O'Connor"", ""Great. Two from my side. Maybe firstly, just on the green shoots, can you talk about them from a geographical perspective? Is it mainly China driven? And now you're seeing that continue in Europe and the U.S.? Or how would you describe it geographically?"", 'Ganesh Moorthy', ""Yes. So the green shoots are not limited to any one geography, not limited to any one end market, it's really across all of them. And as I mentioned, you're going to have in a geography or an end market, both customers with continued paying and other customers who are starting to look at how to get back into growth mode and what they're doing. So no specific end market or geography leading to the green shoots."", ""David O'Connor"", 'Okay. Got it. And then maybe just on the acquisition, the Neuronix Labs acquisition. It seems like it helps you address the AGI market for your MCUs. Can you maybe talk about the kind of content tailwind for your MCUs for AGI that this can generate? Or how much of your MCU portfolio or customers looking to add AI content in the next-gen products to kind of run those AGI models? Can you give us any more color on that would be helpful.', 'Ganesh Moorthy', ""I Don't know if there's a numerical way to give you that. I think -- that's what I said -- I believe that embedded customers are thinking about how AI can be used in delivering better solutions than what they have in the past. No different from -- if you go back in the chronology from 20, 25 years ago, people added intelligence first because you could make a product better with intelligence added. Then further out in time, people added connectivity as a way to now make it even better than just adding intelligence and then they added security as a thing.And now finally, I think AI is the next leg of how people will add capability to the products to make them better. So it's a journey, and there's going to be many customers who don't need to do anything with AI. Others who are seeing the opportunity, and we'll take advantage of that in the next generation of their products. But I think you should think of it as a continuum of customers. They're all looking to innovate. AI gives them another opportunity in their platforms to be able to innovate and provide better products than the previous generations."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Mark Lipacis with Evercore ISI.', 'Mark John Lipacis', ""I think this is for Ganesh or Steve. I'm wondering what is the difference between the setup for Microchip's business over the next 6-months and the setup that you see at the bottom of every cycle? It seems like there's a lot of similarities, and I'm hoping you can tell me the difference.The similarities I see are -- there is some kind of demand shock or a big inventory build and then our customers and the supply chain downstream from them, recognize that, so they decide that they're going to supply themselves out of their own inventories, they cancel orders or they take orders down and then you don't get any visibility. So you and your peers take your utilization rates down and sometimes do temporary fab shutdowns.And then your customers have an epiphany that they overcorrected on the downside and in 3, 4 quarters from here everybody is taking their numbers up and everybody scrambled in to get components. So those are the similarities I see. What are the differences? And if you have a disagreement over those similarities, I'd love to hear that, too."", 'Stephen Sanghi', ""Mark, I think you have answered your question. We couldn't say any better. You asked the question then you answered it, I think it's perfect."", 'Ganesh Moorthy', ""Mark, I was going to welcome you back -- and as you said, I think this is a cycle we've seen play out many times, and the elements that you answered or the elements that you proposed are there. I don't know of any differences in this one. Obviously, the length of the up cycle sometimes affects the depth of the down cycle. But other than that, the elements are very similar."", 'Mark John Lipacis', ""I was hoping you might say, well, the supply chain has learned or lessen over the last 3-years and recognize that you guys need to have visibility because there's a manufacturing cycle time. So is that -- is the supply chain not learned anything downstream from you? Is it -- we're just doing the same over and over again?"", 'Ganesh Moorthy', ""No. So yes, I had assumed that during the depth of the constraints with all the different discussions I was having with the senior executives at our -- at our customers that they would come out of this cycle with a better understanding of how semiconductor supply works and what they would need to be to be more strategic. But I have been surprised at how quickly people have forgotten and how quickly people have returned back to the way they used to think.Basically, they think semiconductors are like water in your tap. You turn on the tap and the water comes and you turn off the tap, and it goes away. And so I am of the belief that those lessons will have to be relearned again as we go through the cycle. And we'll see how the cycle goes. But no, there has not been any -- there are a few. But for the most part, those learnings have not carried forward."", 'Mark John Lipacis', 'So [last one] is repeat off the bottom?', 'Stephen Sanghi', ""Yes. Mark, from time to time, some people have written or talked about industry has matured, and there will not be any cycles anymore. I think all those predictions have been wrong. Industry has always been cyclic and will always be cyclic. I think our customers, our distributors, vendors, suppliers, they don't learn.And I think people change, new purchasing managers come in, new people come in. And as Ganesh described, the lessons are forgotten very rapidly, leading to just these cycles never going away. And this one was the most pronounced cycle, both on the upside and now we're seeing on the downside."", 'James Eric Bjornholt', 'Yes. I was just going to make the point is I view this as inventory correction on steroids, right?

And can you talk about your market share prospects going forward in there?"", 'Ganesh Moorthy', ""Sure. So our FPGA business has, in fact, performed better than our other businesses. And in part, it's because our FPGA business has historically had a large Aerospace and Defense component and continues to. Now we have, over the last 4, 5 years, been creating the new design opportunities for FPGA in the longer term to grow in industrial and automotive and the historical end market strengths that Microchip had before we got the FPGA business.And so this -- it is not immune to market forces and where things are going to go. But it has got a better end market mix than some of our other businesses and therefore, has performed better. And of course, we are picking up designs that in the long term that are falling off of -- Erstwhile, Xilinx and Erstwhile Altera, as they take focus away from the mid -- over many years that they have done or end-of-life products, right? Those are all creating opportunities for our FPGA business.

So we can have an end market, say, industrial. And we have examples of certain customers who have burned through their inventory and they're back asking for new orders at expedited times. We also have other customers, same industry, who are still burning through inventory and taking longer where it goes. So I think a lot depends on a customer, their market prospects, what did they do to create and grow their business and how well are they executing? And so that's really been the difference is that it's customer by customer, the stories are different."", 'Christopher Adam Jackson Rolland', ""Yes. Understood. And then if I'm hearing you correctly, you think June is the bottom. A lot of that is inventory based. I'd like an idea of how you're looking at the inventory position in September at your customers more generally? Do you think we can get back to seasonal trends in September and going forward? Or is there still this inventory drag overall?"", 'Ganesh Moorthy', ""No, I think there's going to be customers at different points in the correction cycle. Some will have corrected and moved on. Others will still be correcting. So I think seasonality is perhaps one of the things which you need a level of normalcy for some period of time before you can say, okay. We now have all these variables that have been taken out. So I can't say we have seasonality in the September quarter. I can say that incrementally, on a weighted average basis, there are more customers who are going to be out of their inventory correction, but not that they're all done."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Tore Svanberg with Stifel.', 'Tore Egil Svanberg', 'Just one quick follow-up.

But lead times are short. We are getting these requests for pull-in. I don't have a good comparison to give you in terms of prior cycles. If this turns out to be the bottom for us, which we believe it will, we can probably give some commentary when we talk about our September guidance as we kind of hit and move through that bottom."", 'Ganesh Moorthy', ""So one of the things which is more difficult to do is most people talk about turns in a normal environment where there isn't inventory out there.

But when there is inventory, we know those turns aren't going to show up because people will burn though inventory before they begin to place it. And I think that's some of the hesitation we have and trying to provide some insight where we know there's a lot of uncertainty.What we have done is done the best of our assessment of what those are going to be, where they're going to be and build it into the guidance. And so I think that's the best way to think about it is that we have taken into account the risks that are present from inventory that would otherwise cause headwinds to turns in the quarter."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.', 'Vivek Arya', ""Quick follow up, I just wanted to clarify what is the contribution of the acquisitions in the June quarter or in fiscal '25? And then, Ganesh, back to the September quarter, I think you did say that you expect it to grow. I understand that it's hard to put a seasonal number on it. But based on what you have seen in prior downturns, just the fact that Microchip has gone down so much from peak to trough, should we also expect kind of sharper recovery back when you do start recovering?"", 'Ganesh Moorthy', ""So to answer your first question, these are small tuck-in acquisitions. They're intended to accelerate our effort on design-ins and design wins and all of that. So they don't have any revenue contribution in the June quarter or in the September quarter, for that matter. In terms of the revenue and what happens as the correction happens, yes, you should think that at some point, and I can't tell you is it in September or is it in December, you will see -- we will see a sharper recovery. That's how it has played itself out in many other cycles as well.And there are 2 stages to it. There's the first stage, which is just people needing to get back to -- they've burned through most of the inventory and they need to get back to at least buying to consumption. And then there's a second phase, which is what is the macro doing? And is the macro driving further growth for them above just what their flattened consumption line alone might tell us. And I think all of that, if you look forward into a likely environment over the next 12 months, should give us a sharper recovery."", 'Operator', 'This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the floor back over to Ganesh Moorthy for any closing comments.', 'Ganesh Moorthy', 'Great. I want to thank everybody for joining us on the call. I know we ran over a little bit, but I appreciate the questions, and we look forward to seeing and talking to many of you in the coming days as well as many of the conferences that are coming up. Thank you.', 'Operator', ""This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.""]"

Reported EPS is $0.57 EPS, expectations were $0.574. Microchip Technology Incorporated isn’t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).', 'Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Microchip Q4 of Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Eric Bjornholt, Senior Vice President and CFO. Thank you, Eric. You may begin.', ""Eric Bjornholt: Thank you and good afternoon everyone. During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events and results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release as of today, as well as our recent filings with the SEC, that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip’s President and CEO; Steve Sanghi, Microchip’s Executive Chair; Rich Simoncic, Microchip’s COO, and Sajid Daudi, Microchip’s Head of Investor Relations."", 'I will comment on our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2024 financial performance. Ganesh will then provide commentary on our results and discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance and Steve will provide an update on our cash return strategy. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. We are including information in our press release in this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the investor relations page of our website at www.microchip.com and included reconciliation information in our earnings press release, which we believe you will find useful when comparing our GAAP and non-GAAP results. We have also posted a summary of our outstanding debt and our leverage metrics on our website.', 'I will now go through some of the operating results including net sales, gross margin, and operating expenses. Other than net sales, I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis which is based on expenses, prior to the effects of our acquisition activities, share-based compensation, and certain other adjustments as described in our earnings press release and in the reconciliations on our website. Net sales in the March quarter were $1.326 billion, which was down 24.9% sequentially. We have posted a summary of our net sales by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 60.3%, including capacity under utilization charges of $32 million. Operating expenses were at 27.4%, and operating income was 32.9%.', 'Although our operating income was better than the midpoint of our guidance, our cash taxes came in higher than forecasted. Non-GAAP net income was $310.3 million and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.57 and at the midpoint of our guidance. On a GAAP basis in the March quarter, gross margins were 59.6%. Total operating expenses were $536.4 million and included acquisition and tangible amortization of $151.2 million, special income of $16.9 million, which was primarily driven by the settlement of an unclaimed property audit at a value that was less than what we had accrued for. Share-based compensation of $37.4 million and $1.1 million of other expenses. GAAP net income was $154.7 million resulting in $0.28 in diluted earnings per share.', 'For fiscal year 2024, net sales were $7.634 billion and were down 9.5% from net sales in fiscal year 2023. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 65.8%, operating expenses were 22% of sales, and operating income was 43.9% of sales. Non-GAAP net income was $2.698 billion, and EPS was $4.92 per diluted share. On a GAAP basis, gross margins were 65.4%, operating expenses were 31.8% of sales, and operating income was 33.7% of sales. Net income was $1.907 billion and EPS was $3.48 per diluted share. Our non-GAAP cash tax rate was 18.8% in the March quarter and 14.5% for fiscal year 2024. Our non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal year 2025 is expected to be about 13%, which is exclusive of the transition tax and any tax audit settlements related to taxes accrued in prior fiscal years.', ""We are still hopeful that the tax rules requiring companies to capitalize R&D expenses will be pushed out or repealed. If this were to happen, we would anticipate about a 200 basis point favorable adjustment to Microchip’s non-GAAP tax rate in future periods. Our inventory balance at March 31st, 2024 was $1.316 billion. We had 224 days of inventory at the end of the March quarter, which was up 39 days from the prior quarter's level and in-line with our expectation, giving the difficult revenue quarter we experienced. At the midpoint of our June 2024 quarter guidance, we would expect inventory dollars to be up modestly and days of inventory to increase based on the lower cost of goods sold, driven by the depressed revenue levels at which we believe is the low point of the current cycle for Microchip."", ""We also continue to invest in building inventory for long-lived, high-margin products whose manufacturing capacity is being end-of-life by our supply chain partners, and these last time buys represented 14 days of inventory at the end of March. Inventory at our distributors -- in the March quarter were at 41 days, which was up 4 days from the prior quarter's level. Distribution took down their inventory in the March quarter as distribution sell-through was about $125 million higher than distribution sell-in. The inventory days increased as this is reflective of the much lower cost of sales for Microchip in the March quarter that is used in this calculation. Our cash flow from operating activities was $430 million in the March quarter. Our adjusted pre-cash flow was $389.9 million in the March quarter."", 'As of March 31, our consolidated cash and total investment position was $319.7 million. Our total debt increased by $312 million in the March quarter, and our net debt increased by $273.3 million. Our adjusted EBITDA in the March quarter was $503 million and 37.9% of sales. Our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was $3.623 billion, and our net debt adjusted EBITDA was 1.57 at March 31, 2024, up from 1.45 at March 31, 2023. Capital expenditures were $40.1 million in the March quarter and $285.1 million for fiscal year 2024. Our expectation for capital expenditures for fiscal year 2025 is about $175 million. Depreciation expense in the March quarter was $45.8 million. I will now turn it over to Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the March quarter, as well as our guidance for the June quarter.', 'Ganesh?', 'Ganesh Moorthy : Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Our March quarter results were consistent with our guidance with net sales down 24.9% sequentially and down 40.6% from the year ago quarter. As we endured through a major inventory correction. Non-GAAP gross margin came in as expected at 60.3% and non-GAAP operating margin was better than expected at 32.9% due to the strong expense control programs we had in place. However, as Eric mentioned, our tax rate was higher than expected and as a result our consolidated non-GAAP diluted EPS only met expectations at $0.57 per share. Our revenue decline resulted in March quarter EBITDA dropping and as a result our net leverage ratio rose to 1.57x. We expect our net leverage to rise modestly for a few quarters, as trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA drops when replacing stronger prior year quarters, with weaker current year quarters.', 'However, our cash generation capability remains strong and we are committed to our capital return plan. Our capital return to shareholders in the June quarter will increase to 87.5% of our March quarter adjusted free cash flow as we continue on our path to return 100% of our adjusted free cash flow to shareholders by the March quarter of calendar year 2025. Reflecting on our fiscal year 2024 results, it was a roller coaster year with a positive start that was followed by a major inventory correction. As compared to fiscal year 2023, revenue declined 9.5% to $7.6 billion. Non-GAAP operating margin was resilient at 43.9% as we took the actions required to respond to the major inventory correction. Capital return to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buybacks in fiscal 2024 was $1.89 billion, representing a 15.4% growth as compared to fiscal year 2023.', ""My thanks to our worldwide team for their support, hard work, and diligence as we navigate a difficult environment and focus on actions that we believe position us well to thrive in the long-term. Taking a look at our fiscal year 2024 net sales from a product line perspective, our mixed-signal microcontroller net sales were down 10.2% and represented 56% of Microchip's overall revenue. Our analog net sales were down 15.2% and represented 26.4% of Microchip's overall revenue. While we don't normally break out our FPGA product line results, it is noteworthy that our fiscal year 2024 FPGA revenue exceeded $679 million and set another record. FPGA revenue grew over 22% as compared to fiscal 2023 and delivered operating margins of a north of corporate average."", ""We deliver market-leading mid-range FPGA solutions with best-in-class low power, reliability, and security, and are especially well-suited for the fast emerging opportunities around artificial intelligence at the edge. Our overall FPGA design win momentum is strong across multiple end markets. A few other product line notes of significance. Early in April, we closed our acquisition of Seoul Korea-based VSI, an ADAS and Digital Cockpit Connectivity Pioneer, to extend our Automotive Networking Market leadership. This acquisition adds Automotive SerDes Alliance Motion Link technology, otherwise known as ASA-ML, to Microchip's broad Ethernet and PCIe automotive networking portfolio to enable next generation software defined vehicles. With the anticipated increase in the adoption of advanced camera-based driver assistance systems, in-cabin monitoring, safety and convenience features, and multi-screen digital cockpits for next-generation software-defined vehicles, there is a growing requirement for more highly asymmetric raw data and video links and higher bandwidths, which the ASA Motion Link Open Standard supports."", 'Also last month, we closed our acquisition of Neuronix AI Labs, whose innovative software technology enhances AI-enabled intelligent edge solutions and increases neural networking capabilities. This technology expands our capabilities for power-efficient AI-enabled edge solutions deployed on FPGAs. Neuronix AI Labs provides neural network sparsity optimization technology that enables the reduction in power, size, and calculation for tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation while maintaining high accuracy. Finally, in July, we expect to announce our entry into the 64-bit embedded microprocessor market with a suite of products, development tools, and other support requirements to address high-performance embedded processing applications, including AI-enabled edge solutions.', ""This will extend our strong 32-bit embedded microprocessor portfolio to higher performance and increased capabilities, while preserving Microchip's historically strong ecosystem of leading development tools to make adoption easy for embedded system design engineers. Microchip is the only company to offer the widest embedded control and processing platform from 8-bit to 64-bit, as well as FPGAs, with a common development tool ecosystem that's empowering customers to innovate and reuse their work across a wide spectrum of markets and applications. Now for some color on the March quarter and the general business environment. All regions of the world and most of our end-markets, with the exception of aerospace and defense and the artificial intelligence subset of data centers were weak."", ""We believe that our product shipments were significantly lower than the end-market consumption of our products as our distribution channels drained inventory during the quarter. Our broad base of customers continued to lower their inventory and adjust their business plans in the midst of a weak macro environment and an uncertain outlook. With no major supply constraints, coupled with very short lead times and a weak macro environment, we believe that as inventory destocking, as well as reduction in target inventory levels that is underway at multiple levels, that our direct customers and distributors buy from us, our indirect customers who buy through our distributors, and in some cases our customers' customers. We are however, also seeing early signs of green shoots in our business."", 'First, the level of requests to cancellations and push-outs has started to subside. Second, our bookings have started to pick up, albeit from low levels. February bookings were the highest in eight months. March bookings were the highest in all of fiscal 2024, and April bookings were higher than March. Third, the new bookings are aging over a shorter period of time. And fourth, the number of expedites and shipment pull-in requests are growing. Collectively, these green shoots, we believe, are pointing to the formation of a bottom. Our average lead times continue to be eight weeks or less. During a period of business uncertainty, we believe short lead times are the best way to help customers navigate the environment successfully and improve the quality of backlog placed with us.', 'However, the significant reduction in lead time is also resulting in reduced near-term visibility for our business. Given the severity of the inventory correction, our factories around the world are running at lower utilization rates. And our pre-major fabs will take another two-week shutdown in the June quarter in order to help control the growth of inventory. Our internal capacity expansion actions remain paused. We expect our capital investments in fiscal year 2025 will be low, even as we prepare for the long-term growth of our business. On the CHIPS Act front, we have nothing new to report. The CHIPS office has completed their diligence for the grants we are seeking, and we are working towards an agreement. At this stage of a major inventory correction, we believe that the days of inventory metric, whether for Microchip or for our distributors, can be deceptive, as this is a backward-looking indicator measuring off of the baseline that is well below where we believe end-market consumption is at.', 'For inventory planning, we are, therefore focused on where we believe consumption is running and will likely run in the coming quarters. We continue to work with our distribution partners to attempt to find the right balance of inventory required to serve their customers, manage through their cash flow requirements and be positioned for the eventual strengthening of business conditions. The operating expense reduction efforts we implemented last quarter, including broad-based salary sacrifices are continuous this quarter. The shutdown for manufacturing team members and pay cuts for non-manufacturing team members are consistent with our long-standing culture of shared sacrifices and down cycles and shared rewards and up cycles. Our culture of shared sacrifice protects our valuable employees from layoffs, helps enable us to support customers and maintain our design win momentum, helps ensure that manufacturing capacity can be turned on quickly as business conditions strengthen and helps enable our product development teams to maintain their pace of new solution introductions.', ""Now let's get into the guidance for the June quarter. While we see a number of green shoots in our business indicators, we still need turns orders within the quarter to meet our guidance. Operating in a high turns environment has historically been normal for Microchip. It is just not a position we have found ourselves in over the last few years due to supply-constrained high backlog environment, we and the industry experience. Taking all the factors we have discussed on the call today into consideration, we expect our net sales for the June quarter to be between $1.22 billion and $1.26 billion. We believe that the June 2024 quarter marks the bottom of the cycle for Microchip and that our business will return to sequential revenue growth in the September 2024 quarter."", 'We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 59% and 61% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 28.25% and 28.75% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating profit to be between 30.25% and 32.75% of sales, and we expect our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $0.48 and $0.56. We believe that the fundamental characteristics of growth, profitability and cash generation of our business remain intact. We are confident that our solutions remain the engine of innovation for the applications and end markets we serve. Our focus on total system solutions and key market megatrends continue to fuel strong design win momentum, which we expect will drive above-market long-term growth. We remain committed to executing our Microchip 3.0 strategic imperatives, which we believe will deliver sustained results and substantial shareholder value.', 'Last but not least a month ago, we appointed Rich Simoncic as Chief Operating Officer. Rich is a Microchip Lifer who has been with us for 35 years in many different capacities, which has been expanding his role over the last few years, and he and I will jointly lead the Microchip global enterprise so that we can apply our combined leadership capacity to engage the opportunities and challenges that are ahead of us. With that, let me pass it back on to Steve to talk more about our cash return to shareholders. Steve?', 'Steve Sanghi: Thank you, Ganesh, and good afternoon, everyone. I would like to provide you with a further update on our cash return strategy. The Board of Directors approved an increase in the dividend of 18% from the year ago quarter to a record [$0.452] (ph) per share. During the last quarter, we purchased a record $387.4 million of our stock in the open-market. We also paid out a record $242.5 million in dividends. Thus, the total cash return was a record $629.9 million. This amount was 82.5% of our actual adjusted free cash flow of $763.4 million during the December 2023 quarter. Our net leverage at the end of March 2024 was 1.57 times. Ever since we achieved an investment-grade rating for our debt in November 2021 and pivoted to increasing our capital return to shareholders, we have returned a total of $4.23 billion to shareholders through March 31, 2024, by a combination of dividends and share buybacks.', 'During this period, our share buyback in the open market was approximately 30.4 million shares, representing approximately 5.7% of our shares outstanding. In the current June quarter, we will use the adjusted free cash flow level from the March quarter to target the amount of cash returned to shareholders. The adjusted free cash flow excludes amounts we collected from our customers for long-term supply assurance payments, these payments are refundable when purchase commitments are fulfilled. Our adjusted free cash flow for the March quarter was $389.9 million, so our target return to shareholders would be 87.5% or $341.2 million of that amount. However, as Ganesh mentioned, we did complete two small acquisitions in this June quarter. So we are reducing our share buyback amount to reflect the cash outlay for those deals.', 'Thus, in the June quarter, our cash return to shareholders is expected to be $315.3 million, out of which dividends are expected to be approximately $243 million and our expected stock buyback will be approximately $72.3 million. Going forward, we plan to continue to increase our adjusted free cash flow to return to shareholders by 500 basis points every quarter until we reach 100% of adjusted free cash flow returned to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. They will take three more quarters, and we expect that dividends over time will represent approximately 50% of our cash returns. With that, operator will you please poll for questions.', 'See also', '25 States with the Highest and Lowest Resignation Rates and', '15 Countries with the Highest Average Salaries in Asia.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

If you want to skip our coverage of the latest developments in the artificial intelligence scene, then you can skip ahead to 5 Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy Now According to Wall Street Analysts. ', 'As companies are reporting their financial results for the first quarter of 2024, artificial intelligence once again appears to be one of the leitmotifs of the current earnings season.\xa0While the data for the current earnings season is unavailable, FactSet estimated that out of 179 companies that had earnings calls between December 15 and March 15, the term AI was mentioned on average 13 times. The tally of 179 marked the second highest for the term ""AI"" in the transcripts over the course of the past ten years, and was just three shy of the current record of 181 set during Q2 2023.', 'Within that dataset, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) led the pack, as it mentioned the term AI 114 times during the company’s latest earnings call. The chip maker, known for its GPUs, has seen a significant boost in its stock price on the back of strong demand for semiconductors that power various AI applications. Its shares are up by a cool 216% since May 2023, after CEO Jensen Huang shared that he foresaw a the need for a ""trillion dollars of installed global data center infrastructure"" to transform computing from ""general purpose to accelerated.""', ""Since then, NVIDIA's CEO, who is widely credited by the industry to have lead the development of GPU-accelerated computing applications such as medical imaging, reiterated his estimates of the AI industry. The latest on this front came in February 2024, when at the World Government Summit, Huang not only elaborated on his vision for accelerated computing but went on to stress that continued advancement of processors to fuel AI use cases will be energy efficient as well. According to him:"", '""So now, we\'re in the beginning of this new era. And what\'s going to happen is, there\'s about a trillion dollars worth of installed base of data centers around the world. And over the course four, five years, we\'ll have two trillion dollars worth of data centers that will be . .uh. . powering software around the world. And this architecture for accelerated computing is ideal for this next generation of software called generative AI. So that\'s really at the core of what is happening. While we\'re replacing the installed base, of, general purpose computing, remember that the performance of the architecture is going to be improving at the same time. So, you can\'t assume, just that you will buy more computers; you have to also assume that the computers are going to become faster.', 'And, therefore, the total amount that you need is not going to be as much. Otherwise the mathematics that we just assumed, that computers never get any faster, you might come to the conclusion, we need fourteen different planets, and three different galaxies, and you know, four more Suns, to, to fuel all this. But obviously, computer architecture continues to advance.""', ""All this focus on NVIDIA and AI means that its upcoming earnings release will be closely watched by investors and analysts worldwide. Another firm that once again has become the center of attention after quarter earnings is the Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp parent Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Meta's stock had a strong run in February 2024 on the back of its fourth-quarter earnings report, which was accompanied by a surprise $0.5 quarterly dividend announcement. However, in April nearly all of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s gains were wiped out as investors looked past better-than-expected results and focused on the forward guidance that included Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s plans to spend $40 billion this year, most of which will go towards its AI initiatives."", ""On the other hand, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) have managed to keep investor pessimism at bay, at least for now. Both companies reported their earnings a day after Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Investors were pleased to see both Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) report robust growth in the Core segments, where artificial intelligence served as a major catalyst. Microsoft and Google's parent reported revenue and earnings above expectations and expressed optimism regarding maintaining the same momentum going forward."", 'For Microsoft and Alphabet, the earnings from their cloud business divisions provide a glimpse into the firms\' AI performance in the first quarter. Microsoft\'s overall results saw it beat analyst revenue and EPS estimates of $60.8 billion and $2.82, respectively, by posting revenue of $61.9 billion and earnings of $2.94 per share. Microsoft\'s Intelligent Cloud segment\'s sales sat at $26.7 billion, while Azure, the cloud computing platform, grew by 31%. At the earnings call, CFO Amy Wood also briefly commented on AI revenue growth by sharing that ""AI services contributed 7 points of growth as expected.""', 'Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\'s first quarter earnings also highlighted AI due to strong performance by the Google Cloud segment. The company\'s Cloud business, which offers AI product bundles like Google One, posted $9.57 billion in revenue and marked a 28% growth on the year. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai shared details for Google Cloud\'s AI Hypercomputer, as he outlined that ""60% of funded Gen AI startups and nearly 90% of Gen AI unicorns are Google Cloud customers."" The executive added that business and corporate interest in AI was proceeding smoothly, with firms such as Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) ""deploying Gen AI-driven tools to its nearly 10,000 call center agents to achieve faster resolution times for customers.""', '""And we shared that more than one million developers are now using our generative AI across tools, including AI Studio and Vertex AI. We spoke about how customers like Bristol-Myers Squibb and Etsy can quickly and easily build agents and connect them to their existing systems. For example, . Customers can also now ground their Gen AI with Google Search and their own data from their enterprise databases and applications.""', 'So, as Wall Street adapts and adjusts to AI, we decided to take a look at which AI stocks analysts are in love with.

We have also talked about the issues stemming from overworking. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Countries with the Longest Working Hours in the World.', 'Overworking, especially during young adulthood, comes with a plethora of challenges, according to a study. Surprisingly, only a quarter of participants in the study maintained traditional daytime hours, while the majority had variable schedules such as night shifts and rotating hours. This discrepancy in work schedules resulted in less sleep and increased vulnerability to depression and poor health by the age of 50. Indeed, the toll of overwork manifests in physical and mental health struggles.', ""The repercussions of overwork are particularly stark for marginalized groups. Black men and women and workers with limited education disproportionately bear the burden of night shifts and volatile work schedules. For instance, the study cited above says that white college-educated women with stable daytime jobs reported significantly more sleep than their Black male counterparts with unstable employment histories. Moreover, insufficient sleep resulting from overwork is not just a personal inconvenience; it's a public health concern. Chronic diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and obesity are linked to inadequate sleep, with African Americans facing a higher risk due to systemic factors."", ""In Europe, the specter of overwork also looms large as inflation continues its relentless climb. With costs increasing, many find themselves strapped for cash. Recent data from Qualtrics reveals that nearly half of UK employees are either seeking or considering a second job, with 77% contemplating overtime or extra shifts just to make ends meet. This trend isn't isolated; Germany and France report similar sentiments, with major portions of their workforce contemplating dual employment or higher-paying roles."", 'Apart from France and Germany, Montenegro is one of the countries with the longest work hours in Europe whereas Netherlands is one of the countries with the shortest work hours in Europe.', ""However, in 2024, we do expect overworking culture to change. According to a recent survey by Nous, over 40% of HR leaders acknowledge that employees are now tackling more 'life admin' tasks during work hours. In terms of formal regulations, in California, proposed legislation aims to safeguard employees' personal time by penalizing employers who contact them after work hours. Under the bill, employers breaching this right could face a minimum fine of $100. The bill stipulates clear agreements between employers and employees regarding working hours and thus, allows individuals to ignore non-emergency communications outside these times. Speaking of working hours, the average working hours per day in the US were 8.42 in 2022 on a weekday."", ""To help the compromised state of overworked employees and ensure their retention, Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) engage in employee wellbeing through their volunteering programs. According to Benevity's 2022 talent retention study, participation in workplace volunteering and purpose programs reduces the likelihood of employees leaving by 52%."", 'Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) boasts a 75% employee participation rate in its volunteering program. Both the companies offer both in-person and virtual volunteering opportunities that cater to diverse preferences.', ""On the other hand, Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) has an 85% volunteer participation rate and focuses on offering diverse volunteering options to align with employees' personal purposes. Their volunteering opportunities range from urban farming to theater programming."", ""Additionally, both companies tend to focus on leadership involvement as a catalyst for employee engagement.

It has been almost one year since we outlined our 2026 financial objectives, and I'm pleased with the progress we have made during that time, including first quarter of this year. In the first quarter, we set new highs for non-GAAP subscription and overall gross margins as well as our second best adjusted EBITDA results.I mentioned this because we typically see our best adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow results during the second half of each year. And with that, I will dive into our results for the first quarter. Subscription revenue was $64.3 million, up 15% year over year, and total revenue was $80.7 million up 10% year over year, both exceeding the guidance ranges.Our first quarter recurring revenue was consistent at 84% of total revenue and our trailing 12-month gross revenue retention continued to be better than 93%. Calculated billings in the first quarter increased 3% year over year and 11% for the trailing 12 months in line with our expectations and the seasonality of our business.We expect the trend of calculated billings this year to continue to be consistent with what we saw last year. Our non-GAAP subscription gross margin was 79% in the first quarter, an improvement of over 140 basis points year over year. We also delivered a 9% non-GAAP services gross margin in the first quarter, an improvement of over 1,500 basis points year over year.With these improvements, our overall non-GAAP gross margin increased to 67% in the first quarter, an improvement of 315 basis points in non-GAAP gross margin year over year. I'm very pleased with the progress we are making on our key gross margin metrics we generated adjusted EBITDA of $4.6 million in the first quarter, significantly exceeding guidance and achieving a near 300% improvement year over year.Our continued focus on operational efficiency through the initiatives we have in place, such as infusing AI in all aspects of our operations are helping us continue to drive better profitability. Our free cash flow burn in the first quarter was 4.9 million, which is about in line with our burn in the first quarter of last year. I'm very pleased with this outcome, given the increase in incentive payments made in the first quarter of this year versus last year.As a reminder, it is typical for us to have higher expenses in the first half of the year because of payroll taxes as well as marketing initiatives and events.From a balance sheet perspective, we exited the first quarter with $166.4 million of cash and investments later this month, we have $21.7 million of our convertible notes due, and we currently plan to pay this balance with our existing cash and investments. Our first quarter non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.04 per share, also exceeding guidance.Now turning to guidance for Q2, we expect second quarter subscription revenue to be in the range of 64 to $64.5 million, representing 12% growth at the midpoint. We expect second quarter total revenue to be in the range of $80.5 million to $81.5 million, representing 7% growth at the midpoint. We are anticipating services to be essentially flat due to the outsized 25% growth we saw in services revenue during the second quarter last year.This is impacting our expected total revenue growth rate by as much as two percentage points. We expect second quarter adjusted EBITDA of between $1 million and $2 million, an improvement of $1.4 million year over year.We are expecting an increase in the selling and marketing expenses for outperform, which will take place later this month using a non-GAAP estimated tax rate of 22%. We anticipate second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share at breakeven to $0.02 per share based on an estimated $48.2 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding.For the full year, we are raising our guidance for subscription revenue, total revenue and adjusted EBITDA. We now expect subscription revenue to be in the range of $263.5 million to $265.5 million, representing 13% growth at the midpoint and total revenue to be in the range of $332.5 million to $334.5 million, representing 10% growth at the midpoint.Similar to what we saw in Q2 of last year. We have visibility to a higher level of services revenue in the second half of this year from what our guidance would imply for the first half of 2024. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $17 million to $20 million, representing an improvement of $12.5 million year over year.In closing, I would like to thank our global team and our customers for their continued support of PROS. We also thank you, our shareholders for your support of PROS and we look forward to speaking with you at our upcoming events. And I will now turn the call back over to the operator for questions. Operator?"", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions)Scott Berg, Needham.', 'Scott Berg', ""Hi, everyone, and congrats on the nice quarter and like through the profitability improvements done nice steady year over year trend there.Andreas, I wanted to ask a question. I actually feel kind of weird about I'm asking is it's on your new copilot functionality that you that you announced. It's only where it because I want to ask you how you monetize AI, or how you plan to monetize new AI technology,Knowing that you've been monetizing the eye for obviously a couple of decades now, but how should we think about this innovation being infused into the platform, is there an opportunity to step up your RPU per customers and costs are or is it really more about embedding that functionality to create further differentiation in the front?"", 'Andres Reiner', ""Yes, great question, Scott. Look, we're very excited about the sales scope, quality innovation because I think Microsoft is changing the way that sales reps will work in the future and bringing this type of technology really brings them the best AI possible to continuously respond to customers.So for us to be embedded into these workflows and then being able to help reps quickly respond to prospects with the right e-mail response with the right quotes powered by PROS creates a significant differentiation in the market.So I think this of one and four months it adds a lot of differentiation for our platform and the ability to now extend our, you know, e-mail threats all the way through being able to dynamically create a quote, powered by PROS and in a lot more adoption of our solution in the market. So see anybody that buys sales copilot can now embed Pro CPQ and have a high-powered deals right there in their fingerprints.So we see this as a big opportunity to continue to innovate with Microsoft and something that helps us drive our strategy of landing more deals and realizing value and driving more expansions."", 'Scott Berg', ""Got it, helpful.Thank you. And then from a follow-up perspective, you hired a new CRO, Todd, I feel like you and I just had this conversation about two months ago if you're going to hire a new CRO or not. And I think the comment I made at that point in time was your best or at least most consistent sales execution last five or six years has seemingly been one a dot Rainer has been running sales.What does what does that bring to the table that's different than and maybe the prior couple of people that have been in this role? And how does he kind of fuel your growth strategies over the near term?"", 'Andres Reiner', ""Yes. Great question, Scott. Look I'm really excited that Todd and his team, he brings a unique skill in sales go to market. I think a lot of the work that we've done in building our land realized expand strategy and our platform, which position us to really scale the business. If you think about deal velocity, deal consistency that we've driven, we've dramatically increased.What Todd brings is I'm very clear experiencing significantly scaling sales organizations and we think tied to our goal of getting to Rule of 40 by 2026, we think now is the time to invest in our go-to-market team this year was very important for us to make a big improvement in profitability and start to invest in our go to market and scaling it.The other aspect that I'm really excited about is we're seeing B-to-B and B-to-C converge. You're seeing a lot of our wins that we're talking about. They're not just traditional B2B stories. They're B2B with B2C and direct to consumer strategies as well. So we're seeing more of a unified platform in our go to market and abilities to really bring our sales go to market team and to drive more efficiency and scale as we move for us. I'm really excited putting that are going to be working closely together.We're aligned on this strategy is not about changing our strategy to do so, but really amplifying that strategy and really setting us up for 25 and 26. I could tell you, I'm really excited in what he brings different is very strong sales go-to-market background."", 'Scott Berg', 'Understood. And congrats on the nice quarter again, and thanks for taking my questions. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'J. Parker Lane, Stifel.', 'Matthew Kikkert', 'This is Matthew Kikkert for Parker. Thank you for taking my questions. First, the last call you mentioned a 28% reduction in new logo sales cycle times for B2B. Are you continuing to see improvements in that metric? And what do you believe is driving that?', 'Andres Reiner', ""Yes. So I would say it's been consistent. So we're continuing to see, you know, the improvement remain the same. So no changes, you know. And so right now, no real changes from what we're seeing. We're seeing them continue to maintain."", 'Matthew Kikkert', 'Okay. Sounds good. And then turning into the marketplace, which continues to be a focus for you this year, what are the attach rates looking like there and how big of a role. Can the marketplace play in your achievement of Rule 40 goals going forward?', 'Andres Reiner', ""Yes, great question. And I will tell you right now, the marketplace is still in the infancy in that creation. But what I'm really excited is the opportunity to have new solutions in that marketplace that can be activated with real real small, little to no activation, which will allow customers to now be able to expand on some of our products in a very, very fast way and in I think that over time, the opportunity that we have with the marketplace is getting our customers to adopt and want these solutions to trial and adopt them in a much faster way.So we're very, very excited about the marketplace and this is the beginning of a product-led growth strategy. And I think a lot of work has gone really proud of the product team for bringing together the platform in the marketplace to allow us to bring these new solutions to market and allowing our customers to activate them seamlessly as we move forward.So right now, the current attach is small over time we see this increasing quite a bit as we get to our 2026 goals."", 'Matthew Kikkert', 'Terrific. Thank you. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Patrick Schultz, Baird.', 'Patrick Schultz', ""Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess maybe starting off on travel. I think last quarter you called out you have started to see some nice momentum in that business, and it seems like that's continued this quarter.Could you maybe frame how the recovery path has trended relative to expectations? And then when looking at the rest of the year how are you thinking about the contribution from new logos versus existing customer expansion?"", 'Andres Reiner', ""Yes, great questions. So I would say, look, as travel continues to drive improvements, I would say you know, typically in the year, you know, early on it, travel tends to be more back-end loaded or loaded in the year, but we are seeing good wins both in net new and existing spent expansions, but we're still seeing B2B drive that growth.So make no mistake about that. B2B is continuing to drive the growth. Travel is continuing to improve, but we expect that similar to last year back end, it's stronger than the front end overall in terms of our sales cycle times in travel, they're still not back to the pre-COVID years.But from a deal growth, we're seeing very good deal of growth in B2B. We're seeing better improvement on deal cycle times and continuing to see that as a main growth driver for the business."", 'Patrick Schultz', 'Okay. Very helpful. And then maybe a quick follow-up for some responses in financials on cycling on the new versus existing?', 'Andres Reiner', ""We expect that to be for the year that 50 50 split, we're continuing to see strong on new logo wins as well as expansions and think of that. Obviously, our B2B driving more new new logo wins, travel, strong on on the expand. But I would say, look, we were very pleased with that expansion in the quarter, both in B2B and travel."", 'Patrick Schultz', ""Great.Appreciate the color there. And if I may, maybe just on subscription revenue for the year, you posted a strong start to the year. I think you beat Q1 guidance by about 1 million full year guidance. Looks like that was raised by a little bit less than that. Can you just talk about that dynamic there and why not pass through the full be?Has anything changed from a broader macro perspective since last quarter and nothing's changed from a broader macro perspective as it relates to the beat in Q1 and how much of that was applied to the full year?"", 'Stefan Schulz', ""We had a little bit of a benefit from a timing perspective in terms of how we initially modeled the year of the subscription rollout in terms of revenue recognition and we actually were able to pull some of that into Q1. And so that's why we had a bit of a beat in Q1 was was really moving some revenue up, which we'll always take when we can.And so that's why there was a 0.5 million of that 4 million that was reflected in the base as it pertains to our views for the rest of the year. As I said earlier, we don't really see anything change with the macro. We have increased our guidance a bit. But I would also tell you that our guidance philosophy is continuing to stay consistent. And that is we provide guidance on our numbers.We have a high degree of confidence we can achieve. And so as we go throughout the year. I expect we'll refine that more and more as our visibility improves, but nothing has really changed. We're very happy with where we sit as of today."", 'Patrick Schultz', 'Perfect. Appreciate the guys. Thanks for taking my questions.', 'Andres Reiner', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Brian Schwartz, Oppenheimer.', 'Brian Schwartz', 'Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my questions today. Andres. Can you talk a little bit more just about the sales productivity and Dom bookings that you had in Q1. You know, it does look like the year is a little bit more back-end loaded than it was when you gave guidance three months ago? And Dom, maybe if you can just provide a little insight into the productivity in Q1?', 'Andres Reiner', ""Yes. So overall, we're seeing pretty consistent on sales cycle times. I did say we've seen some improvement from a B2B perspective, but overall, it's remained on, you know, pretty pretty similar in terms of how the year is turning out is turning out pretty much how we expected side. I wouldn't say we've always been a back-end loaded. You know, back half of the year is stronger than the front half of the year. The year is turning out exactly how we predicted. So no changes there. And overall, in terms of our efficiencies and you know, in our win rates continue to improve."", 'Brian Schwartz', ""Thank you. And then the follow-up question I wanted to ask about also about the Microsoft copilot integration. Is your expectation I guess it's early now, but do you think that that will increase awareness for your AI driven dynamic pricing solution in the market?"", 'Andres Reiner', ""Yes, absolutely. There is no doubt like Microsoft and us are planning to market this as being the first partner that innovated on this, it is really, really important. And, you know, there aren't many AI solutions that that produced this much revenue, a margin uplift with quantifiable value that helped transform the sales process. So I think and both Microsoft and pros are very proud of this innovation.This is just the beginning, but it definitely will increase visibility within the Microsoft ecosystem. And we're very focused from a go to market on how we're going to amplify that visibility.One of the transformative areas of this sales, copilot that's unique. And I think it's been very clever on the Microsoft side is your technology can integrate with any CRM. So not just the Microsoft ecosystem, but also the salesforce.com ecosystem because you can plug in sales copilot on top of both sales force and Microsoft.So I think it really and unify the way that sales rep sell on and that's to be right there to help the reps respond faster and drive higher win rates at better margin. And revenue is said a very high ROI use case."", 'Brian Schwartz', ""And then one question for Stefan. Just wanted to ask you about how you're feeling about the visibility to on the second half now that you're one quarter into the year?I know Larry, last quarter, you felt that on the visibility wasn't as strong for for the back half of the year. I'm just wondering how you're feeling today if that it has at all improved now that we're one quarter into the year. Thanks for taking my questions."", 'Stefan Schulz', ""Yes, Brian, it has improved a bit from being 90 days, further down the line. We have a better view in terms of things like, you know, the amount of services that we're going to have to book on bookings that occurred both last year and this year, and I highlighted that in my prepared remarks, our visibility has improved to the degree that I can actually comment and say we expect to see a meaningful bump up in services revenue in the second half of the year.And I can also say that similarly on the on the subscription side, we have a better idea of what Q3 is going to look like given the bookings that we've had in Q1. So I had just as a point of color on that, as we look at the full year, you look at the mix last year, first half second half and how that unfolded, we're expecting subscription to be somewhat similar to this year's.So a similar ratio, if you will, first half the second half. And in services is what we're expecting to see a meaningful jump in the second half from what you saw in the first half of the year. So we're starting to get a better feel for how the year is going to shake out in. And that's the color we can give at this point in time."", 'Brian Schwartz', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'And next question is from Jason Celino with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.', 'Jason Celino', ""Great. Thanks for taking my question. Andres, in a bit of a philosophy of philosophical question, actually, I think several months ago there was a fast food chain that was looking at real-time pricing set menus. I don't think and then I'm going with through with that plan, but kind of shows you well, how far we've come with the industry as we think about pricing optimization today and reflect on kind of the technology and the adoption trend, especially for the industries that you serve today, what might be talking about three to five years?"", 'Andres Reiner', ""Yes, I would say, look, the adoption of dynamic pricing algorithm, especially for the B2B industries, which is over $30 billion on the TAM opportunity is huge. I mean, the adoption is still low and it's a great example to have less drop. For example, this quarter. That's one of the very important criterias and them selecting process really to power their over 500 reels retail stores with real-time pricing. So we see this use case applying very broadly in the B2B.Our space is more important than ever to compete and win. I think a lot of the challenges that companies are having is one, their products are changing pretty dramatic. So the configuration aspects of the products in personalization criteria. They have So recommending the right offer. And second is the right price of which they can win. That is in real time that is adapting to market changes so I would tell you look at a large percentage of the wins we're having.It's because of these real-time capabilities and our conviction of the growth opportunity and excitement that we have is we feel we're significantly ahead years ahead of anybody in the market in producing real-time AI algorithms that can scale.It can be pure machine run with very significant revenue and margin uplift. So I think we're still at the beginning of the journey. I would tell you it applies to the majority of the opportunities that we're closing. This is a very important component.Yes. No. Next to here. On the left-hand side, you know, the company in my neck of the woods. So yes, we are very excited about."", 'Jason Celino', 'And then one quick one for Stefan business linearity. I guess how did kind of sales execution in our business pipeline and close deals? How does that kind of fair throughout the quarter? Was it was all fairly consistent?', 'Stefan Schulz', ""Yes, I'd say fairly consistent. It always it leans heavily towards the 3rd month, and that's pretty typical of even when we talk about linearity, it linear linearity is assuming a certain percentage in month, one month two and a bigger percentage in month three of that's that's just the nature of the business, but nothing unusual in the first quarter at all."", 'Jason Celino', 'Okay, perfect. Thank you both.', 'Andres Reiner', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Nehal Chokshi, Northland Capital Markets.', 'Nehal Chokshi', ""Yes, thank you and congrats on a strong quarter here I'm talking, however, on billings Rose. Stefan mentioned 1,000 lending expectations was up 3% year over year. And then you also said that you expect billings growth to be consistent with the trend of last year. But I'm not sure what you mean by June of last year because that trend from last year was volatile on a year-over-year basis. So could you just give a little bit more color on what you mean there?"", 'Stefan Schulz', ""Yes, yes. No, all that's that's a good observation. So our calculated billings on a quarter to quarter basis are volatile and we saw that last year. And the point I was trying to make is we're expecting to see that volatility again this year, although I will say it might be muted a bit. In other words, the volatility be a little less than what we saw last year, which is I think it's a welcome to all of us in that regard. But I think in terms of a consistent pattern where the strengths of last year will match the strength, our vision."", 'Nehal Chokshi', ""Okay. So despite basically a year ago, tough compare you'd still expect that to be strength on a year-over-year basis?"", 'Andres Reiner', 'Yes.', 'Stefan Schulz', 'So I think in terms of our total revenue, we plan in calculated billings being in that same ZIP Code just like it was last year?', 'Nehal Chokshi', 'Yes. Okay. And then why are you expecting a deceleration of subscription revenue for Q2?', 'Stefan Schulz', ""It's really related to timing of recognition. So we were able to pull a little bit of revenue forward on the criteria we're actually required. And so it was a little faster than what we had originally modeled. And so we we had a little bit of a beat in Q1 as it relates to that.And so that had a had an impact on the second quarter number. And we see that throughout our history. There are times when we'll see a concentrated amount of recognition occur in one quarter versus another. But as I was talking earlier, our visibility allows us to see how this year's going to unfold. And we're expecting to see that number increase again in the second half of the year."", 'Nehal Chokshi', 'And that sooner than expected recognition of some incremental subscription revenue within a quarter that had to do with the strong billings that you saw in Q4, we had strong bookings rather because of that strong ARR that you put up there.', 'Stefan Schulz', ""Well, yes, but I wouldn't I wouldn't say it's a direct correlation. It just happened to be the transaction that was recorded in the fourth quarter that we were able to accelerate the recognition on basically the delivery happened a little faster than what we had what we had assumed."", 'Nehal Chokshi', 'Great. Thank you very much. Congrats.', 'Andres Reiner', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Victor Cheng, Bank of America.', 'Victor Cheng', ""Hi, Andreas and Stefan. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on a solid quarter again. Maybe first on a I can give us some color on how your Gen four AI. has been resonating with customers and what's the adoption rate right now?And then more broadly, how should we think about whether generative I would change the playing field. Obviously, you've now integrated with copilot, and you've talked a lot about we are the opportunities with Microsoft copilot for sales. How should I think about maybe future plans on leveraging Genesis AI capabilities in into your portfolio?"", 'Andres Reiner', ""Yes. Great questions. So in terms of Gen four AI, I think has been transformative for the market. I would tell you that all the deals we're winning, where there's less fraud or we're seeing an expansion at cargo lux or any of the deals I talked about, you know, the Gen four technology is a very big leap compared to or Gen three technology, and it's resonating really well, especially in these type of markets where you have high volatility, you can't go with that typical segmentation based on pure historical data and as many companies have in the marketplace. So that continues to play a big role.Generative AI. one of the really transformative parts of or AI platform is our ability to and fumble multiple algorithms and L. and lands in Q2, including our you know, the OpenEye technology that we're using with Microsoft. It allows us to leverage those for the right use cases. So think of a sales, assistant type of technology, pricing, assistant type of technology, those are where we're leveraging LLM.'s technology and we'll continue to do so as well as many aspects of our business.But it's a combination of many types of algorithms that we're bringing to bring a higher level of intelligence as to our solution and continue to transform our, you know, the AI space. So I think we're very excited about being able to leverage all of these different types of AI algorithms for the right problem areas, and we'll continue to innovate very closely with Microsoft, especially on the generative AI front."", 'Victor Cheng', ""But I think you and maybe one follow-up on share-based comp I know it's a bit higher for Q1 and for full year as well. Can you give us some color on that? Is there any kind of wage inflation that we are we should be factoring in a bit more?"", 'Stefan Schulz', ""No, that, Tom, that's a timing of some accelerated expense that we took in the first quarter. It's basically going to take expense away from the rest of the year. So what you should see is as the year unfolds, our percentage of stock-based compensation expense should actually decline year over year from about 14% a year ago to about 13% this year. It's really more about the acceleration of some of that that occurred in the first quarter and you'll see the benefits throughout the rest of the year."", 'Victor Cheng', 'Very clear.

Meanwhile, Alphabet's most recent quarter (the first quarter of 2024) has shown signs that its heavy investment in AI is beginning to pay off."", 'Brands like YouTube, Android, Chrome, and Google have made Alphabet a tech behemoth, garnering billions of users worldwide. The company has used its vast user base to build a lucrative advertising business. And now, the popularity of these platforms is providing Alphabet with multiple opportunities to boost its venture into AI.', ""So, here's why it's not too late to buy Alphabet's stock."", 'Alphabet posted its Q1 2024 results on April 25, leading its stock to pop 6%. The company delivered promising earnings, with revenue rising 15% year over year to $81 billion.', ""During the quarter, Alphabet enjoyed significant gains in its advertising division, with Google Services sales increasing by 14%. Macroeconomic headwinds hit the company's ad business hard in 2022 and at the start of 2023. However, recent earnings suggest these challenges have subsided."", ""About 80% of Alphabet's revenue comes from its ad services. Yet, its biggest growth catalyst over the next decade will likely be its AI-focused cloud business with Google Cloud. The segment reported revenue growth of 28% year over year while operating income skyrocketed 371% to $900 million."", ""Alphabet has gradually expanded its AI cloud services over the last year, launching its most powerful AI model, Gemini, in December 2023. The company's investment in generative technology is beginning to pay off as businesses increasingly use its services to integrate AI into their workflow."", 'In addition to a positive quarter, Alphabet announced plans to lay off at least 200 employees from its ""Core"" organization as part of its latest round of budget cuts. Like many tech companies moving past the economic downturn of 2022, Alphabet is prioritizing profitability and slashing anything it deems unnecessary, which only strengthens its outlook going forward.', ""Alphabet has been slightly overshadowed in AI since last year as rivals Amazon and Microsoft appeared to get a better start in the industry. A fumbled launch for its AI model Gemini and the third largest market share in cloud computing (behind Amazon and Microsoft) concerned investors. However, Alpahbet's latest quarterly earnings have tempered those fears."", ""Alphabet's cloud business appears to be taking off as it attracts more users, proven by its nearly 30% revenue growth and soaring profits. Meanwhile, expanded AI capabilities with its Gemini and other models will help the company bolster multiple areas of its business, such as offering more efficient advertising, creating a Search experience closer to OpenAI's ChatGPT, improving its productivity services, and even generative updates to Android. In fact, Alphabet announced AI-powered ads last year as it uses Gemini to enhance its ad solutions."", ""The company's reach in tech is vast, and with $69 billion in free cash flow, Alphabet has the brand power and financial resources to go far in AI. The tech giant announced last month it would invest $3 billion in building data centers in Indiana and Virginia as it works to strengthen Google Cloud. Additionally, Alphabet will spend $75 million to fuel its Google AI Opportunity Fund, which aims to teach Americans AI skills."", ""Moreover, this chart shows Alphabet is potentially one of the best-valued AI stocks. The company's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and price-to-free cash flow are among some of the lowest compared to Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple. Forward P/E and price-to-free cash flow are helpful when determining a stock's value, as they consider a company's financial prospects. For both valuation metrics, the lower the figure, the better the value."", ""As a result, this chart indicates Alphabet shares are a bargain compared to its peers. And with arguably similar, if not more, potential in AI than these companies, Alphabet shares are a no-brainer. Despite having the third largest market share in cloud computing after Microsoft and Amazon, its free cash flow is similar to Microsoft's $70 billion and significantly more than Amazon's $46 billion, suggesting Alphabet has the financial resources to keep up with its rivals in the coming years."", ""Additionally, the billions of users that Alphabet's platforms attract could be leveraged to expand in AI, becoming a major growth driver in the commercial and public adoption of AI services."", ""Alphabet's stock is up 536% in the last ten years. Yet, it appears nowhere near hitting its ceiling.

But one of the simplest and most effective means of generating income is to invest in dividend stocks, while provide passive income without the need to sell an asset, while also allowing you to participate in the stock market.', ""Finding a company that can grow in value while distributing dividend payments is a dream come true for long-term investors. And that's exactly what Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Air Products and Chemicals (NYSE: APD) are."", ""Meanwhile, the J.P. Morgan Equity Premium Income ETF (NYSEMKT: JEPI) yields a whopping 7.6% and includes exposure to top companies from Amazon to ExxonMobil. Here's what makes Microsoft, Air Products, and the J.P. Morgan Equity Premium Income ETF worth buying now."", ""Daniel Foelber (Microsoft): Microsoft's mere 0.7% dividend yield results from its outperforming stock price, not a lack of raises. Over the last five years, the stock is up 223%, but the dividend has increased by 63%. Zoom out over the last decade, and Microsoft is up a jaw-dropping 906%, while the dividend is up 168%."", ""Given the stock's strong performance, Microsoft investors surely don't mind the low yield. But investors who don't own Microsoft and are considering buying the stock may wonder why the 0.7% yield is worth it, let alone grounds for a lifetime of passive income."", 'The reason is that Microsoft can easily afford to make sizable increases to its dividend every year. Earnings have grown at a faster rate than dividend raises, which is why the payout ratio is now at a 10-year low of less than 25%.', ""A payout ratio under 75% is good for a reliable company, but below 50% is even better if a company has cyclical earnings. Part of the reason for Microsoft's low payout ratio is that it rewards its shareholders with stock repurchases and dividends. Microsoft has reduced its share count despite its sizable stock-based compensation expense. Buybacks are an important means of preventing dilution, and we can expect buybacks to continue to accelerate and the outstanding share count to meaningfully decrease over the coming years."", 'If Microsoft keeps outperforming the S&P 500, then the dividend will merely be a cherry on top of a winning position. But if Microsoft languishes, expect the yield to noticeably increase thanks to strong dividend growth and room for the payout ratio to go up if needed. Either way, Microsoft has what it takes to reward shareholders.', ""Scott Levine (Air Products): It may be impossible to look into the future and see which stocks will provide investors with years of passive income, but it's certainly helpful to turn your attention to the past. With a peak at a company's previous performance, you can gain insight into how strong a candidate it is to achieve years of returning capital to shareholders. Air Products is a prime option."", ""Over its 80-year history, Air Products has emerged as a leading provider of industrial gases and related equipment to businesses operating in a variety of industries, including energy, aerospace, and healthcare, to name a few. For forward-looking investors, today's a great time to gas up on Air Products stock, which currently has a 2.9% forward-yielding dividend and is hanging on the discount rack."", ""Growing its dividend for 42 consecutive years, Air Products has demonstrated a steadfast commitment to rewarding shareholders. With respect to the more recent past, it's worth noting the company's dedication to its payout. From 2014 through 2024, Air Products has hiked its dividend at a 9% compound annual growth rate, while averaging a payout ratio of 62.3% over the past 10 years."", ""Because the company serves a wide variety of industries, it's unlikely a downturn in any one would wreak havoc with the company's financials, thus jeopardizing the dividend. Moreover, the company has a strong competitive advantage. Operating over 750 production facilities and over 1,800 miles of industrial gas pipeline, Air Products has developed a robust infrastructure that could hardly be disrupted by upstart industrial gas companies. Add to this the company's commanding position as a hydrogen supplier, and the allure of Air Products becomes even more obvious."", 'With shares of Air Products valued at about 15.2 times operating cash flow -- a discount to their five-year average cash flow multiple of 17.4 -- now seems like a great opportunity to start of position in this industrial gas powerhouse.', ""Lee Samaha (J.P.

A call option on the index is the right to buy the index at a specific price, called the strike price, up to an expiration date. Investors in call options have to pay a premium for that right.', ""As such, when this ETF sells a call option, it's looking to pick up the premium by the index not rising above the strike price, so investors don't realize the option. You could summarize the strategy as follows:"", 'When the S&P 500 rises sharply in the month, the ETF will lose money on selling call options but make money due to its equity exposure.', 'When the S&P 500 falls sharply in the month, the ETF will probably lose money on its equities exposure but make money picking up premiums.', 'In low-volatility months, the ETF should earn money by picking up premiums and may make or lose money on equities.', ""The ETF's total return (generated by reinvesting dividends) since inception in 2020 is an incredible 59.2%, and the maximum drawdown in a month was 6.4% in September 2020. Overall, it's a good record, and the monthly income will suit investors looking to live off of passive income."", 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Biden won by just under 21,000 votes in 2020. A recent Marquette University poll showed that Republican voters in Wisconsin are somewhat more enthusiastic about the election than Democrats.', ""Biden also went to Chicago on Wednesday for a fundraiser, telling his donors that he doesn't think the polls showing poor approval ratings for him are accurate. But he used the event to further attack Trump in a sign that he sees November's election as hinging on how people feel about his predecessor, not necessarily Biden's own track record."", ""Biden's trip to Wisconsin — his fourth of the year and 11th as president — came as his reelection also sharpened its outreach to minority voters on the airwaves. It announced the launch of a new, $14 million digital and television blitz that follows the $30 million effort that began after his State of the Union address in early March."", 'One of the new ads in the latest ad campaign focuses on Trump’s failed yet determined push to repeal the Affordable Care Act. A significant portion of the $14 million campaign starting Wednesday will go into Black and Hispanic media, as well as Asian American print and radio, according to the campaign.', 'By the end of May, Biden’s reelection effort will have more than 200 offices and roughly 500 staff members in place, according to Dan Kanninen, the campaign’s battleground director. Those figures include offices in areas that traditionally haven’t seen investments by Democrats in pockets of Michigan, Arizona and North Carolina.', 'While Microsoft has been ramping up artificial intelligence-driven data center construction around the world, “this one is more important than many because there is more land and ultimately access to power available,” said Smith, who as a child lived in the area where the center is being built.', 'Once in operation, however, even the most powerful data centers typically employ a relatively small group of full-time employees to oversee them.

But Supermicro and SoundHound warrant further consideration given their outperformance.', ""Here's what investors should know."", 'Super Micro Computer designs and manufactures accelerated computing platforms comprising server and storage systems. The company sources chips, memory, and other hardware from partners like Nvidia and Intel. Its computing platforms are purpose-built for enterprise and cloud data centers, and Supermicro is an early leader in the artificial intelligence (AI) server market, according to Samik Chatterjee at JPMorgan Chase.', 'Success in the AI server market can be attributed to its building block approach to development, which has two major benefits. First, Supermicro can bring servers equipped with the latest chips to market faster than its competitors. Second, those building blocks come together in countless combinations, such that Supermicro offers the broadest and deepest portfolio of advanced server and storage solutions in the IT industry.', 'Supermicro reported solid financial results in the third fiscal quarter (ended March 31), but shares plunged 15% because it missed consensus sales estimates. To elaborate, revenue increased 200% to $3.85 billion, but Wall Street anticipated $3.95 billion in revenue. Even so, investors may have overreacted given that non-GAAP net income still soared 308% to $6.65 per diluted share, easily beating the $5.78 per dilute share analyst expected.', 'Moreover, CEO Charles Liang told analysts on the earnings call that Supermicro would have delivered more products during the quarter had it not been supply constrained. The company also raised its full-year outlook, such that the midpoint of guidance now implies 110% revenue growth in fiscal 2024. That tops the consensus estimate among analysts, which calls for revenue to increase 106% to $14.6 billion.', 'The AI server market is projected to expand at 47% annually between 2023 and 2028, according to JPMorgan. Meanwhile, Wall Street analysts expect Supermicro to grow earnings per share at 47% annually over the next three to five years. That consensus estimate makes its current valuation of 46.7 times earnings look reasonable. Supermicro shareholders should not count on an 81% gain in the next year, but investors should consider buying a small position today.', 'SoundHound offers conversational intelligence solutions, also called voice artificial intelligence (AI) products, that can be incorporated into all manner of smart devices. Its voice AI technology has applications across the automotive manufacturing, food and beverage, and consumer electronics industries. For instance, its customer base includes well-known brands like Stellantis, Toast, and Qualcomm.', 'SoundHound is a relatively small business (its market capitalization is under $2 billion) competing against much larger companies like Amazon and Microsoft. But management says it has better technology than its rivals, and that its platform affords brands more flexibility in building differentiated and customized voice AI solutions. Gil Luria at DA Davidson cited that technology-based competitive moat as one reason for his price target of $9.50 per share.', 'SoundHound is growing like wildfire. Revenue rose 80% to $17 million in the fourth quarter, and the company reported a smaller GAAP loss of $0.07 per diluted share, up from $0.15 per diluted share in the prior year. That progress is encouraging, but SoundHound may have to issue stock or debt in the future. The company burned $68 million last year, and it currently has just $95 million in cash on its balance sheet.', 'SoundHound recently completed its $25 million acquisition of SYNQ3 Restaurant Solutions, a specialist in conversational intelligence for food and beverage brands. That deal establishes SoundHound as the largest provider of voice AI technology for restaurants and extends it market reach by an order of magnitude, according to CEO Keyvan Mohajer.', 'Looking ahead, Juniper Research estimates voice AI spending will reach $160 billion by 2026, driven by growing demand across numerous industries. Meanwhile, Wall Street analysts think SoundHound will grow sales at 50% annually over the next two years. That consensus estimate makes the current valuation of 26 times sales seem tolerable, though shares are certainly not cheap.', 'While I doubt shareholders will see an 83% gain in the next year, investors should still consider buying a very small position, provided they understand the risks, especially those related to competition.

I haven't made too many big portfolio moves and have actually been focusing on building positions in my favorite index funds lately."", 'However, I recently made a pair of significant investment decisions. I decided to finally add shares of Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) to my portfolio after its recent post-earnings drop, and I also decided to cut my losses and sell a technology company that could be losing its long-term advantages.', ""Here's why I decided to add the coffee giant to my portfolio, and what stock I decided to sell."", ""I've had Starbucks on my radar for several years, and I've been a fan of the business since the first time I visited one of its coffee shops in the late 1990s. As someone who knows the restaurant business well, I can say that Starbucks' profitability and execution of its growth strategy has been impressive, to put it mildly. But for one reason or another, I never bought the stock."", ""That's changed now. After disappointing first quarter results, Starbucks plunged by about 17% and it became too attractive to ignore."", ""Let's get the bad news out of the way first. Starbucks surprised investors by reporting a same-store sales decline of 4% year over year. Analysts had expected a 1% increase. Customer traffic was down by 6%, revenue declined 2% year over year, and the company lowered its full-year guidance. That's a perfect storm of disappointment, and it isn't surprising the stock reacted how it did."", ""CEO Laxman Narasimhan acknowledged his disappointment and mentioned a few growth initiatives, such as making it easier for occasional customers who aren't Starbucks Rewards members to order. Currently, they can't use the app."", ""However, there are a few reasons I bought the stock despite the latest results. First, these are temporary headwinds as consumers cut down on discretionary spending. It isn't just a Starbucks problem. Plus, Narasimhan revealed that expected supply chain cost savings will be $4 billion over the next four years, $1 billion more than previously expected. And finally, buying an iconic brand at its lowest P/E ratio since the depths of the COVID-19 crash, and at its highest dividend yield ever, seems like a smart move."", ""The stock I recently decided to sell is real estate technology platform Zillow (NASDAQ: Z)(NASDAQ: ZG). My investment was down by about 60% since I initially bought it, because of missteps in its now-closed iBuying business and the real estate market slowdown. But instead of waiting for a comeback, I've decided to cut my losses and move on."", ""To be fair, Zillow's recent results have been strong. In the first quarter, revenue and adjusted EBITDA both came in above Zillow's own guidance, and the rental platform is growing exceptionally well."", ""However, the future doesn't look as bright as I'd like. Traffic to Zillow's app and website was flat year over year, and second-quarter revenue guidance calls for a significant slowdown."", ""And this is before the National Association of Realtors settlement goes into effect in July. When it does, buyers' agent commissions will no longer be part of MLS listings and will become a separate agreement between the agent and the buyer bring represented. To put it mildly, this could cause buyers' agent commissions to plunge, and in many cases, for buyers to simply forgo having an agent. Since 48% of Zillow's revenue comes from the buy side of transactions, this has me seriously concerned about the future growth potential of Zillow's business."", ""As a final thought, it's worth clarifying that I bought a rather small position in Starbucks to start. I'm not completely convinced of the CEO's turnaround strategy, or if there really is one at this point, and I think consumer spending could remain depressed for some time. So I have no idea what the stock will do in the next few weeks or months."", ""So I'm taking a cautious approach to the stock and plan to average into a position over time, assuming no further red flags appear with the business. If you find a stock that you love as a long-term investment, but you aren't convinced about its near-term plans, averaging in can be a smart way to go."", 'Before you buy stock in Starbucks, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Starbucks wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool Money starts now. I'm Dylan Lewis, and I'm joined over the airwaves by Motley Fool Analyst Asit Sharma. Asit, thanks for joining me."", 'Asit Sharma: Dylan, thank you for having me.', ""Dylan Lewis: It's a big week for earnings. We've got results from two major names that are painting a cloudy picture of the consumer, maybe a conflicting picture of the consumer. Asit, I want to start with Starbucks. Shares down 15% after the company earnings update showed a 2% decline on the top-line and also earnings that missed expectations. What was the culprit here behind the pullback?"", ""Asit Sharma: Dylan, the culprit was declining traffic in North America, which is a core market, and also in the major investment markets that Starbucks has emphasized, like China. You had declining same-store sales, which is never a good sign, and this is something that the market is really trying to digest. It was a surprise that the company missed estimates, and the outlook is gloomy. When you have lower same-store sales that are predicated on less traffic, even if you've got a little bit of pricing power, which Starbucks has, that always makes investors worry. When are you going to pick that traffic back up? I think there are some reasons why the traffic is declined. That's easy to see, especially in North America, but we can get into that as we go."", ""Dylan Lewis: You mentioned price power there, and I couldn't help as I was looking through the results and seeing some of these year-over-year declines, to think this is a company that has flexed their pricing power and been able to continually move things up. Are we seeing people say, you know what, it's just not worth it for me to pay that little bit much more this many times a month. I'm going to cut back the number of visits that I'm making to Starbucks because the pricing is just getting a little out of hand."", ""Asit Sharma: I think there could be some of that for sure, and we see that in places like California where, like other restaurant systems which have to serve people on a unit basis very quickly, raising prices because California's implemented some new wage standards is causing this weird dislocation, where investors are having to make that very same decision. The other place we see it is in throughput, and this gets to maybe some of the issues that Starbucks is having that's going to last more than just a few quarters. Management talked about the fact that they really can't serve everyone in their morning daypart. If you drive by a Starbucks in the morning, you've seen the lines of cars that pile up there. This is something that really didn't matter to consumers outside of the pandemic. People want their coffee. There was a lot of still disposable income sloshing around, so it didn't matter. The company could both make customers wait and charged more for the same product. Now the dynamic is different. Starbucks management is acknowledging that consumers are a little more jumpy. They're watching their dollars more carefully, thus if you're in a line, and it's expensive anyway, and you're waiting and waiting, you have a tendency to just pull off that line, so this becomes a problem of throughput. How fast can you get consumers through that drive-through or in and out of the stores? Starbucks has been working on this problem for a while, and they've got some solutions. Some listeners may be familiar with, it's a thing called Clover. This is a small company that Starbucks bought several years ago, and they took those machines and modernized them. They're basically machines that give you a lot of variability in the components, how you make a cup of coffee. It can make a cup of coffee faster than a barista can, and this has been modernized. Now we're seeing Clover in some more Starbucks locations that's supposed to help speed up the whole process of serving a cup of coffee. They have a similar system for the more difficult part of their service, which is serving cold drinks, that's called Siren. The Siren System is supposed to be a solution, but Dylan, there's a bottleneck on the bottleneck. If traffic is a bottleneck, Starbucks is taking a lot of time to test this system. It's been slow to roll this out. We've been hearing about it for a couple of years, so management talks about this as an opportunity. Hey, if we sped up the lines, we actually could record more sales, but so far, management hasn't been able to operationalize on these enhancements, and that's also causing investors to worry."", ""Dylan Lewis: You mentioned the dayparts there. That came up in management commentary as one of the main things that they see as an execution opportunity to address. It was interesting. They dove a little bit into this idea that they are seeing all of these people in Mobile Order and Pay, in particular, go begin to order something and then abandon, and my takeaway there, Asit, is you can make something expensive as long as it's convenient, but if it's expensive and inconvenient, you are going to see consumers vote with their dollars a little bit more. Some of the other execution opportunities that management identified was continuing to launch new and exciting products. I think that is a little bit tougher for investors to say, OK, we are definitely going to see signs of success there, there have been some really breakthrough products for them, but they tend to be very seasonal and a little bit harder to predict. The third thing that they threw out was reaching and demonstrating more value for occasional and non-Starbucks rewards consumers. What I think I'm reading there, if this is correct, is they are seeing strength with their loyal consumers, but a lot of their more occasional buyers are those more price-sensitive folks that maybe are turning away and not going quite as often now."", ""Asit Sharma: It could be. I seem to think similarly. Here Starbucks has some opportunities. They really have done a great job with incentivizing their loyal customers to come in, but at the same time, they've degraded the value of the Starbucks points over the years. We've seen that with airlines as well. I'm not so sure that it's the best solution to reach the occasional customers much. I feel like maybe some reinvestment in the value of the Starbucks loyalty program would help them first. You always have an easier lift incentivizing the core customer versus coming in and trying to entice a customer who hasn't visited as much, but I see and acknowledge the need to to try to get as broad a swath of customers coming in as possible because, if there is this traffic problem, so why not try to fill those gaps in different dayparts with folks who don't come in to smudge?"", ""Dylan Lewis: One of the other ways the company is looking at their dayparts and their operations is testing some after-hours concepts and delivery. They piloted serving customers between 5:00 PM and 5:00 AM and said that, based on the success they were seeing there, they see that this could potentially be a $2 billion business over the next five years. They're going to continue to expand, so we are seeing experimentation. We're seeing innovation in different ideas here with Starbucks. It just feels like one of those quarters where we saw some hints of this last time. We're really seeing the brunt of it this time. Asit, I look at the five-year chart for Starbucks, and we have seen them down around where they are now twice in the last five years, both of those times have been very short-lived. One of them was March 2020 with the COVID reaction. The other was in 2022 with the very broad market sell-off. Shares did not stay around where they are right now for very long. This company certainly has challenges, but it seems like it also has opportunities. Do you feel like Starbucks is worth looking at right now?"", ""Asit Sharma: I think Starbucks is always worth looking at, Dylan. The question is though, what's going to happen in the next couple of years with the macro economy? We're learning that even Starbucks customers have their point of price sensitivity. In 2020, as you rightfully point out, that was a short-lived drop, but the Fed was also sloshing money around, so the effect was easy enough to bounce back from. What I'm worried about here is, if the customer remains crimped for the next couple of years, what will Starbucks rely on to get that revenue growth jump-started? It's not going to be in building more stores. It could be in converting more stores to the self-serve model, where they take out the seats and use simply order and take your drink away, more of the conversions to drive-throughs. Those could be really solid growth propellants, but short of that, investors are wondering, how are you going to come back from what looks like a little bit of deceleration here? That's always harder to do. Starbucks has the tools, it's got the brand power, but it may not be a quick bounce-back. This could be a place to buy Starbucks, but I'm not so sure we'll see that six-month resumption of a very strong chart here. There's something a little amiss underneath all of this that I think management is still working through itself, and it may take a couple more quarters to unravel exactly what's going on, but from the top, i think your census is correct that part of it is this consumers is pulling back."", ""Dylan Lewis: We had a more certain picture with Amazon's results and maybe more of a business-as-usual type story. Revenue up 13% in the company's report to 127 billion. The number that jumped out to me though is operating income up over 200% year-over-year to over 15 billion. I did the math on operating margin here and did a look-back quarter-to-quarter. Asit, I don't think the company has ever touched 10% for an operating margin. Is this a new normal for Amazon?"", ""Asit Sharma: It could be, Dylan. One thing that Amazon has now, which it didn't have before, is sustained profitability in its e-commerce operations, and it got there by doing something. it's used as an explainer for why Amazon Web Services hasn't been as profitable lately, cost optimization. So when you look at Amazon Web Services in quarters before this quarter, management was saying, look, all our customers want to watch their spend because of this uncertain economy, so our profits are a little smaller. They were doing the same thing over in the business of logistics in distribution for the e-commerce side. I think that's a more solid business day. All the work Andy Jassy has done in terms of looking at each business division within Amazon as a holistic enterprise and then paring away what doesn't work is starting to show up in these numbers. So they could be there, and Amazon Web Services itself is doing well. Digital advertising is a nice contributor to that profit margins. You put it all together, I think we could be here, and as you point out, that's not a huge margin, but at a scale when the sales are in the hundreds of billions, it starts to make a difference."", ""Dylan Lewis: Let's talk about that advertising segment for a second. It was up 24% this quarter. That is better growth than its AWS segment. I'll say it is at about half the size of the AWS segment as it currently is, but this was the first time that we had a look at their advertising segment with the benefit of Prime Video being included. I think we have just continued to see the success in what Amazon is able to do. I have to think that this segment is going to become a bigger contributor for the company going forward."", ""Asit Sharma: It should. It's such a high-margin segment for them, and it shows too you don't have to be necessarily the best in terms of content quality. We do know that Amazon has a lot of scale now, so it is a pretty worthy competitor to other streaming businesses, but technology matters. Their technology is pretty good. We see this with Netflix as well, the ability to show advertisers very good conversion on display. They've got that. I think the way that Amazon has approached this isn't the most exciting business, but it's been a steady builder. Again here's this theme coming in Del, now it's reaching scale so it starts to impact that bottom line."", ""Dylan Lewis: Shares were up about 3% on the report, and I feel like people were saying, these are strong results. They're not blowing the, the cover off the ball, but looking pretty good, if there were any things to take exception to and nitpick on, maybe it was the guidance we saw that they were coming in a little bit below expectations for some of the out quarters this year. I do wonder if they are signaling a little bit of that concern that you're mentioning earlier around consumer tightness and just wondering if the macro picture may affect spend a bit."", ""Asit Sharma: I think it's smart of them to do that. It's a business which again, has so many different contributing parts and pieces, but there's not a dominant piece of this business, so if the macro economy gets soft again, each of the big segments, think about AWS, think about those online sales, they'll have some marginal reduction, so it is smartest management to do that. I'll pick a quibble here too with the results. So one thing that I'd been counting on for a long time is, after Amazon built out its distribution network, its logistics fulfillment network, we were supposed to enjoy a lot of amazing free cash flow, and we're seeing it. It's there. It's grants. Now looking forward, some of that free money is going to get eaten up because Amazon is investing in generative AI. That's a benefit to the business, but all the free cash flow, some of the grander numbers that I saw analysts project, I don't think they're going to materialize now. I think Amazon is going to keep investing its spare cash in providing a multilayer of services for AI. That's to the benefit of Amazon long-term, and management talked about this on the call. They go through cycles of investment and then expanding margin and then lower-margins investments."", ""It never ends. I guess there's always something that eats up the available supply of capital that we keep thinking Amazon one day is going to throw off nonetheless. It's really hard to argue with this report in general."", ""Dylan Lewis: Asit, no quibbles with your analysis or ever having you on the show. Thanks for joining me today. My colleague Mary Long caught up with David Henkes, a food and beverage analyst at Technomic to learn about McDonald's CosMc's content."", ""Mary Long: David, you are one of my go-to's when I want to understand what's happening in the food and beverage industry, and I really wanted to talk with you because McDonald's, at the end of last year, launched a pretty interesting new venture. It's called CosMc's. It's a space-themed beverage outpost. It also sells some snacks there, the first launched outside of Chicago. There's a couple of now in Texas. The plan, if I remember correctly, by the end of the year, is to have 10. I've got some business and strategy questions for you that center around what this means for McDonald's, what this means for the beverage space more largely, but I think you're one of the lucky few that have actually been to a CosMc's, so maybe we can start by having you tell us what that experience was like."", ""David Henkes: Thanks for having me on. I did go to the CosMc's. I live just outside of Chicago, and the one here is in Bolingbrook, which is a western suburb of Chicago. I went there. It's a drive-through only concept. It's got golden arches hidden among all of its CosMc's brand name, so it's certainly not trying to hide the fact that it's a McDonald's concept. Interestingly enough, the one in Bolingbrook is right next to a McDonald's, and so as I waited in line for about 40 minutes to get through the drive-through, I watched the McDonald's drive-through which was essentially empty. So they've clearly had a lot of success in terms of driving interests, traffic, sales to the one here in Bolingbrook and to your point, they've I believe they've got two maybe three now in Texas with and my understanding is the same as yours is they want to have 10, so it's something that I think the entire restaurant industry is keeping an eye on and is fascinated by, and we'll see where it goes."", ""Mary Long: The menu is pretty funky. I'm going to just list off a few offerings that listeners, that maybe are unfamiliar, have an idea of what's actually being offered. There's a Sour Cherry Energy Burst, which is like a slushy that comes with caffeine syrup, sour cherry flavoring, as you might expect from the name, and boba balls. There's a Beach Protein Frappe, so a milkshake-like offering with banana flambe flavoring and protein powder. A churro cold brew frappe, that's probably more self-explanatory but interesting flavor combinations there. There's an assortment of coffees, hot and cold, sour and tea-like beverages. Some more familiar items you mentioned the golden arches are hidden within this whole concept, plus some new sandwiches and bakery items. When I hear all that, who is this menu trying to cater to? Is there a specific demographic that McDonald's might be trying to attract here?"", ""David Henkes: I think when you look at a lot of this beverage innovation that they've got on the CosMc's menu, it's clearly aimed toward the younger demographic, Gen Z. Primarily when you talk about these energy drinks, cold coffees, the refresher style drinks that Starbucks has been introducing and has had wild success with, all of these are really aimed toward, certainly not my generation, but they tend to be sugary drinks but high energy and a lot of innovation flavors. To your point about boba, boba has been on a tear lately. So the menu, I think, is built around what McDonald's considers some of the emerging opportunities in beverage, and beverage frankly right now is a hot area ripe for innovation. We see a lot of these stand-alone beverage concepts, Dutch Bro's HTO. There's a number of these beverage forward drive-through concepts that have emerged over the past year or two years. It seems that they've really popped on the scene. McDonald's, within its current four walls of existing McDonald's finds it very difficult to innovate and test out some of these new products. It gets in the way of the flow of the operation. and it's challenged. One of the things that I think CosMc's does for it is it really provides an incubator for them. But it also then doesn't allow them to necessarily alienate the consumers that are coming into McDonald's, and so it gives a separate outlet for them to test some of these things with perhaps this demographic, and McDonald's caters to everybody, and so they, I think, are not trying to be super cutting-edge within their McDonald's menu. What they're trying to do is figure out maybe some opportunities for growth that could be incorporated into McDonald's, and I believe, and I think it's true, that they're using CosMc's as that incubator, as a test site, to try out a lot of these with Gen Z and with the younger consumers especially, but just to see how they resonate and to use it as a test site."", ""Mary Long: I think when news of this launch first came out, a lot of people made the observation that this was McDonald's trying to compete with Starbucks and maybe Duncan and other players in that beverage only type lane or beverage forward type lane. It sounds like you, rather than direct competition, you see this as more like an experimentation space. If that's the case, what do you think the longer-term play is here? Is it to build beyond those proposed 10 CosMc's locations and make this a really substantial stand-alone brand or more so to maybe bring one winner from a CosMc's hub, a CosMc's experimentation place into a full-time McDonald's."", ""David Henkes: McDonald's won't come out to say it, but I think if you read between the lines, listen, whether they have 10 or 100 or even 1,000 CosMc's, McDonald's has roughly a little over 13,000 McDonald's locations in the U.S. They've got about 42,000 globally, so this thing could be a wild success, and it's still going to be a rounding error for McDonald's. McDonald's generates something around $130 billion globally in terms of sales. We see it actually just today. Chipotle just announced today that they're discontinuing their, I think is, Farmesa concept. It's a bowl concept that they were trying. The restaurant industry has a lot of examples where secondary brands do not get the attention, the focus, the investments when you've got a big brand that's growing pretty well, and so there's no question that if this were intended to be a stand-alone brand that they wanted to grow, the success of similar brands in the industry would suggest that it's probably not going to work, including, by the way, McDonald's which used to own Chipotle and spun it off because it was a distraction. The only way, in my opinion, that this really makes sense for McDonald's to grow this and to invest in it, is to use it as an area to test things, to fail quickly, to incubate new ideas, to be unencumbered by how McDonald's currently does things and do things completely different. I think what it means is that beverage as the platform for competition in the future has been acknowledged by a lot of QSR fast food chains. This is McDonald's way of testing and getting more into beverage and figuring out things that work and items that their customers like without completely impacting their McDonald's operations, which by the way is humming along. They grew 9% last year, so the McDonald's business by itself is doing just fine and they don't want to touch that, impact that, slow down drive-through lanes, or impact operational effectiveness, so CosMc's really gives them the chance to have a new sandbox, new playground to try things out in and do it unencumbered by the equipment or the training that their existing McDonald's staff has. They can be as, as out there as they want. The real value then is how you monetize some of these learnings into the $130 billion globally that McDonald's sells because, if you can grow that 5% based on some new beverage learnings, that's a whole lot more impactful than having 50 or 60 CosMc's restaurants which, while they might be successful, are not going to have a material impact on the McDonald's business."", ""Mary Long: CosMc's is a full-on drive through, and it's completely cashless. You order and pay at a drive-through kiosk. Is this the future of fast food, people lists cashless, automated order takers and kiosks?"", ""David Henkes: Yeah. Listen, there's a lot of automation that's happening, primarily in fast food, quick service, fast casual right now. You see some but lessened full service, and a lot of it's driven by the labor situation, so you've got this law in California now, minimum wages are going through the roof. That's having a knock-on effect throughout the country, and so a tight labor market compounded with higher minimum wages makes it tougher and tougher for restaurants, A, to be profitable and, B, to find the people that are going to drive restaurant sales. Automation is certainly an output of that, but listen, labor, we went back to some work we did in 1970. You know what the number one issue facing the restaurant industry in 1970 was? It was labor. Labor is not a new issue for the restaurant industry. What is new is the technology and the ability to drive some incremental sales with it, but realistically, this automation doesn't really replace labor for the most part. It really redeploys labor, and so you're never going to totally take the people aspect out of it. What labor does is it enables more frictionless transactions. Hopefully it drives speed of service, and especially in a convenient environment like QSR is, unlike where there's drive-throughs or a high throughput necessary, the more you can eliminate obstacles and barriers and create that frictionless environment,the better guest satisfaction you have, and hopefully you can redeploy your labor into some higher value added activity. I think that's what a lot of the technology is doing nowadays. They're not necessarily taking labor out, but they're trying to redeploy it and use technology to drive guest satisfaction and, hopefully, drive some incremental sales."", ""Dylan Lewis: As always, people on the program may own stocks mentioned, and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell anything based solely on what you hear.

This week's Motley Fool Money radio show starts now."", ""It's the Motley Fool Money radio show. I'm Dylan Lewis. Joining me in the studio, Motley Fool Senior Analysts Ron Gross and Jason Moser. Gentlemen, great to have you both here."", 'Ron Gross: How are you doing, Dylan?', ""Dylan Lewis: We've got fast food brands signaling that consumer is getting a little pickier and also radar stocks. Ron, generally this time of year, our eyes are on earnings, but we do take a peek at the big macro to make sure that we're not missing anything. For a while, the story was rates are going down. We've had a more recent idea of our rates going up. We had comments from Fed Chair Powell this week. We have fresh labor data. What are you seeing with the rate story?"", ""Ron Gross: Two big stories that this week, on Wednesday, the Fed left interest rates unchanged at 5.3% and commented how they were wary about how stubborn inflation was proving to be. They signaled that rates will likely continue to stay higher for longer. That's been the mantra, higher for longer. It is interesting to see how sticky inflation has been. The Fed's preferred inflation index, while down from 7.1 for sure, which is great, still stands at 2.8%, higher than their target of 2%. Now investors did share the fact that Powell said he thought the next policy move was unlikely to be an increase, and the market actually rallied on that. You'll take what you can get, I guess, in this market. Now fast-forward to Friday, jobs report came out solid but much weaker than expected, which in a vacuum would not be so great, but in the context of an environment where you're looking for a soft landing for the economy, it's actually been heralded as a Goldilocks report. Weakness but not too bad. Its economy appears to be slowing. Market rallied significantly on the hopes that now one or potentially two rate cuts would happen this year. We will see."", 'Dylan Lewis: The big macro can, sometimes, be the big metric soup. I appreciate you helping us wade through that one, Ron.', 'Ron Gross: Very good.', ""Dylan Lewis: We have another monster earnings week to run through. That means we're recovering results all the way from A to W, Apple to Wayfair. Jason, let's start at the top of the alphabet shares of Apple, up 6% this week after the company's second fiscal quarter results. Revenue, down slightly year-over-year but came in ahead of expectations along with earnings. It seems a little bit of a wait-and-see quarter for Apple."", ""Jason Moser: It definitely feels that way. They did not knock the cover off the ball here, but the results seem good enough for Wall Street. and like Ron, it's that you take what you can get. To your point, yeah, revenue, down 4%, and they saw products revenue actually down 10%. Now they blamed this partly on timing and a tough comp from a year ago when supply chain bottlenecks were eased up. Take that for what it's worth, but when you look at the segments, we had iPhone revenue down 10%, services revenue was up 14%. Mac was up 4%. iPad, down 17%. Then I thought this was interesting, wearables, home, and accessories was down 10%, so just hoping to keep an eye on there, but China, always a big point of conversation with Apple. China was down again, but Tim Cook noted in the call that the results there are improving from a quarter ago, so they're seeing a reacceleration there in China. It's becoming less bad as what it was before, but we'll have to see how that shakes out because it's become a very competitive market. We know these replacement cycles are only getting longer as these phones continue to get better, and there are a lot of really good phones out there now, particularly when you look in the China market. Conversation about AI, but still nothing really to report there."", ""Dylan Lewis: I think a lot of people have been waiting for Apple's move when it comes to AI, and CEO Tim Cook alluded to give gifts, a little nugget of something saying, we're looking forward to sharing some very exciting things with customers at events later this year. Jason, what would you want to be seeing from Apple?"", ""Jason Moser: I think the idea, at least probably what people are looking for, is for AI to be incorporated somehow into the device. Primarily that would be the phone, I would guess. Again it's a wait-and-see in a lot of regards because I think that one of the problems with AI right now, just in general, is understanding its implications and how we as consumers might use it or how businesses might use it in the form factor that takes. So I appreciate the fact that they're being deliberate and taking their time there, but yeah, they need to bring something to the table because this conversation regarding AI is only growing louder."", ""Ron Gross: I think the Worldwide Developers Conference in June is probably something to keep an eye on where the next big AI announcement would be. Interesting that the stock rallied significantly on this report. It's all about expectations, really, even though there were some weakness here. It was better than expected. Repurchasing $110 billion of stock continues to return a significant amount of capital to investors, shareholders, in addition to their dividend only trading at 25 times forward, but they do have a China problem, so it's going to be interesting to watch."", ""Dylan Lewis: For context, $110 billion of stock is a Boeing or an Airbnb in market cap. Apple is just saying, yeah, sure, we throw off enough cash. That's not going to get in the way of us doing our R&D investments. We can buy that back. We can also raise our dividend 4%. That's fine. We've got all this stuff in spades."", ""Jason Moser: I will say, with the dividend, it tilts me that it's so low."", ""Ron Gross: It's so [inaudible]."", ""Jason Moser: Exactly. I appreciate what they're doing. Slow and steady wins the race. This is 12 consecutive years they've raised the dividend, and credit where credit's due, it requires looking further out in saying, in year '25, this is ultimately going to be a Dividend Aristocrat® and probably more. [The term Dividend Aristocrats® is a registered trademark of Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC.] Man, I'll tell you, share repurchases are fine. I would love to see them make a little bit more of a material boost to that dividend."", 'Ron Gross: Here.', ""Dylan Lewis: They're setting a low hurdle to keep going up every single year on their path to becoming an aristocrat. Ron, Amazon not really needing to wait for growth in the same way that Apple investors are. The machine just continues to churn their revenue up 13% to over 125 billion for the quarter. It seems like an incredibly strong earnings results for the company, especially with its operating income."", ""Ron Gross: Agreed. Record First Quarter sales. As AI, we have to mention AI in every story, we're contractually obligated. AI, the boom, it would just powered growth through their cloud computing unit. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has tried to shift the company to focus more on AI innovation, both in the Amazon platform as well as the Cloud AWS platform. They were significantly behind Microsoft, Google, some others, attempting to make their way back into that space earlier this month. In a letter to shareholders, he laid out his vision for how generative AI could be a critical building block in their next pillar of growth. You had the website. You had Amazon Prime. You have AWS now. What's going to come next? Perhaps it's AI, but we will see. As you noted, the metrics are wonderful. Revenue, up 13%. North America, up 12%. Amazon Web Services, up 17%. Really strong. Net income increased to $10.4 billion, and that includes a $2 billion loss from their Rivian Automotive investment. Theoretically, from an operating perspective, as you mentioned, even higher. Free cash flow came in at $50 billion for the quarter. They're putting up some real good numbers. Their guidance was pretty strong. As well at CapEx, it's going to be pretty high now as they make investments for AI and other things, so we'll keep an eye on what that does to free cash flow. A pretty strong report trading at 38 times, it's not the cheapest stock in the world, but it is Amazon."", 'Dylan Lewis: We were talking dividend just a minute ago with Apple, and I do have to ask because everyone else in big tech is getting on the bandwagon.', 'Jason Moser: [laughs]', 'Dylan Lewis: Jason, do you think that Amazon would ever consider issuing a dividend?', ""Jason Moser: I think one day they probably will, but I think that they also are not going to feel pressured to do so. They're going to do it on their own timeline, and into Ron's point about the investments they're making in Cloud and AI and whatnot, i t's also nice to see that Jassy is very focused on costs as well with business, so they are not just spending money freely, which is very encouraging. I think probably what comes with that is a singular focus on the balance sheet, net cash flow, and making sure they have the capital that they need to make all of those investments. My guess is a dividend would probably follow years down the line, but I could be wrong."", ""Ron Gross: They do need to continue to make sure their cost structure is right. They laid off 27,000 employees, I want to say, last year, and they keep doing it selectively to make sure their overall head count is where they want it to be. That obviously could cruise right down to the bottom line. As they save money, it pops free cash flow up, it creates more money to potentially pay a dividend and buy back stock, make investments. I think they're closer to getting their expense structure correct, certainly more than they were in the past."", ""Dylan Lewis: Coming up after the break, earnings palooza continues with a look at how Medicare is eating into CVS's results. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Ricky Mulvey with Motley Fool Money here to tell you about a vehicle that is redefining sporting luxury, the Range Rover Sport. The first thing I noticed when I sat down in the driver's seat is that I felt like I was in a cockpit. You're up off the ground in a focused interior that promotes exhilarating driver engagement. I also really appreciated the overhead 360-degree camera view that let me know exactly where I was going as I was backing out of the parking space. I went for a drive in the Range Rover Sport out in Littleton, Colorado, tested the accelerator just a little bit, and felt the performance and agility. It's an instinctive drive with engaging on-road dynamics and effortless composure. To put it plainly, the Range Rover Sport is powerful. It's also quiet and comfortable. Advanced cabin technologies such as active noise cancellation and cabin air purification offer new levels of comfort and refinement. The third-generation Range Rover Sport is the most desirable, advanced, and dynamically capable yet. I'd like to invite you to visit landroverusa.com to learn more about the Range Rover Sport."", ""Dylan Lewis: Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis joined in the studio by Ron Gross and Jason Moser. Our earnings rundown continues with a look at CVS, Wayfair, and Coke. Ron, CVS, logging its worst day in about 15 years after reporting earnings this week. Sales up slightly from a year ago but wide losses, in particular, tied to the company's Medicare operations. Walk me through this. This is an in-depth category here."", ""Ron Gross: Yeah. The stock got just murdered. Investors wanted nothing to do with this company as they missed both revenue estimates, and they decreased their guidance. As you said, revenue growth, anemic at 3.7%. The problem with their Medicare unit and their insurance unit, two things. Increased utilization, and that means more money spent on insurance as people continue to seek treatment more and more post-COVID. Everybody put off some elective surgeries. Believe it or not, we're still dealing with that. It seems like COVID has been a while now but not in this case, much higher utilization rates that eats into bottom line. Medicare reimbursement rates, those were cut, and that continues to pressure the company for the remainder of the year and potentially 2025 and forward, but that remains to be seen. They got hit double whammy there. Like Aetna's revenue, for example, was up 25%, but their adjusted operating income fell 60%. They've got some work to do, and CVS is really paying the price for a really big push into Medicare Advantage plans through their Aetna division, and it's coming back to burn them a little bit. They're going to spend time making sure they right-size their balance sheet. They're going to cut costs if they need to. I think all competitors are likely going to need to take similar actions. Even though CVS went hard into Medicare, they are certainly not alone. Earnings, down 33%. Guidance was brought down as well. Stock is only trading for seven times forward guidance, intriguing, but I would be careful."", 'Dylan Lewis: Starting to look a little interesting?', 'Ron Gross: Seven times.', ""Dylan Lewis: This is a company that is very different than the CVS of about five years ago, with the focus on health, with the focus on insurance, the Medicare exposure. A lot of that has happened under CEO Karen Lynch's guidance. Is she on the hot seat?"", ""Ron Gross: I would think for sure. She used to run Aetna, so the fact that CVS has moved big into Aetna-based products, probably not surprising, but that could be a mistake into 2025. We'll have to keep an eye on it but hot seat for sure."", ""Dylan Lewis: Much more favorable reaction to Wayfair's results. Shares, up 20% this week. Jason, I'm probably part of the reason why their sale story is doing OK. Two new kitchen stools and a mirror in my house. Revenue was down slightly but ahead of expectations. I'm glad I could do what I can now."", 'Jason Moser: It sounds like Dylan is a happy resident of the Wayborhood, right?', ""Dylan Lewis: They've got just what he needs."", ""Jason Moser: Get used to that one, right, the Wayborhood. That's going to be a big marketing platform for them, big campaign in the next several years, but yeah, like Apple, they didn't knock the cover off the ball by any means, but the results were good enough. Clearly, the market responded very positively to it, and management did paint a picture of better days ahead. Revenue, $2.7 billion is actually down 1.6% from a year ago. When you look at the metrics that really matter for this business, active customers, 22.3 million now, that was up 2.8% from a year ago. Revenue per active customer actually fell 2.8%, and orders per customer remained relatively flat. Any one of the key metrics we've always kept an eye on with Wayfair is that repeat customer business because acquiring those customers is expensive, so when you get them, you want to keep them. We've seen this metric really perform over time. Now repeat customers placed 80.5% of total orders delivered in the quarter, that was versus 79.1% a year ago, so that number continues to move in the right direction as well. I think that this is a business that, over the last three years, they, like many of these e-commerce businesses, went just through some really very difficult to support growth. A lot of that growth was pulled forward. They're normalizing now, still working toward sustainable profitability, but you keyed in on it there at the very beginning. We're all using it in one way or another. If you have a home or if you rent a place, they've got everything, so it's a nice place to be able to go look and find stuff that you need, unless you're a true Amazon loyalist, I guess."", ""Dylan Lewis: [laughs] I'm going to take some cues here from the key business metrics and, I think, paint a little bit of a picture with the consumer and the story there. Their active customers, as you highlighted, going up, but the spend per customer on average, going down. I feel like that is a sign of something we're going to continue to see this earning season with other companies."", ""Jason Moser: I agree. It feels like we're seeing that type of behavior across the spectrum of businesses, particularly in things like retail and restaurants and whatnot, but we're just seeing a lot of signs with a lot of these reports that, while there is some growth there, it's very clear that the consumer is stretched and starting to make concessions and deliberate and postpone purchasing. Now with that said, I think one thing they noted on the call was very encouraging. They said for the first time since 2019, they're seeing their suppliers starting to introduce large groups of new products into their catalogs as they try to build momentum for this recovery going beyond this year, so that's encouraging. With Wayfair, it's ultimately a network. They're not holding all of that in inventory, but they're connecting suppliers to customers, and to see those suppliers introducing a lot of new stuff, that's a good thing, and when the consumers start to feel a little bit better, Wayfair likely is going to get a few of those dollars."", ""Dylan Lewis: Jason, I know this is a company you've followed for quite some time, going back pre-pandemic. We're seeing this business normalize a little bit. Do you see a return-to-growth story here for them?"", ""Jason Moser: I do to an extent. I think it's a very competitive market to be sure. You look at Amazon. They're the most obvious competitor that really is a threat to a business like this, but they've done a very good job through the years of maintaining the narrative, investing for growth. They're not worried about that profitability and cash flow right now because they feel they're building this network out, and the market opportunity is just so big, and they continue to grow that international business out. It does feel like there's another leg up to go here."", ""Dylan Lewis: More stools and mirrors in my future, it turns out. We're going to wrap this earnings rundown with a look at Coke. Revenue coming in a little bit ahead of expectations, up 3% year-over-year. Ron, when you look at the results from the company, maybe not quite as subject to some of the consumer whims because they are on the lower-priced end, but what did you see?"", ""Ron Gross: The two main things were anemic volume growth of only 1%. You really would like to see that be stronger, but the report was relatively strong and that's because of a 13% price increase across their product line. It's the age-old story of why Warren Buffett has always said he liked Coke besides his addiction to Cherry Coke. It's because of the pricing power, and they have that ability to continually raise prices over time. They attributed about half of the price increase to inflation, the other half was to keep pace with competitors, but for the most part, consumers accepted it. They are seeing inflation decelerate. Corn syrup, sugar, aluminum cans are coming down, so pricing will probably moderate as the year progresses. Net revenue, only up 3%, if we remove currency, up 11%, a little bit better than that. Adjusted earnings per share, up 7%. That's what Coke does. Coke's going to really knock it out of the park, but they've got to continue to come up with new entries into the marketplace. They have this new Happy Tears Zero Sugar you may have heard about sold exclusively on social media. I don't know, I don't get it, but they upped their guidance by 4-5% expected EPS growth. Again it's Coca-Cola. It trades at 22 times guidance. Pepsi's at 21 times guidance, right in line there."", 'Dylan Lewis: You really came out swinging there, Ron. Anemic growth.', ""Ron Gross: I don't know, I don't get it. When it comes to the social media, I absolutely love the spice."", 'Jason Moser: You need to get more salty snacks in that portfolio.', ""Dylan Lewis: Up next, the numbers just keep coming in. We've got details on Starbucks' 15% drop this week and updates on two major fast-food chains. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money."", ""Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis, joined again in the studio by Ron Gross and Jason Moser. We've got earnings from three of the biggest food chains in the world this week, Starbucks, McDonald's, and Domino's, slightly different outlooks across all of them. Jason, I want to start with Starbucks. Shares down 15% and this is not something that we see all that often with a company like Starbucks. There seemed to be a lot of concerns and not a lot of inspiration in the results that we saw from the company. Also, not a lot of inspiration, the commentary from management after the results."", ""Jason Moser: I think you could say that again. These were not good numbers clearly, and we'll get to that in a second, but I think see CEO Laxman Narasimhan seemed very caught on the defensive, whether it was the earnings call or whether it was interviews that he was offering financial media. I don't want to say detached from reality, but it just didn't seem like he really had a focus on what the real problems were. He kept on throwing around a lot of catchphrases and buzzwords, and there were some assigning of blame to the customer and whatnot. It just I don't know. To me, he really has work cut out for him, but I think even more so, to me, the drumbeat is only going to grow louder. He's been there for a year now. Stock is down 35% under his watch. This is Starbucks. That's a big move. It's only going to get louder. We're going to start hearing the question, is he the man for the job, and that's a really fair question, I think, at this point. Particularly after this report, revenue was down 1%. Global comps, down 4%. They saw particular weakness in China. That was down 11%. They noted that in this very competitive market that there are plenty of options there in the Chinese market. They don't have unlimited pricing power there. They do continue to open stores, so there is room to grow there and room to succeed, but they've run into a little bit of a buzzsaw there. You saw operating margin, down 140 basis points, earnings-per-share, down 7%, and I think really what got the market worked up, this guide down was significant. They were calling for earnings-per-share growth in that 15-20% range earlier. Now that's been whittled down to just flat to low single digits. That's a big deal, and so the market's reaction, I think, was absolutely right. Now the good news is, I think, a lot of this is very fixable. These are fixable problems. Much like Disney's got an Iger problem, Starbucks seems to still have a Schultz problem, and that is not going to be going away anytime soon."", ""Dylan Lewis: The results weren't particularly strong, and I don't think the picture is going to get that much better that quickly. Management did identify three different execution opportunities, they call them, for getting back on track, particularly in the United States."", 'Jason Moser: This is separate from the triple shot with two pumps win.', 'Dylan Lewis: This is a separate.', ""Jason Moser: Now, see, I'm already confused."", ""Dylan Lewis: Cringy. The first they identified was meeting demand across dayparts to drive future growth, so essentially meeting the demand of people who are coming into the store because it seems like, especially during some of their more peak hours, they're actually supply constrained with what they're able to give consumers."", ""Jason Moser: Yeah. If you are waking up in the morning, and Starbucks is a part of your routine, and it is for a lot of people, that is one of the peak traffic parts of the day for them, and then they noted in the call, people will go on there to the app, put an order together, and then see how long that order is going to take to fulfill, and they bag it, and they go somewhere else. That's just unacceptable, right? We've seen restaurants that have to deal with those throughput issues. The one that stands out is Chipotle. Do you remember back in the day, you knew if you went to Chipotle at lunchtime, you were waiting in the line starting outside, but it was almost like magic how quickly they got you through that line. Starbucks needs a little Chipotle right now, if they want to fix that throughput, and that to me, I think, is a key issue that needs to have 100% of their focus."", ""Ron Gross: This is a little Wall Street-y and not company-focused, but the reason that the stock got slammed so much is because the investment community was so taken by surprise about how weak the numbers were. I saw some comments from analysts who were, like, they were stunned and they've got to improve communication. They don't have to, but they should improve communications, so investors have a better understanding. I don't know how they missed it so bad. They could have pre-announced. They could have updated guidance. I'm happy to see that they brought guide down significantly for this quarter. At least it's better communication. Rip the Band-Aid off now, better than later."", ""Jason Moser: Maybe they can improve, right? Maybe that guide down is sandbagging. We won't know until we get there. You made a good point there, I think, in regard to the pre-announce. We've seen pre-announcements all the time, and whatever the reaction is, if they pre-announced this four weeks ago, probably the market has a very similar reaction. Wouldn't you say? Assuming they pre-announced four weeks ago, then there's some time there to digest, to get through it, put together some communication, and again how you're going to solve these problems. It does feel like a pre-announcement would've been apropos in this case."", ""Ron Gross: As you say, they would've taken the hit, maybe not as badly back then, but it's better to see a company being proactive and communicative than not, and so even if you're going to take the hit, be upfront. Let us know how the business is doing, the shareholders are the owners of the company, and just don't play it so close to the vest."", ""Dylan Lewis: Jason, after this decline, post-earnings shares are down around a level that has only really happened a couple of times over the last five years for this business. Generally, when they've fallen down to this level, they haven't stayed there very long. We've seen them rebound pretty quickly. When you see Starbucks at this point in time and the challenges that they currently face, are you interested, or are you sitting on the sidelines?"", ""Jason Moser: I'm getting interested. I'm a shareholder in Starbucks today, thankfully to much lower cost basis, so it's still working out OK. It's a retirement portfolio holding. I own it primarily for the dividend income, and so when they start to see this, I do start to get interested. Now the flip side to that, I think things are going to get worse before they get better. I am not convinced that Laxman is the man for the job, and this quarter really reinforced that. Again I think the drumbeat is going to continue to grow louder in regard to that. He said they didn't pre-announce because they were focused on putting together their game plan or an action plan. You can do both. You're getting paid an awful lot of money to do this job. It didn't seem like it's that difficult of a hurdle, but to me, I think patience probably works out well here. It does feel like it might get worse before it gets better because they are noting as most everyone else is the stretch consumer, right? They can't keep on raising prices to the moon, so they're going to run into a little bit of a wall there."", ""Dylan Lewis: We're going to stick with food and look at results from Domino's. Ron, going through all of this, I am not seeing all of the same stretched consumer elements quite showing up in the numbers for Domino's.

That actually paid off. That doesn't always, but the spend paid off. They revamped their loyalty program. They're advertising on Uber Eats. Delivery and pickup orders, both increasing. We saw their network sales, though it's mostly a franchise business, but their total network sales, up 7%. Their revenue were up 6%. US same-store sales growth up 5.6%. Higher numbers of carry-out and delivery orders across all income groups. The income group part is interesting. They started to work with Uber Eats back in 2023, and it was because they wanted to reach wealthier households who are willing to pay a delivery fee and use a program like Uber Eats to improve sales in that channel. They are making nice headway. They expect Uber sales to reach 3% of total sales by the end of the year. That's an addition to the revamp loyalty program, 33 million-plus active members, more than 2 million of whom joined since the relaunch in September. Margins are up. Net income, up 20%. They're launching a New York style pizza, Dylan."", 'Dylan Lewis: Hey.', ""Ron Gross: I don't know, we'll see, but long-term clients, they're sticking to their long-term hungry for more plan, I think, which is pretty good, 31 times forward earnings, something like Chipotle at 54, something like McDonald's at 22."", ""Dylan Lewis: I will note, as someone who grew up in New Jersey, spent my time going into New York every now and then, I will occasionally get Domino's Pizza. It is not my favorite, Ron, but it exists in a class of its own. It is not pizza in the conventional sense. You just have to say, I'm having Domino's."", ""Ron Gross: I've been a recommender of this stock for a long time as we have been at the Fool from time to time, and they provide a product that people want."", ""Dylan Lewis: We'll stick with a product that people want, and maybe a different idea of burger. Looking at results from McDonald's, not so much fanfare with their earnings results, Jason. It seems there are though some similar threads showing up in McDonald's earnings and the commentary around it that we've been seeing with Domino's and with Starbucks."", ""Jason Moser: It was a fairly benign quarter but definitely fell in line with the theme that we're seeing more widely across the industry. The consumer getting stretched, making concessions, starting to focus a little bit more on value. The good news for McDonald's is that's the play. It's a value play. They are focused on value, which is something that Starbucks can't necessarily claim, and so even when it gets difficult for McDonald's, they still have that to fall back on. Like I said, a relatively benign quarter, global comps were up 2%, but they did grow operating income 8%, which is encouraging, and they saw earnings-per-share growth of 2%. Nothing to write home about, but it was the 13th consecutive quarter of positive comp sales growth, and they are continuing to focus on opening stores. McDonald's is everywhere, but this is amazing to think about. They're targeting 50,000 restaurants by the end of 2027 from just over 40,000 today. They still feel they've got a long [inaudible]"", 'Ron Gross: Where are they going?', ""Jason Moser: I know, and Ron, you'll have one in your garage. I think that's a fair question because Starbucks is doing the same thing. They're targeting opening up thousands of new stores as well, and you start going back to that Onion headline of A Starbucks Inside Of The Starbucks' Bathroom or something like that. You just saturate the market at some point, and you can't open stores forever, but they did just open their 6,000th store in China. They see that opportunity, still with plenty of runway there. I think when you look at it from a global perspective, and you look at this as a value proposition. They're, I guess you'd say, in the right place at the right time. It's not a stock that's going to double over the course of the next five years probably, but again, you probably own this one because of the income, because of the dividend, and it feels like they're doing a good job with the difficult conditions."", ""Dylan Lewis: Jason, you were talking about how McDonald's, being a value provider, plays very well right now with the market and with a pinched consumer. It's really interesting to me as we process results from all of the different restaurant fast-food, quick-serve, fast-casual brands because we had results from Chipotle that were absolutely stellar earlier in this earnings season. They are, I'd say, more in the upper middle-class as a standard customer, and then we see Starbucks in the middle getting waxed because they are both appealing to a value audience, appealing to not-so-much-of-a-value audience and seemingly having a harder time operating this environment."", ""Jason Moser: I think what Chipotle has done so well over the course of time is just basically remaining true to what they are. Along the way, they fiddled around with different concepts and maybe were going to try to open a pizza joint or burger joint, and they quickly realized that wasn't really a very good idea, but I will say that ShopHouse restaurant, I really wish they'd pursued that one, but they didn't. It does feel Chipotle has just remain true to what they do so well. When you look at Starbucks today versus the Starbucks that we knew 20 years ago, they're selling more cold beverages now, and that's different. It's not necessarily just coffee anymore. What comes with all of those cold beverages? A lot of different ingredients, a lot of management which breeds a lot of mismanagement, very difficult supply chain to manage there. We always make fun of them because they just have never nailed the food part right on Starbucks. I think that the juxtaposition there is interesting because you've got one business in Chipotle. They continue to do what they know how to do so well. It feels like Starbucks is a little bit aimless these days, and the market is making it pay the price for it."", ""Ron Gross: When I think of a company that does what they do so well, I think of a Chick-fil-A. Chick-fil-A knows what they're doing from a throughput, from a food perspective. I think, Cava, although it's in its infancy, could end up being like that as well, but you have to know who you are, and you have to know who your consumers are, and you have to deliver the quality product at the right price point. Not the easiest thing to do. Restaurants are notoriously tough things to run and tough things to invest in, but those that do it right, it really pays off."", ""Dylan Lewis: Coming up after the break, we've got stocks on our Radar.

Ron, what are you looking for this year in Berkshire's annual meeting?"", ""Ron Gross: It's the first one without Charlie Munger, so there's certainly going to be a lot of emotion in the room. It'll just be interesting to see how Mr. Buffett handles that, but I'm interested to hear, of course, about the health of the various businesses, what their plans are for stock buybacks. Shares are probably around two times tangible book value right now. It might be a little pricey for Warren, but if they're not going to find any huge acquisitions as they continue to struggle with, I'd like to see them continue to purchase stock back in a pretty meaningful way. It's always an interesting time to see what they're doing over there."", 'Dylan Lewis: Of course, be looking for the quotes. The quotes as well. Jason, what about you?', ""Jason Moser: I think with Berkshire, for me, especially with all of this dividend target, it comes back down to, at some point, are we going to see this company pay a dividend? It seems like now might be just an ideal time to do it. Buffett said here I think here recently that Berkshire is not set up to be some company that just presents these out-sized returns going forward, understandable. It's a big company, a lot of things going on. We know he likes dividends, Dylan. He loves it."", ""Dylan Lewis: He gobbles them up, and he doesn't want to pay them out."", ""Jason Moser: If we're looking at this new growth profile for Berkshire, at least according to his projections, I wonder if maybe now isn't a good time to consider a rewarding shareholders with a dividend policy because, obviously, he's not going to be there forever. You wonder if that's something where he wouldn't like to leave that as part of his legacy."", ""Dylan Lewis: Let's get over to stocks on our radar. Our man behind-the-glass, Dan Boyd, is going to hit you with a question. Ron, you're up first. What are you looking at this week?"", ""Ron Gross: I'm taking a look at Wingstop, W-I-N-G, a company I've never owned, but I have contributed to their sales quite a bit. Shares are up 75% over the last year, 450% over the last five years. We do like our wings. Obviously, they're a wing restaurant, 2300 restaurants systemwide. They're going to grow those well over 3,000. The numbers are very impressive: 34% increase in revenue, 66% in earnings per share. Hundred times forward earnings. I got to dig in a little bit more there. Their wings are good, but they're not that good."", ""Dylan Lewis: Wow, but I love that you're bringing it to us, Ron. Dan, a question about Wingstop."", ""Dan Boyd: Not really a question, more of a quick story. During the Super Bowl this year, I had to run out to the store to get something, and I drove past a Wingstop. I got to tell you, it is standing room only in there at halftime on the Super Bowl. When you'd think that people will be getting them delivered or already have eaten them, I've never had it, there's something going on over there."", ""Ron Gross: Digital sales, 68% of sales in Q1, so lots of people on their phones, but also a lot of people in the stores say I'm a wing snob ever since I got that trigger. I only like to make wings at home anymore."", ""Dylan Lewis: I will say, of the ones that you can go out and get, Wingstop is one of my favorites. A lot of the chains are doing very well. They do a pretty good job. Jason, what's on your radar this week?"", ""Jason Moser: Taking a look, a little bit of a closer look at CrowdStrike, ticker CRWD, I think several weeks back I had a call that Palo Alto Networks as a radar stock. When you look at cybersecurity, few market opportunities really offer the scale and the mission-critical nature that cybersecurity offers. It's an attractive market from that perspective, but it's a difficult one to understand. I am certainly no expert in the matter, and I've always felt maybe just investing in a cybersecurity ETF might be the better way to go, but it also feels maybe we get some winners in the space here, and CrowdStrike seems to be one. This Falcon platform that they have offers 27 modules for its customers to be able to use what they feel is necessary, and then they continue to add on modules. We've seen over time. Those customers that have been with them for longer periods of time, they do. They keep adding those modules all along the way. Twenty-nine thousand subscription customers worldwide. You've got a revenue that's grown about 65% over the last five years annually."", 'Dylan Lewis: Dan, a question about CrowdStrike.', ""Dan Boyd: Before we got on for this segment, I was, like, is it Cloudflare or CrowdStrike?

The tender offer begins today, May 8, 2024, and will expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on June 5, 2024, unless extended or earlier terminated by Monster. The tender offer will be funded using a combination of (1) $2.0 billion of cash on hand, (2) $750.0 million in borrowings under a new term loan, and (3) $250.0 million in borrowings under a new revolving credit facility. Monster and certain of its subsidiaries expect to enter into a new credit agreement providing for a new $750 million three-year delayed draw senior term loan A facility (the “Term Loan”) and a new $750.0 million five-year senior revolving credit facility (the “RCF”) at least five business days prior to the expiration of the tender offer. It is a condition to the consummation of the tender offer that the credit agreement is entered into and at least $1.0 billion is funded under the Term Loan and the RCF at least five business days prior to the expiration of the tender offer (the “Financing Condition”). If the Financing Condition is not satisfied and Monster does not waive the Financing Condition, Monster may amend, terminate or extend the tender offer.', 'Monster shareholders may tender all or a portion of their shares at a price specified by the tendering shareholder of not less than $53.00 nor greater than $60.00 per share in increments of $0.50. Alternatively, Monster shareholders may tender shares without specifying a purchase price, in which case their shares will be purchased at the purchase price determined in accordance with the tender offer. When the tender offer expires, Monster will determine the lowest price per share within the range specified above that will enable it to purchase the maximum number of shares of its common stock having an aggregate purchase price up to $3.0 billion. All shares accepted in the tender offer will be purchased at the same price, which may be higher or lower than the market price immediately prior to or during the tender offer. If the tender offer is fully subscribed, then shares of common stock having an aggregate purchase price of up to $3.0 billion will be purchased, which would represent approximately between 4.8% to 5.4% of Monster’s issued and outstanding shares as of April 22, 2024, depending on the purchase price payable in the tender offer. In addition, if shares valued at more than the maximum aggregate purchase price of up to $3.0 billion are tendered in the tender offer at or below the purchase price, Monster may accept for purchase at the purchase price pursuant to the tender offer up to an additional 2% of its outstanding shares without extending the expiration time of the tender offer.', ""The tender offer is being made outside of Monster’s existing stock repurchase programs. The tender offer provides all Monster shareholders, including Rodney Sacks and Hilton Schlosberg, Monster’s Co-CEOs, with the opportunity to obtain liquidity for all or a portion of their shares with less potential disruption than open-market sales or other transactions. Mr. Sacks and Mr. Schlosberg have communicated their intent to tender up to 610,000 and 610,000 shares, respectively, for investment diversification and estate planning purposes. In addition, Sterling Trustees LLC, which controls trusts and entities for the benefit of certain family members of Mr. Sacks and Mr. Schlosberg, has advised Monster that it intends to tender up to an aggregate of 20,500,000 shares on behalf of such trusts and entities.

No other directors or executive officers intend to tender any of their shares in the tender offer. The tender of shares by Mr. Sacks, in particular, may provide him some flexibility to consider his own potential options, which may also help Monster continue succession planning for its next phase of leadership. In this regard, after consultation with the Board, Mr. Sacks is considering reducing his day-to-day management responsibilities starting in 2025, while continuing to manage certain areas of Monster's business for which he has always been responsible.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So while Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST) has a high ROCE right now, lets see what we can decipher from how returns are changing.', ""For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Monster Beverage:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.23 = US$2.1b ÷ (US$10b - US$1.2b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).', ""Therefore, Monster Beverage has an ROCE of 23%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Beverage industry average of 17%."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Monster Beverage ', ""In the above chart we have measured Monster Beverage's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Monster Beverage  for free."", ""In terms of Monster Beverage's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. While it's comforting that the ROCE is high, five years ago it was 33%. Although, given both revenue and the amount of assets employed in the business have increased, it could suggest the company is investing in growth, and the extra capital has led to a short-term reduction in ROCE. If these investments prove successful, this can bode very well for long term stock performance."", ""In summary, despite lower returns in the short term, we're encouraged to see that Monster Beverage is reinvesting for growth and has higher sales as a result. Furthermore the stock has climbed 75% over the last five years, it would appear that investors are upbeat about the future. So should these growth trends continue, we'd be optimistic on the stock going forward."", 'If you want to continue researching Monster Beverage, you might be interested to know about the 1 warning sign that our analysis has discovered.', 'High returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our free list ofstocks earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.', 'Have feedback on this article?

GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with MNST.', ""On May 7, 2024, Monster Beverage Corp (NASDAQ:MNST) released its 10-Q filing, revealing a financial landscape marked by growth and strategic expansion. The company, a dominant force in the energy drink market, reported a net income of $442,049 thousand for the first quarter of 2024, a notable increase from $397,444 thousand in the same period the previous year. Net sales also surged to $1.90 million thousand from $1.70 million thousand, underscoring Monster Beverage Corp's financial vigor. With a diverse portfolio that includes Monster Energy, Monster Ultra, and newly acquired alcohol brands, the company is poised for continued success. However, navigating the complexities of international markets and fluctuating currency rates remains a challenge for Monster Beverage Corp as it seeks to maintain its competitive edge."", ""Brand Power and Market Position: Monster Beverage Corp (NASDAQ:MNST) has cemented its status as a powerhouse in the energy drink industry, with its Monster Energy Drinks segment accounting for a staggering 91% of net sales in the first quarter of 2024. The company's brand strength is not just in its market share but also in its ability to command higher per case net operating revenues compared to its Strategic Brands segment. This dominance is further bolstered by a 19.5% stake held by Coca-Cola, which not only provides a vote of confidence from a beverage titan but also a strategic partnership that enhances Monster's distribution capabilities."", 'Financial Health: The financial tables from the 10-Q filing reveal a robust balance sheet for Monster Beverage Corp. With cash and cash equivalents rising to $2.58 million thousand from $2.30 million thousand at the end of the previous year, the company demonstrates strong liquidity. Additionally, a significant increase in net income from $397,444 thousand to $442,049 thousand in the first quarter year-over-year indicates healthy profitability. This financial health provides Monster with the flexibility to invest in growth opportunities and weather economic downturns.', ""Innovative Product Portfolio: Innovation is a cornerstone of Monster Beverage Corp's strategy, as evidenced by its diverse product offerings that cater to various consumer preferences. The acquisition of a craft brewer in 2022 expanded the company's portfolio into the alcohol sector, showcasing its adaptability and foresight in capitalizing on market trends. This move not only diversifies revenue streams but also positions Monster to tap into the growing craft beer and flavored malt beverage markets."", ""Dependence on Core Market: Despite its strong brand and financial performance, Monster Beverage Corp's heavy reliance on the energy drink segment could be a potential weakness. With 91% of net sales attributed to the Monster Energy Drinks segment, any market saturation, regulatory changes, or shifts in consumer preferences within this niche could significantly impact the company's revenue and growth prospects."", ""Foreign Currency Exchange Risks: Monster Beverage Corp's international expansion exposes it to foreign currency exchange risks.

These currency fluctuations can erode profits and complicate financial planning."", ""Supply Chain Dependencies: The company's operational model relies on outsourcing beverage manufacturing, packaging, and distribution, which could lead to vulnerabilities in its supply chain.

To skip the detailed analysis of the current economic landscape, go directly to the 5 Best Stocks That Will Always Grow.', ""At the Federal Reserve’s May 1 meeting, Chairman Jerome Powell focused on the Fed's dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and stable prices. The Fed maintained the federal funds rate at 5.25% to 5.5% and said that while the economic activity has been solid, with robust consumer spending and job gains, inflation remains a concern. The unemployment rate remains low at 3.8%, but the GDP growth moderated from 3.4% in the fourth quarter of 2023 to 1.6% in the first quarter of 2024. The market remained strong after the Fed meeting as the S&P 500 was 2.21% higher between May 1 and May 3 market close."", 'Billionaire Leon Cooperman of Omega Advisors believes that the current US debt levels could be too high to manage. He expressed concern about the growing debt crisis in the United States in a CNBC interview on April 23, adding that leadership has failed to address it effectively. Cooperman referenced past endorsements of the Simpson-Bowles report by political figures like Mitt Romney and Senator Joe Manchin, emphasizing that the problem has only worsened since then. He believes that deficits do matter and warns that the country is heading towards a financial crisis due to the lack of action on this issue.', ""The Simpson-Bowles report refers to the recommendations put forward by the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform in 2010 to address the United States' fiscal challenges. The growing debt problem was one of the main concerns of the commission, and their report proposed a comprehensive set of measures to reduce the deficit through a combination of spending cuts, tax reforms, and changes to entitlement programs."", 'If we take Leon Cooperman’s warnings into consideration, investors are more likely to favor defensive sectors like consumer defensive, health care, and utilities. Major companies from these sectors thrived during the financial crisis of 2007-2009. During that crisis, the S&P 500 lost over 56% of its value. On the other hand, between the start of 2007 and the end of 2009, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) share price gained nearly 13%. Moreover, the healthcare company, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) was nearly 14.7% higher during the same period.', 'Walmart Inc.

Furthermore, the company has been increasing its dividends for 52 years and has a dividend yield of 1.39%, as of May 3. At its latest earnings call, Walmart Inc.’s (NYSE:WMT) CEO, Doug McMillon made the following comments:', '“We were strong in the U.S., Mexico, Canada, and India, where we had the best Big Billion Days ever, and we continued the strong performance in China with the start of Chinese New Year. Typically, we see some of our customer experience scores dip during the high-volume hours and days we experience during the holidays. But during Q4, the Walmart U.S. team delivered three-year high customer scores in our stores for pickup and delivery from stores and for those orders that flow directly from our e-commerce fulfillment centers.', ""I'm excited about the omnichannel net promoter score trends the team is driving. Across countries, we continue to see a customer that's resilient but looking for value. As always, we're working hard to deliver that for them, including through our rollbacks on food pricing in Walmart U.S. Those were up significantly in Q4 versus last year, following a big increase in Q3.”"", 'While Abbott Laboratories’ (NYSE:ABT) revenue declined in 2023, it still grew at a CAGR of 5.6% over the last 5 years. Additionally, the company’s stock price resilience isn’t the only thing that makes it a good buy during a financial crisis, it is also a magnificent dividend growth stock. Similar to Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), the company has raised its dividend for the 52nd consecutive year. As of May 3, the company has a dividend yield of 2.08%. Polen Capital also sees accelerating earnings growth for Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) as it said in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:', '“We increased our positions in ThermoFisher Scientific, Visa, Zoetis, Nike, and Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT). Each of these companies is durable and available at attractive valuations, in our view, for the growth we see ahead. In fact, in the case of ThermoFisher, Nike, and Abbott Labs, we expect accelerating earnings growth in the back half of 2024 after more difficult earnings growth periods pass for each of these companies. ThermoFisher and Abbott will finally wind down most of their COVID-19 testing and vaccine-related efforts due to a lack of demand, so these should no longer be revenue growth headwinds.”', 'While analysts keep mixed views on the economy, investors can look toward the companies with consistent top-line growth regardless of the economic conditions.

Cocoa prices, a key input for HSY, have seen a nearly unprecedented price spike on supply disruptions in West Africa (where the majority of global supply originates). While we cannot predict when cocoa prices deflate, we are confident HSY and its largest competitors will be slow to reverse price increases required to recoup the input cost squeeze.

Inflation and the uncertain economy aren’t hurting demand for Philip Morris’ red-hot nicotine pouch product Zyn, which saw shipment volume increase by an incredible 79.7% year-over-year during its first quarter of the year.', 'Big box retailers like Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) are competitive in any type of economic environment, thanks to their low-cost offerings.', 'Lastly, Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ), the maker of popular snacks like Oreos and Chips Ahoy! is the type of company many consumers will buy products from as an affordable pick-me-up when they may not be able to afford other luxuries in a down economy.', 'Other notable VDC holdings from beyond the top 10 include Hershey, Keurig Dr Pepper (NYSE:KDP), Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST), and Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH). Hershey just reported impressive first-quarter earnings in which it brushed off rising cocoa prices to beat estimates. Its earnings grew 3.7% year-over-year, and revenue increased 8.7%. ', 'As these results show, top consumer staples stocks like these have strong brands and persistent demand to succeed during a challenging macroeconomic environment.', 'In addition to these resilient business models and strong demand, another thing that VDC’s top holdings have in common is their strong Smart Scores.\xa0The Smart Score is a proprietary quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from 1 to 10 based on eight market key factors. A score of 8 or above is equivalent to an Outperform rating.', 'Eight out of VDC’s top 10 holdings have Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores of 8 or above, and VDC itself has an Outperform-equivalent ETF Smart Score of 8 out of 10.', 'Whether it’s Pepsi and Coca-Cola or Altria and Philip Morris, many of VDC’s top holdings are lauded for their long dividend histories, so it’s no surprise that VDC is a dividend payer.', 'VDC currently yields 2.5%. While it’s not a huge dividend yield, it trumps that of the S&P 500 (SPX), which yields 1.4%. Plus, VDC has a reliable track record as a dividend payer, having made dividend payments to its holders for 18 years in a row.', 'Like many of its Vanguard peers, it features a modest expense ratio of just 0.10% (a 0.09% management fee plus 0.01% in other expenses). This means that an investor in the fund will pay just $10 in fees on an investment of $10,000 annually.', 'Over time, investing in low-cost funds like this can save investors a considerable amount of money. Assuming the fund returns 5% per year going forward and maintains its current expense ratio, the investor putting $10,000 into the fund will pay just $128 in fees over a 10-year time frame.', 'How does this help investors to save? Let’s compare VDC to another consumer staples ETF with a higher expense ratio, the iShares U.S. Consumer Staples ETF (NYSEARCA:IYK), which has $1.3 billion in AUM and charges an expense ratio of 0.40%. An investor putting $10,000 into IYK will pay $40 in fees annually, and assuming the same parameters as above, this investor will pay a much higher $505 in fees over a 10-year time horizon, illustrating the considerable savings offered by a low-cost fund like VDC.', 'Below, you can check out a comparison of VDC and IYK using TipRanks’ ETF Comparison Tool, which allows users to compare up to 20 ETFs at a time based on a variety of inputs.', 'Turning to Wall Street, VDC earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 56 Buys, 43 Holds, and six Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average VDC stock price target of $220.16 implies 8.8% upside potential.', 'I’m bullish on consumer staples and VDC in particular. The economy goes through ups and downs, and the stock market ebbs and flows, but consumers always need the basics that consumer staples companies sell, whether it’s their favorite soft drink from Coca-Cola or Pepsi or toothpaste from Colgate-Palmolive. It may not be the sexiest sector, but these companies have strong and consistent earnings and revenue.', 'Throughout earnings season, we’ve seen companies like Coca-Cola, Hershey, Philip Morris, Colgate-Palmolive, and other consumer staples names prove this.', 'I’m also bullish on VDC, specifically because of its holdings’ strong Smart Scores, low expense ratio, and attractive dividend.', 'Disclosure']"

Leasing momentum continued, as I mentioned, we signed more than 1,300 leases for approximately 6.3 million square feet. Approximately 25% of our leasing activity in the first quarter was new deal volume. We are approximately 65% complete with our '24 lease expirations and we continue to see strong broad-based demand from the retail community. Retail sales volume across the portfolio increased 2.3% for the first quarter compared to last year. Our tourist-oriented properties outperformed the portfolio average in the quarter with a 6% increase in sales. Reported retail sales per square foot in the first quarter was $745 a foot for our outlets and malls combined, which was flat year-over-year, excluding two retailers."", 'Retail sales per square foot from our premium outlet platform reached an all-time high this quarter. Occupancy cost at the end of the first quarter was 12.6%. Now let me talk about other platform investments affectionately known as OPI. We sold our remaining interest in Authentic Brands Group during the first quarter for gross proceeds of close to $1.2 billion and recorded a pre-tax and after-tax gain of $415 million and $311 million, respectively. The sale in the first quarter combined with the sale in the fourth quarter yielded gross proceeds of $1.45 billion. We generated substantial value from the ABG investment and a 7x multiple on our net invested capital during our short ownership period. As a result of the sale of ABG and the restructuring charges that I mentioned earlier, one-time in nature at SPARC and Penny in the first quarter, we now expect FFO contribution from OPI to be around breakeven this year compared to the initial guidance of $0.10 to $0.15.', 'For your reference, we budgeted the -- at OPI, the FFO from ABG around $0.08 per share, so roughly half of that was associated with ABG. Now moving on to new development and redevelopment, we opened an AC Hotel at St. Johns Center. We are opening Tulsa Premium outlets this summer, leasing is going great, and we have a significant expansion at Busan Premium outlets in South Korea this fall. At the end of the quarter, new development and redevelopment projects were underway across our platforms in the US and Internationally as well with our share of net cost of $930 million at a blended yield of 8%. We expect to start construction on additional projects in the next few months, including just shortly our residential project at Northgate Station in Seattle.', ""What's interesting for us is we're able to build when others need to rely on construction lending market, which is, as you might imagine very difficult right now. We expect our starts to be around $500 million this year now. On our balance sheet, we retired $600 million of senior notes in the quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately $11.2 billion of liquidity. Today, we announced our dividend of $2 per share for the second quarter, a year-over-year increase of 8.1%. The dividend is payable on June 28 and given the transactions for this quarter and our results for this quarter, our current view for the remainder of the year, we're increasing the full range of our full year guidance of 2024 in the guidance range of $11.85 to, I'm sorry, let me restate that, we're increasing our range to $12.75 to $12.90 per share compared to $12.51 last year."", ""This is an increase of $0.90 at the bottom end of the range and $0.85 at the midpoint. Needless to say, I'm very pleased with our first quarter results and our business and tenant demand continues to remain strong despite a cloudy macro-environment. Occupancy is increasing. Property NOI is growing. We made a significant profit on our ABG investment and everything is kind of moving in all the right directions. Thank you.

During this period, the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, which Hologic falls in, has lost 2.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?"", ""Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision."", 'Revisions to Earnings Estimates', ""Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements."", 'For the current quarter, Hologic is expected to post earnings of $1.02 per share, indicating a change of +9.7% from the year-ago quarter.

The S&P 500, one of the leading stock indexes in the world, gained 10.2% in the first three months of 2024, achieving its best first-quarter performance in five years. The impressive performance sparked greater interest among investors in the stock market. In March, investors poured roughly $50 billion into funds focused on purchasing stocks in the US, as reported by EPFR Global Data. That said, it is important to bear in mind that it is the bigger companies that are driving the market upward, especially those that are attentive to the ongoing artificial intelligence wave. The ‘Magnificent Seven’ accounted for 40% of the market’s overall gains in the first three months, according to data by S&P Dow Jones Indices. Meta’s remarkable returns of over 40% during the period were massively driven by the company’s announcement of its first-ever dividend earlier this year.', 'Dividends play an important role in the investment landscape, with approximately 80% of the companies in the S&P 500 paying dividends to shareholders.

In fact, just 13% of the companies in the index are included in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, an elite group that tracks the performance of companies growing their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. Investors also favor dividend growth stocks due to their strong performance over the years, particularly during periods of high interest rates. In our article titled 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we cited Abrdn’s data and reported that from December 2002 to December 2022, dividend growers and initiators delivered a compounded return of 10.68%, compared with a 2.70% return of dividend cutters and eliminators.

Also on the line are Linda Chen, Frederic Luvisutto and Jenny Holaday. I want to remind you that we may make forward-looking statements under safe harbor federal securities laws, and those statements may or may not come true. I will now turn the call over to Craig Billings.', 'Craig Scott Billings', ""Thanks, Julie. Good afternoon, everyone, as always. Thanks for joining us today. The momentum that we generated in the business throughout 2023 continued into 2024 as we delivered all-time record property EBITDAR of $647 million during the first quarter of 2024. I'm incredibly proud of all of our team members who remain so focused on delivering 5-star service and one-of-a-kind experiences to our guests. A heartfelt thank you to each of you. Turning to the quarter and starting here in Vegas. Wynn Las Vegas delivered $246 million of adjusted property EBITDAR, a first quarter record and up 6% year-on-year on a very difficult comp. As we noted on our last call, most of the action in the quarter was concentrated in February as the combination of Super Bowl and Chinese New Year drove all-time record EBITDAR during the month. Quarter was characterized by strong performance across our nongaming businesses with revenue growing 16% year-on-year, led by 21% growth in hotel revenue along with healthy volumes in the casino. Through our unique combination of the best service levels in the market, continuous reinvestment in our property and our Only at Wynn programming, we continue to fire on all cylinders here in Las Vegas. More recently, our top line trends remained healthy in April with drop, handle and RevPAR all up year-over-year on yet another difficult comp. Turning to Boston. Encore generated $63 million of EBITDAR during the quarter. The team in Boston successfully navigated a confluence of poor weather in January and inflationary pressures during the quarter as EBITDAR and revenue at the property were largely stable year-on-year. There were encouraging pockets of strength in the quarter with record slot handle and strong year-on-year growth in hotel revenue. More recently, demand has remained healthy through April with particular strength in slot handle and RevPAR. On the development across from Encore Boston Harbor, we have put this development on hold for the time being as we have been unable to reach an agreement with local authorities on certain financial terms. Though it's disappointing, we have numerous other development projects globally where we can redirect the capital we intended to deploy in Boston. Turning to Macau. We generated $340 million of EBITDAR in the quarter on GGR market share that was above both the prior quarter and above our 2019 exit. We held above our expected range. So on a fully normalized basis, EBITDAR would have been approximately $320 million. The strength in our business has continued into Q2. In the casino, our mass drop per day in April increased 30% versus April 2019. And on the nongaming side, our hotel occupancy was 99%. Overall, strong top line performance, combined with disciplined OpEx control drove healthy margins during April. We were also pleased with the results during May Golden Week, particularly in light of unfavorable weather in the region. In the casino, mass drop per day increased 30% versus the comparable 2019 holiday period and approach levels seen during last Chinese New Year. On the development front in Macau, we began initial demolition and construction work on our second concession-related project, our destination food hall. We are well into design and planning for our other major concession-related CapEx commitments, including our new events and entertainment center and a unique theater and showroom. Turning to Wynn Al Marjan in the UAE. Construction is rapidly advancing on the project. And as of this week, we are currently constructing the fourth floor of the hotel tower. You can find recent renderings and images of Wynn Al Marjan in a press release we issued yesterday ahead of a major travel convention taking place this week in Dubai. And I expect we will further update you on the advances we have made on the project later this year. Finally, we are actively considering greenfield development opportunities in New York City and potentially Thailand. In New York, we believe a full-scale Wynn integrated resort in Hudson Yards will drive meaningful incremental tax revenue, tourism and employment in the state. Despite the elongation of the RFA submission process in New York, we remain intrigued by the prospect of a Wynn resort in Manhattan. In Thailand, it's early days, and we have yet to see the regulatory and licensing structures. Thailand is already a major tourism destination with significant tourism infrastructure and a world-class service culture so we will continue to closely monitor advancement of the legalization process. I remain incredibly bullish about the future of our company. In Las Vegas, we remain at the pinnacle of the market with tremendous demand for what we offer. And in an inflationary environment like this, we have the luxury of being able to reprice our hotel rooms every day in order to take advantage of that demand. In Macau, we continue to punch above our weight on a revenue per hotel room basis generating meaningful market share and substantial discretionary free cash flow. We also have a meaningful high-ROI project underway in the UAE along with potential greenfield developments in other attractive gateway cities. Meanwhile, our leverage profile continues to improve as does our outlook on future free cash flow. Our best days lie ahead. With that, I will now turn it over to Julie to run through some additional details on the quarter. Julie?"", 'Julie Mireille Cameron-Doe', ""Thank you, Craig. At Wynn Las Vegas, we generated $246.3 million in adjusted property EBITDAR on $636.5 million of operating revenue during the quarter delivering an EBITDAR margin of 38.7%. Hold was a bit of a mixed bag given results in the Sportsbook, and we estimate a net $5 million benefit from higher than normal hold in the quarter. OpEx, excluding gaming tax per day, was $4.1 million in Q1 2024, up 9% year-over-year and in line with the increase in operating revenues as we successfully absorbed incremental OpEx related to Super Bowl programming, union-related payroll increases and other inflationary pressures. Turning to Boston. We generated adjusted property EBITDAR of $63 million on revenue of $217.8 million with an EBITDAR margin of 29%. We've stayed very disciplined on the cost side and, excluding a $2 million benefit from a onetime item, OpEx per day was $1.19 million in Q1 2024, up around 2% year-over-year. The team has done a great job mitigating union-related payroll increases with cost efficiencies in areas of the business that do not impact the guest experience. Our Macau operations delivered adjusted property EBITDAR of $339.6 million in the quarter on $998.6 million of operating revenue. As Craig alluded to, we estimate higher than normal hold positively impacted EBITDA by around $19 million during the quarter. VIP hold was largely in the normal range with the hold impact primarily related to higher than normal hold on Wynn Palace's mass table games. EBITDA margin was 34% in the quarter, an increase of 140 basis points relative to Q4 2023 and 310 basis points relative to Q1 2019. Overall, our strong margin expansion relative to 2019 has been driven by a combination of the favorable mix shift to higher-margin mass gaming and operating leverage on cost efficiencies. Our OpEx, excluding gaming tax, was approximately $2.6 million per day in Q1, a decrease of 17% compared to $3.2 million in Q1 2019. OpEx increased 3% on a sequential basis, well below the 10% increase in operating revenue. The team has done a great job staying disciplined on costs, and we remain well positioned to drive strong operating leverage as the market continues to recover. In terms of CapEx in Macau, we're currently advancing through the design and planning stages on several of our concession commitments. And as we noted the past few quarters, these projects require a number of government approvals, creating a wide range of potential CapEx outcomes in the near term. As such, we continue to expect CapEx related to our concession commitments to range between $350 million and $500 million in total between 2024 and the end of 2025. Moving on to the balance sheet. Our liquidity position remains very strong with global cash and revolver availability of nearly $4.2 billion as of March 31. This was comprised of $2.2 billion of total cash and available liquidity in Macau and approximately $2 billion in the U.S. On the capital markets front, in February, we issued a $400 million add-on to the Wynn Resorts Finance 2031 unsecured notes with net proceeds along with cash on hand used to fund the tender and repurchase of $800 million of Wynn Las Vegas notes maturing in March 2025. Over the past 4 quarters, we've reduced company-wide gross debt by approximately $1 billion. Bringing it all together, the combination of strong performance in each of our markets globally, with our properties generating over $2.3 billion of trailing 12-month property EBITDAR, together with our robust cash position, creates a very healthy consolidated net leverage ratio of just over 4x. Our strong free cash flow and liquidity profile allows us to reduce leverage while returning capital to shareholders. To that end, the Board approved a cash dividend of $0.25 per share payable on May 31, 2024 to stockholders of record as of May 20, 2024. Additionally, in late March, the Wynn Macau Board recommended the reinstatement of a dividend at $0.075 per share or USD 50 million highlighting our commitment to prudently returning capital to shareholders in both the U.S. and Macau. Finally, our CapEx in the quarter was $97.7 million primarily related to the Villa renovations and food and beverage enhancements at Wynn Las Vegas, concession-related CapEx in Macau and normal course maintenance across the business. Additionally, we contributed $70 million of equity to the Wynn Al Marjan Island JV project during the quarter, bringing the total equity contribution to date to approximately $160 million. With that, we will now open up the call to Q&A."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank.', 'Carlo Santarelli', ""Craig, just in terms of what you're seeing in Macau, obviously, you guys had a strong quarter. Everything seemed to flow through very nicely. In terms of the competitive landscape that you're seeing into May now relative to perhaps what you're seeing last quarter or fourth quarter, more specifically, could you kind of characterize what's (inaudible) the market at?"", 'Craig Scott Billings', ""Yes. Sure, Carlo. You cut out a little bit there at the end, but I got the gist of your question. Macau has always been and is currently a competitive market. And as you know, we focus on product and service, and we focus on attracting the best guests in the market. So I've seen a lot of the questions and the commentary around promotional activity. I don't really want to speak to promotional activity by others in the market. But I can tell you that our reinvestment can move 50, 75 basis points in any given quarter depending upon what we are trying to achieve. But the core of our competitive strength remains product and service. And I think you can see that in Q1 with both our results and our margin."", 'Carlo Santarelli', 'Helpful. And then, Craig, just going back to your remarks on Las Vegas. You made a point of kind of calling out February being the primary driver of the quarter. You then follow that up with drop, handle, RevPAR kind of all up in April and mentioned kind of tougher comparisons along the way. How do you kind of foresee what is a very, obviously, tough comp stack as you move through the balance of this year in the market?', 'Craig Scott Billings', ""Sure. Well, first, as it specifically relates to drop and handle, we've almost doubled handle from 2019 to 2023, and a lot of that was share taking. We have table drop that's up almost 50% in the same period so not too shabby. And as you know, I've said on several calls, trees don't grow to the sky. But all that being said, the comps are getting tougher. And if you go to a CPI calculator online, you will find that the purchasing power of $1 today is the same as about $0.80 in March of 2019. So for a casino and a hotel operator like us who can reprice rooms every day and whose customers gaming bankrolls reflect the current value of the dollar, we shouldn't be surprised that results today when compared to the past look pretty good. Of course, that pricing power is exacerbated by the strength of what we offer here in Las Vegas with the best service quality, the best physical experience and top-notch program. You can layer on top of that that our target customer base, they can now earn 5 points on their money just by putting it in the bank, and that has seen pretty strong wealth creation over the past several quarters, it's a pretty powerful EBITDA setup. Of course, by the way, the vast majority of our deployed capital here and our debt is in yesterday's dollars. So that EBITDA setup also works wonders for returns and discretionary free cash flow. I digress slightly, but when do things go from absolutely unbelievable to just really great? I don't know the answer to that. The best I can do is give you a clear picture of what we're seeing right now as I did in my prepared remarks with respect to April, and it's good."", 'Operator', 'Our next caller is Joe Greff with JPMorgan.', 'Joseph Richard Greff', ""My first question is on Macau and follows up on Carlos' Macau-related promotional question. If we look at the 1Q, the conversion of gross gaming revenues of Macau to casino revenues was at a better clip than it was in the fourth quarter and all of last year by quarter. How much of that sequential improvement over the last couple of quarters is just a function of maybe a high hold versus maybe you're operating the business differently than maybe some of your peers who are seeing that relationship sequence less favorably for them than it has for you?"", 'Craig Scott Billings', ""Yes. Thanks, Joe. It has a lot to do with the revamp of our loyalty program and the fact that we have given our customers choice in terms of how they want their reinvestment. And so in any given quarter, those choices change. And some of those choices flow to contra revenue and some of those choices flow to OpEx. So that's really the primary driver. It's not indicative of a systemic change in the aggregate reinvestment."", 'Operator', 'Our next caller is Shaun Kelley with Bank of America.', 'Shaun Clisby Kelley', ""Craig or Julie, I just wanted to ask about maybe the Macau OpEx trajectory. Obviously, you've driven and sounds like you expect to continue to see some pretty great operating leverage there. But it is -- as we're still normalizing in that market, it's probably a little bit tougher for us to get a sense of just sort of underlying core expense growth or inflation. So any comments as things start to annualize and normalize a little bit? How much kind of on a year-on-year basis you'd expect that to level off to maybe in the back half of the year?"", 'Julie Mireille Cameron-Doe', ""Sure. Shaun, I'll take that one. Yes, we've talked quite a bit about OpEx and how we've been very disciplined in managing it and how we've been able to accommodate the nongaming OpEx that we have to spend to meet our concession commitments. So we've been really disciplined. We had OpEx per day of $2.63 million in Q1. So it's still well below Q1 '19 levels, and it's only up 3% sequentially. It was a big Q in terms of what we call tentpole events. And it's -- obviously, the OpEx increase is well below the 10% we've had sequentially in operating revenue. So we had -- we were really pleased with the flow-through there. Going forward, we're going to continue to be really disciplined around OpEx. We have good line of sight to the events calendar and how we'll continue to incorporate that. So as we have our EBITDA margin at both properties above Q1 '19 levels and our OpEx were well controlled, we really expect revenue mix to be the key driver of margins going forward. We're going to have some quarter-to-quarter variation as we see different events on the calendar, and we continue to roll out programming. But we feel pretty good about what we've managed to land with OpEx. And we see potential for some quarters to be slightly inside of that $2.63 million. And maybe in a bigger quarter, it might be slightly outside of that. But overall, we're in a good place."", 'Shaun Clisby Kelley', ""Super. And just as my follow-up, Craig, to go back to sort of the Las Vegas macro commentary, I mean, I think what many of us struggling with, and I'm sure you're familiar with this in conversations with industry executives, is just -- there have been some comments out there about some leisure -- even at the high end, some leisure pushback when maybe the product mix isn't perfect. And I think -- in some cases, it looks like Wynn is kind of perfect on many of these metrics. But I'm just curious, as you look through all the KPIs across your business, did you see any area of skittishness? I mean, any area that you would consider normalization or movement around or the truth is the dynamics are alive and well there and again, we may just need to be looking somewhere else across the strip or outside of Las Vegas to see that change in the consumer right now?"", 'Craig Scott Billings', ""Yes. Sure, Sean. Not really. So if you think about what's happening in Vegas, those who have deployed capital in Vegas over the course of the past 5 years, it actually hasn't been so much -- at least innovative capital. It actually hasn't been so much the industry. It's been the sphere, it's been the raters. It's been smaller but still impactful capital deployment here that has driven all kinds of demand to the market. And you've heard our competitors talk about this as well, and we have a unique position in the market. So again, I'll say it, trees don't grow to the sky and comps get tougher and tougher over time. But from a pricing power perspective, we feel great, certainly relative to the rest of the strip. Brian, do you have any comments on what we're seeing in the booking window at this point?"", 'Brian Gullbrants', ""Yes. I mean, everything is pretty much a result of retreated back to what it was in 2019 with respect to bookings. And when you look at the pace of group, we continue to pace to have our best year ever over '23, which was our best year ever, and '25 and '26 are pacing nicely, not just in group, but we're seeing that across the board. So I think continuing to focus on our people, our assets, our experiential events that we put together really allow us to just drive price and continue to balance all our channels."", 'Craig Scott Billings', ""And what it means by 2019 is that it's reverted to a normal -- a very normal booking process."", 'Brian Gullbrants', ""The booking windows are back to normal, and it's quite nice."", 'Operator', 'Our next caller is Dan Politzer with Wells Fargo.', 'Daniel Brian Politzer', ""Just one quick one on Las Vegas. Just in terms of your occupancy at that property, I mean you typically run in the high 80s there. I mean you're getting as much rate as it looks like you want. I mean fundamentally, is that property structurally different in that relative to the Macau properties where you run occupancy close to 99%? It just seems like -- I know there's a balance there, but any reason occupancy in Vegas couldn't go higher as you keep pushing rates up modestly?"", 'Craig Scott Billings', ""Sure. So first and foremost, and this is true company-wide, we never want to be in a position where we have to walk someone because we don't have their room type or we don't have their room available for them. Second, at some point, the experience on the property actually degrades if you get to use an extreme 99% occupancy. So we're always balancing occupancy and rate in order to drive strong revenue results but also maintain a great experience on the property. Macau is very different. Macau, there is a decent amount of occupancy that occurs on the day. So you have people that are in-market and we will offer them a room while they're in-market so you have the ability to drive up that occupancy very, very close to 100%. So it's really just a difference in market dynamics. And can we run higher in Vegas? Sure, we could. We could do that. And at times, we do. We do run higher and then it washes out later in the quarter where we run lower. It's really just a question of the on-premises experience and maximizing revenue."", 'Daniel Brian Politzer', ""Got it. And then just switching to Thailand. Maybe could you talk a little bit about that opportunity potentially? I know it's quite early days but just high level in terms of timing, project size, how competitive do you think this process would be? Any incremental color would be great."", 'Craig Scott Billings', ""Sure. Yes, it's very, very early. I mean, we -- first things first, we need to understand that the regulatory structure, the licensing structure, the bidding structure, et cetera, are all going to be consistent with other jurisdictions that are considered best-in-class. I personally think they will be based on the information that we have to date. But that's really a condition precedent to our further involvement. It's an interesting market for the reasons that I described in my prepared remarks, lots of great infrastructure, a very strong tourism sector today. And I think it will be a competitive process. I think in any market like that, that has those dynamics, I think you're going to find a lot of folks that are interested in being there. And we are very confident in our capabilities given the strength of the portfolio as it exists today and the talent that we have in this business."", 'Operator', 'Our next caller is John DeCree with CBRE.', 'John G. DeCree', ""First one, maybe, Craig, you've introduced some new renderings and photos of Al Marjan in front of the ATM conference here in Dubai. Curious if you could remind us total capital contribution and budget or construction cost and if that's changed at all since you've kind of updated the renderings for that project."", 'Craig Scott Billings', ""Sure. The total budget is around $4 billion. If budgets move here and there but no substantial movement, our capital contribution will be, round numbers, call it, $900 million. That heavily depends on the construction leverage. So we're in the midst of figuring that out now. But you can figure something like 50-50 debt to equity and then we would be 40% of the equity."", 'John G. DeCree', ""Got it. Understood. That's helpful. And then maybe one back domestically to get a little granular, perhaps in Las Vegas on the quarter. You called out February. We knew that was going to be an event-driven month. But I was wondering if you could kind of parse out what January and March look like. And I guess some color on April coming out of the quarter quite strong. But as you kind of size up 1Q, any comments about January and March, specifically relative to year-over-year in terms of performance."", 'Craig Scott Billings', 'Sure. What I would say is this. February, as we called out, it would be -- was, of course, the strongest month of the quarter. And then in rank order, it would be March and January.', 'Operator', 'Our next caller is Robin Farley with UBS.', 'Robin Margaret Farley', 'I wonder if you could just touch on anything for Al Marjan that has to happen from a regulatory perspective approval at any level. If the construction were done tomorrow before it can actually start operating the casino, just to clarify that.', 'Craig Scott Billings', 'Sure, Robin. Just like other jurisdictions, there are regulatory requirements that are required before we can open the doors. And so we expect that we will meet those regulatory requirements and receive the necessary approvals in due course.', 'Robin Margaret Farley', 'But is there anything from a perspective in terms of anything that has to be legalized at any level or separate from just what we have to do to meet licensing?', 'Craig Scott Billings', ""We're not building on spec, put it that way. So I think you've seen -- hopefully, you've seen that they have created a federal regulatory body of the GCGRA in order to license and issue -- license operators and issue regulations associated with gaming. The GCGRA's activities are ongoing, and we are aware of what they are. And we'll get all the necessary approvals in due course."", 'Operator', 'Our next caller is Ben Chaiken with Mizuho.', 'Benjamin Nicolas Chaiken', ""Just one quick one in Macau. At the Wynn Macau property, your mass hold was around 19% for the second quarter in a row after holding below normal for a long period of time. Do you think the current gaming volumes at this property are enough to have more normalized variability in hold, such as what we've seen in the last few quarters? Any color there would be great."", 'Craig Scott Billings', ""Sure. And then we held high subsequent to the end of the quarter. It really is just a function of the normal ebb and flow of the game. A lot of that has to do with the volume of high-end play. And so there's really nothing -- there's really not a lot to see there and, over time, hold will normalize."", 'Julie Mireille Cameron-Doe', ""Operator, we'll take one last question after this one."", 'Operator', 'And that last caller comes from David Katz with Jefferies.', 'David Brian Katz', 'I wanted to just touch on Las Vegas, given the comps are in (inaudible) market given the available resources that you have. I just wonder under what circumstances you might look at developing some of the excess volumes you have in Las Vegas and what would have to happen moving forward?', 'Craig Scott Billings', ""Thanks, David. You were chopping up there a bit, but I think I got the gist of your question. I think you were addressing the development opportunities in the land that we have here. But we do -- we have a very substantial land bank in Las Vegas, as you know. And the reality is that we are replacing choices now from a development perspective. We've got the projects going on in the UAE. By the way, we will have a land bank there as well. We're obviously looking at New York. We are considering Thailand as that process evolves. And so we have a lot of things in the hopper at the moment that are going to meaningfully increase our EBITDAR and our free cash flow base. We are always considering particularly the adjacent land on the strip as a potential development opportunity, but we really want to see how some of these other things play out."", 'David Brian Katz', 'And that was -- the nature of my question is sort of what would have to happen for you to want to move forward on Las Vegas? Would some of these have to fall out or just move forward and this comes right after that. I think that was just a nuance to what I was trying to get at.', 'Craig Scott Billings', ""Sure. Yes. So -- the reality is it's many things. So what happens in the macro economy, what happens to borrowing cost, what happens to the cost to build and then what are our other opportunities, how many of those opportunities can be pushed through our design and development team at any given point in time. So it's a -- I don't know, 5D question, I guess. I don't know if you can get into the fifth dimension. But there's a lot of questions there. And right now, we're focused on New York. We're observing Thailand, and we're in the midst of constructing in the UAE. So we like our development pipeline at the moment. We like our future EBITDAR and free cash flow profile at the moment. So stay tuned."", 'Julie Mireille Cameron-Doe', ""Thank you. And thank you, operator. With that, we'll bring this call to a close. We thank you for your interest in the company and look forward to talking to you again next quarter."", 'Craig Scott Billings', 'Thanks, everybody.', 'Operator', ""And thank you for participating on today's conference call. You may now disconnect.""]"

By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NRG)."", ""Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity."", ' Check out our latest analysis for NRG Energy ', 'The formula for return on equity is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for NRG Energy is:', '50% = US$1.6b ÷ US$3.3b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).', ""The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.50 in profit."", 'One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, NRG Energy has a better ROE than the average (8.9%) in the Electric Utilities industry.', ""That is a good sign. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk. You can see the 4 risks we have identified for NRG Energy by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here."", 'Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.', 'It seems that NRG Energy uses a huge volume of debt to fund the business, since it has an extremely high debt to equity ratio of 3.23. So although the company has an impressive ROE, the company might not have been able to achieve this without the significant use of debt.', 'Return on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.', 'But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider.

There's, obviously, a lot of chatter in the industry right now about some large generators like nukes to go behind the meter. Is this something, I guess, that concerns you as you look at your length in the Eastern markets? So as you go out to the market to match load, are suppliers raising any kind of concerns there? A: (Robert J. Gaudette - EVP of NRG Business) Shar, it's Rob. Like it doesn't raise any concerns for us as far as trying to purchase supply so that we can meet retail obligations. Even if they do go behind the meter, there's plenty of players in the East. It's a very liquid market."", ""Q: Okay. Got it. Perfect. And then maybe just a little longer dated. But as you're kind of highlighting the Texas fleet heavily here, it seems warranted. How would you -- the recent sort of the EPA regs as they stand, impact your generation profile maybe over the next couple of years, right? Is it just additional CapEx? Could we see an acceleration of gas development work beyond the 1.5 gigs that, obviously, Bruce was highlighting of shovel-ready proposals. Just more color on how these items are kind of interacting. A: (Robert J. Gaudette - EVP of NRG Business) Sure. So when you think about the regulations that were promulgated, the first thing I would say, Shar, is that they're all going to be litigated, right? AG, states, ISOs, consumers, everyone has a view and a reason to make sure that these rules get set in place in a way that works for the system and provides reliable and affordable power over time. As far as specifics around us, some of the rules will have to see how they pan out at the end. But what I would tell you is that our decisions to invest around the gas fleet or the 1.5 gig that Bruce talked about earlier, have nothing to do with these regs. It's all about the opportunity that we see in the markets, and we'll continue to drive that way. Does that make sense?"", ""Q: Yes. That was perfect. And then, Larry, it sounds like you're having a really good time on the job right now. So maybe you're not in a rush. But is there anything as far as any updates on the CEO search? Or are you having too much fun? A: (Lawrence Stephen Coben - Interim President, CEO & Chairman of the Board) Well, Shar, I am having a lot of fun. But look, it's a great team, and it's a great company and it's -- look, it's a fantastic job. The committee continues to do its work. I think they're still on the time frame that I talked to you about, but there's no rush. I've told them that, to take their time and that I will continue in this position as long as necessary, until they find the right person that they're happy with to be the next CEO of NRG. But given all the opportunities that we have and everything that we've been talking about on this call, you're right, Shar, I am having fun. And I think you're supposed to have fun."", ""Q: So first, for the last maybe 20 years, you were trying to convince us that you are power price-agnostic. Clearly, not any longer. That's number one. So how do we think about it, this new backdrop, how it impacts your retail business versus wholesale business? Is this additional margin going to be realized by selling this more expensive power to the retail arm? So that's number one. Number two is, so this is gross margin. Is there like an additional O&M layer, we should think about or on maintenance, both on the cost side and CapEx side? Just to get a sense of how big an impact you will have on the EBITDA of the sway in power prices. A: (Lawrence Stephen Coben - Interim President, CEO & Chairman of the Board) And let me have Rob talk a little bit about the CapEx and repair side. And then I'd ask Rasesh to talk a little bit about the margin side ."", ""Q: Just maybe can you help us just frame very high level on the 21 sites that you discussed. How many -- if there's a way to think about how many potential gigawatts that you can add over time? And then also address how quickly you can add the gigawatts. Just the reason being that the demand, like you just said Larry, this is a step change in demand. I'm just thinking about how quick the response can lead to that. A: (Robert J. Gaudette - EVP of NRG Business) Yes. It's a great question, Durgesh, and it's one that we're working on and it's why we've set up this sort of new group to deal with data centers. I don't know the answer yet. I don't -- we're trying to figure that out. We see ginormous potential, but obviously, there's a ton of work to do in terms of -- to figure out exactly how quickly, what's best on this site? Is it better for a data center or a power plant? Is it better for colocation behind the meter, in front of the meter? So we're spending a lot of time working through those. And I think when we have more color on them, we'll certainly provide that to you all, but I'm not sure that will be in the next 2 or 3 months. It will probably be closer to the end of the year. As you know, the power plant development is an awful lot of work."", 'For the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.', 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for your interest in NRG. I'm joined this morning also by Bruce Chung, our Chief Financial Officer. And we also have members of the management team on the call who are available to answer questions. Let's begin with the 3 key messages for today's presentation on Slide 4. First, our business performance exceeded expectations in the first quarter. I'm incredibly pleased with our strong start to the year and in reaffirming our 2024 financial guidance ranges. Second, electrification trends compounded by Gen AI data center growth forecast a signal of transformative rises in power demand. As a result, we expect competitive markets to realize outsized benefits driven by business-friendly environments, available resources and the ability to cite projects quickly. Finally, NRG is well positioned to capitalize on tightened supply and demand in our core markets. Our technology-led consumer platform, our diversified generation portfolio, our leading business energy platform and a real estate site portfolio present a unique opportunity to create significant shareholder value. I'm going to give you visibility into this later in the presentation. Let's move to Slide 5 because I want to share again our value proposition, which may not be familiar to those of you who are new to NRG, and I understand there are several of you on this call. We serve nearly 8 million residential customers and operate the second largest C&I energy and natural gas retail business by volume in the United States. Our company sits at the intersection of energy and technology in the home and the grid. We generate significant excess cash well beyond our current business needs, resulting in the financial flexibility to grow earnings while returning significant capital to our shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. The strength of our business and financial outlook has us uniquely positioned to capitalize on what we believe to the beginning stages of an exceptional time for our industry. It's an exciting time for our company. We remain on track to achieve our 15% to 20% free cash flow before growth per share CAGR target, even as our rising stock price means buying shares at higher prices than projected a year ago. Turning to Slide 6. In recent months, we've received numerous questions about the impacts of the forthcoming power demand growth super cycle on the industry and in NRG in particular. Today, I'd like to talk about what we are seeing. Bruce will then discuss the first quarter results later in the presentation. Starting with macro trends. We're seeing clear signs of a step change in the long-term fundamentals of power demand from multiple catalysts. This marks the departure from an extended period of stagnant power demand during which energy efficiency outpaced usage growth. For the first time in decades, and perhaps in my 40 years in this business, we are experiencing fundamental improvements driven by demand rather than commodity prices. We, along with every other forecasting expert I have read, are now expecting a step change in long-term power demand. This increase in demand is attributed to several factors, including electrification, manufacturing, onshoring, LNG, crypto, greater industrial loads and data center growth. Recent advancements in Gen AI are compounding and accelerating these factors, leading to the formation of the next power demand super cycle. At the same time, the U.S. power supply that is expected to accommodate this growth will increasingly depend on intermittent resources, which highlights a growing and unprecedented imbalance between dispatchable supply and demand. To be clear, it takes only a fraction of what is being forecasted to not just into this super cycle. And this super cycle will require an all-of-the-above supply approach, including retaining existing generation assets, developing new generation, and approaching supply and demand differently through the adoption of technology by shifting large loads, residential VPP and other forms of demand and energy management. This is a transformative opportunity for our sector and for NRG. If you turn to Slide 7, you'll see why competitive markets such as those in which NRG operates are best positioned to realize outsized benefits of this large load growth. It's due to the competitive framework that offers speed-to-market, affordability and resource availability. We see Texas and portions of the Northeast as the most favorable markets. Texas stands out as it is already a preferred destination for large loads including crypto, LNG and manufacturing onshoring, which all have experienced substantial growth in recent years and are exhibiting strong outlooks on the future. Texas benefits from its business-friendly practices, favorable regulatory environment, tax incentives and large land footprint, positioning it as a winner in the era of generative AI and other large load growth. Furthermore, coupled with our ability to cite projects years faster than in regulated markets and its proximity to main fiber channels, I expect Texas to continue to be a leader in load growth. On Slide 8, I'd like to highlight 4 of the many key opportunities for value creation that exists across our platform. To leave no doubt, each of these opportunities represents upside to our June 2023 Investor Day growth plan, and it's not relying on potentially transitory subsidies or inflation reduction act funding. First, we are the only company to have residential energy and smart technologies at scale with nearly 8 million customers. We're a trusted provider and have the unique capability to provide novel energy management through our smart home ecosystem, a capability that will be necessary and increase in value in a tightening market. Second, you may not be aware or fully cognizant of the opportunity that it represents, but we are the second largest business-to-business electricity and largest natural gas provider by volume in North America. Beyond selling customers more of our products, we are a leader in premium services. We offer tailored energy management solutions that focus on optimizing and stabilizing energy costs. We're also able to commercially help our customers achieve their sustainability goals. These customers include many of America's largest industrial players and corporations as well as the hyperscalers. Third, our Texas generation fleet mix is a diverse set of assets that enable us to deliver stable supply costs while maintaining insurance for volatility through higher cost units that are not economical in the current year. These uneconomic units are primarily higher heat rate natural gas assets and in recent low price times may have run for only a few peak hours per year. We primarily use our generation fleet to supply our residential retail portfolio with customer fixed price contracts typically lasting a year or 2. As a result, our generation fleet is mostly open 18 to 24 months out. This creates a significant opportunity to swiftly capitalize on rising power prices and rising demand. As the value of our product increases and equally importantly, units that have historically operated only a few hours annually could now see increasing run times and, of course, profitability. Lastly, our real estate portfolio has several potential development sites for colocation of large loads or power plants. We own 21 sites with 21,000 acres at retired and existing generation facilities that generally have existing or access to grid interconnection. They are in competitive markets and given the extreme focus on project speed, potentially provide another avenue of value creation. Let's try to unpack each of these a bit. Turning to Slide 9. We operate 1 of the leading business-to-business power and natural gas platforms in North America. We serve nearly 100 terawatt hours of electricity and almost 1.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas annually. As demand growth scales, we anticipate increasing electric and natural gas sales volumes. Through our business platform, we help large load customers accomplish their intended goals through tailored plans, including stabilizing their energy costs, delivering specific attributes for their sustainability commitments and optimizing their usage through services such as demand response. At heart, these customers are looking for a partner to help them navigate complicated energy markets while minimizing their risk. We stand ready to provide the services they need as a large market participant with a best-in-class commercial operations platform and a track record of high-quality customer experiences. With respect to data centers. It is still the early days, but we are seeing signs that they are planning to ramp up capacity in the current years. As an anecdotal example, a data center customer approached us about increasing their capacity by 3x at an existing facility in the next 36 months. We are seeing and experiencing demand growth in real time. Moving to Slide 10. Our Texas generation fleet is diverse in technology, age and merit order. We operate 8.5 gigawatts of generation capacity in Texas, supplemented by 1.6 gigawatts of long-term power purchase agreements. We also have 1.5 gigawatts of shovel-ready brownfield projects in development. This strategic diversification across technologies, fuel types and merit orders ensures near-term stability and positions us to capitalize on opportunities from medium- to long-term margin expansion driven by higher power prices. On the right hand of the slide, we provide our Texas generation open growth margin sensitivity to changes in around-the-clock power price scenarios. This sensitivity provides insight into our generation portfolio's earnings power as economic generation increases in value and currently, uneconomic generation becomes not only economic but very profitable. On Slide 11 -- provide a more detailed look at our Texas generation gross margin sensitivity. This analysis focuses on changes in power prices, assuming flat natural gas pricing and normal weather. On the left side of the slide, we have included Texas as around-the-clock and peak pricing forwards for July 2023 and April 2024, which represents the assumed pricing in our 2024 guidance and are compared to today's forward. As you can see, ERCOT forward pricing has moved up significantly. The only explanation for this is that the market is starting to reflect increased power demand from large load growth. Also noteworthy is that the curve is no longer backward dated, suggesting a view and a long-term view of sustained tightness in the Texas power market. Building upon last quarter's additional modeling disclosure. On the right side of the slide, we have provided the necessary components to directionally model the gross margin opportunities for our Texas fleet in a dynamic pricing environment. We begin with the 2024 Texas generation base gross margin and include expected hedge positions of nearly fully hedged in year 1, roughly half in year 2 and less than 25% in year 3 for economic generation, respectively. We have also included an open gross margin scenario, which assumes no hedges. You will observe that our price sensitivity doesn't follow a linear pattern. Units becoming economically viable at different price levels, resulting in disproportionately larger benefits from increases in power prices compared to decreases. With ERCOT forward pricing rising $10 in the outer years on an open gross margin basis, this complies more than $400 million of margin benefit compared to 2024. Assuming we are 25% hedged in the year that, that move occurs, it translates to approximately $350 million of upside compared to 2024, and this is simply the beginning. This sensitivity analysis demonstrates that our portfolio is well positioned to capture significant margin upside in a rising price environment and that the underlying fundamental value of our fleet has materially increased. Supported by our diversified supply strategy, we have the agility and flexibility to leverage these market dynamics and translate them into significant and durable shareholder value. On Slide 12, I want to close by providing details of our site portfolio. Driven by the need for more capacity in the highly valued attributes these sites possess, we are incredibly excited about their potential value. We have 21 sites with 21,000 acres of land within competitive markets that are prime locations for new large loads and power plant development, with colocation opportunities both behind and in front of the meter. These sites offer a mix of valuable and critical access to infrastructure, including transmission, interconnection, water, abundance of land and proximity to long-haul fiber networks. Of particular significance to data centers, these attributes offer expedited construction time lines measured in years of time savings. We have established a dedicated team focused on maximizing the value of our site portfolio. When the analysis is complete later in the year, you can expect to hear more information from us regarding the potential for these sites and what would be required to turn them into new capacity, data center locations or behind the meter projects. With that, let me turn it over to Bruce for the first quarter review."", 'Woo-Sung Chung', ""Thank you, Larry. Turning to Slide 14. Our top decile safety and strong operating performance resulted in first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $849 million, exceeding the first quarter of 2023 by $203 million. This represents a 31% increase in our adjusted EBITDA from the prior year. $150 million of the year-over-year increase was the result of the inclusion of a full quarter's worth of Smart Home EBITDA. The remaining increase was attributable to outperformance in our East and West segments, driven by lower realized supply costs, partially offset by a slight decline in our Texas region due to mild weather. Our consumer energy and smart home platforms increased customer counts year-over-year by 8% and 6%, respectively. Most notably, we added 35,000 customers from the newly opened Lubbock market in Texas, representing a healthy share of the available customer base. This is a testament to the hard work of our consumer energy team over the past 2 years to position NRG and its brands as the electricity provider of choice in Lubbock. Similar to 2023, our Smart Home platform continued to demonstrate strong execution. In addition to growing customer count 6% year-over-year, service margins increased 5% year-over-year, and monthly recurring revenue per subscriber grew 5% over the same period. It is clear that customers recognize the value of our Smart Home services as evidenced by our growth in the face of various macro headwinds affecting the consumer discretionary sector. Our diversified supply strategy continued to deliver, ensuring that we sustain the level of margin expansion we saw in 2023 while also providing the necessary coverage against potential volatility in the winter months. As we discussed in our last earnings call, our fleet performed well in the first quarter, demonstrating a 12% improvement in our in-the-money availability factor winter-over-winter. We have taken advantage of the mild winter in February and March to conduct our maintenance activities more proactively, and we feel confident about fleet performance heading into the critical summer months. Next, I would like to highlight some of what we have focused on as an organization through the first quarter as well as what we continue to remain focused on through the balance of the year. During the quarter, we concluded the $950 million accelerated share repurchase program we launched in November of last year. Through that program, we repurchased nearly 19 million shares at an average price of $50.43 per share, or almost 10% of the shares outstanding, at the time that we launched the ASR. We remain committed to our capital allocation plan, and we are reaffirming our 2024 return of capital amount of approximately $1.2 billion, comprised of our common dividends, which we increased earlier this year and a further $825 million in share repurchases. As Larry discussed, we continue to advance our 1.5 gigawatts of brownfield development in Texas. We will be filing our Notices of Intent for the 3 projects to the Texas Energy Fund in the coming days, and we anticipate filing formal loan applications in early June when they are due. Our brownfield development portfolio comprised of 2 peaking plants and 1 combined cycle project, with CODs ranging from 2026 to 2028 is shovel-ready, and represents some of the most real natural gas-fired development opportunities in the ERCOT market. We have been developing these projects since 2021 and we believe that the advancements we have made on the permitting and equipment procurement fronts should position these projects at the front of the queue for consideration by the PUCT for funding out of the loan program. Next, we continue to remain on track to achieve our $550 million program of growth and efficiency initiatives across our business platforms. As I mentioned earlier, our consumer platforms continue to drive strong stand-alone growth, and we continue to see positive momentum in our ability to generate more margin per customer. A great example of this is the tremendous progress we've made in selling the Vivint protection plan. We started selling this plan shortly after closing the Vivint acquisition. And to date, we have about 15% penetration of the existing Smart Home customer base or over 300,000 active plans, with each plan generating approximately $9 of monthly revenue per customer. Finally, we are reaffirming our 2024 guidance for both EBITDA and free cash flow before growth. We have tremendous momentum in both our consumer and business platforms and the measures we are taking in our diversified supply strategy should set us up well for the balance of the year.Turning to Slide 15 for an updated view of our 2024 capital allocation. As you can see from the slide, there have been no substantial changes since our last earnings call in terms of the quantum of capital allocated to liability management and capital return. As you may recall, we had planned $500 million of debt reduction in our last earnings call as part of the 2024 capital allocation plan. As you can see from the slide, that has changed slightly given our efforts in Q1 to address our outstanding convertible notes. Through April 30, we repurchased $343 million of the outstanding principal of the convertible notes, resulting in $257 million of additional premium paid to retiring noteholders. Given the cash allocated to settle the convertible note premium, that reduced our net debt reduction to $243 million planned for the year. Our strong share price performance over the past year made the convertible notes one of the most expensive pieces of paper in our capital structure. Therefore, we believe that made the most economic sense to pursue a retirement of that instrument before it would get even more expensive as our share price continues to reflect our fair value. Moving a few columns over to the right, you will see that the share repurchase column is $865 million versus the $825 million we showed in our last earnings call. The reason for that is because we now include $40 million of cash allocated to settle tax matters related to our 2023 share repurchases and Employee Stock Compensation Plan. This would include the excise tax on share repurchases instituted as part of the passage of the inflation Reduction Act. Previously, we had bucketed that allocated cash in other categories, but we decided to move those dollars into the share repurchases category in order to more accurately reflect what the cash is being used for. Finally, similar to our last earnings call, we continue to show $41 million of unallocated capital available for allocation in 2024, which we will evaluate the use of as we move along the year. With that, I will turn it back to you, Larry."", 'Lawrence Stephen Coben', ""Thank you very much, Bruce. On Slide 17, I want to provide you a few closing thoughts on our 2024 priorities and expectations. We remain laser focused on execution and on delivering on our financial, operational and safety commitments. We are seeing a step change improvement in fundamentals across all of our platforms. We believe that this will put a spotlight on the scarcity of the critical products and services we sell and the durability of that platform. We are uniquely positioned to deliver significant shareholder value for years to come. Again, we are the only company to combine residential, energy and smart technologies at scale, with nearly 8 million customers and the necessary capabilities to create sustainable value through both tightening and loosening power market conditions. We operate the second largest business-to-business electricity and largest natural gas platform in North America, positioning us as a leader in premium services and tailored energy management solutions. Our integrated supply strategy provides incredible capabilities to stabilize near-term earnings while capturing medium- to long-term margin expansion opportunities from higher power prices. And we own a large Latin portfolio with premium attributes for what is to come in the super cycle of power demand. In my 20 years at the company and over 40 years in power, I have never been more excited about the future of our sector at NRG. The step change in demand should lead also to a change in the depressed valuations for NRG and its peers. These depressed valuations have resulted in double-digit cash flow yields such as ours. This revaluation will be good for NRG and others in our space, and it's very exciting times. I look forward to updating you on our progress along the way. With that, I want to thank you for your time and interest in NRG. We're now ready to open the line for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.', 'Shahriar Pourreza', ""Just Larry, on the curves themselves. There's, obviously, a lot of chatter in the industry right now about some large generators like nukes to go behind the meter. Is this something, I guess, that concerns you as you look at your length in the Eastern markets? So as you go out to the market to match load, are suppliers raising any kind of concerns there?"", 'Robert J. Gaudette', ""Shar, it's Rob. Like it doesn't raise any concerns for us as far as trying to purchase supply so that we can meet retail obligations. Even if they do go behind the meter, there's plenty of players in the East. It's a very liquid market."", 'Shahriar Pourreza', ""Okay. Got it. Perfect. And then maybe just a little longer dated. But as you're kind of highlighting the Texas fleet heavily here, it seems warranted. How would you -- the recent sort of the EPA regs as they stand, impact your generation profile maybe over the next couple of years, right? Is it just additional CapEx? Could we see an acceleration of gas development work beyond the 1.5 gigs that, obviously, Bruce was highlighting of shovel-ready proposals. Just more color on how these items are kind of interacting."", 'Robert J. Gaudette', ""Sure. So when you think about the regulations that were promulgated, the first thing I would say, Shar, is that they're all going to be litigated, right? AG, states, ISOs, consumers, everyone has a view and a reason to make sure that these rules get set in place in a way that works for the system and provides reliable and affordable power over time. As far as specifics around us, some of the rules will have to see how they pan out at the end. But what I would tell you is that our decisions to invest around the gas fleet or the 1.5 gig that Bruce talked about earlier, have nothing to do with these regs. It's all about the opportunity that we see in the markets, and we'll continue to drive that way. Does that make sense?"", 'Shahriar Pourreza', ""Yes. That was perfect. And then, Larry, it sounds like you're having a really good time on the job right now. So maybe you're not in a rush. But is there anything as far as any updates on the CEO search? Or are you having too much fun?"", 'Lawrence Stephen Coben', ""Well, Shar, I am having a lot of fun. But look, it's a great team, and it's a great company and it's -- look, it's a fantastic job. The committee continues to do its work. I think they're still on the time frame that I talked to you about, but there's no rush. I've told them that, to take their time and that I will continue in this position as long as necessary, until they find the right person that they're happy with to be the next CEO of NRG. But given all the opportunities that we have and everything that we've been talking about on this call, you're right, Shar, I am having fun. And I think you're supposed to have fun."", 'Shahriar Pourreza', ""Perfect. Really big congrats to Elizabeth. She's been such a fantastic phase for NRG for some time."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Seaport.', 'Agnieszka Anna Storozynski', ""So first, for the last maybe 20 years, you were trying to convince us that you are power price-agnostic. Clearly, not any longer. That's number one. So how do we think about it, this new backdrop, how it impacts your retail business versus wholesale business? Is this additional margin going to be realized by selling this more expensive power to the retail arm? So that's number one. Number two is, so this is gross margin. Is there like an additional O&M layer, we should think about or on maintenance, both on the cost side and CapEx side? Just to get a sense of how big an impact you will have on the EBITDA of the sway in power prices."", 'Lawrence Stephen Coben', ""And let me have Rob talk a little bit about the CapEx and repair side. And then I'd ask Rasesh to talk a little bit about the margin side ."", 'Robert J. Gaudette', ""Angie, when you think about taking the gross margin expansion that you see on the chart and then trying to translate that across over to EBITDA, I would point out -- so think about it in 2 pieces, right? So on the plants that are the generation that's currently running today, right, the stuff that we've built into our numbers and are running today. When you see a step change in power that has zero impact on OpEx for those megawatts because they're already running. The place where you'll pick up additional OpEx and translate that down to EBITDA is on the stuff that's running more. So we talked to you guys historically about an increase in run times on some assets, given a change in price. It's those additional hours that actually cost you more. And the way that I would translate that down would probably be at the same kind of rate, which is Bruce, correct me if I'm wrong, 80%."", 'Woo-Sung Chung', 'Yes, we would probably see something like an 80% translation to EBITDA and then probably like a 75% translation of the free cash flow.', 'Robert J. Gaudette', 'Does that answer your question?', 'Agnieszka Anna Storozynski', 'Yes.', 'Rasesh Patel', ""And then, Angie, on the retail margins, I mean, I think we've proven our ability to maintain strong retail margins over time. Increasing power prices really affect our competitors as well, and they historically proven to be rational in pricing. And so when you look at quarterly move up of the curve like we're experiencing now, it gives us ample time to pass that through to consumers. And in fact, energy prices have gone up almost 75% caused from 2017 to 2023. We've actually been able to increase margin over that period. And so we feel confident in our ability to do that."", 'Agnieszka Anna Storozynski', ""Okay. And then one other question. So you're talking about the gas-fired new build. I mean I was just doing some -- running some simple math here. Given growing supply of renewable power, right, you probably can't necessarily count on very high capacity factors for these assets, which would suggest that power prices need to be multiples of what we are seeing in the forward curve, in order to justify construction of these new gas plants. So I'm just wondering how you see it. Even in Texas, those peakers and combined cycle gas plant that you're pitching. Even with subsidized loans, it's hard to imagine that these assets would be economic at a $60 around-the-clock or north price."", 'Robert J. Gaudette', ""Angie, it's Rob again. I would tell you that the assets are economic. The way to think about the beauty of peakers, or CCGTs, is that they can flex meaning they can move. And they can capture the value in the hours that matter. We've been trying to transfer our portfolio to something like that for a few years now. And so when you see prices move, right, so as you see the curves go up, particularly in ERCOT, it doesn't mean that every hour goes up by that same amount. It's the very tight hours that go up those exponential amounts that you're talking about. Is that cleared up? So think about the afternoon in Texas in the summer. That is going to go up 5 or 6x versus morning of that same day may have gone up once. And peakers are the things that make money in that [work]."", 'Rasesh Patel', 'Yes. Angie, let me just add that every one of these projects, even on a sort of -- without thinking about lots of rising pricing, without thinking about (inaudible) instruments costs or things, pencils out to be -- they all pencil out to be over our stated hurdle rate. And everything I just mentioned and the things that Rob just mentioned or upside on top of that.', 'Agnieszka Anna Storozynski', ""So but in light of that, I'm sorry, I'm asking (inaudible) line questions. But in light of that, the fact that the new build is materializing at these prices, wouldn't that suggest that there's a cap on the upside to power prices? Because that's usually what it suggests, right, that the new build materializes and that sort of deflates the tightness of power markets."", 'Rasesh Patel', ""Angie, I think if you look at the tightness versus the 1.5 gigawatts, the tightness far exceeds it. And so yes, at some point, of course, if there's enough new build that might exclude the tightness. But if you look at the number of projects that are on the books, not just ours, but everybody's, the time it's going to take to complete those, I don't worry about that tightness being loosened in any significant way for the next several years."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.', 'Steven Isaac Fleishman', ""So just, I guess, following on Angie's first question, I just want to try to reconcile kind of NRG in the old world of low prices for longer versus NRG now in this new world. I don't recall you talking about hedges rolling off and then suddenly being exposed to low power prices. There was the integrated model and the customers kind of side to kind of hedge the low prices. So just how do I -- why wouldn't I still not have to think about some kind of integrated model and maybe the retail margins coming down against the lower, against the higher power prices? Or just how do we reconcile the two?"", 'Lawrence Stephen Coben', ""Steve, I think what it has to do with really is the step change in the market. I mean before we have prices moved and really commodity-driven, those were sort of transitory, and we were managing for the steadiness. I think what you're seeing here is a step change where the flexibility of the integrated model allows us to gear ourselves, in order to take advantage of the higher prices. So the model hasn't changed. It's one of the things -- the reason we never talked about it is we never saw a step change like this. But one of the benefits of the integrated model that we've been pursuing is that it allows us to gear to price increases like this."", 'Steven Isaac Fleishman', ""Got it. Okay. And then on the kind of sites opportunity and also on the new build generation. Could you give us maybe a little bit more color on how you're thinking about funding for those opportunities? And how much might come from NRG versus kind of third-party buying stakes or making the investment? Just maybe some kind of broader overlay how you're thinking about that."", 'Woo-Sung Chung', ""Yes. So Steve, it's Bruce here. First, on the new builds. Obviously, from a funding perspective, we intend to access the Texas Energy Fund. So that's going to be 60% of the capital costs related to the new builds right there. The other 40% of equity, we feel confident that we can fund that from our own cash and cash flow, without impacting any of our capital allocation commitments, in terms of share repurchases and deleveraging. So from our perspective, we feel pretty well capitalized to be able to handle all of that by ourselves. Obviously, as we've always said, to the extent that these projects are getting built and there's a unique opportunity to potentially attract third-party capital at a very attractive proposition, then we would certainly give that some consideration. But right now, as we sit here today, we feel good about our ability to fund those projects on our own. As far as the 21 sites, it's still early days. How it is that, that ultimately translates into what sort of opportunities that results in are still to be discovered. And so don't really have a perspective on any capital need in that regard as we sit here today."", 'Steven Isaac Fleishman', ""Okay. And just last quick one. Obviously, the higher stock price, you mentioned still reaffirming the 15% to 20% growth. So that, I assume means you're expecting a better numerator there in terms of free cash flow to support that? And what is driving that? Is that mainly the higher power prices?"", 'Robert J. Gaudette', 'I always have my opportunity to give you a warmer answer (inaudible) Larry Coben but -- well, the first part of your answer, yes. Look, I mean I think we see, obviously, not only continued execution against our $550 million growth and cost program. But I think as you can see here, based on the sensitivities we provided you, there is going to be -- we do see upside as a result of the forward curve.', 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.', 'Durgesh Chopra', ""Just maybe can you help us just frame very high level on the 21 sites that you discussed. How many -- if there's a way to think about how many potential gigawatts that you can add over time? And then also address how quickly you can add the gigawatts. Just the reason being that the demand, like you just said Larry, this is a step change in demand. I'm just thinking about how quick the response can lead to that."", 'Robert J. Gaudette', ""Yes. It's a great question, Durgesh, and it's one that we're working on and it's why we've set up this sort of new group to deal with data centers. I don't know the answer yet. I don't -- we're trying to figure that out. We see ginormous potential, but obviously, there's a ton of work to do in terms of -- to figure out exactly how quickly, what's best on this site? Is it better for a data center or a power plant? Is it better for colocation behind the meter, in front of the meter? So we're spending a lot of time working through those. And I think when we have more color on them, we'll certainly provide that to you all, but I'm not sure that will be in the next 2 or 3 months. It will probably be closer to the end of the year. As you know, the power plant development is an awful lot of work."", 'Durgesh Chopra', ""That makes sense. I appreciate that, Larry. And then maybe just -- I know this is going to be another tough question, but just can you share your calculus or how you're thinking about buybacks here, given how the stock has kind of gone up in valuation versus investing in these in these opportunities, which obviously, have a tremendous run rate. How do you think about that?"", 'Robert J. Gaudette', ""Let me begin by repeating what Bruce said, which is we are reaffirming our capital allocation that we promised everybody. Obviously, when your stock is trading at a 25% free cash flow yield, it's an easy decision, but we still believe we have enough capital to both do our investing and return capital to our shareholders. And I don't see that changing in the short or medium term. So I think we're going to just continue to be disciplined in terms of returning capital and given -- especially given the rises that we've been talking about here will likely should actually have more capital to invest ourselves. And it won't surprise you to hear that there's an awful lot of people who also now want to co-invest with us in a lot of these kind of projects. So I think the possibilities for doing accretive generation and related projects are there, regardless -- irrespective of our capital allocation principles."", 'Operator', 'Next question comes from David Zimmerman at Morgan Stanley.', 'David Keith Arcaro', 'Dave Arcaro here. Following up on one of the earlier questions. I was wondering, just on the ERCOT market and pricing in the market and the forward curves. Do you have a view from here on where ERCOT prices could go? Is there still room for upside? Do you think in terms of where the forward curve is currently pricing?', 'Robert J. Gaudette', ""David, it's Rob. Yes. The markets can definitely go up. If you look at the large loans that are coming to the state into the system, ERCOT is already beginning to monitor and take a look at it. It's a lot. And you're seeing that price in. There is more upside in the curves from here."", 'David Keith Arcaro', ""Okay. Got it. And does that -- as you're kind of hedging into that, then, is that a view that you're embedding as you start to layer in hedges and firm up some of your out-year EBITDA forecast?"", 'Robert J. Gaudette', ""So when we think about our out-year EBITDA, remember that a big part of our hedging program is through the retail book, right? So as we sell to our 8 million consumers, that ultimately takes a lot of that value and translates it over through the retail revenue rates. We're always looking way out the curve, David. If I thought that something was really high and out of whack, then I would say that we could take something off the table. But we like the position, we like the trend and we like where our portfolio is."", 'David Keith Arcaro', ""Got it. And could you touch on what the competitive dynamics are that you're seeing in the retail energy business right now, in terms of any pressure from new entrants or pricing pressure in the market that might push margin one way or the other right now?"", 'Robert J. Gaudette', ""It's been a very stable performance. As you saw, we had strong performance in terms of customer growth year-over-year. We saw similarly good performance and load growth and our margins. And so we feel very good. I think there are a couple of new entrants in the market, but as we look at our outflow reports, we don't really see any meaningful traction there."", 'Operator', 'The final question comes from Ryan Levine with Citi.', 'Ryan Michael Levine', 'A follow-up on some of the capital -- just a follow up on some of the capital allocation framework. Is there a price where you would reconsider buybacks? Or are you not trying to take any view on the value of the energy security?', 'Lawrence Stephen Coben', ""Brian, there is no price that we would necessarily sit here and tell you is the absolute line at which we would stop buybacks. We're always going to be looking what is implied in the share price with respect to our free cash flow yield, and we'll make the termination from that standpoint. But as we sit here today, we see plenty of room to run for us to continue to be buying back shares."", 'Ryan Michael Levine', ""Okay. And then as you're looking at on investment opportunities related to power generation growth in your service territory. Are you are you focusing -- you mentioned a number of opportunities for new build and partnerships. Do you have a preference for partnerships? Or would you prefer to own the assets out right?"", 'Lawrence Stephen Coben', ""I think for us, it's just a maximization and optimization process. And so I don't think we have a preference, one way or another. It's related to cost of capital, operational flexibility. And at the end of the day, what falls best to our bottom line."", 'Ryan Michael Levine', ""Okay. And given the economic outlook that you suggested was attractive for these new builds, are there any customer commitments or duration of demand that you're looking for the data centers to commit to, to underwrite some of these new builds?"", 'Robert J. Gaudette', ""It's Rob. The answer to that is no. The new builds that we talked about are not set up for data centers or forward to meet that load. The conversations we are in early days with around colocation or use of our sites. Those will be a case-by-case basis as to whether or not it's a long-term deal or not, right, with a data center or other large load. But that's going to come as we evaluate each opportunity. But the things we've talked about thus far are for our book and our portfolio."", 'Ryan Michael Levine', ""And just one last question in terms of retail margin on electricity. The movement in ERCOT forward prices, do you think that will have any impact on the margin that you'll ultimately be able to realize on that part of your business?"", 'Lawrence Stephen Coben', ""Well, we've proven the ability to maintain strong retail margins through various curves. And so we have a very sophisticated analytic engine that gives us insights into the price sensitivity of customers. And when you have sort of these orderly shifts in power prices, we're able to pass them on to consumers over time. So we feel good about our muscle there."", 'Operator', 'This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn it back to Larry Coben, Chairman and Interim President and CEO, for closing remarks.', 'Lawrence Stephen Coben', 'Thank you all very much for joining us. I think you can hear the palpable excitement that we all feel here at n NRG for the potential, and we look forward to continuing to deliver great results and executing on that upside in the days, months and years ahead. Thank you all.', 'Operator', ""Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program.""]"

For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures, please refer to our earnings press release. Now I’ll turn the call over to Donnie.', 'Donnie King: Thanks Sean, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. I’m pleased with our performance in Q2 and I want to thank our team members for their ongoing commitment to driving operational excellence. We’ve certainly come a long way from where we were a year ago and wouldn’t be where we are today without their hard work. Our momentum continues to strengthen and all of our businesses are running better today than they were last year. Our results this quarter are part of a solid performance in the first half of fiscal 2024 compared to the first half of last year. Adjusted EPS and adjusted operating income are both up nearly 60%, while operating cash flow increased by more than 50% and capex decreased by more than 40%.', 'This performance gives us confidence in our improved outlook for the fiscal year and in our long term future. As you saw in our results, tailwinds in chicken again offset headwinds in beef as we benefit from our multi-protein portfolio. While we are not immune to the macro environment, we are taking steps to reduce our exposure to commodity markets. We are expanding our offerings in seasoned and marinated meats to value up our portfolio across beef, pork and chicken to provide consumers convenience and new flavor options. Across our brands, we are focusing on meeting the consumers where they are by offering convenient restaurant-quality food options at home. We are a leader in protein with some of the most iconic brands in food with offerings that span the value spectrum.', 'This is why our share remains healthy despite a more challenging environment for consumers. We continue to support our brands through efficient marketing, effective innovation and strong partnerships with our customers. We continue to build financial strength by being disciplined in our capital deployment to improve cash flow and position us well to tackle challenges and capture opportunities. We also continue to take bold actions to improve performance and drive long term value for shareholders, and I remain highly confident in our strategy and optimistic about our future. Now let’s delve into an update on market share. At Tyson Foods, we have a broad portfolio of offerings across food service and retail at a range of price points to meet consumers where they are, even as they manage through a challenging macro environment.', 'We also have some of the strongest and most iconic brands across food and beverage behind the Tyson, Jimmy Dean, and Hillshire Farm names, which allows us to make efficient choices to maintain margin while strengthening our shelf position. We see this in the strength of our dollar share in our core business lines, which we believe reflects the quality of our share position. Since Q2 of fiscal 2019, we’ve added 400 basis points of dollar share in our core business lines. While our share is down modestly versus last year as we lapped some record performance, we have gained dollar share over each of the past three quarters. Our core bacon brands, Wright and Jimmy Dean have contributed to this recent growth; in fact, our dollar share in bacon for Q2 was at a record high level over the past five years, and we were the fastest growing in the category during the quarter.', 'I’m excited about our opportunities in bacon and expect our share to continue improving as our new bacon facility that opened in January ramps up. The value proposition of our iconic brands resonates strongly with our consumers, and our market share and household penetration rates remain healthy. We continue to have opportunity to expand the household penetration of our great brands, leaving room for continued share growth over the long run. Moving onto the segment performance, starting with prepared foods, consumers’ focus on value continues to impact our retail volumes; however, our share remains healthy and, as I mentioned, we are gaining dollar share in bacon. Our volumes outside of retail continue gaining traction as we strive to grow this business with a focus on customer diversification in margin accretive channels.', 'Operational efficiencies and lower raw material costs drove solid profitability, both in Q2 and the first half of fiscal ’24. In chicken, the momentum established in the second half of fiscal ’23 continued in Q2; in fact, versus the second quarter of last year, AOI increased more than $325 million. While we are benefiting from better market conditions, including lower grain costs, our bold actions and focus on the fundamentals are also evident in our results. We have made progress across the value chain. Our live operations are substantially better. We’ve improved yield, labor efficiencies and utilization in our plants. Our demand planning and customer service have also taken significant steps forward. When our live operations are running well and our demand plan is more accurate, we can operate more efficiently and better service our customers.', 'In summary, our focus on getting back to the basics in chicken is working. As you all know, in beef, limited cattle supplies led to spread compression. Despite some quarterly volatility reflecting market conditions, our results for the first half of the fiscal year have come in as we expected. Our goal remains to offset some of the challenges of a tight cattle supply environment by focusing on the controllables, such as labor utilization and managing mix to meet customer and consumer demand. Turning to pork, better spreads and ongoing operational execution led to improved profitability in the quarter and the first half of the year. As you may have seen, we made the difficult decision to close one of our pork facilities. This is part of our efforts to optimize our footprint and improve performance by reallocating resources to nearby, more efficient plants while improving mix and better serving our customers.', 'Now let me take a step back and talk about our recent corporate rebranding initiative. We launched a new corporate logo earlier this year that captures our One Team, One Tyson spirit. It encompasses our differentiated capabilities and scale and our diverse portfolio across channels, categories and eating occasions. Our Tyson Foods corporate logo represents our company’s legacy and our team’s purpose, which is to feed the world like family. Our approach to driving long term value hasn’t changed and is built on a core of three key pillars. First, we are fortifying our foundation of core proteins. We strive to be best-in-class operators while continuing to look for ways to value-up our portfolio. Second, we are building our brands by delivering innovation for new occasions, categories and channels to better serve consumers.', 'Today, we have three of the top 10 protein brands, with room to expand our household penetration. Brands are our best opportunity to drive faster growth, higher margins, and stronger returns. Third, we are growing globally. Our international business grew revenue eightfold to $2.5 billion over the five years through fiscal ’23. We expect to drive profitable growth over time by capturing expanding consumer markets, particularly in Asia, and we believe we are well positioned to win. These strategic pillars are supported by key enablers of operational excellence, customer and consumer obsession, along with data and digital. A key element of operational excellence is to gain enterprise scale and unlock savings in our controllables by modernizing our operations and driving performance to standards.', 'We win with our customers by building long term partnerships and delivering top tier experiences. We enrich consumers’ lives by creating best-in-class marketing and innovation. Finally, we continue to build our digital capabilities utilizing data, automation and AI tech for better decision-making and outcomes. Before I hand it over to John to review our financial performance, let me remind you of our priorities this year, where we focused on controlling the controllables. Our results for the first half of the year currently show that we are controlling our capex and working capital to drive strong cash flow. Another priority is to optimize our footprint and network. We closed the last of the six chicken facilities that we announced in 2023 along with the two case-ready beef facilities, and as mentioned earlier, we are closing one of our pork plants.', 'We are also focused on operational excellence by restoring performance in chicken, strengthening prepared foods, managing beef through a difficult cattle cycle, and driving efficiencies in pork. As you have seen in our results so far this year, we are making tangible progress in all these areas. With that, I’ll turn the call over to John.', 'John Tyson: Thanks Donnie. I’ll start with an overview of our total company results before moving onto our individual segments. Sales in Q2 were essentially in line year-over-year at $13.1 billion as the decrease in chicken was nearly offset by an increase in beef. Adjusted operating income increased $341 million year-over-year to $406 million, driven primarily by significant improvement in chicken profitability. Operational performance and substantially higher AOI led to a 66% increase in adjusted EPS, which came in at $0.62 in Q2. Now let’s review our segment results, starting with prepared foods. In prepared foods, Q2 revenue was down slightly year-over-year. Volume growth was led by benefits from the Williams acquisition.', 'The pricing decline reflects the mix impact of the lower contribution from retail. AOI in Q2 was down modestly versus last year. Lower raw material costs and operational efficiencies were more than offset by start-up costs and mix. Despite the decline in AOI, our margin for the first half of the fiscal year remained in the low double digits. Moving to chicken, sales in Q2 declined 8.2% year-over-year, primarily due to lower volume. Volume declined 6.1%, driven by lower production as we better aligned our supply to customer demand, while the 2.1% reduction in pricing was due in part to the pass-through of lower input costs. Despite the decline in sales, AOI increased $326 million year-over-year to $160 million. The benefits of our strategic actions and the substantial operational improvements we’ve executed since last year are clear.', 'Market conditions, including lower input costs net of pass-through pricing and a better supply-demand balance, were also key contributors to improved profitability. The current quarter results include a $55 million derivative loss compared to a $35 million loss in the year-ago quarter. As a reminder, our grain hedging program is part of an overarching risk management strategy and not a speculative tool. In our beef segment, revenue was up 7.3% year-over-year in Q2, with both volume and pricing increasing. The 2.8% increase in volume was primarily driven by higher average carcass weight, while pricing increased 4.5%. While revenue increased, AOI decreased versus last year, primarily reflecting compressed spreads, as expected. This more than offset continued progress on our operational efficiencies, including better labor utilization and better management of product mix to meet customer and consumer demand.', 'Moving to pork, Q2 revenue increased 4.6%, driven by volume growth and higher pricing. Volume growth of 2.9% was led by a more plentiful hog supply. Pricing improved due to healthy global demand. AOI also increased year-over-year, going from a loss of $31 million last year to a profit of $33 million this year in Q2, benefiting primarily from improved spreads and better operational execution. Year to date, pork AOI has improved $151 million. Finally, our international business continues to make progress towards stronger profitability. AOI increased versus last year as we begin to lap some of the start-up costs of our newer facilities and continue to focus on operational execution. Shifting to our financial position and capital allocation, year-to-date showcased strong operating cash flow of approximately $1.2 billion as we continued to manage working capital.', 'We remain very disciplined with capex, which came in at $621 million for the first half. The $267 million in capex for Q2 was the lowest quarterly spend in several years and represents the fifth quarter in a row of sequential decline as we lap our elevated capex from the previous two fiscal years and focus on controlling where and when we deploy capital. Year to date, free cash flow of $556 million increased nearly $900 million versus the first half of last year and was more than $200 million ahead of our year-to-date dividend payments. Our balance sheet management approach remains unchanged as we are committed to building financial strength, investing in our business, and returning cash to shareholders while maintaining our investment-grade credit rating and returning net leverage to at or below two times net debt to EBITDA.', 'Our net leverage again declined sequentially, coming in at 3.6 times in Q2, driven by improving last 12-months EBITDA, and we expect it to continue to improve for the balance of the year. We ended Q2 with $4.4 billion of liquidity. As you may have seen from our press release in March, we successfully raised $1.5 billion in new senior notes and we paid down a portion of our term loans. We plan to use the remaining proceeds to retire our outstanding notes coming due this August. We remain committed to maintaining a disciplined yet opportunistic capital allocation strategy, ensuring that we deploy resources to maximize long term shareholder value. Now let’s take a look at our updated outlook for fiscal 2024. We are reiterating our overall sales guidance to be roughly flat year-over-year; however, given our strong year-to-date results, we are raising our AOI guidance, driven primarily by an improved outlook for chicken.', 'For the total company, we now expect between $1.4 billion and $1.8 billion of operating income. Moving to the segments, in chicken, given the strong start in the first half of the year, we continue to believe that there are more tailwinds than headwinds. We are raising our AOI guidance range to be between $700 million and $900 million. Prepared foods also had a solid first half. In this segment, we are tightening our AOI outlook to be between $850 million and $950 million, indicating a weaker second half of the year which reflects typical seasonality. In beef, the first half of fiscal 2024 has progressed in line with our expectations; however, uncertainties remain, including the progression of the cattle cycle, and we now expect our full year AOI to be between a loss of $400 million and a loss of $100 million.', 'In pork, we’ve seen solid first half performance and are raising our guidance to be between $50 million and $150 million. To add some color to the shape of the rest of the year, uncertainties remain around consumer strength and behavior, the progression of the cattle cycle, and key commodity costs. When we factor in these variables with pork and prepared foods’ seasonality, there are reasons to believe that Q3 could be weaker than Q4. To round out the key P&L items, we anticipate interest expense to be roughly $400 million and our tax rate to now be approximately 24%. Turning to capex, we’re maintaining tight controls on spending in line with profitability and cash flow, and we are narrowing our capex range to be between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion this year.', 'Finally on free cash flow, we’re committed to managing working capital and capex and we’re even more confident now that we can fully fund our dividend this year through our free cash flow generation. Now I’ll turn the call back over to Donnie to wrap up before we move to Q&A.', 'Donnie King: Thanks John. Before we get to your questions, I’d like to thank our 139,000 team members who work tirelessly to feed the world like family and fulfill our mission to bring high quality food to every table in the world. It is the strength of our team that secures our position as a world-class food company and a recognized leader in protein. Together, we delivered a solid first half. We still have more work to do and believe we have the strategy in place to continue our progress and deliver long term shareholder value. Now I’ll turn the call back over to Sean for Q&A instructions.', 'Sean Cornett: Thanks Donnie. We will now move to your questions.

It is also displaying an appetite for sustainable eco-luxury and meaningful cultural experiences. Mastercard’s ‘Affluent Travel: A Middle East Perspective’ report reveals an appetite for new experiences in unexplored destinations. The global luxury travel market is expected to grow by 7.9% (CAGR) between 2024 and 2030. Mastercard reports that high-net-worth travellers contribute approximately 36% of the global spend on travel.', '“At Mastercard, we are committed to connecting people to their passion for travel. This report gives a great snapshot of how high-net-worth individuals choose to travel. It’s wonderful to see sustainability, cultural immersion and purpose as key considerations, along with quality accommodation, seamless technology and loyalty benefits. We will continue to harness the power of partnerships with leading industry players to come up with innovative solutions that unlock access to a whole new world of unparalleled travel experiences,” said Amnah Ajmal, Executive Vice President, Market Development EEMEA, Mastercard.', 'Over a third (36%) of luxury travellers say they want to experience different cultures. The combination of business and leisure, or ‘bleisure’, is also resulting in more remote-work trips as digital nomads change the face of travel. Affluent travellers are almost twice as likely as the global average to have taken a vacation as an extension to a business trip. Furthermore, Marriott Bonvoy research also showed that solo travel is being embraced, with 70% of respondents in the UAE and 69% in Saudi Arabia saying they’ve travelled solo.', 'Affluent consumers are keen adopters of the conscious travel trend and place a premium on the authenticity of eco-luxury experiences.

This compares to five of 10 among 18–34-year-old affluents.', 'The report notes that this market segment places more emphasis on experiences than on physical goods. More than half of affluent travellers, compared to 43% of the global total, prioritise meaningful travel experiences over shopping and souvenirs.', 'Luxury travellers are prioritising unique personalised experiences over location. However, they also want their money’s worth in the form of exemplary customer service and pampering.', 'Based on average spend per card by origin market, GCC travellers are among the highest spenders.

If you want to skip our overview of O'Leary's investment philosophy and learn about some more companies in his stock portfolio, go directly to Kevin O'Leary’s Stock Portfolio: 5 Stock Picks for 2024."", 'Kevin O\'Leary, affectionately known as Mr. Wonderful to fans and fellow venture capitalists, is renowned as one of the venture capitalists on ""Shark Tank"" and a commentator on economic news. The Irish-Canadian kickstarted his business journey by establishing the educational software company Softkey in 1986 by leveraging the proceeds from the sale of his SET share and a $10,000 investment from his mother. This venture eventually propelled him to the forefront of the business world. Softkey specialized in producing and distributing educational software in CD format, expanding its market presence through a series of mergers and acquisitions in the early 1990s. Notable acquisitions included WordStar, Spinnaker Software, and The Learning Company, the latter of which Softkey adopted as its name following the acquisition.', ""In terms of investing in securities, O'Leary, Chairman of O’Shares Investment Advisors, advocates for including high-quality businesses with strong balance sheets and robust financial performance in investment portfolios. Additionally, he stresses the importance of diversification across various market sectors, with dividend payments from the companies under consideration deemed as perhaps the most vital factor. To that end, O’Shares Investment Advisors' ETF, ALPS O'Shares U.S. Quality Dividend ETF (BATS:OUSA), holds stocks embodying a blend of these three attributes. The ETF has delivered growth rates of 11.55% over the past year, 38.69% over the last five years, and an impressive 86.92% since its inception. Some notable names held by the ETF include the likes of Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)."", 'The venture capitalist recently outlined his investment approach on LinkedIn, stressing the significance of cash-flow-positive investments within a diversified portfolio. Here is what he said:', '“A couple of years back, I sold my ETF company to Alps, the biggest ETF player in the States. It’s called O’Shares, and that’s where my family’s wealth is parked. OUSA is part of the S&P 500, cherry-picking the highest quality balance sheets with positive cash flow from around 100 out of the 500 names. Then there’s OUSM, which grabs the Russell 2000 and weeds out the underperformers – those companies not making any real dough. Forget Shark Tank, forget Bitcoin. Sure, I’ve got a 5% stake in Bitcoin and another 5% in gold, but the meat of my US portfolio? It’s in OUSA or OUSM.”', 'Speaking further on this, Kevin O’Leary, during his appearance on \'Good Morning America,\' used some of his time to unveil a number of good stock picks for first-time investors, with The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) being one of his recommendations. While investors widely regard the home improvement retailer as a dependable choice, O’Leary is particularly fond of it due to its substantial size, robust balance sheet, and consistent dividends. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is also among O\'Leary\'s top picks, and he holds a strong affinity for the company. ""I love it,"" he said, highlighting the company\'s diversified product portfolio ranging from COVID-19 vaccines to Tylenol.', ""On the other hand, despite his reservations regarding Bitcoin ETFs, O'Leary acknowledges their regulatory approval as a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency industry. He believes that only a select few, particularly those backed by major industry players like Fidelity and BlackRock Inc., will thrive. O'Leary sees this as a step towards broader acceptance of digital payment systems, such as the USDC stablecoin. While exercising caution with Bitcoin ETFs, Mr. Wonderful remains optimistic about Bitcoin's future value, estimating it could reach between $150,000 and $250,000 by 2030. However, he disagrees with Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood's more ambitious prediction of Bitcoin hitting $1.5 million by 2030, unless there is an economic catastrophe, arguing that such a rapid surge in Bitcoin's value would imply a significant downturn in the US economy."", 'The ""Shark Tank"" star also expressed concerns about the current state of the commercial real estate market, suggesting that it is on the verge of collapse. He believes that this downturn will have far-reaching consequences, particularly for investors and small business owners. O\'Leary emphasized that the current situation is unprecedented, as the commercial real estate market is not anticipated to fully recover to pre-pandemic levels. Speaking to FOXBusiness,\xa0the venture capitalist made the following comments on office spaces:', '“Most of these buildings were built over the last 30 years and [have mortgages with] interest rates of less than 4%,” he said. “Now the Fed has raised rates to 5.5% terminal rate, which means these mortgages are going to be refinanced at 9% to 11% — so a 3x cost. So many of these buildings won’t be economically viable.”', 'Helga Esteb/Shutterstock.com', 'Our Methodology', ""In this article, we'll explore Kevin O'Leary's top 10 stock picks for 2024, which reflect his investment philosophy and offer insights into asset management. O'Leary typically favors equities of well-established, financially stable companies with strong balance sheets and a history of consistent dividend growth. The following holdings were selected from the ALPS O'Shares U.S. Quality Dividend ETF (BATS:OUSA). For these stocks, we have also provided hedge fund sentiment.

Continuing trends from Q4 2023, the period witnessed the sustained growth of artificial intelligence and technology stocks, with investors remaining optimistic about AI's potential across consumer and business applications, alongside expectations of multiple interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve throughout the year. However, as we move into the second quarter of the year, investor sentiment has shifted from anticipating a strong economic environment to reassessing strategies for allocating significant funds into the stock market."", ""In April, U.S. job growth decelerated more than anticipated, with the annual wage increase dipping below 4.0% for the first time in nearly three years, according to the Labor Department's latest employment report released on April 3.

Nonfarm payrolls expanded by 175,000 jobs last month, marking the lowest increase in six months, with revisions revealing 22,000 fewer jobs created in February and March than initially reported. Despite these figures, the jobless rate persisted below 4% for the 27th consecutive month."", 'The signs of a cooling labor market sparked optimism that the U.S. central bank could orchestrate a ""soft landing"" for the economy, dispelling concerns of stagflation, which had been fueled by reports of subdued economic growth and elevated inflation in the first quarter.

Most reports this year have indicated an annual inflation rate of around 3%, with the Fed's preferred measure, the core personal consumption expenditures price (PCE) index, recently standing at 2.8%. Rising prices have led to upward pressure on wages, contributing to an inflationary environment that has prevented the Fed from taking aggressive steps to cut interest rates, despite market expectations suggesting otherwise."", ""If you're a beginner in the world of investments and finance, diving right in can seem daunting with everything mentioned above. However, there are strategies to simplify the process and increase your chances of success. One approach is to focus on established, well-known companies with strong financial foundations.

That's because many companies in the sector weren't profitable in their early stages, and needed to save coin to maintain their businesses. The ones that became successful often stuck to that policy, choosing to prioritize activities like research and development. The hope was that investors would be satisfied simply with a rising stock price."", ""That's no longer the norm as the top tech companies on the scene are well-established, habitually profit-making, and frequently able to generate big piles of cash. Two incumbents that have declared dividend increases based on this solid foundation are International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM). Let's take a brief look at both."", ""IBM was a tech company before tech companies existed to any meaningful degree. Its origins stretch back to 1911 as a business selling recordkeeping and tabulation equipment for corporate clients. Very soon after that, it began paying a regular quarterly dividend, and it hasn't let up since."", ""These days it declares consistent, if incremental, dividend raises once annually. The 2024 version was a bump of $0.01 per share, as in previous years. IBM's new quarterly distribution is $1.67 per share."", ""Any business that has navigated all sorts of economies and emerged from more than one world war has done so by being flexible. Over the years, IBM's business has morphed -- it's been a leading manufacturer of personal computers, later it became a major player in the IT consultancy space, and these days it's concentrating on its hybrid cloud computing offerings and making a concentrated push into artificial intelligence (AI)."", ""It's sensible to operate in these high-demand segments, and IBM as a company and a stock has generally been doing well. Yes, investors traded out of the shares following the company's latest quarterly earnings report, but that felt like a case of inflated expectations. The stock had zoomed nearly 50% higher over the past year, after all. IBM's revenue rose, if not spectacularly, while management did a fine job of lifting the bottom line."", ""I can see more future improvements in the fundamentals, especially in AI, where the company's consulting contracts are already worth over $1 billion. IBM is positioning itself to be a major force in this technology, and history shows it's usually successful when it marshals its considerable resources to attack a market."", ""IBM's dividend raise will take effect with the first $1.67-per-share payout, which is set to be distributed on June 10 to investors of record as of May 10. At the most recent closing share price, it would yield a relatively generous 4%."", ""Qualcomm doesn't have the long history of IBM, but it's been a reliably regular quarterly dividend payer for more than 20 years. It matches IBM in its habit of declaring dividend raises every year, the latest being a 6% increase to $0.85 per share."", ""Qualcomm's main stock in trade is chipsets for smartphones. Given the company's very strong presence in this space, it's likely you've got its components packed into your beloved iPhone or Galaxy as we speak. Qualcomm is also active in the next-generation automotive market and the Internet of Things (IoT) sphere. Finally, it earns money from licensing its numerous patents."", ""Of these, it's the smartphone market that's the largest and sturdiest, and automotive that's growing the fastest. The company's just-released fiscal second-quarter results show 1% year-over-year growth in the phone segment to almost $6.2 billion. IoT, alas, isn't doing so hot; its top line slumped by 11% to $1.2 billion. Thankfully, licensing landed in positive territory with a 2% rise to $1.3 billion."", ""The automotive segment, on the other hand, really was quite the race car as far as revenue was concerned. Thanks to the success of its Snapdragon Ride assisted driving platform, the segment's take grew a powerful 35% to $603 million. Yes, that's a small portion of total company revenue now, but automobiles are rapidly becoming more sophisticated, and reliable tech is sorely needed for smartening them up."", 'So in short, Qualcomm is still managing to squeeze out growth from its two traditional business lines. And despite that flagging IoT business, automotive is hot and sure to get hotter. This is a well-established company with good technology that should become an important player in that dynamic sector. The future continues to look bright for Qualcomm.', ""The company's new dividend is to be handed out on June 20 to stockholders of record as of May 30.

The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?"", ""Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision."", 'Revisions to Earnings Estimates', ""Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements."", 'For the current quarter, Qualcomm is expected to post earnings of $2.22 per share, indicating a change of +18.7% from the year-ago quarter.

You can skip our detailed analysis on defense spending patters in the continent and head over directly to the 5 Weakest Militaries in Africa.', 'Global military spending increased 6.8% from 2022 – the steepest rise since 2009 – to reach a record-high of $2.44 trillion in 2023, according to latest figures released by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). This is the ninth successive year of growth in defense expenditure, with spending increasing across all regions of the world.', 'The United States continued to remain the largest military spender in the world, having spent a whopping $916 billion on defense in 2023, representing 37% of the world’s total defense expenditure. China, Russia, India, and Saudi Arabia retained their positions in the top five, while Ukraine climbed from 11th spot in 2022 to become the eighth largest spender on defense, having spent $64.8 billion in 2023. Combined, the top ten countries accounted for 74% of the world’s total defense expenditure during the year.', 'In Africa, the military spending totaled $51.6 billion in 2023, which was 22% higher than in 2022, and represented 2.1% of the global defense expenditure. Of this, $28.5 billion was spent in North Africa, with Algeria and Morocco together accounting for 82% of the military spending in the region. This spike was driven by Algiers’ defense bills soaring 76% compared to 2022 to reach $18.3 billion, made possible by an increase in demand for Algerian gas exports amid sanctions against Russia. On the other hand, $23.1 billion was incurred on defense by states in Sub-Saharan Africa, with 20% of the amount attributed to Nigeria. As is evident from these numbers, while defense spending continues to rise each year, the increase is not even. Neither across continents, nor within.', 'Russia is Africa’s largest arms trade partner, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, with the country’s exports to the continent increasing 23% between 2016 and 2020, compared to 2011 and 2015. This is seen by analysts as a strategic move by Moscow to facilitate trade and soft power in Africa, which would enable Russia to build a presence at NATO’s southern flank. That being said, sanctions against Moscow in recent years have created an opening for Chinese armament manufacturers as well, with the Asian giant exporting over $2 billion worth of military supplies to Sub-Saharan Africa between 2010 and 2021. Arms sales of the United States to the subregion during this period were estimated to be $473 million, according to the Atlantic Council.', ""The situation is strikingly different in North Africa, where American defense companies play a much more active role, driven by the decades-long arms race between Algeria and Morocco, coupled with President Sisi's quest for Egypt to become a major regional power. Washington in April last year, approved the potential sale of HIMARS and related equipment to Rabat under a $524 million deal, with Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LHX), and RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) being among the major contractors of the deal. The Pentagon also approved selling Joint Stand Off Weapons to Morocco for a cost of $250 million, with RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) being the primary contractor of the project."", 'On the other hand, Cairo has also been looking to upgrade its defense systems with advanced American air radars. In January 2022, the US approved the sale of three L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LHX) SPS-48 land-based radars for $355 million to Egypt, which would offer the African nation jamming capabilities and help it detect even extremely small targets. A year prior to this in February 2021, it was reported that Egypt also received the Rolling Airframe Missiles manufactured by RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) under a $197 million agreement.', 'Moreover, elsewhere in the African continent, the United States has actively begun donating military equipment to several countries in the region to aid them in combating terrorism and crime. In 2014, the United States gave away two Cessna 208 Caravan aircraft to Mauritania to help the country in its fight against maritime time and terrorist groups. Both the aircraft were manufactured by Cessna, owned by Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT), and were valued at $21 million each at the time.', 'More recently in 2021, the American government donated a Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) C-130 aircraft to Niger to use in operations related to humanitarian assistance and mobility of UN peacekeeping missions. The C-130 is one of the top-selling tactical aircraft in the world, and has been continuously manufactured by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) since its first flight in 1954.', 'Last year, the United States announced an $80 million grant to donate four Bell 412EP helicopters built by Bell Helicopters, a subsidiary of Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT), to the Zambian Air Force. Under the grant, the US was also to provide three years of service and training for the helicopter. The Zambian government thanked Washington for the donation, and stated that the helicopters would assist the country in enhancing regional security, and in supporting UN peacekeeping missions in the continent.', 'Also see 15 Most Powerful Militaries in Africa.', 'Several weighted metrics have been considered to rank the weakest militaries in Africa. These include capabilities of ground forces (40%) determined by manpower, tanks, and armored fighting vehicles; naval and aerial strength (30%), and economic potential and defense spending (30%). Weighted scores for each metric were aggregated to get an overall weighted score.

This series of events is likely to further weaken Gabon’s military, which is already one of the weakest militaries in Africa, with an active manpower of only 6,500 troops.

Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase WEC Energy Group's shares before the 13th of May to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 1st of June."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.835 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$3.34 to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that WEC Energy Group has a trailing yield of 4.0% on the current share price of US$83.83. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. As a result, readers should always check whether WEC Energy Group has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut."", ' View our latest analysis for WEC Energy Group ', ""Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. WEC Energy Group paid out 69% of its earnings to investors last year, a normal payout level for most businesses. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Over the past year it paid out 155% of its free cash flow as dividends, which is uncomfortably high. We're curious about why the company paid out more cash than it generated last year, since this can be one of the early signs that a dividend may be unsustainable."", ""While WEC Energy Group's dividends were covered by the company's reported profits, cash is somewhat more important, so it's not great to see that the company didn't generate enough cash to pay its dividend. Cash is king, as they say, and were WEC Energy Group to repeatedly pay dividends that aren't well covered by cashflow, we would consider this a warning sign."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. This is why it's a relief to see WEC Energy Group earnings per share are up 6.4% per annum over the last five years. Earnings have been growing at a steady rate, but we're concerned dividend payments consumed most of the company's cash flow over the past year."", ""The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. WEC Energy Group has delivered an average of 8.1% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders."", ""Should investors buy WEC Energy Group for the upcoming dividend?

The company recently spun off its consumer business as Kenvue and is now a two-headed monster of pharmaceuticals and medical technology."", ""Following the spin-off, the goal is to lean more heavily into these two higher-growth business units, which could mean more earnings growth for shareholders. The spin-off produced an infusion of cash for Johnson & Johnson, which has been put to work, acquiring Shockwave Medical for $13.1 billion and Ambrx Biopharma for another $2 billion. The company's financials are among the best on Wall Street, and it is one of two public companies with an AAA credit rating, something not even the U.S. government can boast."", ""Additionally, Johnson & Johnson's dividend is as strong as ever. The stock yields a solid 3.3% at today's share price and has grown by an average of nearly 6% annually over the past five years. The dividend payout ratio is manageable at just 64% of cash flow, meaning you can trust the dividends to keep coming well into the future."", ""As a mature healthcare conglomerate, Johnson & Johnson won't blow you away with growth. Getting the stock at a solid price is essential. Shares are near 52-week lows and trade at 14 times earnings, a discount to the broader market, making now a solid time to consider adding shares."", ""Abbott Labs has been in the healthcare business for over a century. Its ability to evolve its business over time is a big reason why the stock has been such a stellar long-term investment. Today's version of Abbott Labs focuses on some key growth areas. It sells nutrition products, including shakes and baby formulas. It also works in diagnostics and medical devices, specifically specializing in treatments for cardiovascular health and diabetes. The company also manufactures generic drugs for international markets."", ""This diverse business footprint has helped Abbott Labs grow its shareholder dividend. Abbott Labs is a Dividend King, a company with over 50 consecutive years of dividend growth. The dividend doesn't yield a ton today, just 2.1%. However, it has grown by an average of 6.5% annually over the past five years, and the payout ratio is solid at 70%."", ""Notably, the company has a strong growth outlook. Analysts expect earnings growth averaging 9% annually over the next three to five years, carving out the potential for future dividend increases while potentially lowering the payout ratio in the process. Heart disease and diabetes are some of the most prevalent chronic conditions facing society, and it's a wise place for Abbott Labs to have set up shop. The company is a leader in pacemakers and prick-free glucose monitoring devices."", 'Pfizer has been an odd stock to follow for the past several years.

Typically, high yields like this are a red flag, a sign the market doesn't believe it can afford the payout.

The family had shelves stocked with Neutrogena products. But the 20-year-old wanted the brand she saw on TikTok, said the employee who has since left the company.', 'Most Read from Bloomberg', 'Americans Are Racking Up ‘Phantom Debt’ That Wall Street Can’t Track', 'Stormy Daniels Will Return to Court in Test of Trump’s Demeanor', 'Trump Judge Indefinitely Postpones Documents Case Trial', 'US Pauses Arms Shipment to Israel on Rafah Invasion Concerns', 'Kenvue Inc., which owns Neutrogena and Aveeno, has seen its skin-care market share plummet to less than 14% in 2023 from 23% in 2019 — when it was the biggest in the US, according to retail data from researcher Circana.', 'Neutrogena is missing out on what is now a $42 billion US beauty market because it retreated precisely when rivals went all in. What had once been a nimble, innovative company, became slow-moving and cautious, according to four former employees who weren’t authorized to speak publicly on the matter.', 'Faced with pandemic-induced ingredient shortages, the brand focused on getting core items on shelves and discontinued some customers’ favorite creams and cleansers. Neutrogena pulled back on advertising and innovation, a person familiar with the business said. As customers flocked to TikTok to discuss all things skin care related, the brand was slow to follow them.', 'Kenvue attributes much of Neutrogena’s troubles to fallout from the pandemic. The company adjusted its strategies to address changes in consumer behavior and navigate supply chain constraints, a spokesperson for the company said in an email. The spokesperson added that investment in marketing was consistent through the pandemic and that Neutrogena has introduced more than 100 new products in the last five years.', '“I forget about them, I have to admit. They’re not top of mind,” said Patricia Oyetakin, a dermatologist based near Atlanta. Nine times out of 10, she says, her patients reach for CeraVe or La Roche-Posay. “What makes [Neutrogena] different? They’re a good brand, but I’m not sure why.” Neutrogena lost the title of dermatologists’ No. 1 recommended skin care brand in late 2021; L’Oreal SA’s CeraVe quickly stepped in to take it.', 'A turnaround plan announced last year that looks a lot like what competitors have put in place years ago hasn’t yielded any concrete results. Skin health and beauty organic sales slumped 4.5% in the latest quarter, the company said Tuesday. That marks the third straight quarter of such declines.', 'Mimicking the playbook of rivals isn’t a bad idea. But that’s the minimum needed just to keep from falling further behind, said Piper Sandler analyst Korinne Wolfmeyer.', 'For skeptical investors — not to mention fickle Gen Z consumers who’ve moved on to other brands — it may not be enough to win.', 'Falling Off the Radar', 'Neutrogena, founded in 1930 under the name Natone, became a prestige beauty brand in America on its California vibe and dermatologists’ recommendations.', 'When Johnson & Johnson bought Neutrogena in 1994 for almost $1 billion, the health-care giant gave the brand greater distribution and deeper pockets for science-centric advertising. The line of products expanded over the years to include not just soap, but sunscreens, wrinkle cream, acne treatments and lip gloss — fueling sales gains and garnering a cult-like following among young women. A fresh-faced Jennifer Garner appeared in Neutrogena’s TV spots.', 'For a while, Neutrogena continued to feel like an independent, family-run brand that was separate from its parent’s corporate influence, said the former employees. Southwest-inspired folk art from Lloyd Cotsen — Neutrogena’s multimillionaire president — hung throughout its Los Angeles office, and a human-sized stuffed cow named Elsie greeted workers and visitors alike inside the entrance.', 'But as J&J brought Neutrogena more into the corporate fold, former employees said it started to lose its way. As often happens in acquisitions, the brand’s dedicated sales team was tapped to sell products across the parent company’s portfolio. Neutrogena began to fall off the radar of consumers — and physicians — amid rising competition.', 'One of the product lines that historically distinguished Neutrogena from rivals was sun protection. The brand’s Helioplex sunscreens had strong support among dermatologists focused on skin cancer prevention, one of the employees said. But as consumer concerns arose over the safety of chemical-based sunscreens, CeraVe swooped in with a hydrating mineral-based sunscreen in 2019 that grabbed significant shopper attention. While Neutrogena had its own mineral sunscreen under the Sheer Zinc label at the time, some dermatologists said it was lost in the noise.', 'Neutrogena’s downfall “started with that mineral sunscreen,” said Amy Brodsky, a dermatologist based in Rockford, Illinois, who has worked with CeraVe on a campaign. “CeraVe kind of beat them to the punch.”', 'L’Oreal jumped on the opportunity to push its way into dermatologists’ offices. Oyetakin says she’s on a texting basis with her CeraVe sales rep, who comes once a month to drop off samples, whereas Neutrogena’s rep has only visited once this year.', 'The dermatologist says she used to consider the brand a major player, but the skin-care landscape began to shift in late 2020. Consumers and influencers stuck at home on their phones largely shaped the conversation on social media. “CeraVe honestly or just L’Oreal in general seized that opportunity early and they’ve held onto it tightly,” she said.', 'CeraVe began marketing its products on TikTok in 2020. That year it climbed its way to teen girls’ top skin care brand, where it’s now been ever since, according to Piper Sandler. CeraVe cornered nearly 29% of skin care sales dollars across the nation in 2023.', 'Neutrogena, which didn’t embrace TikTok until 2021, has slipped in the rankings, edged out by not just CeraVe but also The Ordinary, La Roche-Posay, Cetaphil and Glow Recipe.', 'Neutrogena also pulled back on more traditional advertising. The brand spent just $51 million on national TV ads in 2022, less than half of what it spent in 2020, data from iSpotTV.com shows. And across brands, Kenvue spent $71 million less on research and development in 2020 than it did the year prior. It took three years for R&D spending to surpass its pre-pandemic level.', 'Meanwhile, competitors ramped up their own new launches. Rival Elf Beauty, noted Piper Sandler’s Wolfmeyer, seems to introduce something new every few weeks, which is key to staying top of mind among teens.', '“It’s a new idea to be this launch heavy,” she said.', 'In the midst of Neutrogena losing both mind and market share, J&J, which also owns Listerine and Tylenol, spun off the consumer-side of its business as Kenvue in an initial public offering last May.', 'Kenvue’s stock has dropped about 27 percent since then, in part due to lagging sales in skin health and beauty, which makes up about 28% of the business. Even as the skin care industry grew sales units by 3.6% last year, according to Circana data, sales volumes of Kenvue’s brands fell 4.8% in 2023.', '“Neutrogena US is a significant part of the business. It’s a high-margin business,” said RBC analyst Nik Modi. “It’s a big deal for investors.”', 'Too Little, Too Late?', 'Turning around Kenvue’s skin care business — and specifically the Neutrogena brand — now rests on the shoulders of Jan Meurer, who was promoted to group president of North America from chief growth officer on Jan. 1. So far, the plan he’s tasked with executing has left investors unimpressed.', 'In a survey of about 60 shareholders, more than half said they were skeptical or not confident that management can turn around its skin care business due to a lack of innovation and rising competition, Modi said in a note published in February.', 'The company says it’s focused on making retail displays more visible and easier to shop, and redesigning packaging to better highlight product benefits. Neutrogena is targeting dermatologists with samples and scientific research. Last October, it launched a new line of “Hydro Boost” water creams. All necessary steps, but they haven’t exactly thrust the ailing brand back into the spotlight.', 'Like its competitors, Neutrogena has enlisted “dermfluencers” and celebs to stump for it. The brand is also trying to build a bridge to Gen Z in a recent campaign featuring both Garner, now 52, and 21-year-old actress Jenna Ortega.', 'Kenvue says it will take until the second half of this year, and into 2025, to correct its mistakes — and for sales to pick up.', '“Stabilizing this business is a key priority for us,” Chief Executive Officer Thibaut Mongon told investors on the company’s first-quarter earnings call. “We are not where we want to be in terms of market-share. The recovery will take time and will not be linear.”', 'Internally, Meurer is making changes. In April, the company closed the brand’s California headquarters, laying off staff amid a move to New Jersey. In more restructuring, Kenvue is dismissing 51 employees from its Skillman, New Jersey, office this spring in preparation for a move to a new 290,000-square foot headquarters 37 miles north in Summit.

The S&P 500, one of the leading stock indexes in the world, gained 10.2% in the first three months of 2024, achieving its best first-quarter performance in five years. The impressive performance sparked greater interest among investors in the stock market. In March, investors poured roughly $50 billion into funds focused on purchasing stocks in the US, as reported by EPFR Global Data. That said, it is important to bear in mind that it is the bigger companies that are driving the market upward, especially those that are attentive to the ongoing artificial intelligence wave. The ‘Magnificent Seven’ accounted for 40% of the market’s overall gains in the first three months, according to data by S&P Dow Jones Indices. Meta’s remarkable returns of over 40% during the period were massively driven by the company’s announcement of its first-ever dividend earlier this year.', 'Dividends play an important role in the investment landscape, with approximately 80% of the companies in the S&P 500 paying dividends to shareholders.

After the market close, we published our first quarter results. As you've seen, we've updated our quarterly earnings format with the goal to enhance our process to provide information to the investors, which they're most interested. And we are happy to take your feedback on our new format as we move forward, it kicked off with the reflections. I'd really like to begin today by thanking the entire Goodyear team for delivering on our first quarter ahead of plan. We are fully engaged in executing the Goodyear forward. And it is this level of momentum that is going to help us drive toward stronger results, stronger segment operating margins and stronger free cash flow over the next couple of years. I do want to point out that it's not just what our associates have accomplished. It's also about how they're doing it. We are focused on a very clear set of KPIs to deliver the good your forward our operating plan, and we have the governance and accountability very clear through our chain through my first months here a good year. It is clear. Our associates are committed to doing the right things and in the right way, this is why the company continues to be one of America's top trusted brands. As I joined Good year just over 90 days ago. It's been inspiring to engage in discussions with our associates in our plants at our retail centers that our tech center and headquarter and all of our stakeholders as well as I work to dive deep into understanding the business and making sure that I'm laser-focused together with the team to execute our GEAR forward transformation as well as the annual operating plan we have in front of us. We turn to Q1 results as we look at our results through the first quarter, we delivered segment operating income of $247 million ahead of expectations and nearly doubling our earnings from last year. This reflects a marked recovery in our Americas business with SOI up $100 million from the prior year. Our Asia Pacific business also continued to see significant growth, both in volume as well as earnings as results in the quarter were relatively stable, providing a good base for us to grow. All that said, as we see our overall volume softness in the quarter, partly driven by weaker industry member sell-in volumes, partly due to the very specific actions we're taking to increase profitability on low margin, low value add products. This is a clear strategy of a good year for plan, something that will help us to increase our margins over the next couple of years. It's a focus by product line profitability and our products, should-cost analysis, which I'll cover more later and at the end, it's always about our execution. What we've seen over the past several quarters, global assume consumer replacement industry volumes continue to be influenced by growth in low and imports in both the U.S. as well as Europe. This dynamic was captured as part of our first quarter outlook. As we look at what is happening at the retail level, industry sellout was up slightly in the US and up about 3% in Europe in our commercial truck business. And like we've seen over the last several quarters, a weak fleet industry conditions continue to weigh on our business in the Americas as well as ammonia for the Americas. While sellout conditions are stabilizing, the industry did see some pre-buy as a result of potential new tariffs on imported tires coming from Thailand. With that said, we don't see this incremental import activity as a significant headwind to our plants. As we turn to Goodyear forward, we delivered about $70 million in segment operating income improvements during the first quarter. In addition to what we captured in the P&L this quarter, we are executing actions to drive towards our $1.3 billion planned earnings improvement as part of Goodyear forward in our footprint and plant optimization, we have put together very detailed plan specific factory plans going to the work center level to drive factory efficiencies across our footprint. We are reviewing the details of these efficiency plans with our plant operating teams, together with the leadership team on a weekly basis. In addition, I spent the last month visiting our manufacturing sites in the U.S. to support both these initiatives to get to know our teams and to get to know the folks on our production floor. The work in our factories includes implementing improvements to drive increases in our operating equipment, uptime reliability, reducing the complexity in our factories, reducing the number of configurations preparing to run several products on common product platforms as well as rationalizing our materials. We are also working to reduce overtime and third-party contractor spend as we move forward in addition, we've announced changes to our distribution strategy in Australia, three planned factory closures, two in Germany, one in Malaysia. In purchasing. We're negotiating with our suppliers using clean sheet and should-cost methodologies and analytics, which are aided by tech advancements. We are implementing enhanced spend control standards and control processes to get to a deeper level of visibility as well as very proactive management of our spend all the way down to the factory level. Given that procurement plays such an essential role in the success of Goodyear forward, I have elevated the chief procurement officer role to report directly to me on the leadership team in our SAG. area. As we previously announced a reduction of 1,200 positions in Amea, it will deliver $100 million in savings by 2025. In addition, we've also taken actions on additional 135 positions in the U.S. and LatAm during the first quarter while headcount reductions of any of any kind are always very difficult decisions that we can make as a management team. They are, in fact, required for us to rightsize our cost structure and enable our long-term competitiveness as a company in the supply chain and research and development, we continue to optimize for best cost, as I mentioned earlier, with respect to margin enhancements. We took actions in the first quarter to increase our price mix on our lowest margin accounts. At the same time, we are also working to industrialize a number of new products to bring to market and the SKUs associated with that in the quarters ahead, we're going to broaden our product portfolio with increased premium Goodyear fitments for the high end market as we continue to rationalize our portfolio and SKU count where appropriate, we continue to be very focused on the Cooper brand as well and continuing to grow in that area. Our retail store network in the U.S. turned in their best first quarter in five years, driven by advancements in consumer insight and the actions we've taken to improve our price and our mix overall, as I reflect on the quarter, I am very encouraged with our execution. I'm excited about the improvements that we are driving for the future. And by now, I've been through the detailed makeup of the Goodyear forward plan inside and out and can confirm that we have the line of sight to the $1.3 billion run rate improvements and 10% segment operating income margin by the end of next year. We'll keep a close eye on the industry volume and price mix over the next quarters to ensure we're managing the external environment while we execute our plan to drive value for our shareholders. Now I'll ask Christina to take you through the first quarter financials in greater detail, and we'll move on to Q&A. Thank you, Christina."", 'Christina Zamarro', ""Mark. I'll start by echoing Mark's excitement about the execution we're seeing from our team on good year forward with energy carrying throughout our organization. It's clear that the combination of this plan, our team's his knowledge of the business and their ability to drive results sets us up for success. I'll begin with our financial results starting with the income statement on slide 8, our sales totaled $4.5 billion, down 8% from last year, driven by lower tire volume and unfavorable price mix. The unfavorable price mix was due to the impact of two factors. First, a weak commercial truck industry on our mix, and second, contractual price adjustments as feedstock prices have remained low over the last several quarters. Unit volume was down 3% from last year. Overall replacement volume declined 7%, partly offset by higher OE volume, which increased about 9%. Segment operating income for the quarter was $247 million, up $122 million from a year ago. After adjusting for significant items, our earnings per share was $0.10, up $0.39 versus last year. Year-over-year drivers of our earnings are shown on Slide 9. The impact of lower tire unit volume was $28 million, reflecting a decline in shipments of $1.4 million units. Factory utilization was a slight benefit. Segment operating income benefited from favorable net price mix versus raw material costs of $127 million. Raw materials were a benefit of $261 million and price mix was negative for the quarter due to commercial truck mix and contractual pricing adjustments. The negative impact of price mix was $134 million. Having said all that, sequential pricing from the fourth quarter was stable. Canadian Forward initiatives contributed $72 million in the quarter with benefits driven by plant optimization and purchasing. Inflation in the quarter was $58 million or about 3%, which was partly offset by favorable other costs of $25 million, driven by lower transportation rates. Other SANYO primarily consists of the impact from the fire in our Poland facility that occurred in August of last year. Turning to Slide 10. Net debt totaled $7.4 billion at the end of the first quarter, down just over $550 million from the same time last year. Cash flow from operating activities is typically negative in the first quarter as activity ramps up following the holiday shutdown, cash use decreased in the first quarter versus a year ago. Given lower raw material costs in our inventory and increased earnings. Moving to our SBU results and starting on slide 12, America's first quarter unit volume decreased 7% or $1.5 million units driven by replacement volume. These results are in contrast to the relatively strong US industry in the first quarter, which was driven by an increase in low end importance industry member volume, primarily representing large branded tire companies, was lower year over year. Segment operating income totaled $179 million or nearly 7% of sales, reflecting an increase of $100 million year over year. Americas earnings benefited from lower transportation rates, the execution of Goodyear forward and from net price mix versus raw materials, which more than offset inflation and volume headwinds. Moving to slide 13, EMEA's first quarter unit volume decreased 5% or 700,000 units, driven by replacement like in the US. Europe's consumer replacement industry growth in the first quarter was driven by imports. Our premium segment share remains stable versus prior year. Segment operating income was $8 million and flat from a year ago. Favorable net price mix versus raw materials and Goodyear forward actions were offset by volume declines and inflation. Turning to Asia Pacific on Slide 14. First quarter unit volume increased 10% or 800,000 units driven by OE growth in China. Segment operating income totaled $60 million and 10% of sales, with an increase of $22 million in SOI compared to the prior year. Asian earnings benefited from favorable net price mix versus raw materials volume and good year forward initiatives. These benefits were partially offset by higher costs. Turning now to our second quarter outlook. On the left-hand side of Page 16, we expect second quarter global unit volume to be about flat versus prior year. I'll note that this excludes the Americas' replacement unit volume recovery related to last year's tornado at our Tupelo facility, which I'll cover in SLY. other in just a moment. Additionally, we expect higher unabsorbed fixed costs of about $30 million, driven by lower production volume during the first quarter. Lower raw materials will be a benefit of about $160 million, partially offset by about $70 million of lower price mix driven by raw material indexed agreements. We expect good year forwards to deliver approximately $75 million of SOI benefits during the second quarter. Lower transportation rates will partly offset general inflation for a net headwind of about $10 million in costs. As to why other items to consider include a net benefit of the recovery from the 2023 storm at our Tupelo facility and the continuing impact from the fire at our Poland facility. The combination of these events reflects a net benefit of $35 million in the second quarter. On the right-hand side of the page, our full-year assumptions are relatively unchanged from our previous call. Although I'll note, we have increased our full year outlook for good year forward given our first quarter performance and reflecting our confidence as we move through the execution of our plan. With that, we'll open the line for questions and at this time."", 'Operator', '(Operator instructions) James Picariello, BNP Paribas.', 'James Picariello', ""Yes, hi, everyone. This is Jake on for James. Congrats on the great quarter and congratulations, Mark. But could you just help me put a finer point on on your full year volume assumptions for Goodyear, if I work through the SLI bridge items you laid out. I got something at roughly $1.4 billion. Yes, I just want to see if there's any and the downside of that."", 'Christina Zamarro', ""Yes, hi, good morning. So our full year outlook on volume, as we laid out in the presentation, is to be slightly behind the industry in consumer replacement. That's all going to be driven by our first quarter experience. And so when you look at the remainder of the year, what I would say broadly speaking is that we should and be more in line with the industry. As we look at what's happened over the past few quarters, we've seen a lot of the destocking that we needed to sell through in Europe complete and in the US in the first quarter, we were cycling through a really easy comp on the import side of the house. But as we move into Q2, we've guided relatively flat volume in the back half of the year yet, of course, depending on your assumptions for industry growth. But we see growth in volume just given that the consumer sell-out has trended positively here in the USVMT. a couple of points in Europe also of about 3% on a sellout basis. And so hopefully that helps you with your not least, that's very helpful."", 'James Picariello', 'Thank you. And it looks like most of the upside in the restructuring space this year from $350 million to about $375 million was captured in the first quarter. So are there any other opportunities to potentially push that number higher through the rest of the year?', 'Christina Zamarro', ""Thank you. Yes, sure. So at on our fourth quarter, conference call, we had said that we should benefit from good year forward actions in 2024 by about $350 million. And just given our experience, you're exactly right. In the first quarter, we've increased our outlook to at least $375 million, which does mean that we have good reason to believe that we should be able to exceed that level, although we need to continue to execute on our work streams real time to be able to increase that amount publicly here for now, we've increased both purchasing and supply chain based on savings. We do have line of sight to that was over and above that initial plan. I'd say supply chain is higher on better utilization and network optimization and purchasing. We have added some new work streams since Mark came on board to deliver more value and indirect spend. This includes new MRO work streams, Grace dock and other spend control programs in our factories, a lot of good successes there. What I would say is we'll give you an update in the next quarter. We should be pretty much locked in on knowing where we land on the savings by Q3, just given our FIFO accounting, but at least where we're comfortable right now is at that at least $375 million level"", 'Mark Stewart', ""than our original guidance and end of June. In terms of we've got really strong momentum in brewed energy with each of our functional teams of each of the four teams. And as Kristina mentioned, right, with this $72 million of total actions already REN that are demonstrated results in the first quarter, but as we look through it, right, I'm I'm personally as well as Christina. We're meeting across the work streams on a weekly basis with each of the functions, be it purchasing be it manufacturing across our retail, et cetera. And as we look across each of the five five areas tying into that three, 75 plus number, Christina mentioned, right, it really evolves it's our footprint and plant optimization and the work that we're doing. We've and we could talk a bit on it later or the questions that we've been pursuing. And I am SaaS going out to each of our plants in the US. Deep diving with our plant leadership teams and our manufacturing engineering and purchasing groups are meeting weekly with purchasing in terms of the diligence. And really we've tightened our KPI.'s across the organization, both at the staff level of what we're looking at on a monthly basis and diving, but within each of our teams with dedicated purchasing and manufacturing meetings weekly to ensure execution and also to add to this workstream. So feel very good about that along with, as we mentioned earlier our RSAG. strains of getting getting that SAG out of the system around the world for better cost competitiveness for the future state and then the supply chain and logṁistics cost savings are flowing through quite nicely as well as the actions that we've taken around complexity, reduction, commonality of platforms and to enhance our margins, be it through repricing be it through choosing not to run those other products that really don't fit into our portfolio."", 'James Picariello', 'Yes. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'John Healy, Northcoast Research.', 'John Healy', 'I wanted to ask about the volume side in North America. You talked about the low margins and about a low margin product kind of going away a bit. Could you talk to what sort of volume impact that is maybe in terms of units, I assume on the replacement side and maybe what areas of the market are retailers or brands like those are disappearing?', 'Christina Zamarro', ""Yes, John. So I'll start here and I'll just say we've certainly seen some volatility over the last several core quarters with respect to low and imports. And we take a broad set that what I'd say is the import activity was depressed for the period immediately following COVID. And then what we've seen is this is several quarters of over compensation, if you will, over the next, you know, over the last several quarters? Yes, as I think about our share in 2023, I'd say broadly speaking, we're about where we expected to be. If I look at nonmember imports over over 2023, that low end part of the market is about 20%, 21% in 2023. That's about where it was for all of the last five years. So I think what we're seeing is a whole lot of choppiness and in the first quarter, in particular, though the imports were 25% of the market, and that represented a pretty significant increase in our nonmember imports, if you will, John were up 100%, which was about $1 million and a half more units than what we would normally see an importer. But again, we really believe that as lumpiness when we think about a question maybe getting getting to the question on is the consumer really trading down at least in the US. What I would say is we don't see we don't have evidence of a consumer trade down, especially in branded Tier one tires. So this would be all of the Tier one tire companies, including Goodyear, that that share in the market has been very consistent over the last five years. And even more recently over the last couple of quarters, we have seen some weakness in Tier two and Tier three accreting to Tier four and share. And I think at this point, it's really not clear, John, whether that's weakness driven by consumer preference or whether that's something that's linked to distributor behavior because historically what we have seen is distributors going long on low-end tires in an inflationary environment. So this is one that we will continue to watch as income. What's different is what's happening with imports in Europe. And I think if you look over the last five years, the import low end imports as a percentage of the market have grown from something like 20% to 27%. And so that what that means is that our distributors are more willing to stock. Our consumers are more willing to bolt on these opening price point tires. And I think that's really a reflection of is the impact of the very high inflation on the consumers in Europe and also just the more recent macro events there and so therein lies the rationale for a couple of the major restructurings we've announced in Europe. Hopefully, that helps."", 'John Healy', 'No. Super helpful. And then just on just a finer point, I wanted to ask just about the price mix outlook. I think you guys are saying price mix would be positive in the second half of the year. Just thinking through some of the moving parts globally with the destocking, there may be growth in the import brand. And to me, it seems like that has a little bit of a risk to it and do you see that as an area with risks to the business? And how do you get confidence that price?', 'Christina Zamarro', ""Well, well, I think a good question, John. I'd say by the end of the second quarter, we'll have one the commercial truck mix drag we've been seeing the last several quarters. Actually, that's mostly finished in the first quarter here in Q2. While we will lap the impact of RMI indexed agreements on price mix. And so I think, you know, until we get a clean base, if you will, for Q3 and Q4 and then the volume I'm looking at in our back half of the year in the Americas, really strong growth in our consumer OE business. We should and outperform the market share just given our mix of fitments, obviously heavily geared to truck and SUV, which creates a lot of rich mix for us. And then we also expect winter inventories in Europe are down 14% year over year, so really low. And that sets us up for a really good selling season in Q3 in media mix also. So I think a lot of good reasons to believe in price mix in the back half of the year."", 'Mark Stewart', ""And I would just add on one point on and specifically around new products, John, and that's where I look at the premium products launching around the world. We've got some great products coming into the marketplace for season and it's for the Americas. We've got we're ready to launch in the fitments filling out the electric drive to as well, which is an all season EV tire for us in the electric drive to a demand side. We've got the Eagle F1 Asymmetric we've got six sizes coming out, filling out that segment. And then on the AP, we've got our versions of Goodyear electric drive there, and we're seeing some really positive success in the luxury and premium performance markets in Asia Pacific and the continued strength of our wins on the EV segment. So all very positive news for us."", 'John Healy', ""Great. That's of luck."", 'Christina Zamarro', 'Thanks. John.', 'Operator', 'Emmanuel Rosner, Deutsche Bank.', 'Emmanuel Rosner', ""Thank you very much.Good morning. My first question is a follow-up on the on the volume question. So I think you've essentially identified two trends, right? Some of it is the lumpiness and this import dynamics in the U.S. and in Europe and in some of it seems to be a little bit more deliberate as part of your strategy. And you explained very well that lumpiness and the imports dynamic and how that would move forward. I'm just want to focus on the second piece, I guess how much more do you have to do in terms of amount of business or tire volume DESCAP, you're not really interested in are that's not profitable and that will help your profitability from exiting. I'm just curious when I'm looking at, I guess, your volume outlook for the rest of the year. Will this be a meaningful factor of potential performance versus the industry? Or are you mostly done with this?"", 'Mark Stewart', ""And thanks for the question. And as always, I will start with your last statement, and that's why we've taken the actions through the first quarter that that we needed to do with that, we're really using a should cost and profitability at in conjunction, obviously, with the cost structure by tire basis and across our customer platforms. And so we've gone through to take a look at it. And it doesn't always mean that we're walking away, right? We're just working with those customers for the right price point for that product at that performance level. And so it's not a matter of everything totally going away. In some cases, it's just a reset of the price to the market based on the performance of it of those individual SKUs are tires. So we actually feel very, very positive on that. We've taken the actions we needed to take with it. And as we move forward, you know, again, we worked with some customers in terms of getting the price points reset, and that's actually been happening before my time, I think over really the last four or five months or so. But we took the final actions to that towards first quarter and expect those things to be relatively stable on that as Kristina mentioned before."", 'Emmanuel Rosner', ""Okay. That's great. That's great color. And then I had a question about the from the good year forward plan. So it seems in the quarter it helps America's profitability quite a bit. I'm curious when could we expect to start seeing it helping Aimia's profitability? Is this can be still within this year?"", 'Mark Stewart', ""Or is it a little bit more back-end loaded as a result of passing to work in Europe as we as we mentioned at the opening, really the SAG. actions have already been well implemented and we're on track to fully execute. The 1,200 roles which were identified on are coming out on plan, if you will. And if we look at year to year as I said with the May release being about flat in terms of the earnings. But with all of your forward restructuring activities done and as well as the two plants that were announced late last year in terms of Florida and first of all, to going through, and that's also proceeding to plan. So from that aspect of it. So we are absolutely on track with the actions we've got"", 'Christina Zamarro', ""and Aman percent indicating I'd like to point out to me, I can't find that when we when we announced the plan in November and we did. We did say that the majority of the actions would benefit our Americas business. It was a split of like 70% of the $1.3 billion was going to be accretive to the Americas. And Peter, the breast stone split between India and Asia Pac. I think we should expect improving margins in EV over the course of the year. And then as Mark mentioned, with the factory restructuring, I'm coming more to bear next year and then again, another step up in 2025."", 'Emmanuel Rosner', 'That should, Ralph, would you think that 70% holds also for the $375 million in benefits expected for this year or January yet?', 'Christina Zamarro', 'That is the same the same.', 'Emmanuel Rosner', ""Okay. And then one final quick one, if I may. I guess what can you tell us about the process and to divest the non-core assets and how that's actually going and the new or updated time line around potential future updates?"", 'Christina Zamarro', 'Yes. Actually, this is regarding a strategic review on our portfolio. And may I say that and process for each one of these assets is well under way exactly where we expected to be at this point in time. And if you remember on our fourth quarter call, we said that we should be in a position to offer a more fulsome update on one or more of these processes by midyear. So you can think about that being our second quarter conference call. We are still working towards that time line. So and no other update other than things are progressing and progressing well.', 'Emmanuel Rosner', 'Great. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Ryan Brinkman, JPMorgan', 'Ryan Brinkman', ""Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Off your personal market. It was great to hear in your introductory remarks that you were able to come in initially as an outsider because you've dug into deeply into that good here forward plan, a Brexit deal, you were able to independently confirm for yourself the line of sight into the operating improvements at the rest of the management team I had identified at the same time, I recall you on the last call saying that while it was that extremely early days in your listening tour, et cetera, that you're hoping to also identify some quick and easy wins or low-hanging fruit in terms of how the plan, which you said, like, I think good bones, you know how it might be augmented or accelerated? And unless I'm just curious, I know the last 90 days would be incremental, but your founder are looking into that and we think might have the most potential?"", 'Mark Stewart', ""Sure. Thanks, Ryan. As I said, I mean, I mean, you know, I sometimes have a big mouth, but I definitely listen a lot the first five weeks, the one of the things, though, in the first five weeks, which we did execute very quickly was was to to add to that Sean Pathe, our Chief Procurement Officer, on the senior leadership team staff you have reported directly to myself. It's very important that we have real-time visibility and ability to help Sean and the purchasing team to in terms of speed of execution and so we absolutely have done that. We've identified some additional savings trends in that area in quite a few of those actually increased the speed of going through some of the global bid process starting here in the Americas, but up in looking as well into both from the raw material stream, but as well into our MRO, which we have identified quite a few additional opportunities, MRO contract employees, the way our contracts are set up. We're going through a lot of things, basic manufacturing one-on-ones, if you will, such as our overtime overtime planning our scheduling within our manufacturing facilities with our plant leadership teams, we brought in all of our plant leaders across the Americas have had some sessions with those guys face-to-face as well as we do weekly sessions with them. And we've really got ourselves lined up slightly differently across process streams so that we can take our best-in-class performance benchmark and ensure that those are cloud-based across the network in order to capture those savings, whether they were already Anaplan, but maybe the timing was different. So we've been able to pull those in faster in terms of our execution within this year and next as well as things that maybe weren't on the radar screen for particular plant. We're also moving resources across plants, both engineering as well as our manufacturing resources to speed those execution pieces as well, Ryan. So those are the couple just a couple of highlights to what we've been doing with that. The other thing we're in the process now is more of a centralized manufacturing footprint for consistency and for us to be able to take efficiencies in terms of OEE., reducing our scrap commonality and complexity reduction all tied in with our shared cost activities. So we've got ourselves lined up for that. We have reduced the number of KPI that we're looking at into the important the top important ones for us that have the biggest lever for impact, and we're driving those on a week-by-week basis to make sure that we have clarity with the teams that we have ownership with the teams and we have timing of when to do business."", 'Ryan Brinkman', ""Okay. Thanks. And then lastly for me, I suppose, but focused in the plan on significantly increasing segment operating income, that free cash flow will naturally follow and benefit also, of course, from the deleverage enabled by the non-operating or divestiture aspect of the plan, I'm just curious how you're thinking about other opportunities to improve free cash flow relative to EBITDA and how important that is or should be as a part of the plan? We've sometimes seen big inflections in cash flow after management have changed the way in which their employees are incentivized taken. Lkq is a one example in this industry, and I know there's likely a ton of focus on driving margin and then getting those divestitures done, but to pay down the debt. But how large of an opportunity might there be around working capital efficiency CapEx discipline, CapEx, reusability, anything that you can I think, to bring from your former employment, et cetera. How are you thinking about the cadence of on the operating side, operating earnings improved versus that the cash flow improves as you progress through the planning about one's market share?"", 'Mark Stewart', ""Sure. Maybe let me start on Prosigna add onto it that when we think about the again, things things kind of coming going from my past rate of also highly capital intensive businesses as well. So we've already we've got a very clear line of sight to the to the R & D that we have planned for as part of that good year forward and then in the years following as well, right? So very disciplined approach on that another reason why we put purchasing to the leadership team of us working together with purchasing in IT Engineering, look into what is our manufacturing equipment strategy, looking at the items again on a payback analysis on that best return on capital for the modernization activities, we have tremendous amount of modernization going on this year, example in our one facility. But as well as many of the other facilities to get our cost basis to a very, very competitive level, if you will, and then balancing our products across the network for looking at a best cost. So in terms of how to do that, right, all these things are tied into that working capital, as you mentioned, right, so investing in the right things at the right time looking with purchasing in terms of how we're negotiating that, just over the one two threes of our negotiation process, how we're bundling when we know we're going through a modernization period here across our equipment. If we know for example, we're going to go from, you know, from replacing 10 machines to possibly at 30 50, et cetera, but negotiating that upfront so that we can get the best price on that. So we're setting up our depreciation schedule and conserving cash upfront, but also making sure the cost structure is right also where the equipment is being placed. The other thing is really working with our individual plant leadership teams around the world, looking at at that cost efficiency level. And really we're starting to talk to the plant leadership teams, not only on a cost center basis, but also on a P&L basis in their window, right? So things that they can impact and it is things like MRO that ties up a lot of cash and a credit, if you will, around the world. So things such as shared, shared spare part resources around the network and things like that, that again, more more basic discipline items when it comes to our spending, we have a weekly spend control as well, quite frankly, that we've installed so that if anything, triggers higher than that, it escalates we talk through it. So it's about changing patterns and behavior while putting the system and discipline, which we already have the systems in place, but getting the robustness of that really, really strong. Christina, as you like to add on to that now."", 'Christina Zamarro', ""Hey, Mark, I think you covered a lot of it. I think internally as to describe what it is, what it feels like granted is that behavioral change where we're emphasizing to the teams is when we get to a target, it's not that we've necessarily done or done the job we're going to we're going to continue to look for what else we can do. And I think it's that it's that never satisfied mentality in as we've put together this plan. And as Marc has come in and added his experience and perspective to it, I think it's all about achieving that sustainability of cash flow that sustainability of earnings. And when we when we look out to the fourth quarter of 2025, we would see an annualized cash flow on an adjusted free cash flow basis is like $600 million or $700 million and that that's on an adjusted EBITDA, say about 2.7. So our goal is to not enough, obviously, to not have a good year or two, but we're really trying to structurally change the cash flow profile of the business."", 'Ryan Brinkman', ""That's very helpful. Thank you."", 'Operator', '(Operator instructions) Itay Michaeli, Citi.', 'Itay Michaeli', ""Great. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Just two final questions from me. First, on the inflation and other costs. The other thing I would just maybe walk through the puts and takes for second half of the year, I think first half imply that just over $40 million that you've got over $200 million of a headwind for the full year. And then maybe going back on my second question on the assumptions for second half for volume and pricing. Hoping you just kind of review on just the underlying assumptions for industry sellout trends, maybe your market share and then maybe the impact from some of the new products mark that you alluded to before? And thank you."", 'Christina Zamarro', ""It's a third on the inflation question and your full year cost headwinds. For us of about $215 million. You rightly point out this is weighted to the second half call-based inflation every quarter, about $50 million or $55 million for us in the first half, we had the benefit of some lower transportation rates, particularly in the U.S. pulling through. We've lapped that in the second half of the year. And then we will put on some additional costs because we've announced two factory closures in Europe that we run that through our inefficiencies, if you will, as we scale those factories down and ready to ready them for closure over the course of 2025 and 2026. We also had some insurance headwinds were related to and the tightness in the market. But also some of the claims activity that we've had over the last year. So that's the first test. Second half story on cost. As I look at volume more broadly, we talk through this a little bit earlier, I'd say we have good expectations for stability. I guess I would say in Q2 with kind of volume about flat and that's good growth in OE still continuing and maybe a little bit of weakness in replacement. And then as we look to the back half of the year, and I guess I would also say channel inventories in the US and Europe are healthy. I would say the US is down about 4% compared to year end is down 8% on a year-over-year basis year over year comp, there is more important because we have different seasonalities and all all of that time. You say the consumer has been resilient to sell out in Europe, up 3% so out in the U.S. as it was, it's been up kind of 1% or so the last several quarters. So expecting a decent market in the back half of the year even coming into the year, our thoughts were that we would see stronger growth in the back half than the first half, just knowing what we need to move through as far as channel inventory, but we think the setup is good. Specifically, if I take you through a little bit of the regions because that may be helpful too. And the Americas should have really good OE growth in the back half. That's on our, you know, Goodyear specific mix of fitments. So we'll gain share. We talked about that earlier. And then in EMEA, as I mentioned this earlier to winter tire inventories down 40%. It is very low levels, so should indicate a good restocking for us in the third quarter in Asia Pacific as just continued to see growth. We have some tougher comps in OE in the second half, but replacement should still be pretty positive for us. So feeling feeling good about on volume and price mix in the second half. And then Mark will walk you through some of the new product introductions and a lot of that kind of two things happening was we're releasing new products sort of opening up the aperture on the SKU portfolio, the number of SKUs that we're offering into more premium in the market and then rationalizing SKUs at the lower end, which is all really supportive of mix as well."", 'Itay Michaeli', ""Terrific. That's all very, very helpful. Thank you."", 'Christina Zamarro', 'Welcome, Guillaume.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. This will conclude our as well as our conference call.

Now I'd like to turn the call over Dr. Frost."", 'Phillip Frost', ""Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. In March, we announced an agreement to sell certain assets of Bio-Reference health to LabCorp for 237.5 million. The assets included Bio-Reference is clinical diagnostics and women's health testing services outside of New York and New Jersey. The transaction was specifically structured in a manner so as to increase the likelihood of obtaining expedited clearance from antitrust regulators, but it also streamlines and remaining operations to advance the path to profitability for our Diagnostic segment. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of this year, pending FTC clearance. In general, our long-acting growth hormone therapy continues to gain traction as our global commercial partner, Pfizer expands its launch of the product in over 40 global markets. This once-weekly injection product to treat growth hormone deficiency is the first new chemical entity developed at OpCo biologics in Israel, where we now have other preclinical candidates under development. One is a long acting form of unlocks the oxyntomodulin analog, which I mentioned in our last quarterly call, the pegylated form of this active peptide has been shown to be effective and safe in treating diabetes and obesity in a Phase two study in over 450 patients. The new long acting form is expected to have the same pharmacology profile as the regulated form will permit administering larger doses we have and in development, a longer-acting ACTH antagonist for the treatment of acromegaly caused by the executive excessive secretion of growth hormone and IGF-1. We are progressing in our work with internal bio to develop oral forms of oxyntomodulin and a group to our analog for short bowel syndrome and other disorders involving nutrient malabsorption. We look forward to keep you apprised of progress with these promising programs. Boardex continues to advance its development work, and two programs are on track to enter the clinic this year. Our upstream bar vaccine license to Merck and our multi-specific oncology antibody which has received FDA clearance for a Phase one trial. Our cooperation with Varda is moving forward and provides nondilutive financing to develop multi-specific antibodies against COVID as work progresses on this first indication, we will begin to explore alternative targets to tackle other biodefense threats such as influenza. With that brief overview, I'll turn it over to Elias."", 'Elias Zerhouni', ""Well, thank you, Phil. And good afternoon, everyone. Let me start by AquaLogic by apologizing. If you hear background noise, I'm in a noisy environment and the airport. But as Phil said, we were very pleased to announce our agreement with LabCorp to sell certain assets of Bio-Reference health for a cash purchase price totaling 37.5 million. These assets generate approximately $100 million in annual revenue and include patient service centers, certain customer contracts and operating assets associated with testing services, focus on clinical diagnostics and women's health across the US, but outside of New York and New Jersey. We will retain our national oncology and urology franchises and our diagnostic services in New York and New Jersey complements our efforts to improve efficiencies and enhance the productivity of operations. This transaction will streamline U.S. laboratory services business and support our work to reestablish profitability in the near future. As Phil mentioned, we expect the sale to close in the second half of 2024, subject to customary closing conditions and applicable regulatory approvals and ongoing initiatives, we continue to improve bioreactors performance and in turn value. Our focus remains on initiatives to reduce cost, improve efficiency and enhance productivity. In addition, we seek to bolster growth with the expansion of insurance coverage in our higher value specialty segments of oncology and neurology, with particular focus in our proprietary 4K Score test. As you know, the focus Cortez was first introduced in 2014 as a laboratory developed test. As you know, FDA published new rules to reform the regulation of lab developed test. This will have a minimal impact on Bio-Reference health as for our tests are approved by New York state regulators who are exempted from the announced FDA reform in December 2021. I would like to remind you, focus coal was approved by the FDA, supported by its analytical and clinical data FDA concluded that the focus charge was had the appropriate sensitivity at 96.9% and negative predictive value of 95.9% contributed to an overall beneficial clinical decision as to whether a prostate biopsy should be performed and accordingly, minimize unnecessary biopsies without excess risk of missing clinically significant prostate cancers in more than 100 independent publications by erosion since then to focus core has ranked us in best-performing biomarker test for the assessment of risk probability for aggressive prostate cancer, our urology team with a strong growth in 4K Score test volumes in the first quarter, and we expect these volumes to build as the cash is included now in various clinical die or guidelines for early detection. Our prostate cancer portfolio of us appears to screen for initial and repeat biopsies risk stratification. In regard to Rayaldee, the program continues to enjoy stable demand, which we hope will grow with new data routing may delay the onset of dialysis. According to our most recent analysis in oncology, we are pleased with GenPath performance due to its innovative testing platform with an expanded hematological malignancy panel and very competitive turnaround times. We continue to see strong growth in our oncology business with over 12% growth in volume Q1 2024 versus Q1 2023 much of this growth was through collaborations with large cancer centers and mid-level health systems. As health systems are challenged with costs and staffing in the oncology space, they are looking for a reference laboratory to work with for the especially for the testing opening up possibilities for Bio-Reference sites. Genpact has been able to meet their needs with our own hands, a comprehensive menu across all stages of care. This includes the internalization of our hereditary cancer business in late Q4 2023, which now offers clients an internal solution with fast turnaround times for timely decision-making that we continue to expand our testing portfolio and expect new tests in Q2 to complement our current OncoCyte advance and risk portfolio, which will enable GenPath oncology to evaluate guideline recommended genetic components of a patient's cancer and keep us at the forefront of precision oncology, similar to our New Jersey, New York, New Jersey, women's health and clinical businesses our national oncology testing segment will remain with Bio-Reference sales under our GenPath Oncology brand. Upon closing of the transaction with LabCorp, we believe that Bio-Reference health is well positioned for further expense reductions and revenue expansion with a focus on the retained businesses in the New York and New Jersey markets after the divestiture. Complementing these efforts to boost performance, we will continue to improve our diagnostic division to further enhance profitability for AACo health and best position us as an innovative biopharmaceutical company. Moving to our pharmaceutical pharmaceutical segment, as you've heard and Jamba has been launched in all major global markets by Pfizer. We believe this drug is well positioned for significant growth as long-acting growth hormone products become the global standard in treating growth hormone deficiency for children. The launch is progressing as expected, with an increasing a significant percentage of patients shifting from daily to the long-acting once a week and gel product. In addition, we expect our partnership with Pfizer to expand with additional indications, including growth hormone deficiency for adults and other pediatric applications. And combined these approvals for these two indications will entitle OpCo to an additional $100 million in milestone payments. Let me go to Mosaic's SurModics. We're proud of the progress to date. In March, we announced favorable results from the Phase one clinical study with our trispecific antibody against HIV. This clinical data are the first reported for a trispecific antibody in humans and strongly support further development of multispecific multivalent antibodies against HIV. The antibody was found to be safe and well tolerated at all dose levels through both intravenous and subcutaneous use with minimal anti-drug antibodies observed with dosing ranging from 0.3 milligram per kilogram to 30 milligram per kilogram with up to four administrations and a pharmacokinetic which remained consistent and similar to standard monoclonal antibodies. We therefore believe and our partners at the NIH believe that multi-specific antibodies will offer a differentiated approach to longer-lasting preventive and therapeutic options against most HIV one virus with the possibility of activating the immune system against the latent virus population to affect a functional cure. We are partnered with the NIH of this program through our collaboration with Merck to develop MDX-010 initial one, which is our Epstein-Barr virus. Multivalent nanoparticle nanoparticle vaccine is advancing on plan. We received a $50 million upfront payment upon licensing this vaccine with a potential 872.5 million in development and commercial milestones, plus royalties on global sales ranging from single digit to double digit percentages. In terms of timing, we expect this program to enter the clinic in the later part of this year. Our collaboration with Barda is also proceeding on schedule and represents another source of non-dilutive funding for the Company. We secured an initial $59 million grant to fund R&D and clinical evaluation to a Phase one study of our multi-specific antibodies against known variants of SARS, CoV two for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19. Additional funding of up to $1.9 million may be available from Barda to develop multi-specific antibodies and delivery approaches to target other biodefense traits such as influenza. The ultimate goal of this research program is to develop a platform for gene-based delivery methods using mRNA or DNA vectors to supplement the body's natural protein production processes, which can then be used efficiently and effectively against future pandemics. Rounding out the Model X pipeline is our immuno-oncology program, which is focused on hard to treat solid tumors as well as certain liquid tumors such as leukemias and lymphomas. We believe our multi-specific antibody candidates can simultaneously target several tumor antigens and enable better control of the immune system activation. And we expect our trispecific laser program for solid tumors to enter the clinic this quarter as our first IND application, as indicated by Phil, focused on solid tumors, was deemed acceptable to proceed by the FDA. Other immuno oncology products are advancing to IND enabling studies and are on target to enter clinical studies next year. So as you can see, it's an exciting time for OpCo as we execute our strategy to gain profitability for Bio-Reference health by rightsizing the half the diagnostic division to its most profitable areas of activities while addressing our bold biopharmaceutical segment with several programs set to enter the clinic this year. I will now turn the call over to Adam go to discuss our first quarter financial results. Adam?"", 'Adam Logal', ""Thank you, Ali, U.S. console and LEO. As I've discussed we had a busy start to the year, realizing significant value from some of our underlying assets and strengthening our balance sheet. The convertible debt offering in January reduced our cash interest expense. This refinancing provided us the flexibility to align our cash needs for our research and development investments to debt maturities over the next five years. In addition, we used a portion of the proceeds to buy back 55 million shares of our common stock, reducing our outstanding shares by over 7%. We also announced our agreement with LabCorp for the sale of select assets, which was a competitive process. And when completed, that will allow us to realign our business operations to focus on core markets and test offerings and to support our path to profitability at Bio-Reference. While while we are still within the review window with the Federal Trade Commission, we are diligent we're diligently working on the profit plan for Bio-Reference to ensure we get to breakeven and then profitability as quickly as possible. The LabCorp deal was the first large step in the multifaceted plan. Moving to our financial results for our Diagnostics segment, we reported revenue for Q1 2024 of 126.9 million compared with 132.4 million for the 2023 period. Cost of expenses decreased to 161.3 million for the first quarter of 2024 from 172.4 million for the 2023 period. Operating loss for our Diagnostics segment of 34.4 million included approximately 2.2 million of nonrecurring costs related to employee severance and programs associated with our efforts to return to profitability. Depreciation and amortization expense were 7.9 million and 8.7 million for the 2024 and 2023 periods, respectively. Revenues included approximately 27.8 million related to the book of business that is subject to our sale agreement with LabCorp. The costs and expenses related to this business were approximately 34.8 million. As part of the transaction Lab Corp has agreed to offer employment to more than 700 of our impacted employees who support this business. Moving to our pharmaceuticals segment, revenue decreased to $46.8 million for the first quarter of 2024 from 105.2 million for the comparable period of 23. Revenue from products, including our intellectual property and our international pharmaceutical businesses, decreased by 2.3 million, reflecting lower sales within our Israeli API business partially offset by higher sales of Rayaldee. Revenue from the transfer of IP was 8.7 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to $64.8 million for the 2023 quarter, which included an upfront payment of $50 million from Merck as a result of our EBV vaccine agreement as well as 9.5 million of milestone payments from our partners for Rayaldee during the first quarter of 2020 for Pfizer was able to substantially reduce the cost of manufacturing in general and by obtaining approval for a significant scale-up of their manufacturing process in order to support the global launch of And gentlemen, in turn, Pfizer has revalued its inventory on hand at December 31st and amortize that difference in manufacturing costs during the first four months of 2024, which is their standard accounting policy. As a result, our anticipated gross profit share for the first quarter was less than we anticipated, and we reported gross profit share from Pfizer of 5.8 million, which compares to 3.1 million for the 2023 period. Pfizer has obtained significant payer access in the U.S. in 2024 for Genvoya, and we look forward to the continued execution on their global commercialization plan. In addition, other revenue includes approximately $2.2 million from our underlying agreement with Varda, which offset R&D and of underlying support expenses for that program costs and expenses for our pharmaceutical segment were $74.5 million for the first quarter of 2024 compared to 86.3 million for the 2023 period. Research and development expenses for the first quarter of 2024 or $21.2 million compared to 31.9 million for the 2023 period. The 2023 quarter included the nonrecurring 12.5 million of expense related to our payment to Sanofi for their portion of our upfront payment from Merck. Partially offsetting this decrease were increased activities for MOX development programs. The resulting operating loss for the quarter ended March 31st, 2024 was 27.7 million compared to operating income of 19 million for the first quarter of 2023, which I previously mentioned, benefited from this 57.5 million of milestone payments received in the quarter. Amortization expense related to intangible assets were unchanged at $16.4 million for both periods. Turning to our consolidated results, the first quarter of 2024 reported an operating loss of 71.5 million compared with an operating loss of 30.6 million for the 2023 quarter. Net loss for the 2024 period included approximately 26.2 million related to the fair value change on an embedded derivatives related to our convertible notes issued in January. For both periods, we recorded non-cash unrealized gains on our investment in GDX of 22.7 and $16.8 million, respectively, for the 2024 and 2023 period. As a result, net loss for the first quarter of 2024 was $81.8 million or $0.12 per share. And this compares with a net loss of $18.3 million or $0.02 per share for the 2023 quarter. Looking ahead, we're providing the financial guidance with the following assumptions for our pharmaceutical segment. There are a number of factors that will continue to impact our gross profit share payments from Pfizer, including revenue from product sales from Gina troponin in general, global sales of Genotropin for the first quarter of 2024, as reported by Pfizer were 130 million, and Pfizer has not separately reported sales of Java. However, we have continued to observe consistent prescription growth globally for in general, as reported by IQVIA and Symphony. After adjusting for the expected accounting impact for the improved gross margins associated with the increased manufacturing scale of in general, we have revised our estimated gross profit share to be between 30 and 40 million versus our previous estimate of estimate of 40 to 50 million. We also assume a stable foreign exchange rate for our US ex U.S. pharmaceutical businesses, which will allow for continued profitable growth. R&d expenses for the second quarter of 2024 will really reflect higher activities related to our modem programs, including CMC and efforts to related to the initiation of our first immuno-oncology clinical trial. A portion of these increased activities will continue to be funded through our Varda agreement for our Diagnostics segment. As the timing of our closing for our LabCorp transaction is not yet certain subject to FTC review. We have not adjusted our guidance to remove this business from our second quarter estimates as we've outlined, we're working to align the business to achieve cash flow breakeven run rate by the middle of 2024 and profitability run rate by the end of the year, which are both subject to the timing of closing of our LabCorp transaction. This work continues to include consolidating our geographic footprint and rationalizing our testing offerings. As we expect our client mix to improve as our cost structure and our cost structure to appropriately support our go-forward strategy. During this transition phase, we expect consistent core testing volumes with a slight increase in the average price per patient collection amounts due to our revenue cycle management initiatives before considering any nonrecurring costs that may result from our restructuring activities and other nonrecurring expenses. We expect our costs and expense in Q2 to decline by approximately $5 million to approximately 154 to 157 million without giving effect to the approximately $35 million related to the assets as part of the LabCorp transaction. As a result, we expect the following for the second quarter of 2020 for total revenue between 180 to $187 million, revenue from services between 127 and $130 million, including 26 to $27 million from assets related to the LabCorp transaction. Revenue from product sales of 40 to $45 million and other revenue between 10 and 14 million including inclusive of the Pfizer gross profit share estimates, which are between seven and 10 million. We expect second quarter costs and expenses to be between 234 and 243 million. Again, excluding any nonrecurring expenses and expenses related to our restructuring of BioArray, it will also include approximately 20 to 26 million for R&D expense the range is based on the timing of certain CMC activities for our Mode X programs, as well as depreciation and amortization expense of 24 million. That concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your attention. And now, operator, let's open the call for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Maury Raycroft, Jefferies.', 'Maurice Raycroft', ""I am Thanks for taking my question. I was going to start with a question related to Bio-Reference. With the remaining Bio-Reference services business. It sounds like you plan to continue to streamline, optimize and grow that business with aim to get to profitability once the LabCorp deal closes, will you be able to provide more clarity into timing for getting to breakeven and profitability? And what's the longer-term strategy for maximizing value for both the services and pharma parts of the Company from a local EquiFirst question."", 'Adam Logal', ""Maury, thanks for the question. So the timing for us getting to breakeven is going to be tied to the LabCorp transaction. And we're not we're certainly not waiting for that as it relates to the rest of the business, and we're actively working down our fixed cost base, we're exiting and surface certain facilities and currently and which will help bring our fixed overhead. We're also continuing to really realign No. Our stated goal was to have no plans that would be executing to have us to run-rate cash cash flow breakeven midyear. I think we're still we're still working towards that. And obviously, if the FTC takes longer than expected them, then that could that could take longer. But otherwise and that's the path we're on."", 'Maurice Raycroft', 'Got it. Understood. And then for in general on, can you provide any more perspective or or clarity into the revised guidance there and the change in gross profit there?', 'Adam Logal', ""Sure. So overall, we've seen in general, the demand continue to be strong on a global basis where Pfizer has been in the market, the longest, obviously, it's continued to do to do the best. Really the change to guidance has to do with the accounting consequence of their of their revaluing some inventory they had on books and that flows through our gross profit share. And that has no reflection on the strength of the program just on the timing of when we're going to realize the benefits of of that improved gross gross margin that's coming from their scale-up data and understand and and maybe one question just on some of the Medex clinical assets. If there are specific catalysts this year that we should be focused on, in particular for two users or one moving into the clinic on. I don't know if there's anything more you can say about that study and when we could see initial data from."", 'Elias Zerhouni', ""I'll let Gary was underlined the CEO of Monex answer that specific question, Eric?"", 'Yvonne Briggs', ""Yes, we you know, as analysts and Phil mentioned, we have the green light to go. So we're at the moment setting up sites and are really looking to bring patients into the trial. I think the as Elliot said in his comments, we're hopeful this should happen by the end of the quarter, and we're working to make it happen sooner if possible, in terms of any clinical results, you know, as you probably know with whenever you're taking a new immune therapy into the clinic, have you started a low dose and you dose escalate really for safety reasons. And that's a plan that we've come to Kraft with the FDA. So I wouldn't be expecting to see any data on CERTAINLY efficacy know, at least for you and probably next year is the time frame and which you might expect to see some type have results."", 'Elias Zerhouni', 'Okay, understood.', 'Adam Logal', 'Thanks for taking my questions. Out back in the queue. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'And the next question comes from Carl with Ladenburg Thalmann at this stage to take your questions and good afternoon, a few from our end on. I was wondering if you could talk about in general and to keep paying for the additional studies as far as the couple of expanded label? So I mentioned is our closure or yourself.', 'Adam Logal', ""So the way our partnership works for those additional indications is we'll split the cost 50 50 with Pfizer, but we're not to the adult."", 'Elias Zerhouni', ""We're not necessarily expecting any additional studies, so just be their pediatric basket."", 'Phillip Frost', 'Okay, got it.', 'Elias Zerhouni', 'And for full year 24, what should we anticipate from Barda reimbursement?', 'Adam Logal', ""I know you called out 2.2 in the first quarter, should we extrapolate that and we would expect that to continue to ramp ramp up, Jeff. So that's part of the reason why the the R&D numbers going up, they're getting ready to do some some CMC activities, which will bump that number up. And just as a reminder, there's it was $2.2 million on the revenue line, the expense line is slightly less than that."", 'Phillip Frost', 'Okay.', 'Adam Logal', 'Got it.', 'Elias Zerhouni', ""That makes sense. And Adam, can you just clarify on the on the cash and debt, so it was 75.6 cash and to 30 plus 71 one on the debt side. That's right, Rio on both Henry and the on anticipated LabCorp closure, you're expecting by end of year, it sounds like back half and that will be till we have the gross number rises to 37 days off. Yes."", 'Adam Logal', 'I mean, the large unknown on the timing is just FTC. So once we clear the FTC, assuming we clear, the FTC will be working quickly with RailCorp the transaction.', 'Phillip Frost', 'Okay.', 'Yvonne Briggs', 'Got it.', 'Phillip Frost', ""You're feeling optimistic on the back half of the year."", 'Adam Logal', ""That's our expectation."", 'Phillip Frost', 'Okay.', 'Elias Zerhouni', 'And then on the fee, that those are also thanks for taking the questions.', 'Operator', 'Edward Tenthoff, Piper Sandler.', 'Edward Tenthoff', 'Okay.', 'Adam Logal', ""Thank you for taking my question to first, just a quick one on you had mentioned cost guidance for the second quarter of 2004 to 2 and I was writing furiously, but I didn't get the number to 43.7 to 43 or 34 to 34 to $0.43. Okay, great. Super helpful. And then just kind of a higher-level question appreciating on what Gary analysts are saying about and the more multi-specific antibody giving moving from. I think a first one is for hematologic cancers. If I'm not, we've taken orders up for solid tumors and at a higher level, what do you ultimately expect to do with these different modality assets of the 700 partner. Could that be further partner? Should we expect more partnerships like from Merck EVV. deal on? Do you expect to keep the cancer stop and generate some clinical data next year."", 'Elias Zerhouni', ""Higher-level commentary on sort of what software and I think what I have been on we have is that forgive the background noise. I think it's a solid tumor molecule that we're planning on entering into the clinic this quarter space, we do have a liquid tumor, a molecule, which we're actually discussing with several parties who are interested. I think in the grand scheme of things, we are interested, but we have a platform to bring it to actually two platforms the vaccine once they have a multi-specific model and we are eliciting a lot of interest. We are interested in partnering and especially in research collaboration that will be funded by third parties where we could develop more targets to enter a larger portion of the market than what we could afford on our own. So we wanted to leverage the platform was the ability for us to through results through the results we've already had with the EBV with the Phase one trispecific data. And hopefully with this one I think is going to generate momentum, our collaborations with partners and licensing that I think will increase our bandwidth. And I'll stop here. And Gary, if you have a lot to say on that on."", 'Yvonne Briggs', ""Yes, I think you said it well, Elliot, say a tad bit tricky. We're open to whatever makes sense in terms of advancing these products to approval and getting them to patients. I think and the advantage of having a platform is that we can take individual products and partner them with third parties, and then we can reserve some that they have higher value and your path forward for commercialization. We can take some of those into play as well."", 'Adam Logal', ""So at the end of the day, I would I suspect it will probably partner more and we will develop internally, but we're very open to collaborate so I think that makes a lot of sense to when you think about all the different arm factors and agents that you can engineer into the multi-specific antibody, you know, a big oncology group who really is doing that. You know, multiplex combinatorial analysis makes a lot of sense, a lot for you guys doing around. So I think you'd really be able to empower some of the bigger players who are looking at ways to combine these different mechanisms. So I really appreciate what you're saying about the partnering potential for that platform."", 'Elias Zerhouni', 'Thank you, sorry.', 'Adam Logal', 'Thank you. And the next question comes from Yale Jen with Laidlaw. Good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions. I two questions. There are regard to the motor a product to enter the clinic soon. First one is for the EBV virus, a vaccine.', 'Yvonne Briggs', ""And my question is there's also a competitor of what they're now also developing on the vaccine against the same target. So my question is that at least on theoretical grounds, how do you compare yours to that?"", 'Elias Zerhouni', ""But there are notes. And I have a follow-up question to you for the answers to both of them then were better. But I'll let Gary give you the specifics."", 'Adam Logal', ""I'm just kidding."", 'Yvonne Briggs', ""The fun. Well, you know, just to take a step back, my journey actually is delivering through mRNA almost the same gene products that we have managed to engineer onto the ferrets and nanoparticle, I'd say for the good of the patients it's actually a good thing to have more than one product out there being tested because one never knows how they will perform in the real world. I think what we like about our platform is the fact that it's a protein platform and we're using adjuvants that are well described with a safety profile that looks favorable in humans. The preclinical data in nonhuman primates and in our animal models is very strong. And so we're following a pretty well prescribed path with a nice set of ImmunoGen's where you know, I think we could and with great biomarkers when you're looking at and you of the viral loads and immune responses to the virus. So we feel pretty good about our products. I really don't want to get into the details of the alternative program. But what I will just say is the obvious, which is that they're using a different platform, they're using an mRNA platform that has some advantages in terms of going fast, but it has some unknowns, particularly with regard to side effects of the therapy and know as you begin to treat more and more patients with the vaccine, those issues become more and more important. And so there's no way to go on or gain or to have a crystal ball about which will work better I can. But we feel pretty good about the platform that we have and the partnership with Merck, where they have a real deep bench of the experts and knowledge for how to expand the trials and how to expand the reach of this vaccine to what we would ultimately like to address, which is the <unk>, is it the cause of cancer or the cancer on aspect of vaccine. So that I think that's the best I can do for you right now. Okay."", 'Adam Logal', ""Great. That's very helpful. That's a lot of details here. It's one well, in terms of the two zero zero one is any could you give us some detail about the study design may be what are the targets P being pursued by design Flowcast type target? Yes."", 'Yvonne Briggs', ""Yes, we we haven't formally disclosed the targets, but we will disclose them in the near future, probably within the next few weeks as we mine up to on enroll our first patient. But what I can tell you is that we've picked two on cell surface markers that are found on a number of solid tumors. There actually is a list of about 13 malignancies. They express these two antigens and they include lung, breast, prostate, pancreatic and the list goes on there. And there's of a fairly large number be tested. And we will in the initial stages, look at a variety of those tumor types, and we'll be looking for signs of some on tumor type where we might be seeing more efficacy. And then with time, if that bears out, we'll focus more on the tumor types where we're seeing efficacy and expand the trials in and those tumor types. Okay. Great."", 'Adam Logal', ""That's very helpful and congrats to move this program of the Group."", 'Yvonne Briggs', ""Thank you. We're very excited to see it get to patients. Yes."", 'Operator', 'And the next question comes from Yi Chen with H.C.', 'Yi Chen', 'Thank you for taking my questions.', 'Elias Zerhouni', 'Just to follow up on that and the X. 2001 of the solid Phase one solid tumor trial is a all-comer solid tumor trial, correct in how many patients do intend enroll grow for this trial?', 'Yvonne Briggs', ""On the IT, the trial is broken into two parts. So we have the Phase 1a and then a Phase Ib, I'd say in the Phase Ia will be the by the group where we will look at multiple different types. And then add after that point, we will begin to drill down on the ones where there's more activity, we expect to be able to make some decisions with approximately 40 or so patients in the first. Then that includes some dose escalation because we have to go slowly and on and we will do that again and agnostic to the tumor type. And then when we reach what we think we'll be close to a therapeutic level, assuming we don't see any side effects that would preclude further expansion than we would. I treat the large number."", 'Elias Zerhouni', ""And just to clarify, did you say that the results from the Phase one trial won't be available until 2026?"", 'Yvonne Briggs', ""I didn't really say that look when they would be available because I said probably not before next year's when I said earlier, and I I would stand by that. It does take a while to, you know, get to the point where you think you're in a therapeutic dose and then you have to enroll sufficient patients and then you have to follow them for a period of time. So expecting to see even early efficacy data, we certainly will have safety data, I think before the end of this year, that tells us what what doses and how well tolerated it is and patients. But I don't expect that we'll begin to start seeing signals and until well into next year."", 'Adam Logal', 'Got it.', 'Elias Zerhouni', 'And could you give us some idea of that? How many oncology candidates you intend you bring into clinical stage of development before the end 2020.', 'Yvonne Briggs', 'And I would say that we have it will be in the range of two to four. I think very likely there will be two that will be into the clinic by next year, then depending on some partnerships on what we may have opportunities to advance another two.', 'Adam Logal', 'Okay.', 'Elias Zerhouni', 'And for partnerships, is it is it likely that you will need to generate Phase two level proof of concept data to materialize partnerships here?', 'Yvonne Briggs', ""You know, I think that's the earliest you'd like to respond."", 'Elias Zerhouni', ""No, no, I wanted to just clarify that is very different in oncology is another area in oncology is our litigation. And so you don't need Phase two data to generate a partnership you need to have a basket trial and some demonstrable results in the Phase 1a and 1b beginning of two, which you don't need to do what you need to do in other areas as well. And I'm clear because Phase two to retract a major and a partner, we'd like to be a strategic buyer has gone down from. I don't know if you agree with that one."", 'Yvonne Briggs', ""And then I very much agree. I think that often in oncology you can begin to see signals in Phase one. And then it's in instances where you don't really just depends on the appetite of the partner and of our internal teams in terms of the you know, at what point we really want to make those transitions So I'd say the safe answer is somewhere between Phase one and Phase two data."", 'Operator', 'Mike Petusky, Barrington Research.', 'Mike Petusky', ""It's what I just wanted to ask about the few months away. Yes, we think we've got some data. We've got some evidence. Yes, low CKD progression. And I'm just curious, are your sales folks able to share this data, this evidence with nephrologists? Are there any anecdotal reactions that, hey, this is really compelling this name really matter. I mean, can you just give a sense of if there if there's if there's any sense this could really unlock this product going forward?"", 'Elias Zerhouni', ""Things haven't certainly I can expand on that. I mean, it's true that the data that we generated this year was very telling us from real-world evidence as well as from our own data. You could delay the onset of the dialysis by six months was not normal. Now in terms of the reception of that, with publishing obviously presented to KOLs and nephrologists, it really makes a difference because no other therapy of secondary hyperparathyroidism has shown the ability to introduce. And it shows also we have the biomarkers that really indicate which patients are the ones that I really welcome the Rayaldee to delay the onset of dialysis would realistically for etc. So the ask the sales force is out there yet for asthma. It's really talking to the early for the holidays. You see a lot of those late-stage CKD that are not likely to go into dialysis, but we also think is valid for CKD three patients. No, just for So great story and evolution. I think it reinforces the point that treating secondary hyperparathyroidism depression. And it does have an impact on the evolution of the disease, which was one of the questions we always had was a change outcomes and this is the answer that we announced so far and the data has been revenues and that's going to be. My next question comes from Matt Duncan."", 'Adam Logal', ""I have a follow up to that in terms of, okay, you get the to get the data published and you start talking to docs about this. I mean, how long how long you don't think fixed subtypes seem to move much slower than they things logically seem like they should in terms of changing behavior of prescribing behavior. Is this the kind of thing that, hey, it's still a good one. It's really good missionary effort a matter of years rather than quarters or two to really change behavior or if they are currently in businesses that I would like to."", 'Elias Zerhouni', ""Thank you. Absolutely. Are the right questions. I mean, if you know medicine medicine patterns among clinical guidelines take time to develop, I mean, you're talking about a year or two before they are going to make it to the guidelines. Like I mean, Rayaldee is in the guidelines now. So it's not a rapid process depending on the strength and the reception of the community of the files, you suggest that it may be faster or slower, but it's not a matter of a quarter or two. It will take time to develop All right."", 'Adam Logal', 'Very good. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And this concludes the question and answer session. And I would like to turn the floor back to Dr. Phillip Frost for any closing thoughts.', 'Phillip Frost', 'I just wanted to thank everybody for participating and for your very good questions and discussion.

Well, thanks, Danilo, and thank you all for joining us today. Well, another first quarter and another strong start for Williams. So let me begin here on Slide 2 by calling out a few operational financial and strategic achievements we saw this first quarter. Starting here on the left of this slide, Yet again, we've set a record for contracted transmission capacity led by Transco, the largest and fastest-growing natural gas pipeline. And in January, we closed on our acquisition of a portfolio of Natural Gas Storage assets from an affiliate of Hartree partners for approximately $1.9 billion. The transaction included 6 underground natural gas storage facilities located in Louisiana and Mississippi, making us the largest owner of storage on the Gulf Coast. Demand for natural gas has greatly outpaced natural gas storage capacity since 2010. And our thesis of this underinvestment is now being realized as this newly acquired storage is being re-contracted at rates above our acquisition expectations. In fact, storage rates have reached the point of supporting Brownfield expansions, and we are gauging interest from customers willing to underwrite potential expansion of these facilities in the form of long-term contracts. Also in the first quarter, we announced the expansion of the Southeast Supply Enhancement project to roughly 1.6 Bcf a day of capacity, and we prefiled this project with the FERC on February 1. We expect to make the official FERC filing later this year. And I'll remind you that this project will serve both the Mid-Atlantic and the Southeast markets. These markets are experiencing increasing gas demand from power generation and the reshoring of industrial loads. Since the time of our open season, the large utilities that we serve in this area have come back and provided dramatic increases to their generation needs based on data centers to be built in the region, as well as reshoring of industrial markets. So we believe that we are in the early innings for expansions in these Mid-Atlantic and Southeast markets. Our project execution teams also delivered an impressive list of accomplishments this quarter. In total, we have 20 high-return projects in execution across our business, including approximately 3.1 Bcf per day of expansion on Transco, which equates to a 15% increase in fully contracted long-term capacity that will be coming online over the next few years. Within these Transco opportunities, a few noteworthy accomplishments to hit. First, we placed the Carolina Market Link in service and now began receiving the full revenues in this quarter. Next, we commenced construction for the Southside Reliability Enhancement and the Southeast Energy Connector projects, and we received the FERC order for the Alabama-Georgia Connector and the Texas to Louisiana Energy Pathway projects. And finally, we're advancing a number of modest but high-return expansion projects on our MountainWest Transmission System.This is a period where we have a tremendous amount of large projects and sometimes it's easy to overlook things as large as even the well deepwater project but happy to report to you that great execution by our teams there in some pretty difficult environments has that project coming in quite a bit below our original capital estimate on that project, and we do expect now this project to start up towards the end of this year. So congratulations to our deepwater team that have been working on that project for about 4 years now, and pretty remarkable accomplishments to get that project in on budget and actually below budget. And then finally, our teams are well on their way to replacing 112 mainline compressor units with state-of-the-art low-emission turbines and electric drive units on Transco and Northwest Pipe. As a reminder, these projects will generate an incremental regulated return realized through a rate case or a traction mechanism that will begin in 2025. So again, a huge body of work there to go in and replace this compression that is well past its useful life, but the team is doing a great job. You can imagine the efforts that go into replacing that scale of operations. But we have so much going on. It's kind of easy to miss. So and we're excited to see the earnings from that show up in '25. So now turning to the highlights of our first quarter financial performance. We delivered quarterly EBITDA of $1.934 billion, which was 8% higher than last year, an impressive feat given the tough comp we were up against and the 25% year-over-year decline in natural gas prices and the lack of severe winter weather in most of our markets. An important takeaway from the quarter is that our outperformance occurred despite year-over-year lower earnings in the marketing and upstream segments, which reaffirms the strength and resilience of our underlying business, no matter the commodity price environment. To this end, we expect to deliver our EBITDA in the top half of our earlier guidance.And to be clear, we think we can accomplish this with continued soft gas prices and without any further earnings contributions from our Marketing segment. Due to the ongoing steady growth and resilience of our business, we recently raised the 2024 dividend by 6.1% underscoring our confidence in our ability to continue this strong record of per share growth through even extreme low commodity price environments and with the slate of high-return growth projects under execution right now and in development. Williams remains well positioned to grow at this rate for many years to come. And with that, I'll turn it over to John to walk through the quarter and year-to-date financials. John?"", 'John D. Porter', ""All right. Thanks, Alan. Starting here on Slide 3 with a summary of our year-over-year financial performance. Beginning with adjusted EBITDA, we saw an 8% year-over-year increase despite natural gas prices that averaged less than $2 for the first quarter of 2024. Now included in that 8% overall growth is almost 13% growth from our primarily fee-based infrastructure businesses, excluding marketing and the upstream JV. As we'll see on the next slide, our adjusted EBITDA growth was driven by strong growth from our core large-scale Natural Gas Transmission, Gathering and Processing and Storage businesses, including the expected favorable effects of our recent acquisitions. And it also included strong performance from our Sequent Marketing business, which had another strong start to the year despite falling a bit short of the extraordinary start they had to 2023. Our adjusted EPS increased 5% for the quarter, continuing to grow off of the 19% ,5-year CAGR we've had for EPS for 2018 through 2023. And available funds from operations growth was just over 4%. Also, you see our dividend coverage based on AFFO was a very strong 2.6x on a dividend that grew 6.1% over the prior year. And our debt to adjusted EBITDA was 3.79x in line with our expectations for slightly higher leverage in 2024 before dropping back down in 2025 to guidance of 3.6x. So before we move to the next slide and dig a little deeper into our adjusted EBITDA growth for the quarter.We'll provide a few updates to our financial guidance. Overall, based on our strong start to 2024, we are now guiding to the upper half of our 2024 adjusted EBITDA range of $6.95 billion to $7.1 billion and we are also well positioned for upside to drive towards the high end of this original guidance. We also remain well positioned to deliver on our 2025 adjusted EBITDA range of $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion. Additionally, based on our improved adjusted EBITDA outlook and other changes, including interest expense and income assumption shifts, we now see our key per share metrics, adjusted EPS and AFFO per share coming in at the high end of their ranges for 2024, which in the case of AFFO per share would lead to a higher overall dividend coverage ratio as well. Now specifically for 2024, our transmission in Gulf of Mexico business is tracking a bit ahead of plan with a good first quarter and expectations of continued best-in-class execution on our many key high-returning organic projects, as well as immediate results from our Gulf Coast storage acquisition with strong performance expected going forward.Our Northeast Gathering and Processing business was basically right on plan for first quarter with drilling in the higher-margin wet gas areas and inflation adjusters offsetting lower volumes in some dry gas areas. The West got off to a strong start in the first quarter, where DJ performance following our recent transactions along with all the hard work our teams did in preparing for winter allowed for excellent execution, especially across our Rocky's assets. We see the West also tracking a bit ahead of plan, although we're also embedding a bit more conservatism around Haynesville volume assumptions. For both the Northeast and West G&P assets, our guidance update today provides room for additional volume reductions and for upside movement toward the higher end of the range if those don't occur. For the Marketing business, we've had a strong overall start to 2024. But again, beating the midpoint of our full year 2024 guidance doesn't rely on any additional help from Sequent at this point. And then finally, nice to see our upstream joint ventures off to a strong start versus our plan, again, supported by the preparation our team made for winter weather. So we expect our upstream joint ventures to perform well against their plan this year as well. So let's turn to the next slide and take a little closer look at the first quarter results. Again, it was a strong start to the year with 8% growth over the prior year.Walking now from last year's $1.795 billion to this year's record $1.934 billion, we start with our Transmission in Gulf of Mexico business, which improved $111 million or 15% due to the combined effects of nearly a full quarter contribution from the Hartree Gulf Coast Storage acquisition, which is delivering as expected, following a flawless integration effort thus far. Higher Transco revenues, including partial and service from the Regional Energy Access project, and also a full quarter contribution from the MountainWest Pipeline acquisition, which closed mid-February in 2023. The Segment growth was unfavorably impacted by last year's Bayou Ethane divestiture and also some planned maintenance at Discovery. Our Northeast G&P business performed well with the $34 million or 7% increase driven by a $22 million increase in service revenues. This revenue increase was fueled by rate escalations that occurred after the first quarter of last year. Overall Northeast Gathering volumes performed roughly in line with our plan, down about 2% versus the prior year, with those decreases focused in the dry gas areas. Shifting now to the West, which increased $42 million or 15%, benefiting from a great start for the DJ transactions we completed in the fourth quarter of 2023.Now the increase in the DJ Basin results was about the same magnitude as the unfavorable loss of hedge gains that we had in the first quarter of 2023. Additionally, last year, the West was significantly unfavorably impacted by the severe Wyoming weather and January processing economics at our Opal, Wyoming processing plant. As I mentioned a moment ago, much work was done by our teams to prepare for winter weather this year, and those preparations proved effective in getting us off to a great start for the West and also for our upstream operations in Wyoming. Overall, West gathering volumes performed roughly in line with our plan, up 5% on the benefits of our DJ transaction and better Wyoming volumes, which more than offset declines primarily in the Haynesville area. And then you see the $41 million or 18% decrease in our Gas and NGL marketing business. As I mentioned a moment ago, it was another strong start to the year, but it did come up a bit short of the extraordinary 2023 start. Our upstream joint venture operations included in our Other segment were down about $9 million or 15% from last year. Our Wamsutter upstream EBITDA was actually up about $8 million with strong volume growth that was substantially offset by lower net realized prices. However, the Wamsutter increase was more than offset by lower Haynesville results from both lower net production volumes and net realized prices. So again, a strong start to 2024 with 8% growth in EBITDA, driven by core infrastructure business performance with continued strength from our marketing business.And with that, I'll turn it back to Alan."", 'Alan S. Armstrong', ""Okay. Thanks, John. And so just a few closing remarks before we turn it over to your questions. First of all, natural gas demand is not just growing now, it is accelerating. This period of low natural gas prices is reaffirming the great bargain that natural gas offers as a practical low-cost, clean energy solution and the power hungry world we live in is rapid turning to natural gas to generate this power. This compounded with the hard to miss growth in LNG exports and data centers as well as the continued drumbeat of electrify everything and resort it is accelerating demand and the expansions of our uniquely placed infrastructure will demand a premium. We have been betting on and setting our strategy around the benefits of natural gas for many years and have focused our investments in this space. So if you want to invest in natural gas infrastructure, no one is more concentrated than Williams. We are the most natural gas-centric large-scale midstream company around today, and our natural gas-focused strategy will be relevant for decades to come, thanks to the accelerating natural gas demand we are seeing today. Our strong conviction of the strategy led us to the bolt-on acquisitions of strategic assets like MountainWest Pipeline, Hartree Storage and NorTex Storage. A couple of points on these acquisitions. First, these deals were quickly -- sorry, these deals were directly in line with our strategy based on where we thought the puck was going. The synergies and commercial opportunities we expected are already being realized, thanks to clear plans and decisive actions. And finally, I'll reiterate our belief that Williams remains a compelling investment opportunity. Our conservative but distinct strategy continues to deliver steady, predictable growth and value to our shareholders and checks all the boxes that a long-term investor looks for in a durable and winning portfolio. We've now seen 11 consecutive years of adjusted EBITDA growth and an 8% CAGR of adjusted EBITDA since 2018 and I'll remind you that, that is without issuing equity to drive this growth. In addition, we have recognized a 19.5% return on our invested capital during the same period, and our steadfast project execution has led to record contracted transmission capacity and will continue to drive growth in 2024 and beyond. On the predictability front, we have met or beat analyst estimates for 33 quarters in a row now and beat the estimate 2/3 of the time over this 8-year period. And this year marks the 50th year in a row that The Williams Companies has paid a dividend. In closing, we've built a business that is delivering record profitability and strong financial returns in the present, but is positioned even better for the future. And with that, I'll open it up for your questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Spiro Dounis with Citi.', 'Spiro Michael Dounis', ""First one, maybe to start with the guidance, two-part question there. So John, you'd mentioned leaving room for some volume reductions from here. Curious if you could provide a little more detail there and how to think about maybe the cadence as we go throughout '24? And just given that you've left '25 EBITDA unchanged. Sounds like maybe '25 also contemplates some slower activity levels. So just curious to kind of get some confirmation around that?"", 'John D. Porter', ""Yes, I'll start and then Micheal can chime in as well. But yes, I think, overall, we are being cautious, obviously, with where natural gas prices are and especially during the shoulder months. So we started off with a plan that I think embedded a fair amount of cautious, I think, caution, and I think since then, we've taken a little bit more caution just given where things finished from the time that we were at Analyst Day, which was really mid-winter to where we finished the year. So hopefully, we will actually experience some upside relative to these assumptions, but we are going into the rest of the year with quite a bit of caution, especially around the dry gas areas."", 'Micheal G. Dunn', ""Yes. This is Micheal. I can add to that. Obviously, we talk to our producer customers quite often about their plans and they're shifting, obviously, back and forth, depending on where prices are. We feel really comfortable where we've had predicted our results to occur in the second half of the year here with our guidance -- confident. Based on the volume expectations that we have coming from the customers. And so just as a reminder, and I always say this, we have a lot of diversity across geography, customers and rich gas as well as dry gas. And obviously, that benefits us and having that diversity and so we're still seeing some activity on the rich gas side, it's benefiting not only our gathering but our processing business in the Northeast. And as I said, we feel confident about the volumes that we have embedded within our going-forward plans here in 2024."", 'Spiro Michael Dounis', ""Great. Appreciate the color there. Second question, maybe going to data centers. Alan, your credit, you've been talking about data center demand for a few quarters now. It seems to be a bit more mainstream to say the least at this point. So curious to maybe get your updated thoughts on how you're thinking about that data center demand going forward? And really what I'd love to know more about is when do you think we start to see tangible sort of commercial discussions start to take place and filter through?"", 'Alan S. Armstrong', ""Yes. Great question, Spiro. And I do think that this is one that will grow over time. Each individual data center isn't going to show up as a big pool and demand given the size and scale of most of these big transmission systems. So it is going to be the collective amount of data centers in these markets that's going to show up. But there certainly is a lot of fury going on right now, I would say, both with our utility customers. And we certainly are working closely with them to make sure that we can serve their needs and the growth in their needs. I would tell you that it's broader than even though data centers and AI gets all the hype, it's actually broader than that in terms of a lot of reshoring of industrial loads that is occurring as well. And part of that is because natural gas is so low cost here. If you think about the rest of the world and the energy cost expanding in the rest of the world and the U.S. sitting here on such a great resource of low-cost energy, it is reshoring industrial loads as well. And so I would say it's a combination of those things that tends to center around low-cost power. So I would just say, first of all, this isn't going to be a one-and-done kind of issue, it's not going to happen maybe as quick as some people are expecting, but -- because it does take a long-term planning to be able to serve the kind of ultimate loads that we're talking to our customers about. But I do think it is going to be very sizable and very impactful. I just don't think it's going to happen quite as quick as a lot of people think it will, just because a lot of these areas, we are constrained on infrastructure. And so it's going to take some time and planning to be able to address that. But we are looking at it both with our customers, and we are also looking in terms of both direct serve as well, where all of the combinations of low-cost gas, land and communication capacity all come together. So I would tell you, we, as Williams, are working very hard. It's a very high priority for us to make sure that we don't let any of these opportunities slip by us, and we've got a great team assembled that's working on that."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.', 'Jeremy Bryan Tonet', 'Just want to dive a bit further into the natural gas market, if I could. It appears a bit oversupplied at this point in time. And just wondering any thoughts you could share, I guess, in how you see supply-demand balancing over the course of this year and into 2025 and I guess how that might impact Williams trajectory at that point?', 'Alan S. Armstrong', ""Yes. Great question, Jeremy. I firmly agree with the notion that the market is oversupplied right now. And it's kind of a unique time because we've had the market in such strong contango here for quite some period. Putting a lot of value on our Storage. I would tell you we feel very fortunate to have bought the storage that we bought in the time frame that we bought and to pick up the contracts that Sequent had on storage as well. So a lot of in the money business around the storage business because of the strong contango. But that strong contango is also keeping rigs running that might not otherwise be running right now. And I think that's adding to the oversupply situation. But we certainly are starting to see producers respond to that. And we're also starting to see the demand side respond to that as well. And I think we'll see more of that this summer, and the market always finds a way to balance itself with low enough prices. But it's definitely oversupplied right now. And I do think that once the demand materializes that we would expect in -- starting in mid-'25, I do think that we're going to start to see a big call on gas that will last for years to come. So it is going to be a period though of people having to be patient and waiting on the market. And it's going to take some turn back, if you will, here in the short term, but I think people are appropriately looking to the future. And it is -- the future is pretty clear and pretty transparent when we think about LNG demand, and we think about incremental demand from our customers on both power -- traditional power generation is maybe as well as direct power generation as well. So short term, we're oversupplied. That's causing a lot of contango in the market. But I think that contango is well-founded because there's such a transparent and clear picture of demand for the future."", 'Jeremy Bryan Tonet', 'Got it. And then I just want to pivot over to LEG and I was wondering if you could provide any updates on project progress at this point given litigation other items in play? And any thoughts, I guess, on Basins in Southern Louisiana just given there seems to be a concern that, that could widen out without the infrastructure coming into service?', 'Micheal G. Dunn', ""Jeremy, this is Micheal. I'll take that. I'll start with a bit of a higher level in regard to pipeline crossings and generally, we have almost 26,000 pipeline crossings in the U.S. that have been built over the last several decades, just under 2,200 of those are with energy transfer. And for the most part, those are all being done by our operators in the field unless you have some design issues that you've got to get your engineers involved with. But for the most part, each of our companies work that out in the field until most recently. So we've been challenged in Louisiana and some other states by Energy Transfer and our ability to cross their pipeline. And I would say the tide is turning now on the legal issues. We're seeing the appellate ruling from the Louisiana court that overturned, the lower court ruling in the DTM case. We certainly think that's going to be the same outcome that we'll have on our cases, ultimately, it certainly is troubling that we're having these difficulties with an industry peer. But ultimately, we're going to get our pipeline project built out of the Haynesville, there's definitely a need to move volumes to our gathering systems. To the demand centers in the Gulf Coast area and ultimately, we'll get through the legal process. We'll get through the FERC process, has now been initiated by Energy Transfer, certainly, this was a move that we expected Energy Transfer to do. And so it was anticipated, and that was established within our project schedule that I talked about at the Analyst Day. So we still expect the second half 2025 in service date. And just in closing, we filed permitted and installed more FERC regulated pipelines in the U.S. than any operator, over the last decade. We fully know well when a project is when it comes to either being a designated gathering line or when it should be FERC regulated. And we've taken that certainly into consideration in the formulation in the design of the LEG project. And ultimately, we'll get it built. And it's unfortunate that we're having these delays, but I'm very confident in our ability to finish this project as we've outlined in our most recent schedule. It's going to be needed. The growth in the LNG demand in the Gulf Coast is going to happen. We're certainly seeing the expectations of that occurring late this year and early 2025 when some of the new facilities are coming online. And so we're as I said, very confident about the project and looking forward to getting the legal issues behind us and getting on with construction."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Manav Gupta with UBS.', 'Manav Gupta', ""Congratulations on a very strong quarter. I only have one question. When we look at your 2025 guidance here, can you help us elaborate the growth CapEx, like key projects that you'll be looking to spend the money in 2025 to grow your EBITDA from '25 ahead? But can you help us identify some of those key projects that the good spending will be done on?"", 'John D. Porter', ""Yes, absolutely. So when we look at 2025, we've got really quite a bit of spend expected on the Louisiana Energy Gateway project that Micheal just referred to. So that would be in the category of gathering and processing expansions. And by far, the biggest in the gathering and processing area would be the Louisiana Energy Gateway pipeline project. We do have some new Energy Ventures investments that we're expecting to begin to spend some money on, including our first Carbon Capture and Sequestration project, which is at the terminus of the Louisiana Energy Gateway project. So it's related to that LEG project. But we also have some solar projects that we'll be investing in. We will have some of our contributions to our upstream JVs, those are typically smaller amounts of capital. But then finally, you can see the long list of transmission projects that we have on Transco and MountainWest that are still in execution. Obviously, we're wrapping up regional energy access this year, but you'll see many, many that will continue to have a spend going into 2025 as those reach their in-service dates in 2025. So that would be the main pieces of the growth capital for 2025."", 'Alan S. Armstrong', ""And Gupta, I would just add in terms of drivers for growth in '25. We have a number of large deepwater projects that we've already spent a majority of the capital, those will be coming on towards the end of this year and into next year. So we're really excited about the big step-up in deepwater growth and how well we're positioned out there for what we think is going to be a lot of continued growth in that area. So -- but in terms of drivers for growth, that's one additionally, drivers for growth would be the rate case on Transco. And so the benefit of all the money we're spending right now on the emission reduction projects will show up. The benefits of that will show up when we start charging our new rates in March of '25. So those are some of the other drivers for growth."", 'John D. Porter', ""Yes, I didn't do a great job of connecting that to growth. So thanks, Alan. Just specifically, we have 6 Transco growth projects that are in service between the second half of '24 and 2025, and 5 major Gulf of Mexico projects, that are in service as well as well as that Transco rate case that Alan mentioned. And -- but in many cases, those are projects where we've already spent the capital. Or in some of the cases of some of the deepwater projects, there were no capital requirements at all."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Praneeth Satish with Wells Fargo.', 'Praneeth Satish', ""Maybe let me start with a data center question here. So most of the expansions on Transco over the last few years have taking place in the Northeast. But if we start to see large AI data center build-out or even some of the reshoring that you talked about in other regions along Transco's path like the Southeast and that the bottleneck for more capacity shifts south on Transco. Just trying to think about how that impacts things. Is there more opportunity for maybe higher return compression expansions on the southeastern part of Transco or just more available capacity there? Or do you think expansions anywhere along Transco are kind of uniform in terms of return?"", 'Alan S. Armstrong', ""Yes. Good question. Yes, the first evidence of that, even though it really was before the data center load became quite so evident, is our Southeast supply enhancement project. We've announced that and now filed it in the first quarter for 1.6 Bcf a day, and that does serve both the Mid-Atlantic and the Southeast markets. Since that time, as I mentioned, those utilities have come out and said that they were missing their growth targets by many multiples. In fact, I think Southern companies came out and said they missed their original growth for power generation by 17 times. So lots going on in those markets. In terms of our abilities to serve those, we're extremely well positioned to serve that. Again, Southeast Supply Enhancement project is the first initial example of that, and that will serve projects along Transco to the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast, starting at Station-165, and we'll take advantage of supplies coming in from the Mountain Valley Pipeline at 165. In terms of the future, continued ability to expand along system and ability to restore pipeline pressures on systems that have been derated over time due to population encroachment in the areas. So lots of ways for us to expand along that existing capacity. And believe me, there is a lot of work going on right now with our teams and with our customers in those areas, figuring out the very best solutions to serve their growth needs in that area. And there's a lot going on in that front that we're not in a position to talk about yet. But a lot of -- a lot of expansion in that corridor. And again, Transco is extremely well positioned to serve that with the expansions of our existing systems."", 'Praneeth Satish', ""Got it. That's helpful. And then I just had a couple of questions here on the Washington Storage Transition to market-based on Transco. Can you just help frame maybe how much of an uplift you expect for moving that from -- to market base from, I guess, cost of service? How much difference in rates could you see there? And then how much of that capacity do you need to go through an open season now? And how much of that capacity do you think third parties could take versus Sequent? And then finally, is this shift to market-based rates and the upside is that reflected in 2025 EBITDA guidance at all?"", 'Alan S. Armstrong', 'Mike, do you want to take that?', 'Micheal G. Dunn', ""Yes, I'll take that. So yes, to answer your last question first, that is embedded in our guidance for 2025. So the process where it stands now. FERC has approved our settlement with the customers, the customers have a choice to take a tranche of capacity on a term that they so desired. So they're making that decision now between now and the end of May. So ultimately, they'll decide upon how long of a term they want and there's already a pre-determined rate for that was embedded within the settlement. And so once they make that decision, that will be effective as of April of 2025. So that's when those rates will go into effect. So we definitely embedded what our expectations are with where we think the customers will end up in regard to their choices of selection. Ultimately, we think that we fully subscribed by existing customers. It's a really good project for them. It's a great project for us. The storage is in high demand. We don't expect anybody to turn back any of that capacity at this time."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Gabriel Moreen with Mizuho.', 'Gabriel Philip Moreen', ""A quick one on your Gulf projects. I think there's been some talk about there about Shenandoah being delayed, maybe half a year plus or minus. Can you talk about whether you're potentially seeing that? Or whether that would impact project economics or would just demand fees kick in regardless?"", 'Alan S. Armstrong', ""Yes, Gabe, I would just say our part of that project is on schedule. We're not really at liberty to get into details of the contracting details in that. But remain confident in what we have in the forecast for that project. So anyway, we're not going to speak for the producer. Our part of that project and our work there is on time and team's doing a great job of executing on that, and we'll be ready to serve when we were supposed to be ready to serve on that project."", 'Gabriel Philip Moreen', ""Understood. And then maybe if I can just talk LNG a little bit. There's a stake in the facility LNG export facility under construction that I know you've looked at pretty hard over the course of time. Are you interested in potentially looking at that stake? And just how it may or may not fit into a broader LNG strategy that you may be pursuing over time?"", 'John D. Porter', 'Gabe, are you referring to Port Arthur?', 'Gabriel Philip Moreen', 'I am.', 'Unidentified Company Representative', 'Chad, do you want to take that?', 'Chad J. Zamarin', ""Yes. I think in general, we're focused on high-return projects that we operate -- we build and operate. And so we continue to look at how we can connect our customers to the most attractive markets. LNG markets are obviously an important destination for U.S. natural gas. And so we're going to continue to look for ways to connect our customers and our value chain to those international markets. But we've typically not been looking for non-operated positions in infrastructure projects. We've got so many opportunities to invest in our kind of organic projects, that's been our primary focus. But again, if we find opportunities that come with our ability to connect our customers to better markets, we'll look at them, but that's certainly not the primary focus of our LNG strategy."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Neel Mitra with Bank of America.', 'Indraneel Mitra', ""I had -- I wanted to follow up on the (inaudible) expansion in your conversations with your big three utility customers there. You had an interesting slide at the Analyst Day where you talked about those utilities having quotes about not recurring enough natural gas and kind of underestimating power. When they made those quotes in your conversations, did that reflect the AI team. So do you think that the project that you've contracted so far has some AI components in it? Or is it just general electrification so far that's being reflected in that demand?"", 'Alan S. Armstrong', ""Yes. To answer your question, our work on that in terms of developing that project, obviously, was even further ahead of when we announced that. And so you kind of have to remember that as you think about the timing of that. And to answer your question very simply, the degree -- the kind of incremental demand that we're talking about is not reflected in the (inaudible) project. There might have been some expectation for that. But in terms of the large incremental growth impacts that customers are now starting to reflect in their integrated resource plans. Those are somewhat, I wouldn't say perfectly incremental, but certainly, a big chunk of that is incremental to the load that we're serving on (inaudible)."", 'Indraneel Mitra', ""Okay. And then I wanted to follow up on some of your producer activity. I know one or more of your customers are delaying sales til gas prices get better. Do you have any updates on that? And then how do you factor that into '25 guidance if you just have a lower base going into '25 if those don't get turned in line?"", 'Alan S. Armstrong', ""Yes. Well, first of all, there's a lot of productive capability in these fields. And the ability to ramp that up and respond to the market. And I think the producers are managing their business in a way that they will be ready to respond to respond to it, as I mentioned in my comments earlier around gas supply demand balance, that's certainly what we're seeing is producers being willing and able to commit to what they need to on their end to be ready to respond to that. So I think there certainly will be some upside to our business in '25 as the market and supply start to respond to that. But it is typically a very long lag period and very difficult for the market to be able to respond quickly. I do think, however, this time, and I hate to be the guy calling it's different this time. But because there is such strong contango in the market right now, we are seeing a different response and a different positioning from our producers than we typically see in this situation. And again, I think that's because there's such confidence in both the fundamentals and the visibility to the forward market that's suggesting that that's how they should behave at this point."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Theresa Chen with Barclays.', 'Theresa Chen', ""Alan, I'd like to go back and touch on the comments of strong contango benefiting your storage assets. Can you give us a sense of what you're seeing in changes in storage rates as contracts come up for renewal? And is this largely due to the current contango? And as we come out of the contango, do you think these economics are durable?"", 'Alan S. Armstrong', ""Yes. Good question, Theresa. I'll give you my comments, and I'm going to ask Chad to give you a little more detail on that. But I think over time, we have seen the value of storage, and we've certainly seen it with our own Sequent operations. We've seen the value of storage in these volatile markets and markets that are having to respond very quickly to shifts in demand continuing. I think it's also pretty visible to see that both with an increase in renewable power on the market as well as more and more LNG as that comes on LNG is going to need to be a little more responsive. It's not going to run at 100% load factor when the LNG is more -- is closer to meeting the more mature demand from that market. So I think those are a lot of the drivers for the increase in storage capacity. As Micheal mentioned earlier, we certainly have seen a pretty strong response from our customers and making sure that they don't lose the benefits of the Washington storage facility and the flexibility of their business. And I think as the market turns to more and more hourly type service, and pipelines tighten up on the flexible services and no noted services that they previously offered. I think that's going to continue to put more and more pressure and more need for the storage business. And I think that's becoming pretty evident to the gas marketing business. In terms of contango driving the value, it's certainly one of the elements of value that is driving that. But I think it's a little broader than just the contango in terms of what's driving the pretty rapid increase in storage rates. And I'll let Chad talk a little more specifically about what we're seeing in rates."", 'Chad J. Zamarin', ""Yes. I think it's a really important theme to keep an eye on what both the ability to set up our infrastructure to benefit from volatility and price that supports extraction value. But also importantly, we're seeing the transition. We've been talking about it for a while, increased volatility in power markets, Alan talked about the power demand that we're seeing -- I mean we talk often -- I mean, PJM numbers themselves say that by 2040, peak demand will more than double. That's a significant -- from a set of infrastructure that's already full. And so assets like storage will not only be driven from a value perspective by dislocations in price over time, like the contango we're seeing in the current market, but we are seeing an evolution and a recognition that you're going to need those assets for reliability. Power -- produced power companies will need storage LNG companies. We're seeing much more variable demand coming in the future. And so not only will we be set up for storage to have value in the near term when there are price dislocations like we're seeing with the contango in the market, but we're also seeing an evolution of the market to recognize that storage value will increase even when there may not be apparent price dislocation, there will be a need for reliability in backup, both in supply and the ability to put gas into storage when upset conditions occur. So we're set up really well to benefit from both the value dislocations you see in the current market and the long-term fundamentals around the need for storage for reliability. So all that to be said, I don't think that the contango in the market is the only necessary driver for long-term storage value. We see long-term storage value both in markets where there are dislocations from a price perspective but also because of the long-term need for reliability and the important role that storage plays in providing reliability."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Tristan Richardson with Scotiabank.', 'Tristan James Richardson', ""Alan, just maybe switching back to the thematic for a moment. At the Analyst Day, you and some of your guest speakers talked a lot about sort of that general need for permitting reform and how critical gas supply is to power sort of this increased demand we're seeing in electricity. How critical is sort of permitting or form or at least a more amenable regulatory environment for energy supply to kind of meet this accelerating demand growth you guys have talked about today and the slide you talked about with sort of the 3x demand you're seeing over the next decade?"", 'Alan S. Armstrong', ""Yes. I would just say as the world turns off of coal, as the reliable baseload and is shifting more and more and more to natural gas as the base load, as Chad mentioned, that reliability issue is going to be really key and us continuing to stretch and deny the amount of capacity we really need in these markets, is going to become a louder and louder drumbeat. You're hearing it from the ISOs already. You're hearing it from -- starting to even hear from the utility commissions about how important it is that they have access to natural gas. You're even starting to hear it in places like Connecticut that are upset that they don't have low-priced gas into those markets because Governor Cuomo stopped a number of projects coming across the state. So it's unfortunate. It's kind of like sometimes it's a terrible situation as we think about long-term infrastructure and politics, but the two don't meet very well together, unfortunately. And sometimes the bridge has to fail to people to realize that we have to spend money on maintaining and keeping our bridges safe. And I would say similar situation on gas infrastructure. We are heavily under-invested in gas infrastructure right now in terms of keeping up with this growing need. The good news is, I think the screen is going to get pretty loud and it's not just going to be from the gas industry when the tech industry is really struggling to get adequate supplies for data centers and power, I think that both the utilities are going to get loud on this. I think the tech companies are going to get loud on this.And hopefully, it doesn't come to a catastrophe in some of the markets, but it's amazing to me how quickly people forget how close we got last -- this last winter, how close we got to losing parts of the Northwest markets due to a couple of very small failures on some of our competitors' pipeline serving into us that caused a shortage as well as distorted at one of the big storage facilities up there. So we've been able to manage. We've been able to keep the gas service on, but we really haven't experienced a situation in these big heavily populated areas where we've lost gas service because people, I think, tend to think just like losing your power and it just clickers off and comes back on. That's not the way gas service works. And it will be a pretty catastrophic event. So thank you for asking the question because we certainly try to make it clear that we've got to invest adequately in our infrastructure, and it is going to take permitting reform to do that. I would say we're hopeful that we're getting more and more the moderate left engaged on this issue and understanding how important this is for their constituents as well. So I do think we're making progress on it, but it is a very large issue if we hope to keep up with demand. We're going to have to get better at building out infrastructure here in the U.S."", 'Tristan James Richardson', 'Appreciate it. And then maybe, John, just a smaller one. You appreciate kind of laying out sort of some of the puts and takes in the (inaudible) segment year-over-year. But is there a number we can think of as what was the organic growth in the quarter? Just thinking about Hartree contributions as well as sort of a partial anniversary of MountainWest?', 'John D. Porter', ""Yes. I think we think the acquisitions as it relates to Hartree and MountainWest Pipeline have tracked very well to the announcements we made in terms of the valuation and the multiples that were involved there. So I think you can -- you can rely pretty much in terms of sizing those impacts as to the announcements we made at the time of the acquisition. Obviously, with MountainWest Pipeline that closed on Valentine's Day in 2023. So that kind of allows you to size the relative size of the uplift in '24 versus '23 for MountainWest Pipeline. With Hartree, it closed very early in the year. So we pretty much had a full quarter of Hartree. So I think that I would just say size those two pieces.It was a strong quarter for Transco. No doubt, they did have the nice uplift from partial and service of Regional Energy Access, but they had some good seasonal revenues as well. And we did mention a couple of things that work the other way though, the Bayou Ethane divestiture that we had last year, and I think we put some information out about that -- the size of that divestiture as well. And then we did have some planned downtime at Discovery, which was an impact as well."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from John Mackay with Goldman Sachs.', 'John Ross Mackay', ""Maybe to keep it in the gas demand policy front. You guys have also talked a lot about coal plant retirements on your footprint, you kind of framed up maybe an upside number at the Analyst Day earlier this year. Just be curious, any thoughts you can share on the recent EPA updates around power plant carbon emissions? And how that's playing into your forward view?"", 'Micheal G. Dunn', ""John, this is Micheal. Yes, obviously, we're watching that closely and the fact that these new gas-fired power plants have to have some kind of sequestration on them in the -- in the midterm, I would say, is certainly taken into consideration by the utilities that are building these plants. I think ultimately, we'll probably be tempering of that. That's my opinion that whenever you see the EPA power plan come out with a new rule, it's certainly subject to litigation as they happened several times now, and I suspect this one will be no different. But that will be a challenge, I think, for the industry to respond to a lot of that sequestration requirement in regard to these combined cycle power plants. I mean it's technology that is available but it is going to be expensive. It's going to be expensive for the end user and the consumers. And I certainly think utilities will take that into consideration in their plans. But we'll definitely see some coal plant retirements accelerating. And I think the rub there is, will they be able to meet demand with the acceleration of coal plant retirements with the AI boom that we're seeing. And I think that's going to be a big base in the boardrooms for the utilities to come."", 'Alan S. Armstrong', ""Yes. And I would just add to that, the issue around sequestration, if you think about how difficult it's been to build sequestration pipelines in South Dakota and Iowa, in serving those markets. And if you think that we're going to be able to take sequestration to a new level in areas where there isn't good underground resources for sequestration along the East Coast. And pipe that through heavily populated areas. I just think that is very unrealistic perspective right now. And so I think this is a place again where politics and the popular notion of politics and good old-fashioned hard physics are not matching up. And to have the Sierra Club fighting a CO2 pipeline in Iowa that's going to sequester carbon, is really, I think, a forewarning about the practical nature of being able to sequester large volumes of CO2 in these heavily populated areas."", 'John Ross Mackay', ""I appreciate all that. Maybe just zooming back in on you guys specifically quickly. Appreciate the frame up of the gas storage opportunity. At the very beginning, you mentioned the rates have come into making brownfield economics work. I guess I'd just be curious like, how much do you think you guys can add on a Bcf basis across your existing footprint from a Brownfield perspective?"", 'Alan S. Armstrong', ""Well, I mean, the fact is we have the right away through those areas. And so there's a very large number, but it's not as simple -- it's not a finite number by any stretch of imagination and it has its economic limits. And so said another way, it may not have its physical limits because we have the right of way through there, but it certainly has its economic limits. And so obviously, the easiest thing to do is to add compression in the area. And then next is replacing lines that are -- that we've had to derate over time."", 'Unidentified Company Representative', ""I think it's about storage."", 'Alan S. Armstrong', ""Sorry, on storage. Sorry, I thought we were back on Transco sorry about that. I'll let Chad take that forward."", 'Chad J. Zamarin', ""Yes, sorry. Just on storage. We do have quite a bit of capacity at the salt-cavern facilities that we acquired in the Gulf Coast. And so -- and those expansions that we're looking at would likely come in kind of 10 Bcf tranches at each facility. And there is a lot of capacity to expand. I think we're going to be thoughtful about how to do that incrementally as the market kind of recognizes the need. And we're seeing that evolution, but we need to see storage contracts shift from short term to long term for us to support that kind of infrastructure expansion. But it would look like kind of 10 Bcf cavern expansions at those salt-cavern facilities."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global.', 'Sunil K. Sibal', ""So I wanted to start off -- a little bit big picture question. So it seems like you're executing pretty well on the guidance, the '24 and '25. So I was curious if your actual performance comes out to be above the top end of your guidance ranges? What's the best incremental use of the cash flows in the current environment, especially if this permitting constraints continue?"", 'Alan S. Armstrong', ""Yes. Well, that is a great question and one that gets a lot of debate both and this team and within the boardroom as well. And it's a very astute question because if you look at the math, that starts to build on us pretty quickly, we saw the outlook -- positive outlook change coming from S&P on our Credit Rating. And so that we think will meet the conditions for that here through the balance of the year. So only so much more value, I would argue to be added in that regard. But I would say, certainly, our dividend policy is one lever, share buybacks, another and acquisitions of bolt-on transactions that have continued to add a lot of value and ones that we're really excited about the way our teams have performed on taking these assets and extremely quickly extracting the synergies that we expect out of them. And so we have been very purposeful about building the capabilities within the organization to be able to act quickly and decisively on those kind of bolt-on transactions. And so we'll keep our eyes on that. Certainly, we've seen -- so far, we've seen a lot of value that we can add by being the operator on those kind of assets to make them immediately accretive transactions. And so we'll sort of keep our eyes open for those kind of bolt-on, very tightly aligned with strategy acquisitions as well."", 'Sunil K. Sibal', 'And then in the Northeast, it seems like MVPs really start up pretty soon. And I was kind of curious in the current gas price environment, how do you think that impacts the producer reactions and then what kind of operating leverage you have in your systems to kind of benefit from that in the near term?', 'Alan S. Armstrong', ""Yes, great question. I think right now, as we sit here today. The power gen loads will be pretty strong this summer if the weather predictions that are out there are accurate right now. I think we'll see some pretty strong pools and that pipe and those gas supplies serve that will be capable of responding to that. And that's probably the extent of what we would see here in the immediate term for that, as our expansions that we're working on like the Southeast supply and expansion, system come on in the years ahead, that will start to take full advantage of those incremental supplies. And we'll see areas where we gather the volumes upstream on that benefit from that. But importantly, our ability to expand Transco is a lot lower cost and a lot higher margin for us if we have supply coming in there at 165. And so that's a huge positive for us to have high-pressure supplies coming into our system right there at 165. And so we'll see. I'm fairly confident we'll see some fairly significant additional expansions from 165 and take advantage of that on the Transco system."", 'Operator', 'This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn it back to Alan Armstrong for closing remarks.', 'Alan S. Armstrong', ""Okay. Well, thank you all very much. We're very excited to deliver another record at the company and not just for the quarter that it produced in terms of the present a lot of people are talking about what they're going to do in the future. We continue to deliver in the present. But we also have a very strong future ahead of us and are extremely well positioned for not just the next couple of years, but for the next decades, as we were contracting for these major expansions on our system. So very excited to see a strategy that we've stuck with for years now really coming home and all the benefits that we thought natural gas had to offer the market start to be realized by others and putting a lot of demand on our infrastructure. So very excited to see this turn here in the quarter and very thankful for all the extraordinary efforts of the employees and the leadership of this company and the management team that I get to work with for continuing to deliver such great results.

With that, I'll turn it over to Maurice."", 'Maurice Gallagher', ""Thank you, Sherry, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today on because you can see from our release, our results are not where we want them to be. Historically, our Q1 is one of our strongest quarters. Last year's 15% operating income showed the strength. If you look at our operations operationally, we ran the same airline this Q1 that we ran in 23 departures ASMs, passengers all were within 2% of each other fact, we've had minimal growth since 2021, averaging approximately 3% per year during these past three years, even with this minimal growth. However, we have been one of the most profitable airlines during these turbulent times. But in the last year, we and the industry have experienced major expense increases, particularly South salaries and specifically with our pilots. Additionally, we had problems predicting how many pilots would be available for us last year. This time last year, we were losing more than a pilot a day, annualizing out to a 40% annual attrition rate stopped hemorrhaging. In June, we began to accrue future bonus payable to our crew members. After we signed an agreement through this April, we have accrued and expensed $80 million without any corresponding offset of a new pilot agreement. We hope to have this new agreement in the not-too-distant future. You'll hear today from Greg Drew, Robert Scott and Mike Origin's about our current status, including comments on our revenue problems tied to our Navitaire upgrade, Boeing deliveries and the lack of productivity of our fleet and pilots, particularly do during our off-peak periods there are a number of reasons for this drop off in productivity. Clearly, the pandemic changed our rhythms, our routines, our annual cycle of hiring and training new pilots for the coming year and the fall adding them in January and February for March, OPTIC and the late spring for the summer, Sprint, we have been out of this rhythm for the past three years, we are about to resume this proven approach in the back half of this year and into 2025. A critical component of this rhythm is obviously having airplanes our Boeing order of 50 MAX plus 80 options provides us with the necessary aircraft for the anticipated growth in the coming years. Let me emphasize that the model remains the same going forward, we need to reinstate the execution of the model that has worked so well. Additionally, we are optimizing our revenue software, finalizing MAX deliveries, as I mentioned, and working with our pilots to finish an agreement. Let me turn to Sunseeker at this point. We are excited to finally have this world-class destination resort opened and operating initial reviews are all exceptional on the quality of the personnel, the product and in particular to the quality of the cuisine by calling projects. However, there is a run-in time opening at the end of December was not ideal. The date was driven by the construction delays we experienced for most of last year. Given we made the decision to open in late October, we did not have as much time as we would have liked to market and sell this new destination resort, we use many tools to drive traffic, not the least of which is our 18 million person customer database. We've had success with this program's sending out as many as 25 million to 30 million e-mails per week on Sunseeker. And specifically, we are already the booking patterns for Southwest Florida of what the differences are. We saw some expected strength in Q1, Q2 and Q3, however, will be slower and we're trying to understand where they will sell given the patterns we are experiencing. At this point, we are lowering our estimates to a negative $15 million EBITDA for this year. Michael Richards, President of Sunseeker, will have more comments in just a moment for Sunseeker will be a project for 24 and 25 airline problems we are currently experiencing can be addressed for the most part during the remainder of this year and into 2025. By then, we should be hitting our stride a comment about the industry for years. We have been grouped together with other low-cost low-fare companies particularly Spirit and Frontier. While all of us offer low fares and focused on leisure customers, we would be remiss if we did not point out that our model has made money consistently during this pandemic. Time in particular, I want to direct your attention to the revenue differences in the just-completed q. one, our unit revenue or transit was $0.132 compared to $0.092 average for 42% greater than the aforementioned operators in today's inflationary world. The ability to generate sufficient revenues and increased revenues is the difference between success and failure. Cost management is also important. No doubt, given our increased utilization later this year and into 2025, you'll see our unit cost decline accordingly. An important component of our revenues has been our third party revenues. While they are not that big on an absolute basis, they are very powerful for the bottom line. This quarter, our $8.21 per passenger was worth $33 million of operating income, and that's a 30% increase over last year's $6.32. In spite of our problems with our revenue tools and Navitaire. We still had one of our best unit revenues in the Company history. Many things go into this ability to generate stronger revenues, including brand and reputation, and we are pleased with how we have positioned ourselves to look at the success of the majors. One only has to point to their loyalty programs to see the power of third party revenues. We understand this benefit and are focused on this producing more of these very accretive dollars license about revenue. We all work better, have better results when we and what we do is know is repeatable and predictable. Looking back on our successes of the past 20 years, while the model is a critical organ component, namely 77% of our routes not have direct competition. The execution component, the rhythm each year is also critical. For the past many years post COVID, the rhythm, the routine has not been present to the contrary, there's been minimal predictability, uncertain rhythm starts and stops. The fog is lifting in the traditional focus, and we are in better control of our own actions going forward, the model is just fine. As I mentioned, as strong as ever, the rhythm is coming back. Stay tuned for the good news, Greg, Maury."", 'Gregory Anderson', ""Thank you, team. Allegiant delivered another strong operational performance this quarter with a 99.7% controllable completion rate that puts us near the top of the industry. And that's thanks to the tremendous efforts of our frontline team members. We have a long history of providing a great service at an attractive price for our customers. And our differentiated model is focused on being the only nonstop carrier on the vast majority of our 525 routes has a structural advantage that affords us great relationships within our origination and destination market, which in addition contribute to our strong ancillary and third party revenue. Our differentiation is why we are we have been able to generate industry-leading margins and profitability for our investors over the long term. While I am pleased with our operational and customer service metrics this quarter. Our first quarter adjusted operating margin of 6.2% is disappointing and is not reflective of Allegiant's earnings potential these results were impacted by three distinct issues, lower aircraft utilization during peak periods, Navitaire implementation timing and Boeing's delivery delays starting with lower utilization. March 2020 for flying was about 20% less than where we would have liked it to be. The primary constraint of our peak utilization has been the uncertainty of part of our pilot staffing levels. We were impacted by the same industry-wide shortage faced by our peers in our attrition levels were meaningfully elevated coming out of COVID, but beginning to normalize around the middle of 2023 it was because at this time we implemented a retention bonus for our pilots that materially helped stem attrition. It is important to us that our pilots receive fair and competitive compensation in advance of an agreed-upon pilot contract, and we are accruing upwards of $6 million per month for this bonus. Given our pilot staffing levels have turned to being stable, we are just starting to realize some of these benefits through our scheduling as we work towards restoring our peak utilization. On a related note, achieving a pilot labor contract continues to be a priority of ours, and I am optimistic that we can come to an agreement in the not-too-distant future. We value our relationships with our pilots and are encouraged by the forward movement made since the recent changes in union leadership since cutting over to Navitaire in the second half of 23, we have made a lot of progress in the system that runs all of our reservations and rent revenue management. It offers critical new features of our legacy homegrown system. This includes the ability for international expense expansion and further efficiencies that are expected to improve our dynamic pricing and increase ancillary revenues. That migration last year went well for the most critical aspects as customers had a seamless ability to book and to fly. However, migrating our ancillary data has taken longer than we expected, which caused a reduction of about $2 per passenger in ancillary fees in the quarter. As you all know, that is high margin revenue for us. Turning to Boeing due to their well-publicized issues, we are experiencing even further delivery delays since our last earnings call. As a reminder, we had originally anticipated and planned for six MAX deliveries in the first half of this year. Prior to this brand, new type of aircraft entering the Allegiant fleet, we hire and train pilots, and we plan our network and we take on other preparation and infrastructure costs. These material headwinds are at a current run rate rate of roughly $30 million annually to operating income at this time, we do not anticipate any MAX aircraft to be placed in service during the first half of 24. Yet we continue to incur these significant expenses. Excluding these three distinct items I just outlined, our adjusted airline operating margin for the quarter would have been approximately 13%. This does not, however, change the fact that our current financial port performance is not acceptable to us. The good thing is we have solutions. So I'd like like to talk about the key drivers of how we will. We will return to our normal industry-leading margins. The first driver is increasing peak flying. While the airline has recovered well from COVID, our peak flying is still 20% below 2019 levels. Fortunately, our pilot hiring and attrition issues have improved considerably, and we are seeing normalized staffing levels. Given these improvements, we are pushing up peak utilization and look to fully restore it by 2025 and 2025, which we expect to add roughly four points of incremental margin. The second driver is harnessing the full power of our Navitaire reservation system. While the implementation of the system was more complex and took longer than we expected. We are now at the right point with Drew Wells, our Chief Revenue Officer, spearheading this initiative at this pivotal time we see a big opportunity using avatars tools to create to drive greater ancillary revenue. Drew will talk in more detail about this platform, but we estimate enhancements to Navitaire will drive as much as three points of incremental margin at a mature state in 2025. We are also growing and improving our product offerings through other commercial opportunities in areas such as loyalty co-brand, Allegiant extra and our planned international expansion with Veeva. And finally, the third driver is ramping up our Boeing MAX fleet once in service and operating scale at scale we expect the MAX aircraft will provide a meaningful tailwind to our earnings. The annual operating income carrying cost of $30 million we are currently incurring will naturally subside. Furthermore, there is a 20% fuel burn savings and other advantages of this new fleet for Allegion, we are working with Boeing to ensure an orderly delivery schedule and given their extended delivery delays. Our 2024 CapEx CapEx is expected to be significantly below our initial forecast. Last, but certainly certainly not least, we are very happy to report. We have reached a deal with the TWU and our flight attendants on a new contract, a deal, our in-flight team members were proud to support. In closing, our airline is one of the best proven models in the business. This management team is laser focused on restoring our industry-leading margins. We are executing on a clear path just as outlined and further building on our strength. I'm excited about the opportunities ahead for us. With that, I'll turn it to Mike."", 'Michael Broderick', ""Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Maury mentioned in his opening remarks, we're extremely pleased with the progress that's been made at Sunseeker this past quarter. When we last updated you, we were in the early days of transitions from a construction site to an operating resort. We still had thousands of punch list items to complete in several venues to bring online today. All of our outlets are online and all but a handful of the punch list items have been completed. Feedback from guests has been overwhelmingly positive with consistent month-over-month improvements in our Medallia NPS scores. Of note, our customers are not only impressed by the resort, but have been delighted by our wonderful team members in terms of quality of experience drivers, the leading categories, helpfulness of staff, we couldn't be more proud of them. Guests and locals alike have been highly complimentary of our food and beverage offerings. Opening this many restaurants concurrently is no easy task. Despite that, all six of our specialty restaurants have satisfaction ratings over four on a scale of five with the average being 4.5. These venues, in addition to our spectacular pool experiences allow us the ability to activate the property in meaningful ways, including sporting events like Super Bowl and the Kentucky Derby. We had just this past weekend in terms of group business, year to date, we successfully hosted more than 50 groups. Our operating and services team have worked tirelessly to ensure the satisfaction of meeting planners and the attendees alike, building reputational credibility that will pay dividends throughout the remainder of the year and certainly into 2025 and beyond. In the hospitality business, the convention segment is the most effective leading indicator of future financial performance. While our sales teams are still fielding leads for short term in the year. For the year bookings, much of their activity is now focused on planners booking 2025 and beyond. Our 2025 goal for convention room nights is 60,000. We expect to open the year with 43 room nights, 43,000 room nights on the books and 17,000 to be booked in the year. We already have 20,000 on the books with 62,000 room nights in the funnel in future calls, I'll provide updates on our progress. Clearly, our occupancy and our resulting financial performance is not yet where we expect it to be. The repeated shifting of our opening date, made it extremely challenging for our sales teams to book convention business into Q1 and Q2 of this year, understandably good planners historically risk-averse when it comes to new hotel product. That's why the reputational credibility I mentioned earlier is so critical right now at 785 keys. We have a short term excess room capacity challenge with the associated cost structures. As with any new venture, particularly one of this scale, it will take time and significant effort to rectify. We've assembled an executive committee of highly skilled experienced leaders, some from Vegas, some from Florida and others from around the country. Most have been through the rigors of opening multiple properties. They know what to expect. They know what to do and how to accomplish the results we anticipate going forward."", 'Scott Deangelo', ""With that, I'll turn it over to Scott DeAngelo face Micah, our leading brand and product continue to improve and are increasingly highly regarded among our customer base. Our Net Promoter Score rose to 55 in the first quarter. That's four points higher than we reported last quarter, and our customers rated us materially higher than all other airlines in the nation. Our high margin third party product revenue increased nearly 30% during the first quarter compared to Q1 2023, with our always Rewards Visa card, leading the way as the program surpassed 500,000 cardholders in the quarter and earned nearly $35 million in total co-brand credit card compensation, up 24% versus Q1 2023. It's also noteworthy that this program was included among Newsweek's 2020 forward listing of America's best loyalty programs for the value it delivers to consumers as voted on by consumers. We also continued to see progress during the first quarter from our marketing support for Sunseeker Resort, primarily e-mail marketing to our 18 million customer database, but also including prominent merchandising on our website and mobile app and onboard through our in-flight magazine nonstop flight from dedicated seatback insureds. We also enable functionality allegiant.com for customers to be able to book their stay without requiring a deposit bookings improved sequentially each month from an average of 140 room nights booked per day in December when the resort opens to an average of 265 room nights booked per day in March for heading into a typical off-peak season for Southwest Florida. We expect to continue making progress on the sales and distribution front in order to be at full strength when customers begin booking in earnest for fall and winter. Lastly, our transition from legacy homegrown booking and operating systems to modern open integration technology platforms will enable us greater speed and flexibility as we enhance our customer-facing website and mobile app to improve the booking experience and maximize customer driven revenue, specifically as our Navitaire implementation unlocks its full set of features and functionalities as both Maury and Greg referenced, Andrew will elaborate on. We will in parallel be enhancing our web and app booking experience and merchandising capabilities to drive increased take rate for high margin air ancillary products and bundles, along with continued increased attachment for high margin, third party hotel rental car and credit cards. Also the expansion of newer air ancillary products such as Allegion extra leg room, Boston trip insurance, along with future new product conditions such as gift card play subscriptions and more should collectively play key roles in driving profitable revenue growth on a per passenger basis. And with that, I'll turn it over to our Chief Revenue Officer, Drew Wells from."", 'Drew Wells', ""Thank you, Scott, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. I'm pleased to report a first first quarter airline revenue of $632.5 million and travel of $0.1323. Both the second-highest first quarter figures in Allegion history. System Anthem also increased 2% versus 1Q 23. I believe this continues to represent one of the best performances versus pre-pandemic at roughly 15% travel gains on over 20% ASM. gains versus the first quarter of 2019, along with a record first quarter fixed fee performance, leading the way once more with a total ancillary per passenger increase of roughly $0.5. Our core products are strong and the addition of all eOn's travel insurance drove new opportunities in the booking path. Further, as Scott described, the always Rewards Visa card continued to drive excellent value. The ancillary portion was down slightly and we know that we're leaving value on the table here, as Greg mentioned, but more on that later. 1q travel represented 0.54% sequential increase versus four Q. 23, and in line with our revised guidance well, on a year-over-year basis, traffic was down 4.8%. As communicated during last quarter's call, our peak spring break flying at the end of March with unit revenue positive versus the same weeks in 2023. Obviously, 2024 gets the benefit of Easter in that comparison. However, it is still a great signal that the best leisure travel periods remain resilient. Of course, there's the other side, Easter shifting the first two weeks of March were weaker than anticipated and early April felt the pain of the spring travel season ending earlier. While Easter shifts every year it landed in March just twice between 29 and 2019. Both of those time saw 1Q to 2Q sequential travel decline at least 5%. The expectations for 2Q 2024 exceed those comparisons, and we expect sequential travel to declined just 2.5% versus 1Q 24. This represents a year-over-year decline of roughly 5.5% while I still expect the total ancillary per passenger to grow slightly year over year in the second quarter were accomplishing this with reduced functionality versus same time last year. Our Navisphere cutover in late August 2023 was implemented with some known gaps and a path to not just bridging but improving our position included in those gas or roughly $2 per passenger and booking path ancillary functionality impacts to our ability to collect all revenues at the airport and a handful of factors driving additional call volume to our customer care team for issues previously, self durable in the bridges have proven significantly more challenging than initially thought. The additional upside of at least another $2 per passenger we had communicated from the increased dynamic abilities have to take a backseat. I'd like to commend the entire organization for their efforts in developing testing, finding ways to go above and beyond and continuing to make this company great through the growing pains. As we become more familiar with the platform and its capabilities, we feel it is time to take a step back and acknowledge there may be a better way to move forward. We have incredibly high conviction in the Navisphere platform. When done right and done right is what we need to do. It won't be an overnight fix, but we believe it's the right long-term decision. We'll have more details around timing and value beyond what I've described here in the coming quarters. One of the ways we continue to offset the current integration headwind is with our extra product. As the fleet grows and we gather more data, we continue to work to align our product mix and experience with what customers value most the first quarter ended with 15 tails and the 180 seat extra Leo, and thanks to our maintenance strategy team and our Mesa hangar we expect as many as 11 additional aircraft to be modified by the end of May. As we shift to the capacity front, our summer capacity did increase, as indicated on the last call, the month of June is expected to grow approximately 7%. And while it offsets the 11% April decline primarily associated with the Easter shift, we expect the quarter to have a SIM is approximately 1% below 2Q 23. Despite the delays and Boeing aircraft, our planning and ops teams have found a way to preserve the selling schedule through July and August, allowing us to maintain a mid single digit percent ASM growth in each month and about 0.5 hour utilization per day per aircraft increase over last summer. This was generally in line with 2018 summer utilization and a solid first step toward restoring our peak period utilization. It has taken about a year from the announcement of the pilot retention bonus to have comfort levels at the appropriate lead time to push on flying a bit harder. Candidly, we ended with enough pilots to fly a little more in March. Unfortunately, that certainty occurred too close to march to react accordingly, but it does provide support for our summer plan of our reduced Boeing delivery expectations will impact our anticipated fourth quarter capacity and in turn our full year guidance, and we now expect 2% to 4% year over year ASM growth. The demand environment continues to be elevated well above pre-pandemic levels peaks have shown resiliency and the gap between peak and off-peak leisure demand appear normal. We see a path forward with our system into implementation and other plans laid out today and are confident that we are building out the tools and processes to optimize flying revenue and most importantly, profitability. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Robert."", 'Robert Neal', ""Good afternoon. As you've heard from others today, our first quarter results are below our expectations. As Greg outlined, there are several contributing factors for this underperformance. We are encouraged, however, that for each of the factors Greg identified, we have a clear and actionable plan to restore our earnings potential in the coming quarters. I'll speak today to our financial results and guidance on an adjusted basis. Looking at the first quarter, we delivered a consolidated net income of $10.4 million, yielding an earnings per share of $0.57. Consolidated EBITDA came in at $92.3 million, generating an EBITDA margin of just over 14%. Airline business recorded a net income of $19.8 million, yielding an airline only EPS of $1.8. The airline produced 97 million in EBITDA during the quarter for an EBITDA margin of 15.3%. Fuel continued to pressure results coming in at $3 and $0.03 per gallon for the quarter, which was $0.18 above our initial expectations. But we have seen some slight relief as of late, and we are estimating second quarter fuel costs to be approximately $2.90 per gallon. Non-fuel unit costs were up 14% year over year. Six points of this increase was related to the accrual for our pilot retention bonus as we were not accruing during the first quarter of 2023, three points were driven by pilot training and lots of pilot productivity awaiting delivery of the seven three seven MAX aircraft, roughly a 0.5 was attributable to the maintenance CVA that was passed last May one point came from the timing of light engine maintenance and the remainder was from a handful of various other items. Turning to the balance sheet, our total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $1.1 billion comprised of $854 million in cash and investments and $275 million in undrawn revolver. We made principal payments of $31.5 million during the first quarter and expect about the same during the second quarter. Net leverage was higher at the end of the quarter with net debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA at $3.4 times, which included $75 million in pilot retention bonus costs. At the end of the quarter, we had prearranged financing commitments for $435 million to cover our first nine seven three seven MAX deliveries, which in aggregate provide the business with approximately $100 million in liquidity from efficient financing vehicles that those aircraft deliver. This will give us valuable flexibility with respect to aircraft financing heading into 2025 while retaining ownership of those assets. I want to thank our committed financing partners and our PDP. lenders who have been particularly supportive and flexible for us in the face of the aircraft delivery delays, we retired two A3 20 aircraft during the quarter and placed one A. through 20 into service. We took delivery of one A3 20 aircraft during the quarter. This delivery represents our last A3 20 under contract, and we expect that airplane to Interserve revenue service for our summer peak. As Greg mentioned, we're working with Boeing to devise an orderly delivery schedule, which may moderate our capacity growth in the short to mid term, but should mitigate risks to the operation risks to our selling schedule and cost drag resulting from the disconnected timing of crew and aircraft availability. At the time of our last earnings call, we anticipated our first seven 37 MAX aircraft delivery to be in March. That aircraft. The first in a leading spec is awaiting FAA inspection, which will need to be completed before deliveries to lead. It can begin, we now expect this aircraft to enter revenue service during the third quarter. We are updating our delivery expectations and planning the business for delivery of six aircraft this year rather than 12 previously communicated. This estimate is not based on guidance from Boeing, but rather represents our best estimate based on information available to us today. While we remain excited about and committed to the MAX entering our fleet this year, we're very happy to own 86% of our operating fleet providing meaningful flexibility to help manage these delays given the reduction in expected deliveries, we have updated our full year airline CapEx to $475 million, down roughly $315 million from the prior guide. As indicated last quarter, these expectations differ from our contractual obligations. Updated CapEx guidance consists of $240 million in aircraft and engine related payments, $85 million related to heavy maintenance and $165 million related to other airline CapEx because we're planning for six fewer aircraft to deliver in 2024. We have trimmed our full year capacity guide by one point and now expected capacity to be up 3% over the prior year. On a quarterly cadence, we are estimating second quarter capacity to remain unchanged at down 1% year over year. Third, capacity to be up about 4% year over year and fourth quarter capacity and be up about 7% over the fourth quarter of 2023 due to further reductions in capacity this year and uncertainty around our 2025 aircraft delivery schedule. We are now reviewing our airline infrastructure and expect to make adjustments over the coming months to align with a more moderate growth trajectory. Turning to second quarter guidance, we expect to airlines reduce and adjusted earnings per share of $1.50 at the midpoint of our guide, yielding an airline operating margin of around 8%. We expect second quarter CASMex to increase by approximately 7% over the second quarter of 2023. While this assumes a slight year-over-year reduction in capacity in the quarter, the increase is due primarily to increases in the salary and benefits line, including one additional month of the pilot retention bonus accrual as well as incorporating increased wage rates for our flight attendants, technicians and dispatchers as a result of new agreements or amendments. It's worth noting that these labor agreements are part of our path back to incremental utilization and better productivity in the business. I want to congratulate our flight attendants on their recently ratified agreement. As we progress throughout the back half of the year, we expect CASMex to moderate into the third quarter with a slight year-over-year reduction expected in the fourth quarter based on worries commentary regarding Sunseeker and much of the second quarter being off peak for the property, we are guiding consolidated earnings per share to $0.75 for the second quarter. Before I close, I want to thank our team members for all their efforts this quarter. Despite this financial outcome, the operation again ran safely and smoothly, thanks to your hard work, and that's foundational for us as we now focus on increasing utilization and peak leisure demand periods as we head into our peak summer schedule. Thank you for all you do. And with that said, DI, we can now turn it back to you for analyst questions. Thank you."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Helane Becker, TD Cowen.', 'Helane Becker', ""Thanks very much, operator. Hi, everybody. Thanks for the time here. And just a couple of questions on on guidance on as we're looking forward, the maintenance costs, is that is that just a one quarter item or is that a full year item that we should expect at that level hail."", 'Robert Neal', ""And as BJ said, yes, it's a little bit of both there. Some noise in the comp in the first quarter of 2023. So we are running some light on check and repair level. Maintenance visits on our engines now persist throughout the year, but it's offset by a nice reduction in contract labor expense. So on an ASM basis, we expect maintenance costs to be down on unitized throughout the year."", 'Helane Becker', ""Okay. That's very helpful. And then I actually follow up question for you. Is there a level on cash or I don't know if you want to measure in liquidity that you are not willing to go below, as you pointed out at."", 'Robert Neal', ""Sure, you know, we normally talk on these calls about some liquidity levels being maintained at two times ATL. Now for our purposes, we would credit that data some of the available balance under our undrawn revolver facilities. So all in, we're a little bit above that today. I'd still like to maintain cash balances of around two times ATL until we have some clarity on the Boeing delivery schedules. But as we have financing lined up further and further out, we would be comfortable at two times a deal, including revolver balances."", 'Operator', 'Ravi Shanker, Morgan Stanley.', 'Ravi Shanker', 'Great. Thanks. Good afternoon and thanks for all the detail on the call. Maybe the first question is you said that you are taking steps to kind of improve the financials, and the first step was to improve your peak flying.', 'Robert Neal', 'One of your peers are also going to have increased their flying once they resolve their staffing issues, but they ended up with too much capacity and they are now pulling back.', 'Ravi Shanker', ""Do you have the visibility that kind of your increasing peak flying is kind of not going up that outcome and will actually be accretive to earnings if this is Drew, if I'm reading between the lines properly and thinking of the right other airline, I believe they commented that there was outsized growth in April and May that they wish they hadn't had pulled back a little bit given current fare levels. And what we're talking about is summer flying, it's market, it's the holidays and where I still believe that there is immense incremental value for us to drive by flying more there, but not quite as much and April May timeframe. So forgive me if I'm thinking of the wrong quote, but that's that's my position in Ravi, this is Craig."", 'Gregory Anderson', ""I just wanted to add a comment to that. And 80% of our earnings come in those peak periods, March, March, the summers in the holidays and Drew is still and his team are still seeing terrific demand, leisure demand in those periods as well. I don't know if you caught in his comments, but we've already taken a nice step up this summer with a half hour more of utilization per aircraft. So we're going to continue to take those steps up until we get into 2025 where we want to restore that 20% delta that work that we're under today and in terms of aircraft utilization in the peak periods."", 'Ravi Shanker', ""Got it. That's really helpful. And maybe as a follow up, I know that a lot of the industry is kind of pushing towards premiumizing their product. And some of your ULCC peers are also introducing new front of cabin product and kind of pushing the potential kind of premium offering. Wondering your thoughts on that kind of. Obviously, you have a good bundle product now at Sunseeker. And if anything you can do kind of on the aircraft itself to kind of push towards a premium player or anything else?"", 'Drew Wells', ""Yes. So no, we're not that far removed from talking about bringing the extra products from across all of our fleet. And we sought and received our first MAX aircraft, which would have materially increased the number of either extra or leg room plus on seats on the aircraft. We're constantly looking and evaluating other options that, you know, I don't think we're at a position today against and we haven't received the MAX aircraft to say we need to be pushing harder but a lot of I think, confirmation bias and will be what we've seen right and putting aircraft on the most valuable routes. So given time, we'll continue to review everything and maybe it makes sense. Maybe it doesn't, but that's probably a little bit further down the road for us."", 'Maurice Gallagher', ""But I think it goes more to one other thing when you have 77% of your routes are without competition. A lot of what you're seeing is the one element ship and competitiveness and ability to price with some majors really rolled in so they can roll people up in their purse or in their purchasing of having that ability to fly. You know, our customer well, our we've got a great brand and we do a good job. I don't know that they're that price sensitive in a two hour flight. It's hard to see that you're really adding a lot of value first class, but that's very much being driven by the majors and the others are following trying to keep up."", 'Operator', 'Andrew Didora, Bank of America.', 'Andrew Didora', 'Hey, thanks for the questions, everyone. Maybe first question for Greg or P.J. Just given the CapEx changes in 2024 and down $315 million. What would be kind of your first look in terms of how 2025 and maybe 2026 look like? I would assume that 300 just moves into those years on any initial thoughts?', 'Robert Neal', ""Hey, Andrew, is BJ. I apologize. I'm trying to get back to that page. But what I will say is there's still a lot of uncertainty around 2025. And I mentioned at the moment, we're taking a close look at different areas of the business and where we need to adjust to be prepared for a little bit slower growth profile. So I think we'll have a lot more for you next quarter that maybe we can share on 2025. We were originally contracted to take 24 airplanes next year, just given what we've learned from the risk of relying on two aircraft a month, and I would expect we adjust that down somewhat. So as that does shift into 2025 and into 2025 CapEx, and we expect to ship to 2026."", 'Andrew Didora', 'Got it. Okay. Thank you. And then second question just for maybe first for Maury. I mean, I guess just in terms of Sunseeker and what changed so rapidly on the years that brought kind of RevPAR assumptions down about 30%? And does the year one EBITDA losses, but do you think any differently about owning or running the asset and potentially picking up thinking about a potential divestiture here? Thank you.', 'Maurice Gallagher', ""What unfortunately, we didn't have a lot of front end time to market and sell. And I think we're also a bit of victims of the curve that's coming down and normalizing that, you know, and we've been started in 21, EUR22. We were looking I know I personally looked at rates of 2009. There are a lot of equivalent of properties down there, but that's just up putting all effort that we've got to go after on. I can Michael can probably add more color than I can at this point. As far as looking at other alternatives? Yes, we're going to look at those types of alternatives. I think that this year that I look at this as I call it a project. We're going to learn a lot this year and we'll be able to react and do things accordingly for filling it in next year. It's definitely going to improve as we go forward. But bottom line, as I said, we have a really quality product, so we'll fill it up. It's just a question of how fast, Michael, any thoughts."", 'Michael Broderick', ""Yes, in terms of why why the adjustment? Because a couple of things. One, we now have four months of data and that helps us at least I think, better about what's going to happen in the next coming months. When we're talking about this in Q1, we had almost we had zero. So that helps us a little bit. Scott talked about the bookings trends and the way they were ramping up, like we wanted them to into March and they slowed down a little bit. So part of the booking trend analysis that we were watching and its decline has led to led to us thinking about Q2 and Q3 a little differently than we were thinking about it in February and March. There's anecdotal softness in Florida, some of you're starting to see people talking about that. That's a part of it. We're still learning every day about how the locals behave and how how they'll handle food and beverage demand between seasons in and out of season. And I think the last thing that I would tell you is that we didn't really know for sure when we first talked about what our what of our group prospects would materialize and which ones wouldn't we kind of hoped. We play a little more lucky than we have. And I think those are probably some of the things that led to the changes in the short term."", 'Operator', 'Duane Pfennigwerth, Evercore ISI.', 'Duane Pfennigwerth', ""Hey, thank you, guys. Good morning. Tom. I wanted to maybe ask the CapEx question a different way. Obviously, you're disappointed in the delays, the delays, drive your hiring plan and your ops plan or at least the fleet plan does look from the outside looking in the higher any feels like it's actually a good thing for 2024 and so the question is, do you see an opportunity to smooth out? Are the capital commitments beyond just this year? And how do you think about the guardrails from a balance sheet perspective that shape your longer term capital plans?"", 'Robert Neal', ""Sure, Duane. Yes, I mean, I guess there is there is an ability to smooth it out. I think we'll have to wait to see No, just how many airplanes on Boeing is going to produce in a month and how many of those are delivered to Allegiant. We do need to be careful of what I think is an outsized risk for leading compared to some of the other carriers with respect to the deliveries in that what Greg mentioned is we're getting ready for the airplanes and taking pilots off of the A3 20 and having them standing by ready for seven, three, seven or so sitting here relying on two aircraft a month, just just doesn't feel like a good recipe at at the moment. And then that said, that's also creating some pressure on earnings as we talked about today, which would would limit on what we can do from a leverage perspective. So all things that we're mindful of, but I don't know that I have a clean answer for you as we think about 25, 26 yet."", 'Gregory Anderson', ""Duane, it's Greg. I might just add, and BJ mentioned this in his opening comments that he and the team they're actively working with Boeing on setting up an orderly delivery schedule that we can all electric execute to. And so that flexibility is important and that plan is going to be important. And together, we believe we'll get to the right outcome Yes, whatever fund come and play."", 'Maurice Gallagher', ""And if we slow down a little bit, it won't be the end of the world to on certain credit part of that process. We're going to retire some more airplanes when we took those those that new equipment. But Bill, just given the way the world's developing just taking our time a little bit longer, it's not a bad thing for where we see ourselves. And I think you also get some benefits maybe in interest rates that the you take them all very quickly. We'll have the interest rate benefits that might come on a year to later on. But we are going and we have to come to an agreement and there certainly are continuing to hire carefully how they can't get off the front page. It's just astonishing so on."", 'Duane Pfennigwerth', ""Yes. Okay. Appreciate those thoughts. And maybe you gave part of the answer with the Navitaire commentary, but can you speak to the level of integration of air and hotel packages within your booking engine. When do you think you'll have the ability to fully market Sunseeker to your airline customers?"", 'Scott Deangelo', ""Hi, Duane, this is Scott. Thanks for the question. On the answer is we've gotten there on technically now as of a couple of weeks ago, we removed one of the biggest barriers which you may recall was from requiring customers to pay for the entire air plus hotel purchase at once. Now, when do you book Sunseeker, you actually are required to leave? No deposit as you book your air and hotel together, we will begin to market that now that we've got a couple of weeks knowing that everything works on from a customer experience standpoint and customer servicing standpoint, market that in earnest come very soon. And I will tell you just one other tidbit of the different channels, the the Allegiant.com, if you will customer who books air and hotel is by far the highest value. Their length of stay is longer and they're paying more on an average daily rate. So continuing to fuel that fire on our air plus hotel for Sunseeker is going to be critical, and we're already at now the the technical ability to do that."", 'Duane Pfennigwerth', 'Enormous. Thanks. And if I could sneak one last one in just on the Sunseeker OpEx run rate. Is this first quarter level a good level? Do we go up from there sequentially? Or is there a way to kind of flex it down in these off-peak periods. Thanks. Thanks for taking the questions. Micah Say that again, Duane, I had a hard time hearing if you just just we now have a quarter a full quarter of Sunseeker OpEx. And so is this the right level to model off of going forward? Or can you flex that up or down depending upon seasonality?', 'Michael Broderick', 'No, absolutely. You can flex it up and down based on the seasonality. So you should see us become more efficient in Q2 and Q3 and then flex back up a little bit into Q4 as demand returns.', 'Operator', 'Scott Group, Wolfe Research.', 'Scott Group', ""Good afternoon. So I think you talked about 7% increase in airline CASMex in Q2. Two. Is that I just want to make sure it's not apples to apples with the up 14.5% in Q. one? And then any thoughts on back half of the year cash?"", 'Robert Neal', ""Hey, Scott. Yes, it's apples to apples with the first quarter. I will mention in the second quarter, you have still one month of the on pilot payroll accrual. I think I mentioned in the script and then incorporating some of the new labor agreements. But yes, otherwise apples-to-apples."", 'Gregory Anderson', ""Scott, it's Greg. I'm just as you think about maybe even longer term and the power of increasing utilization, I think something like an hour increase of aircraft utilization per year results in a reduction of CASMex about 0.5%. So that could be a nice tailwind. And then as we work through some of the kind of inefficiencies with the overhead getting ready to take on the new MAX aircraft. I believe as that starts to work itself through, it's another like eight of a cent per CASMex that you said we could see there, too."", 'Robert Neal', ""And then just Scott, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we expect CASMex on a year-over-year comp basis to to moderate into the third quarter and up so slightly below the fourth quarter comp, you're saying Q4 CASMex should be down something year-over-year, right. Slightly recovered from any of them."", 'Maurice Gallagher', ""I know you said Rezum down about 2.5% sequentially, Q1 to Q2. Just absolute terms. I know it's early, but any early thoughts about how you're thinking about back half of your resin?"", 'Scott Group', 'Not particularly?', 'Maurice Gallagher', 'Yes.', 'Drew Wells', ""There's still, obviously a long ways to go in for July has at least 75% left to book. So everything still early. And I think the general theme still hold that we believe there's resiliency in the peak period. I'd expect continued normalization between the peak and the off-peak. But other than that, I don't have and I have a lot more to ask the back half of the year."", 'Scott Group', ""And then just last one, I know you got asked a question earlier about them sort of liquidity targets and all that sort of stuff to the extent that you wanted them and how do you balance liquidity needs versus where you're willing to take? The leverage is no give or take four times. Is that as high as you're willing to take the balance sheet leverage, would you take it higher or is if any incremental capital raises that more likely to view it with equity than debt Sure."", 'Robert Neal', ""Yes, no, no plans for any equity related capital raise at this time. You know, I realize what that could mean for leverage if we're trying to maintain liquidity at two times a deal. But as we've locked in financing for some of this future, CapEx, we're okay with liquidity coming down a little bit, as I mentioned in response to the last question. And so we're really part of your question. I missed something like that."", 'Scott Group', ""I guess you're saying you're okay, either with Phil liquidity coming down a little bit or the leverage metrics going up a little bit?"", 'Robert Neal', 'Yes. And we had expected leverage to be elevated throughout this year. I think we may have mentioned on the last call that certainly, you know, in one-on-ones and whatnot throughout the year. We would this is an investment period, a lot of CapEx for airplanes that we would have expected leverage to be pressured a little bit as we move through 2024.', 'Operator', 'Mike Linenberg, Deutsche Bank.', 'Mike Linenberg', ""Please go ahead your Haithum. Good morning, everyone. With respect to the distribution of Sunseeker, I know that you know you're going through third party channels, which I know historically was not the model for for Allegiant. Can you tell us, you know, as of now maybe what you're booking to Allegiant.com versus third party channels? And I'm just curious out of the $18 million people in your customer database, what's the uptake of them? Would you say that the majority of people at Sunseeker today are out of that $18 million database? Are these just entirely new clients, new customers?"", 'Scott Deangelo', ""Hey, Mike, it's Scott. I'll start and let lead might come chime in. So right now, the majority I'd put it at like 80% to 85%. And Michael, you'd correct me are coming directly either to Sunseeker Resorts.com or via allegiant.com. So that's that's great news that we're seeing the majority of bookings come without requiring of both the added cost and the disintermediation that comes via OTA. Um, in terms of the majority of folks that are staying back in January, call it, you've seen it go from about late three-quarters to one-quarter in favor of Allegiant customers to now close to 50 50 home while the overall pie grows. So it's a good story that yes, we're driving a lot directly and do the email, but that proportion, as the pie has grown has become smaller, meaning that more other people are coming into the Allegiant Travel Company family, if you will, from many from places that Allegiant doesn't currently serve or serve in earnest like Atlanta or New York City, et cetera. Mike, I'd invite you for any additional commentary?"", 'Michael Broderick', ""Yes. The only thing that I'd add to that, Scott, is, as you mentioned in Q1, we were just in the very early stages of ramping up of peak productivity so for example, when you looked at January and the way we put us in less than 15 rooms by February, we're booking 3 to 300 to three 50. And by March now upwards of 1800 to 2000, and we think that will continue to grow. One of the things that we think you know, I think Scott mentioned it, which is obviously best for us to produce as much as we can through G4 direct as part of packages. They have long lengths of stay. They have really good rates. And then obviously, anything we can book directly through our own website and or through group business is our priority. But third party will always be a good partner to it for us. And it's important for us to continue to grow that. And so you'll see our sales and marketing teams, particularly over the next several months and working to not only establish, but then make them make our partnerships that we have already established now more effective work in marketing programs with them and see better production out of the OTA partners. But I think Scott nailed it the right way. We have a priority of how we'd like that to happen, but they are a key component for us."", 'Mike Linenberg', ""Mike, was that 1800 to 20 March that is that's a monthly booking rate, is that?"", 'Michael Broderick', ""No, that's and that's an actualized in the month. So, you know, I think on a go forward basis, yes, on a go forward basis, you'd expect that to be somewhere in the 2 to 3,000 a month or so."", 'Mike Linenberg', ""Okay, great. And then just my second question with respect to on this call, to said, DOT on, I guess, consumer protection plan or benefits as a young characterized. And from what we hear you have this refund element that kicks in, I think, in the next month or so, maybe it's like at the end of June. And the transparency piece and carriers have come back incentives that it disproportionately impacts low-fare carriers. It's ultimately going to raise the cost to the consumer, which is actually I do think that it is going to it is going to add cost. So it's going to make it harder to offer lower fares, but what what are the gating issues? It seems like some of the refund elements are already being done today. It does seem like we've gotten feedback on the technology piece that the industry may not be ready in six weeks can meet the various elements of what the DOT is requiring your thoughts on that. Thanks for taking my questions."", 'Drew Wells', ""Sure. I'll start it and we'll probably keep it pretty high levels is all pretty fresh. Right. And where we're trying to work through with some. Yes, I think we do comply, particularly to the refund length. I think we comply with quite a bit of it already. I'm proud of how we've how we've addressed a lot of that around cancels, in particular, I think there's a little work we need to do around the delay side. But in terms of the gating or how ready will be in 60, I think we still need to kind of do some work on that, but I don't think it's quite as big of a lift given what we've already done to date and not a lot of commentary on the transparency part of ancillary fees, but you still need to do a lot of work to understand what that's going to look like and the booking funnel. So I'm sorry to keep it maybe a bit vague for today, but we're still working through just like everyone else."", 'Gregory Anderson', ""Can I just add one thing? Drew, Mike, this is Greg. Just on the refund point? Yes, region, we've talked about this over the years, but when we have cancellations with our customers, we issue them actual, let's call the pain over time up to $300. And so we compensate our customers when we have cancellations. We've been doing that. I think we're one of the unique carrier or carriers in the U.S. to do that. And so when we talk about higher offsets a big chunk of the eye drops. So just wanted to point that out that we've already and for years of tried to take care of our customers in those difficult type of situations when they had a cancellation. Very good. Thanks, everyone."", 'Operator', 'Dan McKenzie, Seaport Global.', 'Dan McKenzie', ""Well, hey, thanks. I know you're not guiding to the full year, obviously, but the Street's pretty divided you could drive a Mac truck through estimates. I think you had a low of $2.55 to over $7. And I guess just based on what you're seeing for the summer, can we start to eliminate either the high end or the low end here? And I guess part of that, does the current plan contemplate profitability in each of the quarters?"", 'Robert Neal', ""It's Dan. It's P.J. I'm going to shy away from giving guidance in the third and fourth quarter of theirs. A lot of moving parts, as we talked about today, one of which is execution of the CBA with our pilots which will have an impact on full year results, as will the timing of Boeing deliveries and when those airplanes can be placed into service and one that would be more immediate is just around some of the of the improvements in Navitaire that Drew, since speaking to side, you can see just a lot moving. And so apologies for going to dodge the question."", 'Dan McKenzie', ""Yes, understood. Okay. I guess second question here. Leg room plus seems it's now part of the booking process. I can see it there, but it doesn't look like you're really monetizing it yet. I just want if you could remind us when did that start exactly and where are you at with this program? And then I guess what is the kind of target benefit that this could potentially provide?"", 'Drew Wells', ""Yes. So we started testing the Allegiant Xtra layout as for the 2019, I believe. And then, of course, ran right into the pandemic and kind of got derailed a little bit through there. We announced probably what, 18, 24 months ago, we were going to bring this to the full fleet. In addition to putting it on all MAX aircraft with about double the number of seats, a little bit less than double the amount of premium seats. So there's a little distinction between Allegion extra, which is kind of an all-inclusive by legal standards product that has the extra leg room comes with the priority boarding, the dedicated overhead bin space. I now have free snack onboard, which complements very well for our cardholders who will get a free drink and really maybe not to the full extent that rival kind of a delta Comfort plus type of experience, which I think is a remarkable remarkable perk there. So in terms of monetizing right, it's on only a few of what a portion of our fleet 15 aircraft out with 11 more primed for the summer. So I think there's a lot left to go here in terms of experimentation with pricing and product mix. But so far, we've been responding to what our customers say is valuable to them and lead us to where we are today. So still in the infancy, I think of where this will go, but absolutely thrilled with what we've been able to do with the product and monetization thus far."", 'Operator', 'And since this concludes our Q&A session, I will now turn the conference back over to Maury Gallagher for closing.', 'Maurice Gallagher', ""Thank you all very much. Appreciate your input, and we'll talk to you in 90 days. Have a good day."", 'Operator', ""Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call.

As we work across the company to enable a net-zero transition, our renewables portfolio continues to grow. Across the Southern Company system of retail electric utilities, more than 2,800 MW of solar generating capacity has been added since 2015.

""We expect solar generation to continue its accelerated growth trajectory across our service territory as we transition our electric generating fleet in pursuit of our goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Our customers and communities depend on the clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy we serve every day - and we\'re committed to keeping them at the center of everything we do.""', 'Georgia has ranked in the top 10 for annual solar capacity additions in the U.S. for each the past three years. Georgia Power recently advised regulators that adding some 10,000 MW of solar capacity to their generation fleet by 2035 can potentially stimulate economic benefits for that state.', ""In addition to Southern Company's retail electric utilities, the company's wholesale energy subsidiary, Southern Power, currently owns or operates more than 2,740 MW of solar generating capacity at 30 facilities nationwide*. Southern Power helps serve the energy needs of municipalities, electric cooperatives, investor-owned utilities and other energy customers across the nation."", 'While various policy and economic factors could impact the continued growth of solar in the U.S., the outlook is currently optimistic. ""If we stay the course with policies in the IRA, solar capacity will quadruple over the next 10 years,"" said SEIA CEO Abigail Ross Hopper.', '* Some 250 MW of this amount is under contract to Georgia Power and is included in the 2,800 MW value cited above.

Can you use publicly available insider trading data to your advantage and mimic what insiders are doing to make money in the stock market? Researchers have been trying to answer these questions for decades, and we have a treasure trove of research papers and studies to understand this topic from various angles.\xa0 One of the most important aspects insider trading researchers revealed over the past few years is that insiders are often contrarian investors. Thanks to the strong informational advantage, they know the true intrinsic value of their company stock. As a result, when a company\'s stock jumps after positive news, insiders may see it as a selling opportunity while the broader market buys the stock. In a research paper titled Do insider trades reflect both contrarian beliefs and superior knowledge about future cash flow realizations, Joseph D. Piotroski and Darren T. Roulstone shared some extremely interesting insights about insider trading. The paper established that insider trades are positively correlated to companies\' stock performance in the future as well as their book-to-market ratio. On the other hand, insider trades are inversely related to recent returns. The paper said that insiders\' tendency to be contrarian investors and them having ""superior knowledge"" has ""incremental explanatory power for insider purchases, suggesting that insiders trade on the basis of both contrarian beliefs and private information about future cash flow news.""', 'Should you following insider trading activity of growth stocks or value stocks? The research uses the term ""glamour firms"" for growth companies that often get a lot of market attention. The research paper said that insiders at ""glamour firms"" often sell their company shares after strong earnings reports because they know their stock is becoming overvalued and growth catalysts which the market is paying for are already priced in. On the other hand, when value stocks post strong news, it is taken as a signal of strong future performance.', '""For value firms, the positive relation suggests that insiders use the current earnings news as a signal of strong future performance. This behavior is consistent with Piotroski’s (2000) findings that strong earnings performance in year t can be used to identify value firms withstrong subsequent returns and earnings performance …This asymmetric trading response to the current earnings innovation is consistent with insiders recognizing both differences in investor interest across glamour and value stocks and the impact investor neglect has on the informational efficiency of stock prices.""', 'The research paper also found that outsiders can gain more by following insider buying activity for small-cap companies since these companies usually lack analyst coverage. Insiders at small companies often pile into their company stocks before major positive news and earnings. This activity often goes unnoticed by the market due to lack of coverage. Outsiders can keep an eye on insider trading activity at smaller companies and gain an advantage over others.', 'Moving beyond academic research, does following insider trades to beat the market actually work?

CDT Insider Sentiment jumped to ""High"" in March and touched levels not seen since the end of 2023. CDT Capital Management also highlighted the contrarian nature of insiders while talking about the recent jump in insider sentiment:', '""We note that March’s jump in sentiment amid a market rally lays in stark contrast to the group’s notorious reputation as astute contrarian investors.

The new workflows will empower Ansys customers to make critical decisions earlier in the design process and bring products to market sooner.', 'Presently, materials discovery and product development are separate processes. While digital engineering tools have been widely adopted, standardizing and accelerating materials engineering tools has been delayed by the complexity of generating detailed data at a small scale. As a result, new products are being developed faster than the discovery of new materials that could improve performance. Computational materials engineering tools that quickly model materials from molecular to macroscopic levels present an opportunity to help customers unlock new levels of innovation and keep pace with industry advancement.', ""The Ansys and Schrödinger collaboration delivers a critical solution to address this challenge. The holistic approach of ICME allows customers to first determine what material characteristics are needed to meet specification standards. Once identified, users can generate material properties using Schrödinger's molecular modeling platform\xa0and use them in an Ansys simulation tool to evaluate product performance based on predicted materials data — all before prototyping begins. With this collaboration, users can run multiscale simulations to discover new materials, while ensuring products across industries fit performance standards such as\xa0weight, size, and efficiency."", '""Designing the next generation of materials starts at the molecular level,"" said Mathew Halls, senior vice president of materials science at Schrödinger.

Schrödinger's platform enables virtual testing of these properties to determine their reactions to stress factors, and the results can be stored and managed in an Ansys materials information database. From there, the materials data can be applied to an Ansys structural simulation workflow to observe the material's behavior in context."", '""Using the right material for product development is crucial for the success of its intended application,"" said Shane Emswiler, senior vice president of products at Ansys.

These assets generate approximately $100 million in annual revenue and include patient service centers, certain customer contracts and operating assets associated with testing services, focus on clinical diagnostics and women's health across the US, but outside of New York and New Jersey. We will retain our national oncology and urology franchises and our diagnostic services in New York and New Jersey complements our efforts to improve efficiencies and enhance the productivity of operations. This transaction will streamline U.S. laboratory services business and support our work to reestablish profitability in the near future. As Phil mentioned, we expect the sale to close in the second half of 2024, subject to customary closing conditions and applicable regulatory approvals and ongoing initiatives, we continue to improve bioreactors performance and in turn value. Our focus remains on initiatives to reduce cost, improve efficiency and enhance productivity. In addition, we seek to bolster growth with the expansion of insurance coverage in our higher value specialty segments of oncology and neurology, with particular focus in our proprietary 4K Score test. As you know, the focus Cortez was first introduced in 2014 as a laboratory developed test. As you know, FDA published new rules to reform the regulation of lab developed test. This will have a minimal impact on Bio-Reference health as for our tests are approved by New York state regulators who are exempted from the announced FDA reform in December 2021. I would like to remind you, focus coal was approved by the FDA, supported by its analytical and clinical data FDA concluded that the focus charge was had the appropriate sensitivity at 96.9% and negative predictive value of 95.9% contributed to an overall beneficial clinical decision as to whether a prostate biopsy should be performed and accordingly, minimize unnecessary biopsies without excess risk of missing clinically significant prostate cancers in more than 100 independent publications by erosion since then to focus core has ranked us in best-performing biomarker test for the assessment of risk probability for aggressive prostate cancer, our urology team with a strong growth in 4K Score test volumes in the first quarter, and we expect these volumes to build as the cash is included now in various clinical die or guidelines for early detection. Our prostate cancer portfolio of us appears to screen for initial and repeat biopsies risk stratification. In regard to Rayaldee, the program continues to enjoy stable demand, which we hope will grow with new data routing may delay the onset of dialysis. According to our most recent analysis in oncology, we are pleased with GenPath performance due to its innovative testing platform with an expanded hematological malignancy panel and very competitive turnaround times. We continue to see strong growth in our oncology business with over 12% growth in volume Q1 2024 versus Q1 2023 much of this growth was through collaborations with large cancer centers and mid-level health systems. As health systems are challenged with costs and staffing in the oncology space, they are looking for a reference laboratory to work with for the especially for the testing opening up possibilities for Bio-Reference sites. Genpact has been able to meet their needs with our own hands, a comprehensive menu across all stages of care. This includes the internalization of our hereditary cancer business in late Q4 2023, which now offers clients an internal solution with fast turnaround times for timely decision-making that we continue to expand our testing portfolio and expect new tests in Q2 to complement our current OncoCyte advance and risk portfolio, which will enable GenPath oncology to evaluate guideline recommended genetic components of a patient's cancer and keep us at the forefront of precision oncology, similar to our New Jersey, New York, New Jersey, women's health and clinical businesses our national oncology testing segment will remain with Bio-Reference sales under our GenPath Oncology brand. Upon closing of the transaction with LabCorp, we believe that Bio-Reference health is well positioned for further expense reductions and revenue expansion with a focus on the retained businesses in the New York and New Jersey markets after the divestiture. Complementing these efforts to boost performance, we will continue to improve our diagnostic division to further enhance profitability for AACo health and best position us as an innovative biopharmaceutical company. Moving to our pharmaceutical pharmaceutical segment, as you've heard and Jamba has been launched in all major global markets by Pfizer. We believe this drug is well positioned for significant growth as long-acting growth hormone products become the global standard in treating growth hormone deficiency for children. The launch is progressing as expected, with an increasing a significant percentage of patients shifting from daily to the long-acting once a week and gel product. In addition, we expect our partnership with Pfizer to expand with additional indications, including growth hormone deficiency for adults and other pediatric applications. And combined these approvals for these two indications will entitle OpCo to an additional $100 million in milestone payments. Let me go to Mosaic's SurModics. We're proud of the progress to date. In March, we announced favorable results from the Phase one clinical study with our trispecific antibody against HIV. This clinical data are the first reported for a trispecific antibody in humans and strongly support further development of multispecific multivalent antibodies against HIV. The antibody was found to be safe and well tolerated at all dose levels through both intravenous and subcutaneous use with minimal anti-drug antibodies observed with dosing ranging from 0.3 milligram per kilogram to 30 milligram per kilogram with up to four administrations and a pharmacokinetic which remained consistent and similar to standard monoclonal antibodies. We therefore believe and our partners at the NIH believe that multi-specific antibodies will offer a differentiated approach to longer-lasting preventive and therapeutic options against most HIV one virus with the possibility of activating the immune system against the latent virus population to affect a functional cure. We are partnered with the NIH of this program through our collaboration with Merck to develop MDX-010 initial one, which is our Epstein-Barr virus. Multivalent nanoparticle nanoparticle vaccine is advancing on plan. We received a $50 million upfront payment upon licensing this vaccine with a potential 872.5 million in development and commercial milestones, plus royalties on global sales ranging from single digit to double digit percentages. In terms of timing, we expect this program to enter the clinic in the later part of this year. Our collaboration with Barda is also proceeding on schedule and represents another source of non-dilutive funding for the Company. We secured an initial $59 million grant to fund R&D and clinical evaluation to a Phase one study of our multi-specific antibodies against known variants of SARS, CoV two for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19. Additional funding of up to $1.9 million may be available from Barda to develop multi-specific antibodies and delivery approaches to target other biodefense traits such as influenza. The ultimate goal of this research program is to develop a platform for gene-based delivery methods using mRNA or DNA vectors to supplement the body's natural protein production processes, which can then be used efficiently and effectively against future pandemics. Rounding out the Model X pipeline is our immuno-oncology program, which is focused on hard to treat solid tumors as well as certain liquid tumors such as leukemias and lymphomas. We believe our multi-specific antibody candidates can simultaneously target several tumor antigens and enable better control of the immune system activation. And we expect our trispecific laser program for solid tumors to enter the clinic this quarter as our first IND application, as indicated by Phil, focused on solid tumors, was deemed acceptable to proceed by the FDA. Other immuno oncology products are advancing to IND enabling studies and are on target to enter clinical studies next year. So as you can see, it's an exciting time for OpCo as we execute our strategy to gain profitability for Bio-Reference health by rightsizing the half the diagnostic division to its most profitable areas of activities while addressing our bold biopharmaceutical segment with several programs set to enter the clinic this year. I will now turn the call over to Adam go to discuss our first quarter financial results. Adam?"", 'Adam Logal', ""Thank you, Ali, U.S. console and LEO. As I've discussed we had a busy start to the year, realizing significant value from some of our underlying assets and strengthening our balance sheet. The convertible debt offering in January reduced our cash interest expense. This refinancing provided us the flexibility to align our cash needs for our research and development investments to debt maturities over the next five years. In addition, we used a portion of the proceeds to buy back 55 million shares of our common stock, reducing our outstanding shares by over 7%. We also announced our agreement with LabCorp for the sale of select assets, which was a competitive process. And when completed, that will allow us to realign our business operations to focus on core markets and test offerings and to support our path to profitability at Bio-Reference. While while we are still within the review window with the Federal Trade Commission, we are diligent we're diligently working on the profit plan for Bio-Reference to ensure we get to breakeven and then profitability as quickly as possible. The LabCorp deal was the first large step in the multifaceted plan. Moving to our financial results for our Diagnostics segment, we reported revenue for Q1 2024 of 126.9 million compared with 132.4 million for the 2023 period. Cost of expenses decreased to 161.3 million for the first quarter of 2024 from 172.4 million for the 2023 period. Operating loss for our Diagnostics segment of 34.4 million included approximately 2.2 million of nonrecurring costs related to employee severance and programs associated with our efforts to return to profitability. Depreciation and amortization expense were 7.9 million and 8.7 million for the 2024 and 2023 periods, respectively. Revenues included approximately 27.8 million related to the book of business that is subject to our sale agreement with LabCorp. The costs and expenses related to this business were approximately 34.8 million. As part of the transaction Lab Corp has agreed to offer employment to more than 700 of our impacted employees who support this business. Moving to our pharmaceuticals segment, revenue decreased to $46.8 million for the first quarter of 2024 from 105.2 million for the comparable period of 23. Revenue from products, including our intellectual property and our international pharmaceutical businesses, decreased by 2.3 million, reflecting lower sales within our Israeli API business partially offset by higher sales of Rayaldee. Revenue from the transfer of IP was 8.7 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to $64.8 million for the 2023 quarter, which included an upfront payment of $50 million from Merck as a result of our EBV vaccine agreement as well as 9.5 million of milestone payments from our partners for Rayaldee during the first quarter of 2020 for Pfizer was able to substantially reduce the cost of manufacturing in general and by obtaining approval for a significant scale-up of their manufacturing process in order to support the global launch of And gentlemen, in turn, Pfizer has revalued its inventory on hand at December 31st and amortize that difference in manufacturing costs during the first four months of 2024, which is their standard accounting policy. As a result, our anticipated gross profit share for the first quarter was less than we anticipated, and we reported gross profit share from Pfizer of 5.8 million, which compares to 3.1 million for the 2023 period. Pfizer has obtained significant payer access in the U.S. in 2024 for Genvoya, and we look forward to the continued execution on their global commercialization plan. In addition, other revenue includes approximately $2.2 million from our underlying agreement with Varda, which offset R&D and of underlying support expenses for that program costs and expenses for our pharmaceutical segment were $74.5 million for the first quarter of 2024 compared to 86.3 million for the 2023 period. Research and development expenses for the first quarter of 2024 or $21.2 million compared to 31.9 million for the 2023 period. The 2023 quarter included the nonrecurring 12.5 million of expense related to our payment to Sanofi for their portion of our upfront payment from Merck. Partially offsetting this decrease were increased activities for MOX development programs. The resulting operating loss for the quarter ended March 31st, 2024 was 27.7 million compared to operating income of 19 million for the first quarter of 2023, which I previously mentioned, benefited from this 57.5 million of milestone payments received in the quarter. Amortization expense related to intangible assets were unchanged at $16.4 million for both periods. Turning to our consolidated results, the first quarter of 2024 reported an operating loss of 71.5 million compared with an operating loss of 30.6 million for the 2023 quarter. Net loss for the 2024 period included approximately 26.2 million related to the fair value change on an embedded derivatives related to our convertible notes issued in January. For both periods, we recorded non-cash unrealized gains on our investment in GDX of 22.7 and $16.8 million, respectively, for the 2024 and 2023 period. As a result, net loss for the first quarter of 2024 was $81.8 million or $0.12 per share. And this compares with a net loss of $18.3 million or $0.02 per share for the 2023 quarter. Looking ahead, we're providing the financial guidance with the following assumptions for our pharmaceutical segment. There are a number of factors that will continue to impact our gross profit share payments from Pfizer, including revenue from product sales from Gina troponin in general, global sales of Genotropin for the first quarter of 2024, as reported by Pfizer were 130 million, and Pfizer has not separately reported sales of Java. However, we have continued to observe consistent prescription growth globally for in general, as reported by IQVIA and Symphony. After adjusting for the expected accounting impact for the improved gross margins associated with the increased manufacturing scale of in general, we have revised our estimated gross profit share to be between 30 and 40 million versus our previous estimate of estimate of 40 to 50 million. We also assume a stable foreign exchange rate for our US ex U.S. pharmaceutical businesses, which will allow for continued profitable growth. R&d expenses for the second quarter of 2024 will really reflect higher activities related to our modem programs, including CMC and efforts to related to the initiation of our first immuno-oncology clinical trial. A portion of these increased activities will continue to be funded through our Varda agreement for our Diagnostics segment. As the timing of our closing for our LabCorp transaction is not yet certain subject to FTC review. We have not adjusted our guidance to remove this business from our second quarter estimates as we've outlined, we're working to align the business to achieve cash flow breakeven run rate by the middle of 2024 and profitability run rate by the end of the year, which are both subject to the timing of closing of our LabCorp transaction. This work continues to include consolidating our geographic footprint and rationalizing our testing offerings. As we expect our client mix to improve as our cost structure and our cost structure to appropriately support our go-forward strategy. During this transition phase, we expect consistent core testing volumes with a slight increase in the average price per patient collection amounts due to our revenue cycle management initiatives before considering any nonrecurring costs that may result from our restructuring activities and other nonrecurring expenses. We expect our costs and expense in Q2 to decline by approximately $5 million to approximately 154 to 157 million without giving effect to the approximately $35 million related to the assets as part of the LabCorp transaction. As a result, we expect the following for the second quarter of 2020 for total revenue between 180 to $187 million, revenue from services between 127 and $130 million, including 26 to $27 million from assets related to the LabCorp transaction. Revenue from product sales of 40 to $45 million and other revenue between 10 and 14 million including inclusive of the Pfizer gross profit share estimates, which are between seven and 10 million. We expect second quarter costs and expenses to be between 234 and 243 million. Again, excluding any nonrecurring expenses and expenses related to our restructuring of BioArray, it will also include approximately 20 to 26 million for R&D expense the range is based on the timing of certain CMC activities for our Mode X programs, as well as depreciation and amortization expense of 24 million. That concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you for your attention. And now, operator, let's open the call for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Maury Raycroft, Jefferies.', 'Maurice Raycroft', ""I am Thanks for taking my question. I was going to start with a question related to Bio-Reference. With the remaining Bio-Reference services business. It sounds like you plan to continue to streamline, optimize and grow that business with aim to get to profitability once the LabCorp deal closes, will you be able to provide more clarity into timing for getting to breakeven and profitability? And what's the longer-term strategy for maximizing value for both the services and pharma parts of the Company from a local EquiFirst question."", 'Adam Logal', ""Maury, thanks for the question. So the timing for us getting to breakeven is going to be tied to the LabCorp transaction. And we're not we're certainly not waiting for that as it relates to the rest of the business, and we're actively working down our fixed cost base, we're exiting and surface certain facilities and currently and which will help bring our fixed overhead. We're also continuing to really realign No. Our stated goal was to have no plans that would be executing to have us to run-rate cash cash flow breakeven midyear. I think we're still we're still working towards that. And obviously, if the FTC takes longer than expected them, then that could that could take longer. But otherwise and that's the path we're on."", 'Maurice Raycroft', 'Got it. Understood. And then for in general on, can you provide any more perspective or or clarity into the revised guidance there and the change in gross profit there?', 'Adam Logal', ""Sure. So overall, we've seen in general, the demand continue to be strong on a global basis where Pfizer has been in the market, the longest, obviously, it's continued to do to do the best. Really the change to guidance has to do with the accounting consequence of their of their revaluing some inventory they had on books and that flows through our gross profit share. And that has no reflection on the strength of the program just on the timing of when we're going to realize the benefits of of that improved gross gross margin that's coming from their scale-up data and understand and and maybe one question just on some of the Medex clinical assets. If there are specific catalysts this year that we should be focused on, in particular for two users or one moving into the clinic on. I don't know if there's anything more you can say about that study and when we could see initial data from."", 'Elias Zerhouni', ""I'll let Gary was underlined the CEO of Monex answer that specific question, Eric?"", 'Yvonne Briggs', ""Yes, we you know, as analysts and Phil mentioned, we have the green light to go. So we're at the moment setting up sites and are really looking to bring patients into the trial. I think the as Elliot said in his comments, we're hopeful this should happen by the end of the quarter, and we're working to make it happen sooner if possible, in terms of any clinical results, you know, as you probably know with whenever you're taking a new immune therapy into the clinic, have you started a low dose and you dose escalate really for safety reasons. And that's a plan that we've come to Kraft with the FDA. So I wouldn't be expecting to see any data on CERTAINLY efficacy know, at least for you and probably next year is the time frame and which you might expect to see some type have results."", 'Elias Zerhouni', 'Okay, understood.', 'Adam Logal', 'Thanks for taking my questions. Out back in the queue. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'And the next question comes from Carl with Ladenburg Thalmann at this stage to take your questions and good afternoon, a few from our end on. I was wondering if you could talk about in general and to keep paying for the additional studies as far as the couple of expanded label? So I mentioned is our closure or yourself.', 'Adam Logal', ""So the way our partnership works for those additional indications is we'll split the cost 50 50 with Pfizer, but we're not to the adult."", 'Elias Zerhouni', ""We're not necessarily expecting any additional studies, so just be their pediatric basket."", 'Phillip Frost', 'Okay, got it.', 'Elias Zerhouni', 'And for full year 24, what should we anticipate from Barda reimbursement?', 'Adam Logal', ""I know you called out 2.2 in the first quarter, should we extrapolate that and we would expect that to continue to ramp ramp up, Jeff. So that's part of the reason why the the R&D numbers going up, they're getting ready to do some some CMC activities, which will bump that number up. And just as a reminder, there's it was $2.2 million on the revenue line, the expense line is slightly less than that."", 'Phillip Frost', 'Okay.', 'Adam Logal', 'Got it.', 'Elias Zerhouni', ""That makes sense. And Adam, can you just clarify on the on the cash and debt, so it was 75.6 cash and to 30 plus 71 one on the debt side. That's right, Rio on both Henry and the on anticipated LabCorp closure, you're expecting by end of year, it sounds like back half and that will be till we have the gross number rises to 37 days off. Yes."", 'Adam Logal', 'I mean, the large unknown on the timing is just FTC. So once we clear the FTC, assuming we clear, the FTC will be working quickly with RailCorp the transaction.', 'Phillip Frost', 'Okay.', 'Yvonne Briggs', 'Got it.', 'Phillip Frost', ""You're feeling optimistic on the back half of the year."", 'Adam Logal', ""That's our expectation."", 'Phillip Frost', 'Okay.', 'Elias Zerhouni', 'And then on the fee, that those are also thanks for taking the questions.', 'Operator', 'Edward Tenthoff, Piper Sandler.', 'Edward Tenthoff', 'Okay.', 'Adam Logal', ""Thank you for taking my question to first, just a quick one on you had mentioned cost guidance for the second quarter of 2004 to 2 and I was writing furiously, but I didn't get the number to 43.7 to 43 or 34 to 34 to $0.43. Okay, great. Super helpful. And then just kind of a higher-level question appreciating on what Gary analysts are saying about and the more multi-specific antibody giving moving from. I think a first one is for hematologic cancers. If I'm not, we've taken orders up for solid tumors and at a higher level, what do you ultimately expect to do with these different modality assets of the 700 partner. Could that be further partner? Should we expect more partnerships like from Merck EVV. deal on? Do you expect to keep the cancer stop and generate some clinical data next year."", 'Elias Zerhouni', ""Higher-level commentary on sort of what software and I think what I have been on we have is that forgive the background noise. I think it's a solid tumor molecule that we're planning on entering into the clinic this quarter space, we do have a liquid tumor, a molecule, which we're actually discussing with several parties who are interested. I think in the grand scheme of things, we are interested, but we have a platform to bring it to actually two platforms the vaccine once they have a multi-specific model and we are eliciting a lot of interest. We are interested in partnering and especially in research collaboration that will be funded by third parties where we could develop more targets to enter a larger portion of the market than what we could afford on our own. So we wanted to leverage the platform was the ability for us to through results through the results we've already had with the EBV with the Phase one trispecific data. And hopefully with this one I think is going to generate momentum, our collaborations with partners and licensing that I think will increase our bandwidth. And I'll stop here. And Gary, if you have a lot to say on that on."", 'Yvonne Briggs', ""Yes, I think you said it well, Elliot, say a tad bit tricky. We're open to whatever makes sense in terms of advancing these products to approval and getting them to patients. I think and the advantage of having a platform is that we can take individual products and partner them with third parties, and then we can reserve some that they have higher value and your path forward for commercialization. We can take some of those into play as well."", 'Adam Logal', ""So at the end of the day, I would I suspect it will probably partner more and we will develop internally, but we're very open to collaborate so I think that makes a lot of sense to when you think about all the different arm factors and agents that you can engineer into the multi-specific antibody, you know, a big oncology group who really is doing that. You know, multiplex combinatorial analysis makes a lot of sense, a lot for you guys doing around. So I think you'd really be able to empower some of the bigger players who are looking at ways to combine these different mechanisms. So I really appreciate what you're saying about the partnering potential for that platform."", 'Elias Zerhouni', 'Thank you, sorry.', 'Adam Logal', 'Thank you. And the next question comes from Yale Jen with Laidlaw. Good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions. I two questions. There are regard to the motor a product to enter the clinic soon. First one is for the EBV virus, a vaccine.', 'Yvonne Briggs', ""And my question is there's also a competitor of what they're now also developing on the vaccine against the same target. So my question is that at least on theoretical grounds, how do you compare yours to that?"", 'Elias Zerhouni', ""But there are notes. And I have a follow-up question to you for the answers to both of them then were better. But I'll let Gary give you the specifics."", 'Adam Logal', ""I'm just kidding."", 'Yvonne Briggs', ""The fun. Well, you know, just to take a step back, my journey actually is delivering through mRNA almost the same gene products that we have managed to engineer onto the ferrets and nanoparticle, I'd say for the good of the patients it's actually a good thing to have more than one product out there being tested because one never knows how they will perform in the real world. I think what we like about our platform is the fact that it's a protein platform and we're using adjuvants that are well described with a safety profile that looks favorable in humans. The preclinical data in nonhuman primates and in our animal models is very strong. And so we're following a pretty well prescribed path with a nice set of ImmunoGen's where you know, I think we could and with great biomarkers when you're looking at and you of the viral loads and immune responses to the virus. So we feel pretty good about our products. I really don't want to get into the details of the alternative program. But what I will just say is the obvious, which is that they're using a different platform, they're using an mRNA platform that has some advantages in terms of going fast, but it has some unknowns, particularly with regard to side effects of the therapy and know as you begin to treat more and more patients with the vaccine, those issues become more and more important. And so there's no way to go on or gain or to have a crystal ball about which will work better I can. But we feel pretty good about the platform that we have and the partnership with Merck, where they have a real deep bench of the experts and knowledge for how to expand the trials and how to expand the reach of this vaccine to what we would ultimately like to address, which is the <unk>, is it the cause of cancer or the cancer on aspect of vaccine. So that I think that's the best I can do for you right now. Okay."", 'Adam Logal', ""Great. That's very helpful. That's a lot of details here. It's one well, in terms of the two zero zero one is any could you give us some detail about the study design may be what are the targets P being pursued by design Flowcast type target? Yes."", 'Yvonne Briggs', ""Yes, we we haven't formally disclosed the targets, but we will disclose them in the near future, probably within the next few weeks as we mine up to on enroll our first patient. But what I can tell you is that we've picked two on cell surface markers that are found on a number of solid tumors. There actually is a list of about 13 malignancies. They express these two antigens and they include lung, breast, prostate, pancreatic and the list goes on there. And there's of a fairly large number be tested. And we will in the initial stages, look at a variety of those tumor types, and we'll be looking for signs of some on tumor type where we might be seeing more efficacy. And then with time, if that bears out, we'll focus more on the tumor types where we're seeing efficacy and expand the trials in and those tumor types. Okay. Great."", 'Adam Logal', ""That's very helpful and congrats to move this program of the Group."", 'Yvonne Briggs', ""Thank you. We're very excited to see it get to patients. Yes."", 'Operator', 'And the next question comes from Yi Chen with H.C.', 'Yi Chen', 'Thank you for taking my questions.', 'Elias Zerhouni', 'Just to follow up on that and the X. 2001 of the solid Phase one solid tumor trial is a all-comer solid tumor trial, correct in how many patients do intend enroll grow for this trial?', 'Yvonne Briggs', ""On the IT, the trial is broken into two parts. So we have the Phase 1a and then a Phase Ib, I'd say in the Phase Ia will be the by the group where we will look at multiple different types. And then add after that point, we will begin to drill down on the ones where there's more activity, we expect to be able to make some decisions with approximately 40 or so patients in the first. Then that includes some dose escalation because we have to go slowly and on and we will do that again and agnostic to the tumor type. And then when we reach what we think we'll be close to a therapeutic level, assuming we don't see any side effects that would preclude further expansion than we would. I treat the large number."", 'Elias Zerhouni', ""And just to clarify, did you say that the results from the Phase one trial won't be available until 2026?"", 'Yvonne Briggs', ""I didn't really say that look when they would be available because I said probably not before next year's when I said earlier, and I I would stand by that. It does take a while to, you know, get to the point where you think you're in a therapeutic dose and then you have to enroll sufficient patients and then you have to follow them for a period of time. So expecting to see even early efficacy data, we certainly will have safety data, I think before the end of this year, that tells us what what doses and how well tolerated it is and patients. But I don't expect that we'll begin to start seeing signals and until well into next year."", 'Adam Logal', 'Got it.', 'Elias Zerhouni', 'And could you give us some idea of that? How many oncology candidates you intend you bring into clinical stage of development before the end 2020.', 'Yvonne Briggs', 'And I would say that we have it will be in the range of two to four. I think very likely there will be two that will be into the clinic by next year, then depending on some partnerships on what we may have opportunities to advance another two.', 'Adam Logal', 'Okay.', 'Elias Zerhouni', 'And for partnerships, is it is it likely that you will need to generate Phase two level proof of concept data to materialize partnerships here?', 'Yvonne Briggs', ""You know, I think that's the earliest you'd like to respond."", 'Elias Zerhouni', ""No, no, I wanted to just clarify that is very different in oncology is another area in oncology is our litigation. And so you don't need Phase two data to generate a partnership you need to have a basket trial and some demonstrable results in the Phase 1a and 1b beginning of two, which you don't need to do what you need to do in other areas as well. And I'm clear because Phase two to retract a major and a partner, we'd like to be a strategic buyer has gone down from. I don't know if you agree with that one."", 'Yvonne Briggs', ""And then I very much agree. I think that often in oncology you can begin to see signals in Phase one. And then it's in instances where you don't really just depends on the appetite of the partner and of our internal teams in terms of the you know, at what point we really want to make those transitions So I'd say the safe answer is somewhere between Phase one and Phase two data."", 'Operator', 'Mike Petusky, Barrington Research.', 'Mike Petusky', ""It's what I just wanted to ask about the few months away. Yes, we think we've got some data. We've got some evidence. Yes, low CKD progression. And I'm just curious, are your sales folks able to share this data, this evidence with nephrologists? Are there any anecdotal reactions that, hey, this is really compelling this name really matter. I mean, can you just give a sense of if there if there's if there's any sense this could really unlock this product going forward?"", 'Elias Zerhouni', ""Things haven't certainly I can expand on that. I mean, it's true that the data that we generated this year was very telling us from real-world evidence as well as from our own data. You could delay the onset of the dialysis by six months was not normal. Now in terms of the reception of that, with publishing obviously presented to KOLs and nephrologists, it really makes a difference because no other therapy of secondary hyperparathyroidism has shown the ability to introduce. And it shows also we have the biomarkers that really indicate which patients are the ones that I really welcome the Rayaldee to delay the onset of dialysis would realistically for etc. So the ask the sales force is out there yet for asthma. It's really talking to the early for the holidays. You see a lot of those late-stage CKD that are not likely to go into dialysis, but we also think is valid for CKD three patients. No, just for So great story and evolution. I think it reinforces the point that treating secondary hyperparathyroidism depression. And it does have an impact on the evolution of the disease, which was one of the questions we always had was a change outcomes and this is the answer that we announced so far and the data has been revenues and that's going to be. My next question comes from Matt Duncan."", 'Adam Logal', ""I have a follow up to that in terms of, okay, you get the to get the data published and you start talking to docs about this. I mean, how long how long you don't think fixed subtypes seem to move much slower than they things logically seem like they should in terms of changing behavior of prescribing behavior. Is this the kind of thing that, hey, it's still a good one. It's really good missionary effort a matter of years rather than quarters or two to really change behavior or if they are currently in businesses that I would like to."", 'Elias Zerhouni', ""Thank you. Absolutely. Are the right questions. I mean, if you know medicine medicine patterns among clinical guidelines take time to develop, I mean, you're talking about a year or two before they are going to make it to the guidelines. Like I mean, Rayaldee is in the guidelines now. So it's not a rapid process depending on the strength and the reception of the community of the files, you suggest that it may be faster or slower, but it's not a matter of a quarter or two. It will take time to develop All right."", 'Adam Logal', 'Very good. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And this concludes the question and answer session. And I would like to turn the floor back to Dr. Phillip Frost for any closing thoughts.', 'Phillip Frost', 'I just wanted to thank everybody for participating and for your very good questions and discussion.

The S&P 500, one of the leading stock indexes in the world, gained 10.2% in the first three months of 2024, achieving its best first-quarter performance in five years. The impressive performance sparked greater interest among investors in the stock market. In March, investors poured roughly $50 billion into funds focused on purchasing stocks in the US, as reported by EPFR Global Data. That said, it is important to bear in mind that it is the bigger companies that are driving the market upward, especially those that are attentive to the ongoing artificial intelligence wave. The ‘Magnificent Seven’ accounted for 40% of the market’s overall gains in the first three months, according to data by S&P Dow Jones Indices. Meta’s remarkable returns of over 40% during the period were massively driven by the company’s announcement of its first-ever dividend earlier this year.', 'Dividends play an important role in the investment landscape, with approximately 80% of the companies in the S&P 500 paying dividends to shareholders.

In fact, just 13% of the companies in the index are included in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, an elite group that tracks the performance of companies growing their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. Investors also favor dividend growth stocks due to their strong performance over the years, particularly during periods of high interest rates. In our article titled 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we cited Abrdn’s data and reported that from December 2002 to December 2022, dividend growers and initiators delivered a compounded return of 10.68%, compared with a 2.70% return of dividend cutters and eliminators.

You're listening to Motley Fool Money. I'm Ricky Mulvey, joined today by Matt Frankel. Matt, thanks for being here."", ""Matt Frankel: Thanks for having me. I'm excited too. We're in my favorite part of earnings seasons right now."", 'Ricky Mulvey: Why is that?', ""Matt Frankel: It's all the companies that I follow like the two we're about to discuss today, but this week it's crazy. I'm going to be working till 10:00 P.M. everyday this week."", ""Ricky Mulvey: There you go. The reason why we've called you here, we got PayPal and Kinsale, which are two companies you follow closely and maybe for a listener, one of them is a lot more known than the other. So let's start with PayPal, which reported this morning. This was the third call for the new CEO, Alex Chriss. He's still early in his tenure, but do you think he's starting to deliver on that promise he made in the first call to make PayPal a much more focused and profitable company?"", ""Matt Frankel: The short answer is yes, but it's also important to know that Alex Chriss isn't just the only new part of the team. PayPal literally got rid of its entire C-suite. Alex Chriss started his tenure in September and everyone else on the key leadership team is newer than him. Some started in January of this year, some are just being appointed now. I think they just added another key board member this past week. It's a really interesting time. It's really rare that a company of this size and this dominance at what did those just like wipe the slate clean and brings in a totally new management team. But on the efficiency question, absolutely. This is what was the big surprise to me in the quarter. There were two big surprises, this was one of them, is that PayPal's revenue grew by 9% year over year. It's earnings per share grew by 27% year over year. Anytime you see earnings from an already profitable company growing that much quicker than the top line, they're doing something right when it comes to efficiency."", ""Ricky Mulvey: They're also doing hundreds of billions of dollars in payment volume, so those percentages become a little bit harder to come by. Chriss is an outspoken CEO. In this call, he took some pot shots at the previous administration of PayPal for essentially their relationships with small to medium sized businesses. He called out Zoom for being a company in stagnation. Usually, you hear leaders say, this is a company we want to be like. We want to be like the Taiwan Semiconductor of artificial intelligence, and in this case you have Chriss saying, look at Zoom, they stagnated and that's exactly what we don't want to be like. He's got this more, I would say, deliberate, straightforward approach than you see in a lot of CEOs."", ""Matt Frankel: He came from the small and medium sized business world. He was CEO of Intuit, if you're not familiar, which is the company behind QuickBooks, which is the small business accounting software package. It's not surprising that that's a key focus area of his. He's absolutely right that PayPal just completely stagnated. The previous management strategy was generally that we're going to keep growing our user-base forever and ever until every person in the world uses PayPal. That clearly didn't pan out. Then they had a disjointed strategy. I don't know if you remember when they were going to acquire Pinterest."", ""Ricky Mulvey: I've heard the stories."", 'Matt Frankel: Then just scrapped it because everybody who heard it was just like, why? It was just really a disjointed strategy. They abandoned their core growth strategy, which like you said, small and medium-sized businesses, and were just throwing spaghetti at the wall to see what sticks.', ""Ricky Mulvey: It has a couple of powerful tools over at PayPal, they didn't need Pinterest. Let's do a menu of topics of what was talked about in the quarter and then you can pick from the menu what stood out to you. Here's a few of them. Number 1 is, Chriss is trying to grow the fraud prevention services, which Chriss called best-in-class, its key differentiator. They inked a deal with DraftKings for fraud prevention. There was a 21% increase in users on the Venmo debit card. It's working on linking that to Google Pay and Apple Pay. I would say reporting thing that stands out to me is that PayPal is now reporting stock-based compensation as a part of non-GAAP metrics, which is going to change a lot of those comparisons, but gives a lot more clarity to those investing in the company. Hey, we got to stablecoin. How about that? PY USA, they're hoping to eliminate fees on those cross-border transactions for users on Venmo. Then active accounts grew sequentially, which is a little bit of a reversal from recent trends. There's your menu board, Matt Frankel, which would you like to order from?"", ""Matt Frankel: Well, let's start with the two different Venmo topics: that was the Venmo debit card and the stablecoin. Venmo has been an area that PayPal has struggled to monetize for a long time. It's a big part of its payment volume. I want to say it's roughly one-fourth of the company's entire payment volume, which one-fourth of $1.6 trillion of annualized volume, that's not nothing. They've really had a hard time figuring out the best ways to monetize that. The Venmo debit card is huge because they will get some take rate from each transaction there. It's not just like if I Venmo you some money, they really don't make any money off that transaction. It's a really good way to monetize. The stablecoin, we can talk all day about my thoughts on cryptocurrencies and stablecoins and things like that. Cross-border transactions are expensive. This is why credit cards with no foreign transaction fees do so well in the marketplace. Anything you could do to eliminate that charge and maybe even increase your own margins by being able to offer that as a back-end on their infrastructure is being able to move money around for free. It's something that I'm excited to see develop and it sounds like another piece of the efficiency puzzle."", ""Ricky Mulvey: I think it's easy to dunk on the stablecoin, but if they can solve a lot of those cross-border transactions, that's huge. Also, among its competition, I'm more willing to trust that PayPal has $1 to backup every single one of their PY USA's or at least they can make good on it. I know you want to talk about the active accounts though, because that's a part of the story that's not getting covered a ton, but I know stands out to you."", ""Matt Frankel: The headline number, is that the number of active accounts on PayPal declined by 1% year over year, which is about 4 million people. But that doesn't really tell the full story. PayPal had four consecutive quarters quarter-over-quarter declines in their user base. This is the first time in the past five quarters where they were reported a sequential growth of about a million use active users quarter-over-quarter. That's especially big in the first quarter because it's bad seasonality trends. A lot of people are active in the fourth-quarter for holiday purposes, in simple terms, and drop-off the platform in the first quarter. Even including that, they net added active users this quarter, which is a nice reversal."", ""Ricky Mulvey: I'm a PayPal shareholder, so I'm bringing in some bias to this next question about to ask you. PayPal, they raised revenue guidance which they got hit for in the past for, for essentially lowering it, they expanded the operating margin, they're adding users. What's going on with the market? It's just a completely lukewarm reaction to these results."", ""Matt Frankel: The biggest raise they made was actually earnings guidance because they had in their fourth-quarter report expected earnings to be roughly flat this year. Now they're saying a mid to high single-digit percentage growth. That's a pretty big adjustment. But the question is, is this just one time efficiency adjustments that the new CEO is making? Obviously, more earnings is better than less earnings. Now, if their full-year guidance comes true, PayPal trades for something like 11 times times earnings right now, it's a really cheap stock. You would expect a bigger reaction, especially when you're considering not only the earnings growth, but the top and bottom-line beats this quarter. You have the accounting change, which I love the accounting change, we got to hit that in a minute. The return to growth in the active user base, you would expect a better reaction. I'm a PayPal shareholder too, and I expect a better reaction."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Let's hit the accounting change because I can't title the episode: PayPal Makes an Accounting Change, but why is this something that the investors should care about?"", ""Matt Frankel: Well, they changed the way that they report adjusted earnings. A lot of commentators, including Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger, have always looked down on adjusted metrics because they don't really take everything into account that actually is a cost. PayPal specifically, and this is the only time I've heard of it, maybe you've heard of other companies doing this, they're now reporting stock-based compensation as part of their adjusted earnings. Normally, that's the adjustment that you see these tech companies make the lake their earnings look better than they are. But now PayPal they're owning it. They're saying here's what we're paying our people. It's not just that they made the accounting change, they're actually adjusting their incentive plan to better align with shareholder interest. Not just, here's your paying in stock, we're going to give you more stock if you deliver returns for shareholders. I love these changes. I hope other companies follow this lead because we're not the only ones who think it should be included in earnings. It is an expense, so I'm happy to see it."", ""Ricky Mulvey: It's something that might hurt the models, but Chriss was talking about on the earnings call, they're saying, we're not going to hide this. We're a pay for performance culture and so we're going to highlight it. I want to move to Kinsale because this is another, what I would describe as a befuddling market reaction. I know Kinsale is familiar to us, but for those listening who haven't heard of it, this is a company that focuses on excess and surplus insurance for your hard-to-reach places. If you're a business or an event and you have a tough time finding insurance, Kinsale will help you. Think about if you want to host an equestrian event inside of a weed dispensary, Kinsale will help you with the insurance for that. Why should you care from what we're about to talk about? Well, Matt on Twitter was saying, this is a massive buying opportunity, so we're going to find out why. But let's focus on the business first. The company is getting beaten up essentially because of the slowdown in growth of its premiums. But it's also getting a lot more in terms of investment income. That's the table. What's going on with this business right now, Matt?"", ""Matt Frankel: The investment income, that's not really their doing. You really can't give the company credit for that. That's like saying, my savings account is making five times what it was two years ago. I didn't do anything smart, the interest rates went up. Kinsale, like you mentioned, they're in specialty insurance. The key thing to know about that business, one, it's really hard to do, which is why they have companies like Kinsale, and you can't just go to Progressive if you have a demolition business or something else, that's really hard to insure. These companies exist because they're good at what they do and if you're good at it, it's very profitable. Most insurers are happy with an underwriting margin of 3-5%, and then they make the rest of their money on investments. Kinsale's underwriting margin averages more than 20%. I think it's something like seven times the industry average, it's just their underwriting margin before we even get into investments. It was a slowdown in growth, if you want to call it that, but it was. Gross written premium growth was 26% versus 34% year over year in the previous quarter, net investment income you mentioned it was up 59% year-over-year. It was up 71% in the previous quarter. In my opinion, this is the big reason we saw the reaction that we did. The combined ratio, which is an indicator of underwriting profit, went from 72.1%, subtract that from 100, you get your underwriting profit so lower is better to 79.5%. About 7.4% jump in the wrong direction in the combined ratio, and that's why I think the market reacted the way it did."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Quickly, underwriting profit, essentially. What's that mean?"", ""Matt Frankel: If I'm an insurance company, I collect a $1,000 in premium, some of that's going to get paid out as claims. That's what you call your loss ratio and some of it's going to be used to just run the business, after paying my office rent things like that. Add the two of those together, you get your combined ratio. Whatever is left after your combined ratio is your underwriting profit, so 100% of your money, if your combined ratio is 90% the other 10% will be your underwriting profit. Kinsale's underwriting profit, put in more simple terms, went from about 28% to about 20%."", ""Ricky Mulvey: The other trend that's going on here, and I haven't seen a lot of discussion about this, is the rise of seeded written premiums, which essentially means that Kinsale is transferring their policies to a reinsurer to someone else. What's going on with this? Why are they spending so much more money on reinsurance right now?"", ""Matt Frankel: That's not necessarily a terrible thing. It's like a sportsbook, laying off some of the action it receives. Insurances is an inherently risky business, specialty insurance is riskier than most and reinsurance policies are used to cap an insurer's losses. A lot of it could be because we're entering peak hurricane season. A lot of insurers get scared when you get through the second and third quarter because that's when all the natural disasters tend to happen. I don't know if that's what the management is thinking there, but they're definitely shifting some money into reinsurance, and it's a common part of the insurance business. You don't want a natural disaster to wipe out your business. You want to make your losses manageable and if that means spending a little more on reinsurance, then so be it. By the way, that combined ratio under 80% is still pretty great, just so investors know."", 'Ricky Mulvey: Then finally, you went out on the X platform, the platform formerly known as Twitter. Calling this dip on these results, a massive buying opportunity, lay out the thesis. Why is this a massive buying opportunity for Kinsale Capital?', ""Matt Frankel: Well, even if it slows down 26% growth, it's still growth. Even if your underwriting margin dropped to 20%, that's still seven times what the average insurers making. Now, the biggest reason for this reaction is because Kinsale is generally priced for perfection. They've a great history of under-promising and over-delivering. Just for example, Kinsale trades for about 25 times forward earnings and about seven times sales. I own another insurer called MetLife. I'm sure you've heard of them. They trade for less than one-time sales and have an eight times forward earnings multiple. There are very expensive insurer relative to their peers, priced for a lot of growth and I think that slowdown in growth is scaring people, but it shouldn't. There's a lot of investment income that's embedded in the portfolio that we haven't seen yet. These are mostly fixed-income security, so as they roll over to today's interest rates, you're going to see that investment income climb even further. I think there's a lot of unlocked potential on that side of the business. I like what they're doing in their investment portfolio. They are putting more money in investments like common stocks, like a Berkshire Hathaway would. Not a giant portion of their portfolio, but a lot and I love the management team, they're the only pure-play in specialty insurance in the space, and they have about a 1.1% share of the market right now. If you think that they can't keep up that 26% growth rate, they can."", ""Ricky Mulvey: It's a good place to end it. Matt Frankel, appreciate your time and your insight on this one."", 'Matt Frankel: Always glad to be here.', 'Ricky Mulvey: How do you find a financial advisor, and what should you ask them? Alison Southwick and Robert Brokamp offer up some questions to ask in that very first meeting.', ""Alison Southwick: There comes a time and everyone's life when they need a little help and your finances are no different. Maybe you've heard bro over the years say stuff like, I'm Robert Brokamp, if you've had a major life event, it might make sense for you to talk to a professional fee-only advisor."", 'Robert Brokamp: Is that what I sound like?', ""Alison Southwick: No, but that is what strong dads sounds like. Anyway, this sounds easy enough. But we've heard from plenty of people over the years who struggled to find a good financial advisor they could trust. Today we're going to tackle this topic. Bro, when should you enlist the help of a financial advisor?"", ""Robert Brokamp: I would put it in two broad categories. One is you're mostly a do-it-yourself, but you just want a second opinion, or you're about to experience a big life event. Maybe every 5-10 years you want just to make sure that your retirement plan is on track, or you're getting close to retirement, and you want to make sure you have all your bases covered, or you may have just one big question you'd like help to answer. One of my favorite personal finance columnist is Christine Benz at Morningstar. She knows about as much as anyone about financial planning. But when she and her husband were trying to determine whether they should get long-term care insurance, how to take care of long-term care. They hired a fee-only financial planner to help with that decision. Basically, you just want occasional help, but the other situation is you don't want to be mostly a do-it-yourself, you want an expert to be helping you along the way every day, though maybe not your entire portfolio. It couldn't be because you're just very busy with your career, and your family, and you don't have the time to become a financial planning and investing expert in your spare time. Or it might be because you're getting up there in years, and you want to begin a relationship with a financial advisor now in case something happens to you, especially if you're the person who primarily handles the finances for the family."", 'Alison Southwick: Not all financial professionals are alike in their credentials, qualifications or expertise. How about you break it down for us? What are our options here?', ""Robert Brokamp: It's very confusing because you'll hear a lot of terms, and they're almost meaningless. Financial advisor, financial planner, financial consultant, wealth advisor, wealth coach. Because there aren't many regulations, just about anyone can call themselves a financial advisor. The main differentiation I think to look for is whether someone is a broker, which means they sell products, or a registered investment advisor who is required to act as a fiduciary. We'll talk about this a little bit more later on. But a fiduciary is someone who is legally obligated to put your interests first. You would think that all financial professionals should be held to that standard, but that's not the case. The other thing to look for is designations, and there are a bunch, so I'm just going to highlight the biggest. For financial planning the granddaddy of them all is certified financial planner designation requires you to take six classes, pass a pretty hard exam and have three years of experience. One that is gaining more popularity is the Chartered Financial Consultant. You'll see it as CHFC behind someone's name. Also, you have to take classes, one more class than the CFP designation have to have experience, you don't have to pass an exam. If you're looking for someone who's a real investment expert, the thing to look for there is the chartered financial analyst or CFA. My opinion, that is by far the hardest one to get. You have to pass three very difficult exams. I know many very smart people who failed one or more of those exams until they eventually passed it and got it. Taxes, of course, you're looking for a certified public accountant CPA but some of them also have another designation called the personal financial specialists or PFS, which basically means there are tax expert, but they also know financial planning. They are very knowledgeable about many aspects of your finances. If you're looking for someone to help you with insurance decisions, you are looking for the chartered life underwriter or CLU, which is a designation that shows you know something about life insurance, estate planning, maybe business planning, so those are the biggest. You'll find plenty of other ones. Some are meaningful, some are not. The key is to look at the requirements in terms of classes, in terms of experience and whether they had to pass any exams."", 'Alison Southwick: Where do you find them?', ""Robert Brokamp: Well, I'll start with the one everyone starts with, and that is referrals. You talk to people you know, you talk to professionals, you work with your attorney or accountant, see who they recommend. The only thing I would say about referrals, though, is that in my experience a lot of people are very happy with their financial advisor. But then when I asked them questions about what the financial advisor does, the financial advisor, actually, is very good. They just like the person, and they're not knowledgeable enough to know that they're not getting good service. But still, referrals are a good place to start. But really since the early days of the Motley Fool, we have recommended that you look for a fee-only financial planner. Most of these fee-only financial planners, first of all, they are paid for their service. They don't sell your products, and they are fiduciaries. There are a few places to find these people. The first I'm going to mention is the one I know the best, Garrett Planning Network started by Sheryl Garrett. I've known Sheryl for many years, she was very kind enough to let me attend her conferences here in there, so I've gotten to know a lot of their members. In fact, I spoke with their current Managing Director, Eileen Freiberger, got some input from other financial planners, Christopher Lazaro, just to get the insider view with input on this episode. That's a place to start. There's also the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors or NAPFA, and the XY Planning Network. You'll find that there are planners who belong to two or all of these networks because they're all fee-only financial planners. Most of them will manage money for you, but many of them will also just do projects and charge by the hour or the project. Then finally, I'll just add, if you work with a financial services firm that you're happy with, like Vanguard, Fidelity, Schwab, T. Rowe Price, all of them provide wealth management and financial planning services, so you could look to them, but just expect that many of their solutions will be their own products. If you're going to have your money managed by Vanguard, chances are they're going to put all your money in Vanguard funds, so there is a little bit of a conflict of interests there."", 'Alison Southwick: Not only do financial professionals have different scopes of work, some might be absolute crux, sorry to say it. Some might be incentivized to align their own pockets, some might be in competent, some might be right for someone else, but not so right for you. How do you evaluate these people?', ""Robert Brokamp: Well, first of all, you want to make sure they're not crux, and there are a couple of ways to do that. You could check what is called broker check offered by FINRA. It's brokercheck.finra.org. FINRA is the self-regulatory organization for brokers. Then there's the investment advisor public disclosure website offered by the SEC, that is advisorinfo.sec.gov. You check them. You first of all, we'll find out whether that person is registered, in what states they are registered, and if there have been any complaints. If someone has been in the business long enough, they might have one or two complaints, but you just want to see what those complaints are and make sure that they were resolved. If someone says that they have a certain designation, go to the website of the governing board of that designation to make sure they actually have it. If they don't have a designation, you might still go to that website because in some situations someone had the designation, but they lost it due to some ethics violation and you'll find that on the website, so go to the website of the board or the certified financial planners and CFAs. If you're going to work with attorney, go to the website of the state Bar Association to make sure that everything is fine there, do those checks. But then once you have gone through these various processes, you should identify and interview multiple planners, and they will likely allow you to do what's something called a get-acquainted meeting where you talk for maybe a half-hour or so and just to make sure that they can provide what you're looking for and that you're comfortable with working with them."", ""Alison Southwick: Let's go through some questions you'll want to ask in this meeting, as well as the answers that you're going to want to hear. The first question to ask is, what are your qualifications/credentials? Maybe don't say this lash."", ""Robert Brokamp: [laughs] Obviously they'll probably highlight some of the designations they have. They'll highlight their experience, maybe talk about how they became a financial professional. That's always an interesting question to what brought you to becoming a financial professional. There are some things that they may have that are not listed on their website. For example, for me personally, I got my masters in personal financial planning. That would be something you would look for and what was their education. But really what you're looking for the comfortability that you find with them talking about their qualifications. Do you feel comfortable that they know enough to provide what you're looking for?"", 'Alison Southwick: Next question. Are you a fiduciary?', ""Robert Brokamp: We touched on this a little bit. The tricky part about fiduciary is you can be a fiduciary in many ways. You might be a fiduciary because you work for a firm that is a fiduciary like a registered investment advisory firm. You could be a fiduciary because of the designation you have. Your firm may not be required you to be a fiduciary, but for example, if you have these certified financial planner designation, you are expected to act as a fiduciary. Then there are circumstances in which you have to act as a fiduciary. The Department of Labor just passed a rule that said, if you are advising someone on their rollover from a 401K to an IRA, starting this September, you have to act as a fiduciary. Part of it is going to happen this September, another part next September. Expect that the industry is going to protest this, especially the insurance industry, so we'll see if it happens. But what you're looking for is for them to explain whether they are fiduciary, whether they understand what a fiduciary is. There are circumstances in which you might find a very good financial advisor who's not technically a fiduciary. What you're looking for there is that she or he is explaining to you in such that they are looking out for your best interests."", ""Alison Southwick: Next question is to ask, how are you compensated and what are the all-in costs I'll be paying?"", ""Robert Brokamp: This is where the difference between like a fee-only planner and broker really comes in. Sometimes the solutions someone provides will generate a commission for them. You just want to be very clear that the advice you're getting is the best thing for you and not the thing that is going to generate the biggest commission. You want to understand how they are getting paid, so you can understand any potential conflicts of interest. These days more people are charging an assets under management fee. The average is about 1%. It's usually a little bit higher if you have a smaller account, smaller being 250,000, and it's usually lower if you have over a $1 million. But even in that situation, you want to find out is that the only fee? Because if you are paying the advisor 1% a year to manage the money, but then they put you in mutual funds or separately managed accounts that charge another 1%, in that case, the all-in cost is 2%, so you want to be very clear about that. Now, if you are looking for just a onetime analysis or a onetime financial plan, you're going to have to pay by the hour or by the project. The fees on that are going to vary based on the experience of the planner as well as the city they live in, but expect to pay anywhere $100-$500 an hour or on a project basis, a $1,000 to $10,000, again, based on the person's experience, but also the complexity of your plan."", ""Alison Southwick: Next question to ask is, what's your investment philosophy?"", ""Robert Brokamp: If you're going to have someone to manage your money, you want to make sure that you are at least mostly on the same page. You'll find that many fee-only financial planners are pretty committed indexers, is not exclusively, but a lot of them are. If you are an active stock picker, you don't want to choose a financial advisor who's just going to put you in index funds unless you are looking for something besides wealth management. I'll just point out when I was talking to Eileen Freiberger about trying to find a financial advisor, she said that often many people from many readers are members of The Motley Fool reach out to them and they're looking for advice about stocks, their portfolio and stuff like that. Many of the folks at the Garrett Network don't look at individual stocks so much. It's just important that you are finding someone who could provide what you're looking for."", 'Alison Southwick: These are all great questions. I know one red flag that I saw when we were researching this is that your advisors should actually do more listening than talking.

That's because many companies in the sector weren't profitable in their early stages, and needed to save coin to maintain their businesses. The ones that became successful often stuck to that policy, choosing to prioritize activities like research and development. The hope was that investors would be satisfied simply with a rising stock price."", ""That's no longer the norm as the top tech companies on the scene are well-established, habitually profit-making, and frequently able to generate big piles of cash. Two incumbents that have declared dividend increases based on this solid foundation are International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM). Let's take a brief look at both."", ""IBM was a tech company before tech companies existed to any meaningful degree. Its origins stretch back to 1911 as a business selling recordkeeping and tabulation equipment for corporate clients. Very soon after that, it began paying a regular quarterly dividend, and it hasn't let up since."", ""These days it declares consistent, if incremental, dividend raises once annually. The 2024 version was a bump of $0.01 per share, as in previous years. IBM's new quarterly distribution is $1.67 per share."", ""Any business that has navigated all sorts of economies and emerged from more than one world war has done so by being flexible. Over the years, IBM's business has morphed -- it's been a leading manufacturer of personal computers, later it became a major player in the IT consultancy space, and these days it's concentrating on its hybrid cloud computing offerings and making a concentrated push into artificial intelligence (AI)."", ""It's sensible to operate in these high-demand segments, and IBM as a company and a stock has generally been doing well. Yes, investors traded out of the shares following the company's latest quarterly earnings report, but that felt like a case of inflated expectations. The stock had zoomed nearly 50% higher over the past year, after all. IBM's revenue rose, if not spectacularly, while management did a fine job of lifting the bottom line."", ""I can see more future improvements in the fundamentals, especially in AI, where the company's consulting contracts are already worth over $1 billion. IBM is positioning itself to be a major force in this technology, and history shows it's usually successful when it marshals its considerable resources to attack a market."", ""IBM's dividend raise will take effect with the first $1.67-per-share payout, which is set to be distributed on June 10 to investors of record as of May 10. At the most recent closing share price, it would yield a relatively generous 4%."", ""Qualcomm doesn't have the long history of IBM, but it's been a reliably regular quarterly dividend payer for more than 20 years. It matches IBM in its habit of declaring dividend raises every year, the latest being a 6% increase to $0.85 per share."", ""Qualcomm's main stock in trade is chipsets for smartphones. Given the company's very strong presence in this space, it's likely you've got its components packed into your beloved iPhone or Galaxy as we speak. Qualcomm is also active in the next-generation automotive market and the Internet of Things (IoT) sphere. Finally, it earns money from licensing its numerous patents."", ""Of these, it's the smartphone market that's the largest and sturdiest, and automotive that's growing the fastest. The company's just-released fiscal second-quarter results show 1% year-over-year growth in the phone segment to almost $6.2 billion. IoT, alas, isn't doing so hot; its top line slumped by 11% to $1.2 billion. Thankfully, licensing landed in positive territory with a 2% rise to $1.3 billion."", ""The automotive segment, on the other hand, really was quite the race car as far as revenue was concerned. Thanks to the success of its Snapdragon Ride assisted driving platform, the segment's take grew a powerful 35% to $603 million. Yes, that's a small portion of total company revenue now, but automobiles are rapidly becoming more sophisticated, and reliable tech is sorely needed for smartening them up."", 'So in short, Qualcomm is still managing to squeeze out growth from its two traditional business lines.

A: (Udit Batra - President, CEO & Director) The improved funnel activity is primarily due to higher quality orders across all segments, particularly in pharma and biotech in Europe and the U.S. The expectation is that this will translate into actual orders later in Q2 and more significantly in the second half of the year, following historical revenue patterns of a 45-55 split between H1 and H2.', 'Q: Can you elaborate on the end market performance, particularly in the Americas, and any changes in the outlook for the year? A: (Amol Chaubal - Senior VP & CFO) The performance in the Americas was slightly below expectations, but overall, the guidance remains unchanged as the company has derisked other areas of the guide. The focus remains on executing well in China and maintaining stable performance in other regions.', 'Q: How is the Wyatt acquisition progressing, and why was there a slight adjustment in the M&A contribution expectations? A: (Amol Chaubal - Senior VP & CFO) The Wyatt acquisition is progressing well, with synergies being realized faster than expected. The slight adjustment in M&A contribution from 1.3% to 1.1% is due to minor timing shifts in instrument deliveries, but overall, the acquisition is performing well.', 'Q: Regarding the pharma performance in China, can you discuss the impact of the BIOSECURE Act and the performance of Tier 1 versus Tier 2 and 3 CDMOs? A: (Amol Chaubal - Senior VP & CFO) The pharma market in China is stabilizing, with no new significant downturns. The BIOSECURE Act has not had a new impact as the market had already adjusted to previous changes. The performance across different tiers of CDMOs remains consistent with these adjustments.', 'Q: Could you provide more insight into the expected impact of the China stimulus on the business and the types of instruments and industries that might benefit? A: (Udit Batra - President, CEO & Director) The China stimulus is broad and covers various industries, not just academia. Waters is actively working with customers on proposals as they learn more about the stimulus details. The impact of the stimulus is expected to be more psychological initially, improving CapEx spending confidence, particularly in replacing aging LC fleets.', 'For the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.', 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

This robust financial performance is underpinned by a disciplined approach to cost management and operational efficiency. Waters Corp's ability to generate significant cash flows from operations, which totaled $262.9 million for the quarter, provides the company with the financial flexibility to invest in growth initiatives, manage debt, and return value to shareholders. The company's balance sheet reflects a solid foundation, with total stockholders' equity amounting to $1.26 billion as of March 30, 2024."", ""Declining Sales and Market Pressures: Waters Corp (NYSE:WAT) experienced a notable 7% decrease in net sales in the first quarter of 2024, with product sales taking a significant hit. This decline is attributed to lower customer demand across most major regions, signaling potential market saturation or increased competition. The company's mass spectrometry instrument systems, which are higher-priced, were particularly impacted by the cautious capital spending of customers. Furthermore, the decrease in sales volume has put pressure on the company's operating income, which declined by 23% compared to the first quarter of 2023. These factors suggest that Waters Corp may need to reevaluate its market strategies and explore new avenues for growth to counteract the downward sales trend."", ""Increased Expenses and Operational Challenges: The first quarter of 2024 saw Waters Corp grappling with increased expenses, including costs associated with the Wyatt acquisition, severance-related costs from workforce reductions, and litigation settlement provisions. These additional expenses have eroded the company's operating income and could impact its profitability if not managed effectively. Moreover, the company's instrument system sales declined by 20%, indicating operational challenges in meeting market demand or adapting to changing customer preferences.

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Caspar Tudor, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.', 'Caspar Tudor', ""Thank you, Ivy. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Waters Corporation First Quarter Earnings Call. Today, I'm joined by Dr. Udit Batra, Waters' President and Chief Executive Officer; and Amol Chaubal, Waters' Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I will cover the cautionary language. I would like to first point out that our earnings release and the slide presentation supplementing today's call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. In this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future results and commentary on potential market and business conditions that may impact Waters Corporation over the second quarter of 2024 and full year 2024. These statements are only our present expectations and actual events or results may differ materially. For more details, please see the risk factors included in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, our Form 10-Qs and the cautionary language included in this morning's earnings release. During today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including in our discussions of the results of operations. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are attached to our earnings release issued this morning and in the appendix of our presentation, which are available on the company's website. Unless stated otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 in organic constant currency terms.

Finally, we do not intend to update our guidance, predictions or projections, except as part of a regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release or as otherwise required by law. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Udit to deliver our key remarks, then Amol will provide a more detailed look at our financial results. After, we will open the phone lines to take questions. Udit?"", 'Udit Batra', ""Thank you, Caspar, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong start to the year with sales coming in at the high end of our expectations backed again by excellent operational performance. I want to begin today's call by thanking my colleagues for their continued focus on innovation and supporting our customers. These results reflect our drive to accelerate the benefits of pioneering science with our innovative portfolio. In the first quarter, market conditions were as expected, with cautious customer spending and later than typical budget releases. But as budgets opened up, we executed well with sales landing at the high end of our guide. We also continued to deliver outstanding operational results. Earnings were above our guidance and margins expanded even with volume and FX headwinds. This is a testament to our team, our resilient business model and our operational initiatives. Waters is well positioned for future growth in our attractive secular end markets. In the first quarter, we added to our revitalized portfolio with new products that serve high-growth areas. Turning now to our results. In the first quarter, sales landed at the high end of our guidance, declining 7% as reported and 9% in organic constant currency. Our non-GAAP earnings per share exceeded our guidance at $2.21. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $1.72. Outside of China, sales declined mid-single digits as expected. In China, sales declined just under 30%, which was better than expected. Growth remained weak as our prior year baseline does not reflect last year's deterioration in market conditions, which became more pronounced in the second half. While instruments declined 25% overall, LC sales were slightly better than expected, instrument weakness was led by mass spec, particularly for A&G-related applications, which had a tough prior year comparison from global funding and the China stimulus. Wyatt delivered a 3% M&A contribution to sales. We continue to see strong synergy performance and traction for our recently launched products such as ZetaStar. Now I will talk more about our operational performance. We believe the best reflection of good operational execution is effective margin management, particularly when things slow down. While facing significant headwinds from volume, FX and inflation, we delivered yet another strong margin result. Our gross margin expanded 40 basis points to 58.9%, and our operating margin expanded 20 basis points for the quarter to 27%. This was achieved through a combination of our operational management initiatives across pricing, productivity and proactive cost alignment. These initiatives position us well for resilience during lower volume periods and give longer-term opportunity when market conditions normalize. You can see further evidence of our operational performance and our free cash flow. We had an exceptional start to the year, generating free cash flow of USD 234 million in the first quarter, which was 37% of sales. With our excellent free cash flow profile, we made rapid progress in delevering from the Wyatt acquisition, as we approach its 1-year anniversary. We serve attractive secular end markets where testing volume plays a pivotal role in our business. This volume, which is correlated with global prescription consumption is expected to accelerate in the future, supporting our strong long-term growth outlook. Our distinct advantage in downstream applications lines with our full ecosystem of products that complement our innovative instrument portfolio. In addition, we have strategically aligned with high-growth opportunities that further enhance our core position. We had a busy quarter launching several new products that support a number of exciting, high-growth areas. At Analytica, last month, we launched the Alliance iS Bio, a version of our groundbreaking next-generation liquid chromatography platform suited for biologics applications. In the -- the new HPLC system combines advanced bioseparation technology, bioinert surfaces and built-in intelligence features. This helps Biopharma QC analysts boost efficiency and eliminate up to 40% of common lab errors. We believe that the Alliance iS is the most significant innovation to hit pharma QA/QC labs in over a decade. We're excited to bring this technology to routine testing applications for biologics. Supporting BioSeparations, we launched a new set of size exclusion chromatography columns called GTxResolve Premier. These columns enable scientists to quickly assess aggregate content, integrity and purity of larger biologic particles. It covers modalities such as lipid nanoparticles, nucleic acids, and viral vectors and give scientists a significant improvement in sensitivity and sample consumption while accelerating run times. This launch supports the development of these modalities into downstream high-volume settings, where Waters has critical instrument technology like LC, mass spec and light scattering as well as highly innovative industry-leading software chemistry and service. To simplify the detection of PFAS, we launched waters, Oasis, dual-phase analysis cartridges. This consumable streamline sample prep for PFAS workflows when detecting concentrations in water, soils, biosolids and tissues. It joins our comprehensive portfolio of solutions that support the surging demand for PFAS testing, which is a USD 300 million to USD 350 million global market, growing 20% annually. In an environment of increased scrutiny, the ability to accurately test for PFAS at very low levels is becoming a critical compliance need for a broad spectrum of industries. Our Xevo TQ absolute mass spec has leading sensitivity for detecting these anionic compounds. It can detect PFAS levels at as low as 1 part per quadrillion. Last month, in the United States, the EPA finalized and enforceable 4 parts per trillion limit of PFOA and PFOS in drinking water, which marks a significant regulatory milestone. Later this year, further regulations governing PFAS are expected across the globe. This includes the European Union, where REACH proposed chemicals, regulation contemplates a PFAS ban on products manufactured as well as once imported. In our TA business, we launched the Rheo-IS, which serves battery testing applications when used with our hybrid rheometers. This Rheo-Impedance Spectroscopy accessory supports characterization of electrode studies, which can lead to more efficient battery production. I will now cover our 2024 full year guidance. With our first quarter results, we remain on track to achieve our full year revenue outlook, which is unchanged from our previous guidance at negative 0.5% to positive 1.5% growth in organic constant currency. We expect growth rates to improve over the remainder of the year and as our prior year comparisons, especially in China get easier. We expect improving funnel activity to translate to orders as the year progresses. With our strong operational performance, we expect to build leverage in our P&L despite the flattish revenue guide and delivered 20 to 30 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion while still reinvesting for growth. As a result, our adjusted EPS guidance is also unchanged at 0% to 3% growth in the range of $11.75 to $12.05. Now I will pass the call over to Amol to continue covering our financial results in more detail and provide the rest of our guidance. Amol?"", 'Amol Chaubal', ""Thank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, sales landed at the high end of our guidance range, declining 7% as reported and 9% in organic constant currency. As Udit mentioned, end market dynamics were consistent with our expectations. Ex-China declined mid-single digits as expected, while China declined close to 30%, which was slightly better than expected. In organic constant currency by end market, Pharma declined 6%, industrial declined 7% and academic and government declined 30%. In Pharma, sales outside of China declined low single digits as we executed well in this CapEx constrained environment. In China, sales declined almost 30% due to ongoing market challenges that are not reflected in our prior year baselines. In industrial, food and environmental applications grew mid-single digits with continued strong growth in PFAS related workflows globally. We also saw strong growth in battery testing within our TA business, which has been a consistent growth theme. However, this strength was more than offset by weakness in core industrial applications, which are more cyclical. Our TA business declined high single digits overall, while chemical analysis declined high teens. In academic and government, growth was weak against a 45% comparison as stimulus in China and elevated global funding in the prior year quarter drove lumpy spending patterns. By geography, sales in Asia declined 16%. The Americas declined 8% and Europe declined 3%. By products and services, instruments declined 25% with LC growth slightly better than expected. Within recurring revenues, chemistry grew low single digits and service grew mid-single digits, both of which were affected by low activity levels in China. The quarter had 1 fewer day versus first quarter of 2023, which translates to a growth headwind of approximately 1% for recurring revenues. Now I will comment on our first quarter non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Despite headwinds from lower sales volumes, FX and inflation, our team continued to respond to these challenges with resilience and commitment. Our focus on operational excellence with pricing, productivity and proactive cost alignment allowed us to deliver first quarter gross margin of 58.9%, an expansion of 40 basis points and first quarter adjusted operating margin of 27% and expansion of 20 basis points. Our effective operating tax rate for the quarter was 14.3% and our average share count was 59.4 million shares. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share were $2.21. On a GAAP basis, earnings per fully diluted share were $1.72. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to this morning's press release and in the appendix of our earnings call presentation. Turning now to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures and excludes special items. In the first quarter of 2024, free cash flow was $234 million after funding $29 million of capital expenditures, which is approximately 37% of sales. We maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and well-structured debt maturity profile. This strength allows us to prioritize investing in growth, including M&A and returning capital to shareholders. We continue to evaluate M&A opportunities that will meaningfully accelerate value creation. At the end of the quarter, our net debt position further declined to $1.7 billion, which is a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1.8x. This reflects a decrease of approximately $300 million, as we delivered the Wyatt acquisition. As previously disclosed, our share buyback program has been temporarily suspended to enable us to pay down debt incurred as part of the Wyatt acquisition last year. We will evaluate the resumption of our share repurchase program throughout 2024 as part of our balanced capital deployment objectives. Now I would like to share further commentary on our full year outlook and provide you with our second quarter guidance. We expect to see an improvement in sales growth over the course of 2024 as prior year comparisons, particularly in China, become easier, and has improved funnel activity translates to orders. Our full year guidance is unchanged with 2024 organic constant currency sales growth expected between negative 0.5% and positive 1.5%. At current exchange rates, currency translation is expected to result in a negative impact of just under 1% on a full year sales basis. We expect Wyatt transaction to add just over 1% M&A contribution to our full year 2024 revenue for inorganic sales incurred in the first 4.5 months of the year. Therefore, our total reported sales growth guidance is unchanged at approximately 0% to 2%. Despite guiding to flattish sales, we expect to deliver a gross margin of 59.8% for the full year, which is a 20 basis points of expansion versus 2023. We also expect to deliver 20 to 30 basis points of operating margin expansion versus 2023, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of slightly over 31%. We expect our full year net interest expense to be approximately $80 million. Our full year tax rate is expected to be 16.3%, and our average diluted 2024 share count is expected to be approximately 59.7 million. Rolling all this together, on a non-GAAP basis, our full year 2024 earnings per fully diluted share guidance is also unchanged and projected in the range of $11.75 to $12.05. This is approximately 0% to 3% growth and includes an estimated headwind of approximately 2% due to unfavorable foreign exchange. Looking to the second quarter 2024, we anticipate that cautious customer spending will persist. In addition, while the China Q2 baseline reflects the onset of weakness, it does not fully reflect the weakness we observed in the second half of the year. As a result, we expect China to decline mid-teens in Q2 versus 28% decline we saw in Q1. Given these dynamics, we expect to see an improvement in year-over-year growth versus the first quarter and our second quarter organic constant currency sales growth guidance is projected in the range of negative 6% to negative 4%. At current rates, currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 2%. Wyatt is expected to add approximately 1.5% M&A contribution for sales incurred in the first 1.5 month of the quarter. Therefore, our total second quarter reported sales growth guidance is negative 6.5% to negative 4.5%. Based on these revenue expectations, second quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $2.50 to $2.60, which includes a negative currency impact of approximately 4 percentage points at current FX rates. Now I would like to turn the call back to Udit for some summary comments. Udit?"", 'Udit Batra', ""Thank you, Amol. I would like now to give you a brief update on our progress towards leaving the world better than we found it, which is how we think about ESG. We work alongside wonderful people here at Waters, and I'm always proud when others recognize their talent and hard work. Our colleagues were recognized in the quarter for their achievements and contributions to separation science, excellence in manufacturing and for being champions of LGBTQ and women's benefits in the workplace. I would also like to congratulate Dr. Philip Wyatt, the founder of Wyatt Technology for receiving the esteemed Pittcon Heritage Award earlier this year. Dr. Wyatt's groundbreaking contributions to laser light scattering technology have paved the way for industry-leading advancements. From a corporate standpoint, Waters has once again been honored by Barron's, earning a place on its list of the 100 most sustainable companies in 2024. Additionally, we are delighted to announce that S&P Global has included Waters in its 2024 sustainability yearbook. Separately, our commitment to robust governance practices was recently highlighted by the New England Chapter of the National Association of Corporate Directors. We were honored to have Massachusetts Governor, Maura Healey present Waters with the 2024 public company Board of the Year Award. After recently committing to SBTI, which is the science-based targets initiative, we are now building on the excellent progress we made in reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. We're in the process of setting new standards towards a long-term reduction in emissions and aligning our business with the 1.5 degree centigrade future. Now to summarize, we're pleased with how the first quarter landed versus our expectations, which supports our full year guidance. We remain on track to achieving the 2024 objectives and look forward to building on this strength as the year progresses. Our long-term growth profile remains excellent, and we are aligned to secular tailwinds that are stronger than ever in our attractive markets. With our robust financial profile and balanced capital allocation strategy, we have an excellent platform to deliver sustained value for our shareholders. So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Caspar."", 'Caspar Tudor', 'Thanks, Udit. That concludes our formal comments. We are now ready to open the phone lines for questions.', 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Dan Brennan from TD Cowen.', 'Daniel Gregory Brennan', ""Maybe the first 1 just on China. You guys were coming into the quarter expecting down 40 and I know it was certainly better than that, and you're talking about Q2 color. I'm just wondering, I know you guys gave some color on what was going on in the quarter. But could you just unpack it a little bit more like what deviated from the guide? How it's pacing in the quarter? And then is there any change to your full year down mid-teens, high-teens growth for China?"", 'Udit Batra', ""Look, China came in better than we expected. But I'll remind you, it's still declining in the high 20s. Now we expect that to continue for at least the first half of the year. Q2 will also see a decline and the second half of the year, we'll start to see a little bit of growth given the weakening comps as the year progresses. Now coming back to Q1, to your question on what changed? I mean you just have to go back to late 2023 when we basically said, look, we think across all end markets, especially pharma, we've seen a bottoming out of the volume. And from that baseline, we started to see better activity especially on the replacement of LCs in our Branded Generics segment and something that we had talked about in the last quarter as well. Now it's early days, right? We're starting to see a turn as customers start to replace this sort of highly aging LC fleet. So remember, we again talked about it at the end of last year. When you look at the 5-year stack growth of LC instruments for China, in particular, it's down now almost double digits, about 8% to 9% versus a year versus 5 years. So with that as a baseline, we expect to see the replacement cycle initiate and we've started to see that already in Q1. Now to put things in perspective, there's also a fair amount of talk on the new stimulus and the stimulus itself is very different than the previous one. It appears it's going to roll over a 3-year period. It's 3x in size, and it explicitly calls out instrument replacement, so which encourages us, but we have not incorporated that into the guide for the full year, which now we're basically saying is likely to be low double-digit decline as opposed to the high teens decline that we had talked about when we gave the full year guidance. So China will likely be a little bit better than we had anticipated. And just coming back to the stimulus and looking ahead, I would not -- while we have not incorporated that into our guidance explicitly, I would not underestimate the importance of that on the psychology of CapEx spending, especially the replacement cycle. And as that sort of starts rolling out towards the latter half of the year and towards late 2024 and early 2025, we should see the sentiment improve and likely start of the replacement cycle in earnest."", 'Operator', ""Next, we'll go to the line of Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI."", 'Vijay Muniyappa Kumar', 'Udit, maybe on that comment around China. I think you mentioned improved funnel activity in the quarter as the quarter progressed. Is that funnel activity -- is that being sort of driven by this China? Or is that a global biopharma? Any color on what you mean by the funnel activity, and I think for the back half guidance, which assumes I think, close to high singles growth. What visibility do we have in growth normalizing in the back half?', 'Udit Batra', ""Vijay, thank you for the 2 questions. So let me just sort of take a step back and provide some context, right? I mean, as you know, Q1 is the toughest quarter for Waters to predict, right? It's our smallest quarter of the year, and this is when customers start to think through the total CapEx spend for the year and also think through the phasing of that CapEx right? So we took advantage of that. And I personally met several customers across Europe and in the United States, across pharma, across A&G, across our industrial segments, across our clinical segments with our teams. And really, there are 3 main takeaways. First, the quality of the funnel, the quality of the orders is way higher than what we saw a year ago across all of the segments, especially in pharma -- both in pharma and in biotech across Europe and the U.S. Second, when you look at the traction of our new products, our new products are gaining a ton of traction and are being used heavily by our customers. And they're waiting to sort of adopt Alliance iS in earnest, you can go across the portfolio. It's being received extremely well. And third, the question on phasing, while the orders are firm and strong, the CapEx spending is firm, given that it is decided in the late -- in the latter part of Q1, we think it's safe to assume that you'll only start to see the benefit late in Q2 and more so in the second half of the year. So the funnel is weighted towards later in Q2 and the second half of the year. So that's what sort of has gone into our overall thinking. Now there are 2 big takeaways. One, we have increased confidence in our full year guide as a consequence of these discussions. And second, on the phasing, we simply went back and said, okay, let's just look at the last 15 years. Over the last 15 years, the Q2 usually is a step-up from Q1 of about 11% to 12%, right? And so we assumed a 10% step-up from Q1 to Q2. And then first half versus second half, I mean, historically, it's basically, again, over the last 15 years, almost like clockwork. First half is 45% and the second half is 55% of revenues. So that's basically what the algorithm we used to look at the phasing of the guide from a revenue perspective. But overall, really increased confidence in the full year guide given the strengthening of the funnel and conversations across the globe and across customer segments and second, the phasing is basically rooted in history."", 'Vijay Muniyappa Kumar', ""Fantastic. I'll let others jump in."", 'Operator', ""Next, we'll go to the line of Michael Ryskin from Bank of America."", 'Michael Leonidovich Ryskin', ""Just following up on some of the end market commentary you talked about China a little about how you expect a low double-digit decline, so a little bit better than prior. You're maintaining the fiscal year. So what's sort of offsetting that? And maybe specifically honing on Americas, it looked like that came a little bit worse in the quarter. Anything changed in your outlook there for the year? And then I've got a quick follow-up."", 'Amol Chaubal', ""Yes. No. I mean, Mike, at this point, we are just derisking the remainder of the guide, right? We had better expectations of China, based on how we are executing in that market, and we're keeping our full year guide flat."", 'Udit Batra', ""Yes. And then I think you asked about the U.S., in particular, what are we seeing in the U.S. Look, I mean, as I said, I spent a fair amount of time with customers across the globe. And one of those was a large customer in the Midwest, where I spent a whole day with about 12 to 13 folks from the customer across many different departments, across development, manufacturing, QA/QC. And we talked deeply about what they envision for CapEx, which I sort of earlier commented on, and the CapEx is very robust. Second, we talked about the use of our new products, think about in-line testing with LCs, think about our columns, think about the upgrades for empower. The software, really, really well received. And we talked about the phasing of the spend, which also, again, is still sort of late Q2 and back half weighted. But to put it all in perspective, if you look at the U.S. itself, the 5 years stack, Michael, is still pretty healthy. It's in the mid- to high single digits, right? So there is really no drama outside of China. I mean we've had 2 exceptional years in ex-China sales. And now you have a little bit of a lull, but the activity looks extremely good, gives us confidence of what we are planning for the full year. So as I said, no drama, no new news, but just other than the fact that new products are gaining traction and customers have much more robust orders than they did a year ago."", 'Michael Leonidovich Ryskin', ""Okay. If I could squeeze in a quick follow-up. On Wyatt, you had some commentary on how the quarter progressed? And if you could elaborate on that a little bit. And it looks like you tweaked down the M&A contribution for the year. I think it was $1.3 million prior. Now it's $1.1 billion. Is that instrument mix in Wyatt? Is that phased and phasing through the year? Just sort of how is that acquisition trending?"", 'Amol Chaubal', ""Yes, look, I mean, on Wyatt, we're making fantastic progress, right? All the synergies that we laid out at the beginning of the acquisition, like cross-selling, like attaching our LC seamlessly to the instrument, like attaching our columns with their shipments have all progressed ahead of schedule, including sort of a beta version of bringing light scattering on Empower. Now keep in mind, right, Q1 is a really small quarter and for instruments, especially and when things sort of slip a couple of weeks here and there, it causes that distortion. And that's why we sort of tweaked down Wyatt to 1.1% versus 1.3% M&A contribution. But way that acquisition is going, we are super happy where we are in that journey and really look forward to bringing light scattering into QA/QC."", 'Udit Batra', ""And Michael, to build on it, again, from to customer conversations, I had an opportunity spent some time last week with one of our largest academic customers who has a hospital attached to it. And basically, we talked at length about characterization of lipid nanoparticles, which as you will know, are used for delivery of mRNA, both vaccines and therapeutics as we go forward, an area of intense interest across academia and industry. And these folks specialize in characterizing lipid nanoparticles, which can often be aggregated of different -- and have different sizes and shapes. Lights -- they basically use SEC columns from Waters and light scattering equipment to characterize these aggregates. In addition, what I learned is that they're piloting the use of field flow fractionation, which is another instrument that Wyatt makes as a precursor to using SEC malls, right? And field to fractionation, if -- and the early experiments indicate a really positive outcome. If those experiments work well, could become a mainstay for any experiment that is done to separate these aggregates. And the same idea then applies to AAVs, which is -- which are viral vectors used for cell and gene therapy or other particles, that are used in biologics. So very excited about what we're seeing in Waters, really a great cultural fit, well ahead of all synergy targets and customer conversations even give me more confidence. So in the mid- to long-term, we expect it to continue to be accretive to growth and to margins."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Matt Sykes from Goldman Sachs.', 'Matthew Carlisle Sykes', ""Maybe just revisiting the guide, just given the lower-than-expected guide in Q2, and you mentioned that you expect sort of funnel activity translate into some level of orders towards the end of Q2 into Q3. Have you changed sort of your view on the phasing for second half in terms of the growth you're going to achieve in Q3 versus Q4. Are you pushing more of that potential growth into Q4. Has that phasing at all changed for your full year guide?"", 'Amol Chaubal', ""So Matt, thanks for your question. And look, I mean, we executed well to finish at the higher end of our Q1 guide, right? And that sort of keeps us on track for our full year sales guide. And as Udit discussed, our Q2 guide is essentially 10% higher than Q1, which has been sort of our historical trend pre-pandemic. And our second half guide is also very much consistent with how we've historically performed, which is a 45-55 split. So we generally expect the breakdown between Q3 and Q4 to also follow that historical trend for 2024."", 'Udit Batra', ""I think, Matt, thanks for the question. And again, I'll remind you, we had the same discussion when we looked at Q3 versus Q4 of 2023, and there was a lot of discussion on the ramp. And I think we, again, landed at the higher end of what we were predicting. So a difficult business overall to predict if you have high average selling price instruments. But I think we have so much statistics from the history of Waters, gives us a lot of confidence and couple that with discussions that we've had with customers that we think the full year guide is fully intact. And quarter-on-quarter, there's a lot more time to talk about it as we see how Q2 evolves on the ramp between Q3 and Q4. But history should be a decent guide if you're really looking at that sort of modeling between quarters."", 'Amol Chaubal', ""Yes. I mean on a growth basis, it looks a little weird, but that's because of last year, right? The weakness progressively stepped in China and pretty much Q3 and Q4, there was no incremental meaningful bad news out of China, but a lot of that was not reflected in Q1 and Q2. And that's why it sort of it plays out in the growth purely from the baseline effect mostly from China."", 'Udit Batra', ""I think what Amol saying is it's arithmetic and customer conversations give us confidence that we have a pretty good set of visibility."", 'Matthew Carlisle Sykes', 'Great. And then just one quick follow-up. Just on the academic end market in the quarter. I know you were facing a really challenging comp. I think you grew academic like 45% constant currency. In Q1 of last year. So was there any incremental weakness in that academic end market? Or was it just purely facing difficult comps?', 'Udit Batra', ""Yes, I think you nailed it, it's really difficult comps. I mean it is our smallest segment, in particular, anyway. So you see an exaggerated drop if you just look at year-on-year. And again, if you look at sort of the long-term trend and which is sort of the best way to look at Waters in any case, even in A&G what you find is the 5-year comp is at the low single digit, 5-year CAGR is at the low single-digit range. And ex-China, as I keep saying, there's really no drama ex-China, you're at almost 2% to 3% growth versus what we saw 5 years ago on a CAGR basis. And China is down about sort of mid -- low to mid-single digits in the academic segment. Again, given the comps from last year, but also a little bit more exaggerated weakness."", 'Operator', ""Next, we'll go to Rachel Vatnsdal from JPMorgan."", 'Rachel Marie Vatnsdal Olson', ""So I wanted to dig into the pharma performance in China a little bit. I believe you said that was down 30% this quarter versus rest of world down low single digits. So can you impact that China performance within Pharma for us a little bit Obviously, we've seen the headlines related to BIOSECURE Act. Last year at 1Q, you guys called out your overexposure to CDMOs in the region. So can you quantify for us how much of this was driven by those Tier 1 CDMOs in the region this quarter? And then you previously have kind of broken out those trends between Tier 1 versus Tier 2 and 3 CDMOs. So could you do that for this quarter as well?"", 'Amol Chaubal', ""So look, I mean, great question. As you sort of travel through last year, Q2, Q3, Q4, we saw weakness creep in on different elements of the pharma business in China. But as I said earlier in Q3 and Q4, there was no incremental bad news out of China, and that trend sort of has continued into Q1. And so in a way, what played out, what you see in terms of the decline, is largely baseline related where China, from a pharma point of view has bottomed out and there is no incremental headwind coming into the business. But we are also not seeing sort of growth in activity, both in CDMOs or in branded generics or in biotechs in China. So if anything, let's call it stable. Now on your second point, which is around the BIOSECURE Act, I mean, look, with the weakness that we observed in 2023, the baseline is largely corrected in China for submarkets like CDMOs, right, including Wuxi. We are -- what we are seeing in the market is customers are taking proactive measures to secure their supply chain. And when they are doing that, our service organization, which is really well respected in the industry and plays a pivotal role in these tech transfers are deeply embedded when these moves happen, right? I mean, our role is to support customers in their pursuits and our customers really value our support when they go through situations like this and move products from one site to another."", 'Udit Batra', ""And Rachel, just to embellish on this, and that's a very good sort of insightful question, just to embellish on what Amol said, on the minus 30% for Q1, it came minus 28%, Q1, it came above our expectations, largely because we started to see customers who have aging LC fleets in branded generics start to move, right? So we started to see that signal, which is a positive sign. And as I commented earlier, as the stimulus starts to roll in towards the latter part of the year, that should have a positive impact on the psychology for spending CapEx. And I'll remind you that we're sort of almost 50% delinquent on these replacements in the Branded Generics segment, which is the largest segment for LCs in China. So we expect that to turn at some point and the psychology will have a lot to do with it. And on BIOSECURE, I mean it's a net neutral for us at the end, right? I mean we've already bottomed out on CDMOs at -- in China, and I think as customers look for help in transferring from one vendor to another, we stand ready to help them."", 'Rachel Marie Vatnsdal Olson', ""Great. And then my follow-up. I want to push on that China stimulus dynamic a little bit more in terms of some of your peers that are working on proposals for customers at this point, so can you talk about the conversations you're having on your end with customers and if you're working on proposals as well. And specifically, what types of instruments and then which industries do you really expect to benefit from within China stimulus? We've heard some rumors around this being a little bit more industrial-focused or you seeing down in your proposal funnel as well? And then when do you think that this could eventually translate into orders and revenue? You mentioned back half of the year, some of the psychological impact. So any color on timing expectations that would be helpful as well."", 'Udit Batra', ""Everything and anything about the stimulus, Rachel. Look, the timing, I don't have much more to add than what I said earlier. I think latter half of the year. We are indeed working with several customers on their plans for the stimulus as they hear more across the country. And it is a broad stimulus. I mean this time around, it's a 3-year stimulus, it's 3x in size. It's quite broad across virtually every customer segment, not just limited to A&G. And frankly speaking, I don't know what people -- if they got extra money in academic -- academia, what they would do with it because they've sort of been chockful. And I remember I commented sort of in Q3 last year about how many instruments they bought high res instruments and how many are still in boxes. So I don't expect much of it to go to high-tier A&G customers, but definitely beyond that, there is a lot of conversation across many different customer segments as they plan and they learn more about the details of the stimulus. But I would not -- and so we have not incorporated that into the guide, and I would not expect that impact sooner than sort of later this year and in earnest first part of next year. So good conversations with customers, planning going on, like you've heard it from others but a broader one, not just limited to academia across industrial, across pharma and the psychological impact I would not underestimate, as I said before, because I think we're operating at a significant deficit on LC instruments and Branded Generics."", 'Operator', ""Next, we'll go to the line of Daniel Leonard from UBS."", 'Daniel Louis Leonard', ""One question on your gross margin expansion in the quarter. How much did better-than-expected product mix contribute to that? You mentioned that liquid chromatography did a bit better than planned and mass spec was a bit worse. So I'm curious how much of the contribution that was."", 'Amol Chaubal', ""Dan, yes, I mean, look, the product mix is helping at this point, especially given lower instrument mix, that's contributing about 30 basis points. But keep in mind, there was also a good 70 to 80 basis points of FX headwind that we offsetted, right? So the remaining delta is favorably coming from price and some of the productivity initiatives in manufacturing."", 'Operator', ""Next, we'll go to the line of Patrick Donnelly from Citi."", 'Patrick Bernard Donnelly', ""I guess in terms of some of these conversations you're having, I'm wondering what stage do you think we're in? It sounds like again, the conversations with the funnel to your point, maybe improving a little bit, specifically with China, it sounds like maybe you're expecting the actual revs to show up late this year at the earliest. So how do you think about just the progression of these conversations into orders, into revs. And again, is there a potential for a bit of an air pocket as these conversations pick up and the dollars materialize a little later in the year? How do you think about just the progression there?"", 'Udit Batra', ""It's a great question. Look, Patrick, let's just take a full step back on Waters, right? As you know and many on the call know, we've grown instruments roughly 5%. And I know your question is targeted towards instruments. Instruments have grown on average 5% over the last 15 years, right? And those statistics are sort of easily available given that we've not done a lot of M&A. You can look at our longitudinal history on instruments, right? So about 5% on average, but no year is actually 5% on the dot, right? There are 5 that are well below 5 that are well above and 5 close to the average, right? So you start with that. And since I've been at the company in the last 3.5 years, we've seen a microcosm of that already, right? So 2 years of 20-plus percent growth and now a bit of decline in instrument growth rate. We didn't get too excited when things were at 20-plus percent growth for several quarters in a row. And we said this is not going to last just given the long-term averages. And we're not so phased when we look at what we are seeing now. And now let me sort of address your question just with that as context, it's very difficult to predict a quarter-on-quarter rollout of instruments for Waters. But I think it's more instructive to look at the 5-year average, especially when you think about LC. And a 5-year CAGR for LC is operating now at the low single-digit level. In China, it's almost double-digit decline. So we are due for a replacement cycle to begin very soon in LC instrumentation. And remember, these are used in QA/QC. So you can't forever defer these replacements. And the conversations that we've had with customers, and as I said, I spent a whole day with one of our largest customers, especially in QA/QC, they are raring to go and start the replacement cycles, right, on LCs. The aging fleet is not something that they want to have, especially for new launches, which are going to be high volume and, of course, marketed compounds. So I think things are trending in the right direction. But again, I mean, just put this all in context, there's really, again, one shouldn't get too excited when you see high growth and decline, especially for our instrument portfolio. And when you look at the full year, again, I'll remind you that it's a 45, 55 average for the overall business, right? First half, 45%, second half, 55%, and that's what we've assumed for the full year phasing overall, and the step-up in the second quarter is roughly 10%. So just sort of give you broad sort of signpost. But the conversations were with a QA -- with a heavy focus on QA/QC. And we see replacement -- signs of replacement cycles beginning both in China, which we commented on earlier, ex-China."", 'Patrick Bernard Donnelly', ""And then Amol, maybe just quickly on the margin side. Can you just talk about the progression as we work our way through the year. I know you guys have some kind of cost initiatives working the way through the year last year. So I'm just trying to think on the cadence there and any moving pieces you want to call out as you work our way through '24 here."", 'Amol Chaubal', 'Yes. Look, I mean, already in Q1, we put good numbers on board and continued our good financial performance. As you get into second half of the year, keep in mind, the proactive cost actions that we took are already in the baseline, and there will be some headwind as we accrue for bonuses. So you may not see meaningful margin expansion in the second half, net of those 2 effects, but we would have mostly covered our ground for the 20 to 30 basis points of margin expansion mostly in the first half. So we will still end up delivering an adjusted operating margin expansion of 20 to 30 basis points.', 'Operator', ""Next, we'll go to the line of Doug Schenkel from Wolfe Research."", 'Douglas Anthony Schenkel', ""Udit, thank you for the commentary on the quality of the funnel and also providing context, looking back 15 years at seasonal patterns, that's helpful. That said, recognizing those points and even being mindful of the year-over-year comparisons and how they progress over the course of the year. Your guidance, it doesn't seem conservative to me to be direct, at least as I look at the model. I'm struggling a little bit to kind of see how you get there in spite of all the helpful commentary you provided. To explain where I'm coming from, starting on revenue, the 45, 55 H1, H2 revenue split. It's a long-term norm, but it certainly isn't the recent norm. And then looking at things a different way, I think you would need to go down -- go from being down more than 6% organic in the first half, to being up more than 7% positive in the second half. And for margins, if I'm doing the math right, I think you're essentially implying a targeted second half operating margin of around 33.5%, which is a bigger first half to second half ramp than normal. So with all of that in mind, my questions are really the following: one, how dependent are you on an instrument recovery and, in fact, a normalization to trend in the fourth quarter to get to these targets? Two, if the answer is you are assuming a normalization, how do we put that with the margin guidance? And then third, given investor concern and just the market backdrop, keeping in mind, none of your peers sound good on China or instruments right now, did you contemplate cutting guidance a bit? I know that was a lot, so I'll get back in the queue and listen."", 'Udit Batra', ""Go ahead -- Let's Amol start, and then I'll jump in."", 'Amol Chaubal', ""Yes. Look, I mean, where we stand at this point, one may say, look, your Q2 guidance is conservative given there was some delay in budget releases in Q1. And we've been prudent there just to stay with our historical norm, right? Q3, Q4, we have some visibility in CRM. But the sales cycle, as you know, is 6, 9 months, so you don't have all the visibility, but it's still in line with the historical pattern, and we are seeing increased activity at early stages in our pipeline, which we think will convert into orders as the year progresses, right? If you look at ex-China pretty much across these quarters, it is on a 5-year stack basis, a little lower, mid-single digits. So again, as Udit said, there is no noise ex-China. And really what plays out in the growth guide is how progressively the decline in China translates to a modest increase in the second half of the year, and that's what we are modeling. There could be upside on China, if China performs well. And we did some of that in our guide where we saw a little bit better China, and we derisk the remainder of the guide. On your second question on the margin, I mean, as I said earlier, right, a lot of the cost work we did last year is in the second half baseline. So you're going to see very modest, if any, margin expansion in the second half, but we would have covered most of the ground on the 20 to 30 basis points of full year margin expansion in the first half. And China, I mean, stimulus is not in our guide. We expect very little towards the end of the year, if any, because a lot of things need to be worked out there. But we are super encouraged by what the government is doing, both in terms of the size and the tenure of the stimulus and the secondary effect it will have on the local mentality and purchase patterns."", 'Udit Batra', ""Yes. And then just to sort of, again, embellish just a little bit, Doug, and summarize. First, yes, I mean, the discussions with customers are increasingly positive, but we felt we want to see that land first before we start assuming that it has come, right? So you can imagine, given how difficult it is to predict instrument businesses year-on-year, quarter-on-quarter is even trickier -- a trickier exercise. So yes, the conversations are positive, but we want to see it land and then we'll have -- hopefully, you're right, and then we can have another discussion at the end of Q2 that looks a little bit different. Second, on China, it's a pure math issue, right? I mean the year has started better than we expected, but the second half of the year is when all the weakness was plugged in -- into the overall numbers. So you see second half being slightly -- basically flattish to slight growth. But if you put it all together, I mean, there is no drama ex-China. It's low single-digit growth prediction for the full year across the different customer segments, especially pharma and academia. And in China, it's a low double-digit decline after a very significant decline in the previous year. So really, there's not a lot of risk, as I look at it after the conversations that we've recently had with customers, the visibility we currently have."", 'Operator', 'And our final question comes from Catherine Schulte from Baird.', 'Catherine Walden Ramsey Schulte', 'Maybe just on pharma. I think you said down low single digits ex-China. And you talked about budgets opening up throughout the quarter. So can you just talk through the health of that end market outside of China exiting the quarter and your expectations for the second quarter for that end market?', 'Udit Batra', ""So Catherine, thank you for the question. Look, pharma overall even last year grew low single digits for us for the full year. And the full year guide again is low single-digit growth. Q1 was sort of a low single-digit decliner, but the conversations with customers make us even more confident that the full year guide is very much intact for a low single-digit growth in pharma. And as I said before, look, first, the orders look much more firm than they did a year ago across biotech and across pharma. Second, when I look at what traction our products have especially the products that are meant to solve problems for large molecules, be it in columns. And I talked about that in the prepared remarks, be it in analysis using light scattering or using mass spec and LC the products have an extremely, extremely good traction. And as far as phasing is concerned, it's the same commentary that I provided overall. Look, Q1 came in as we expected for pharma and as we roll through the year, basically, the comps get a little bit easier. And so you see us landing at the full -- landing the full year with a low single-digit growth for pharma."", 'Caspar Tudor', 'Thank you for joining us today and for your continued support and interest in Waters.

GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with WMT.', 'Despite operating in a very challenging market, Walmart has delivered strong results for investors historically and has built up a durable competitive advantage.', ""Walmart is a leading global retailer with more than 10,500 stores across 19 countries. The company operates three divisions: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club U.S. Walmart U.S. is the company's most important market and accounts for nearly 70% of its total sales. Key international markets include Mexico and Central America, Canada and China."", ""While the majority of Walmart's revenues are generated through sales at physical locations, it has a robust online business that accounts for roughly 18% of global sales."", ""The company sells a wide variety of products. Key product categories include groceries, general merchandise, health and wellness products and other. The grocery category is Walmart's largest merchandise category and accounts for nearly 60% of its U.S. sales."", ""The retail business globally is highly competitive. Walmart's key competitors include Target, Kroger (NYSE:KR), Costco (NASDAQ:COST), Dollar General (NYSE:DG), TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX), Aldi, BJ's Wholesale Club (NYSE:BJ), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Temu, Shien and many others."", 'Given this highly competitive landscape, Walmart stands out due to the competitive advantage it enjoys due to size. With annual revenue of approximately $648 billion, Walmart is considerably larger than its key competitors. Amazon generates annual revenue of roughly $484 billion, excluding its AWS segment. Kroger, Costco, and Target generate annual revenue of $150 billion, $238 billion and $107 billion respectively.', 'Walmart is able to exert strong negotiating power with suppliers due to its scale, which allows it to sell to consumers at lower prices. Additionally, the company enjoys other advantages due to its scale, such as being able to run a highly efficient supply chain, make significant investments in technology and spread marketing spend over a higher volume of sales.', ""I view Walmart's competitive advantage as highly durable given its significant scale advantage over competitors. In particular, the retailer's competitive advantage is especially strong in its core grocery business as the threat from Amazon, arguably its toughest competitor on cost, is less significant in this space."", 'As a result of these competitive advantages, as shown by the chart below, Walmart has been able to deliver fairly consistent returns on invested capital above its weighted average cost of capital.', 'For fiscal 2025, Walmart expects to increase net sales by 3% to 4% on a year-over-year basis. The company expects adjusted earnings per share to increase by roughly 4% based on the midpoint of company guidance for adjusted earnings per share of $2.23 to $2.37.', ""Consensus estimates currently call for the company to deliver revenue growth of 4.30% and adjusted earnings per share of $2.36, which represents growth of roughly 6.60% for fiscal 2025. Thus, Wall Street analysts are optimistic the company will be able to deliver results toward the very upper end of company provided guidance. Moreover, Wall Street's consensus adjusted earnings per share estimates for fiscal 2026 and 2027 call for adjusted earnings per share growth of 9.30% and 10.90% respectively, while annual revenue growth is expected to remain around 4%."", 'Over the next few years, the key earnings growth drivers for Walmart will be its international division, margin expansion due to increased efficiencies and ancillary businesses such as advertising, which grew to $3.40 billion in fiscal 2024, up 28% on a year-over-year basis.', 'While I am optimistic the company will be able to deliver solid results for fiscal 2025 that are in line with consensus estimates, I believe delivering accelerating growth for 2026 and 2027 will be more challenging.', 'Walmart currently trades at roughly 25 times consensus fiscal 2025 adjusted earnings per share. This represents a moderate premium to the broader market, which trades at close to 20 times forward earnings. In addition to trading at a higher multiple than the broader market, Walmart also has somewhat lower near-term growth prospects than the broader market. Currently, consensus estimates call for the S&P 500 to grow earnings by nearly 11% for 2024 and nearly 14% in 2025, while Walmart is expected to grow earnings at 6.60% and 9.30% over the next two years.', ""While the retailer's lower growth prospects compared to the broader market argue for a discount, its recession-resilient business model argues for a premium. The less cyclical nature of Walmart's business argues for a valuation premium as its earnings tend to be less volatile than more economically sensitive companies. While Walmart is exposed to general trends in consumer spending, as the low-cost retailer across many products, the company tends to benefit during times of economic stress as consumers look to cut costs. Evidence for the company's low degree of cyclicality can be seen in its relatively low historical beta, which, based on a three-year trailing basis, has averaged around 0.41 over the past 10 years."", ""Over the past decade, Walmart has traded at an average price-earnings ratio of roughly 27, while the S&P 500 has traded at an average forward price-earnings ratio of close to 18. Thus, the stock has historically traded at a premium valuation to the broader market and the current valuation premium appears reasonable relative to historical norms. Moreover, Walmart's valuation relative to peers also seems reasonable. Costco, a company with somewhat higher near-term growth expectations, trades at nearly 46 times forward earnings, while Target trades at 17.50 times forward earnings."", ""Walmart currently has a GF Value of roughly $55 per share, which suggests the stock is reasonably valued at current levels. I agree with this characterization and view the stock as reasonably valued due to historical norms and the stock's valuation relative to the broader market."", 'WMT Data by GuruFocus', ""Perhaps the biggest risk to the bull case is that Walmart fails to deliver high levels of growth from its international business over the long term. The company's U.S. business is very mature and thus, if it is going to be able to deliver long-term earnings growth above the mid-single digits, the international segment must play a key role. As a U.S.-based company Walmart faces cultural challenges when executing in foreign markets and, at times, has struggled with its international business. In recent years, Walmart has pulled back from its business in key markets such as Japan and the United Kingdom.

If you want to skip our overview of O'Leary's investment philosophy and learn about some more companies in his stock portfolio, go directly to Kevin O'Leary’s Stock Portfolio: 5 Stock Picks for 2024."", 'Kevin O\'Leary, affectionately known as Mr. Wonderful to fans and fellow venture capitalists, is renowned as one of the venture capitalists on ""Shark Tank"" and a commentator on economic news. The Irish-Canadian kickstarted his business journey by establishing the educational software company Softkey in 1986 by leveraging the proceeds from the sale of his SET share and a $10,000 investment from his mother. This venture eventually propelled him to the forefront of the business world. Softkey specialized in producing and distributing educational software in CD format, expanding its market presence through a series of mergers and acquisitions in the early 1990s. Notable acquisitions included WordStar, Spinnaker Software, and The Learning Company, the latter of which Softkey adopted as its name following the acquisition.', ""In terms of investing in securities, O'Leary, Chairman of O’Shares Investment Advisors, advocates for including high-quality businesses with strong balance sheets and robust financial performance in investment portfolios. Additionally, he stresses the importance of diversification across various market sectors, with dividend payments from the companies under consideration deemed as perhaps the most vital factor. To that end, O’Shares Investment Advisors' ETF, ALPS O'Shares U.S. Quality Dividend ETF (BATS:OUSA), holds stocks embodying a blend of these three attributes. The ETF has delivered growth rates of 11.55% over the past year, 38.69% over the last five years, and an impressive 86.92% since its inception. Some notable names held by the ETF include the likes of Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)."", 'The venture capitalist recently outlined his investment approach on LinkedIn, stressing the significance of cash-flow-positive investments within a diversified portfolio. Here is what he said:', '“A couple of years back, I sold my ETF company to Alps, the biggest ETF player in the States. It’s called O’Shares, and that’s where my family’s wealth is parked. OUSA is part of the S&P 500, cherry-picking the highest quality balance sheets with positive cash flow from around 100 out of the 500 names. Then there’s OUSM, which grabs the Russell 2000 and weeds out the underperformers – those companies not making any real dough. Forget Shark Tank, forget Bitcoin. Sure, I’ve got a 5% stake in Bitcoin and another 5% in gold, but the meat of my US portfolio? It’s in OUSA or OUSM.”', 'Speaking further on this, Kevin O’Leary, during his appearance on \'Good Morning America,\' used some of his time to unveil a number of good stock picks for first-time investors, with The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) being one of his recommendations. While investors widely regard the home improvement retailer as a dependable choice, O’Leary is particularly fond of it due to its substantial size, robust balance sheet, and consistent dividends. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is also among O\'Leary\'s top picks, and he holds a strong affinity for the company. ""I love it,"" he said, highlighting the company\'s diversified product portfolio ranging from COVID-19 vaccines to Tylenol.', ""On the other hand, despite his reservations regarding Bitcoin ETFs, O'Leary acknowledges their regulatory approval as a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency industry. He believes that only a select few, particularly those backed by major industry players like Fidelity and BlackRock Inc., will thrive. O'Leary sees this as a step towards broader acceptance of digital payment systems, such as the USDC stablecoin. While exercising caution with Bitcoin ETFs, Mr. Wonderful remains optimistic about Bitcoin's future value, estimating it could reach between $150,000 and $250,000 by 2030. However, he disagrees with Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood's more ambitious prediction of Bitcoin hitting $1.5 million by 2030, unless there is an economic catastrophe, arguing that such a rapid surge in Bitcoin's value would imply a significant downturn in the US economy."", 'The ""Shark Tank"" star also expressed concerns about the current state of the commercial real estate market, suggesting that it is on the verge of collapse. He believes that this downturn will have far-reaching consequences, particularly for investors and small business owners. O\'Leary emphasized that the current situation is unprecedented, as the commercial real estate market is not anticipated to fully recover to pre-pandemic levels. Speaking to FOXBusiness,\xa0the venture capitalist made the following comments on office spaces:', '“Most of these buildings were built over the last 30 years and [have mortgages with] interest rates of less than 4%,” he said. “Now the Fed has raised rates to 5.5% terminal rate, which means these mortgages are going to be refinanced at 9% to 11% — so a 3x cost. So many of these buildings won’t be economically viable.”', 'Helga Esteb/Shutterstock.com', 'Our Methodology', ""In this article, we'll explore Kevin O'Leary's top 10 stock picks for 2024, which reflect his investment philosophy and offer insights into asset management.

V.This January, Visa, in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, announced receipt of its shareholders' approval to amend its Certificate of Incorporation “that redenominated the Visa Class B common stock to Visa Class B-1 common stock.” The shareholders also authorized V to conduct one or more exchange offers. The company’s unique share structure – three share classes – was planned to ensure that banks that owned Visa before the IPO would still be on the hook to cover costs arising from its long-running litigation with major U.S. merchants.Hence, under the plan (commenced on Apr 8), JPMorgan tendered its 37.2 million shares of Visa Class B-1 common stock in exchange for a combination of Visa Class B-2 common stock and Visa Class C common stock.

The technology will warn issuers in real time when a payment account number appears to have been compromised by an ""enumeration"" attack, a type of brute-force card testing aided by bots.', '""Until now, stopping an enumeration attack has been like finding a needle in a haystack, but with gen AI we\'re able to spot it by rapidly combing through trillions of rows of data,"" said Paul Fabara, Visa\'s chief risk and client services officer.', ""Fraudsters perpetrate enumeration attacks by using scripts to run trial-and-error authorization attempts on millions of potential payment account numbers at scale until they randomly hit one with the right combination of authorization credentials. Increasingly, they're using gen AI to do this even faster, according to Fabara."", ""In recent years, fraudsters have intensified their efforts in enumerated attacks by using AI to crack the logic of a targeted bank's sequential issuing logic and guess at customers' card numbers and credentials, sometimes finding combinations merchants will validate online, he said."", 'Enumeration attacks account for about $1.1 billion in global losses globally each year and represent about 10% of global fraud, according to Visa data.', ""To block issuers' exposure to enumeration attacks, Visa used gen AI to update Visa Account Attack Intelligence, a machine learning-powered tool introduced in 2019, with the new product that evaluates up to 182 risk attributes in a millisecond, generating a two-digit score in real time that predicts the likelihood of an enumeration attack."", '""Speed is critical, because the minute a fraudster hits on a valid account number in an enumeration attack, the clock is ticking as fraudsters immediately start trying to monetize the account data,"" Fabara said.The new product, which has six times the fraud-detection features of previous VAAI models, also helps reduce the rate of false positives by 85%, so issuers are less likely to block legitimate transactions that may have looked like they were subject to enumeration attacks, he said.', 'Visa used ""noisy data"" to train the model, but Fabara declined to describe the precise large language models Visa used to develop the new VAAI Score, which is rolling out to U.S. issuers this year.', '""It\'s a Visa-built tool, a generative model that uses deep learning techniques to generate new data that resembles data we know about enumerative attack patterns, allowing the tool to score transactions in real time for the likelihood of enumeration with improved performance,"" he said.', 'Companies have used various forms of AI to detect fraud for almost 30 years, Fabara noted, and the industry is in the early stages of adapting gen AI to attack new fraud vactors.', '""AI has been an integral part of our fraud detection and prevention strategies for the past three decades, but generative AI unlocks the next era in payments security,"" Fabara said.', 'Sift, a San Francisco-based fraud-detection firm, uses advanced machine learning to spot and block suspicious transactions.', ""According to FIBR, Sift's Fraud Industry Benchmarking Resource, the payment fraud attack rate has held relatively steady over the last year. As of the first quarter of 2024, Sift reported a 2.7% payment fraud attack rate, down from 2.8% during the same quarter in 2023. During the same period, Sift noted a surge in the payment fraud attack rate at payment service providers reaching 4.%.""]"

Unsure of which to choose, Mayer took stock of all the good decisions she had made up until that time, according to an interview at Fortune’s MPW conference in 2011, which included picking Stanford, pivoting away from a major in medicine, and working in Switzerland for a summer.', 'When she analyzed what made those choices great, she saw a common theme: Mayer thrived in the unknown.', '""I always did something I felt a little unready to do,” she told Fortune.', 'In the end, it was a fluke that led her to considering Google as a career option. With a flurry of recruiter emails in her inbox, Mayer went to delete one, and because of a wrong keystroke, opened it instead, according to Business Insider. When she opened the Google recruiter email she remembered that her mentor, Stanford professor Eric Roberts, had told her she should meet the founders, Stanford PhD students Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Instead of deleting the email, Mayer asked for an interview.', 'Despite the happenstance of her applying to Google, Mayer was willing to take a chance on the fledgling startup looking to revolutionize search, even if at the time it had fewer than two dozen employees.', '""When you do something you\'re not ready to do, that\'s when you push yourself and when you grow,” she said.', 'Another area of growth for Mayer is in serving as a corporate director. Nextdoor Holdings, which offers the neighborhood-based app of the same name, appointed Mayer to its board today. She also currently serves on the boards of Walmart and AT&T. She was joined by Niraj Shah and Robert Hohman, who also joined the Nextdoor board, the company announced today. Shah is cofounder and CEO of online home goods seller Wayfair, and Hohman is the founder and chairman of company information platform Glassdoor.', 'According to Mayer, encircling herself with the right crowd is another important factor and stood out when she contemplated a future at Google. One of Mayer’s closest friends was working at Google, and said she was already “really impressed” with Page and Brin.', ""“I always surrounded myself with the smartest people I could find,” Mayer said. “Because I think that when you're surrounded by smart people, they challenge you and they make you think about things, you know, harder and and just rise to another level.”"", 'All of those factors made Mayer’s decision easy. Mayer stayed at Google for more than a decade until she was offered the top job at Yahoo. Although Mayer was often criticized during her time there, she still tripled the company’s stock price and navigated it through a sale to Verizon in 2017. Mayer now runs an AI startup called Sunshine, which raised $20 million in 2020 “to simplify and learn from people’s digital address books,” Fortune reported.', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

The Zacks Wireless National industry, to which Verizon belongs, has lost 2.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?"", ""While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making."", 'Earnings Estimate Revisions', ""Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements."", 'Verizon is expected to post earnings of $1.16 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -4.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.2%.', 'For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.60 points to a change of -2.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.', 'For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.70 indicates a change of +2.3% from what Verizon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.6%.', ""With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Verizon."", ""The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:"", '12 Month EPS', 'Revenue Growth Forecast', ""Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial."", 'For Verizon, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $33.06 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +1.4%.

In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects."", ""While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price."", 'As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.', 'Verizon is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers.

If these companies spend on infrastructure, they're posting smaller profits. That's not music to the market's ears, so when companies mention that, they can get hit. That's exactly what happened to Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) after it reported first-quarter results. But the information companies like Meta give investors during their conference calls can be like gold, as the crumbs of all the conference calls reveal one clear winner."", ""In Meta's Q1 conference call, Susan Li, Meta's CFO, discussed the company's investment in AI infrastructure:"", 'As we develop more advanced and compute-intensive recommendation models and scale capacity for our generative AI training and inference needs, we expect that having sufficient infrastructure capacity will be critical to realizing many of these opportunities. As a result, we expect that we will invest significantly more in infrastructure over the coming years.', ""Prior to that, she mentioned that Meta sees great opportunities in the various AI technologies it's developing. This is a long-term investment, and with most investors in the market focused only on the short term, this announcement isn't what they wanted."", ""As a result, Meta increased its 2024 capital expenditure costs to $35 billion to $40 billion from its previous $30 billion to $37 billion.

Its growth has been nothing short of incredible over the past year. Announcements like Meta's stating they will only accelerate their infrastructure buildout are a bullish sign for the company."", ""Furthermore, the GPUs customers are installing now may be obsolete in five years, so there should be significant revenue in the future as older GPUs are cycled out. This gives credence to analyst firms like Precedence Research, which believes the global GPU market opportunity could be $773 billion by 2032. With Nvidia already holding a significant market share, it's set to capture a large chunk of this opportunity."", ""This already helped transform Nvidia into one of the world's most powerful companies, and it's not set to relinquish that title soon. As more companies build out their AI products, Nvidia will be set to benefit."", 'But does that make the stock a buy?', ""Because Nvidia is still growing rapidly, using trailing metrics is unwise. So, we'll look at its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio."", ""At 34 times forward earnings, Nvidia is still a very expensive stock with many expectations baked into it. But if its growth rate continues for several years, this still could be a bargain price for the stock, as long as you're willing to endure the volatility it brings."", ""If you can, it's clear that the long-term opportunity for Nvidia's primary product is still there, and the infrastructure needed to support the proliferation of AI is yet to be fully constructed."", 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Market leaders hyped the technology as being able to bring mobility to sections of the market that have never before had access, such as children, the disabled, or those otherwise unable to drive themselves.', 'As well as this, the technology has lent itself to the vision of new exciting business models, such as ride-hailing services using robotaxis, on-demand freight logistics services, mobile retail, in-car content provision, and servicing to be brought directly to the customer.', 'However, hype from investors and automakers has slowed down considerably as the market faces real challenges. Self-driving companies are facing a myriad of problems, the main one being that it is just a whole lot harder to create autonomous driving software than companies first imagined.', 'According to research company GlobalData’s report, Thematic Intelligence: Autonomous Vehicles (2023), the leap from Level 1 autonomy to Level 2 has proven minor compared with the jump in complexity needed for Level 3 ‘eyes-off’ AV operation.', 'Level 3 autonomy is defined as when the human driver may completely disengage from the dynamic driving task under certain conditions.', '“Moving to Level 4 from Level 3 will be a bigger jump still,” according to the report. “Even Level 3 vehicles will appear simple in comparison with the higher levels and capabilities demanded by truly self-driving Level 4 and Level 5 models, both of which might not include controls for human drivers.”', 'However, Wayve said that its AI-powered driving software could learn to assess risk quickly and learn from other human behaviours on the road – reacting to unexpected accidents.', 'The AI-powered technology is ""built to generalise its driving knowledge from one scenario to another... because it\'s nearly impossible to imagine every situation that a self-driving car needs to reliably handle,” Wayve President Erez Dagan told Reuters.', '""By leveraging the raw power of AI, we can build an Embodied AI system that\'s learned from real-world and synthetic data how to handle edge cases at a rate that surpasses human programming,"" he said.', ""Wayve's huge financial backing and technology partnerships also puts the company at an advantage over other AV startups."", ""Each new AV needs around $700 worth of AI chips, along with a huge amount of sensors, cameras and other technology – making it an incredibly expensive process to build, according to GlobalData's report."", '""Wayve now has significant financial resources to advance its technology, scale operations, and overcome technical hurdles that have impeded other firms,"" John Ellmore, editor and spokesperson for Electric Car Guide, told Verdict.

As well as concerns from safety experts and consumers who fear that the technology is not yet safe.', 'Regulatory progress has been patchy in the US. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration changed safety regulations to permit the provision of vehicles without human controls, but a national approach has been more elusive since earlierattempts failed to pass into law.', 'However, the UK and Europe are making proactive pushes for getting AVs onto roads with safety at the forefront, which could give Wayve an advantage.', 'In November 2023, the UK government rolled out new rules which it said placed safety at the forefront of regulation in self-driving technology.', 'The long-awaited AVs Bill will provide the sector with the confidence it needs to develop the technology in the UK, the government said at the time.', 'Following the bill, Defence Secretary Mark Harper told the BBC that driverless cars could be on some UK roads by the end of 2026.', '""The legislation is going through parliament at the moment, so hopefully we\'ll get that through parliament by the end of 2024,"" he said.', '""Probably by as early as 2026 people will start seeing some elements of these cars that have full self-driving capabilities being rolled out, he added.', 'According to GlobalData, the EU’s long-standing approach continues to be firmly targeted at reducing collisions and fatalities, something that a large consensus continues to expect will be strongly supported by the wider adoption of self-driving technologies.', '""Analysis: Could UK self-driving unicorn Wayve overtake its competitors?"" was originally created and published by Verdict, a GlobalData owned brand.', '', '\xa0', 'The information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

We want to thank the 51,000 McKesson employees for their terrific efforts over the course of this year as together, we drove the business and achieved significant progress in advancing our mission and our strategies.', ""In fiscal 2024, consolidated revenue grew 12% to $309 billion, and adjusted earnings per diluted share increased by 6% to $27.44, both exceeding the expectations we set out at the beginning of the fiscal year. We're pleased with the growth across the enterprise, supported by our differentiated portfolio of assets, our innovative solutions, and our deep commitment to quality and operational excellence. We're particularly excited about the opportunities within our strategic growth pillars of oncology and biopharma services. During the year, we saw a record expansion in the U.S."", ""oncology network and strong market demand for our access, affordability, and adherence solutions. I'm going to start my remarks today with a review of our company priorities and then I'm going to hand it over to Britt, who will take us through more details on the financial performance and our outlook for fiscal 2025. What you will take away from both of us today is our confidence in the strength of the underlying businesses, our commitment to continue carrying out the strategy, and the momentum into the next year. The first company priority I want to touch on is our focus on people and culture."", ""Over the past few years, we've made continued progress in transforming McKesson into a diversified healthcare services company. That requires us to embrace new ideas and lead at the forefront of innovation. We're honored to be recognized as one of America's most innovative companies by Fortune. We'll continue to strengthen our innovative culture, which is essential to our growth strategy overall."", ""Recently, we were also named as one of America's greatest workplaces for women by Newsweek and a top women employer by Diversity Com Media, I am pleased to see our companywide efforts continue to be recognized externally. I'm also really quite impressed by the commitment and leadership exhibited by so many McKesson employees and the initiatives they take on to support each other and to create an open and collaborative culture. Moving on to our two strategic pillars of oncology and biopharma services. These are both pivotal assets that unlock tremendous value and bring significant benefits to our customers and stakeholders."", ""Over the years, we've been building out our portfolio of assets around oncology, spanning from the distribution of related therapies to practice management, to oncology data insights and other value-added services. We're very pleased with the meaningful expansion in our oncology assets as reflected in the growth of the U.S. oncology network. We welcome four practices to the network in the fiscal year, including regional cancer care associates, Cancer Center of Kansas, Nashville Oncology Associates, and SCRI Oncology Partners."", 'The addition of these new practices expands our geographic footprint and allows us to provide our services to a broader set of providers and, importantly, to the patients they serve. As of April, the network has grown to approximately 2,600 providers at 600 sites of care across 31 states. We grew the provider network through a combination of newly affiliated practices and the recruitment of new providers to existing practices. We saw organic growth in providers at more than 75% of the practices.', 'But this extensive reach within the community oncology setting, the U.S. oncology network now treats over 1.4 million patients each year. In addition to practice management, we also provide clinical trial services to these community-based practices. In 2022, we expanded our clinical trial capabilities through the formation of a joint venture that now operates under the name of Sarah Cannon Research Institute or sometimes referred to as SCRI.', 'In the past year, practices in the U.S. oncology network participated in over 200 clinical trials through SCRI, enrolling more than 3,100 patients in treatment studies across various disease states. And in February, SCRI announced a collaboration with AstraZeneca to enhance the delivery of oncology clinical trials. Working together, the two parties will implement modern solutions to accelerate clinical trial delivery time lines, reduce site burden, and enhance trial enrollment within our scaled provider network.', 'In addition to oncology, our other differentiated growth priority is our biopharma services platform, our portfolio of connected solutions provides unique value propositions to biopharma companies and help them improve medication access, affordability, and adherence. In fiscal 2024, we saw strong growth in the Prescription Technology segment, delivering 23% growth in adjusted operating profit. More importantly, in the past year, our differentiated solutions helped patients save more than $8.8 billion on brand and specialty medications. We helped to prevent approximately 10.7 million prescriptions from being abandoned due to affordability challenges and we help patients access their medicine more than 94 million times.', ""The biopharma services platform was built through years of strategic investments. It includes targeted acquisitions that accelerated our growth strategy and internal investments that drove innovation and enhanced capabilities. One of the first assets we acquired was Relay Health and it's foundational to the network and services we offer today. For those who aren't familiar with this business, it helps adjudicate prescription claims and enable the efficient delivery of prescription drugs."", ""It's now connected to over 50,000 pharmacies and processes, billions of transactions annually. The connectivity to the pharmacies provides us insights into the patient's journey and it helps us develop additional solutions programs like co-pay assist programs and digital coupons. We want to provide our customers not just a claims switch solution but a robust platform that connects key stakeholders delivers access and affordability solutions and ultimately improves the patient's experience and outcomes. Let's move on now to our next priority of driving sustainable core growth."", ""We have scaled and durable assets in both pharmaceutical and medical-surgical distribution, and we continue to deliver sustainable growth in these core businesses. In fiscal 2024, U.S. Pharmaceuticals delivered solid results to 16% increases in revenue and a 7% increase in adjusted operating profit, which I'll remind you is at the high end of our long-term target for this segment. To support the business growth and the evolving needs of our customers, we continue to invest in our infrastructure, ensuring that the distribution assets are technologically equipped to maximize capacity and efficiency."", ""And while we're still in the early stages of investing in capabilities of artificial intelligence, we've already developed tools and algorithms that apply AI in the supply chain. This is enabling us to move products more quickly and nimbly throughout our distribution centers, generating cost savings and continuing to improve our service levels. We'll continue to make these targeted and strategic investments that support the sustainable growth of our business. Our core distribution business is also complemented by a growing portfolio of services and solutions around specialty and oncology which adds to our differentiated market position and supports our unique value proposition to our customers."", ""And today, we're excited to talk about our strategic relationship with Optum. We started servicing a portion of Optum's business last year, and we're pleased to get the opportunity to expand the scope of our services starting July of 2024. We believe this relationship is a strong testament to our differentiated capabilities and services across pharmaceutical distribution, sourcing, and oncology. We look forward to the opportunity to serve and grow with all of our customers, including now Optum."", 'As we assess investment opportunities and we allocate resources across the enterprise, we strive to ensure that our decisions align with our strategic priorities and with our mission of improving healthcare in every setting. We want to become not only a diversified healthcare services company but also a company that enables positive change in our communities and drive impact. In April, we launched a new initiative aimed at advancing HealthEquity for at-risk populations in underserved communities. We have a long history of working with pharmacies and providers in the community setting.', 'Now, we want to leverage our business resources and expertise to support their growth and enable better access to healthcare in many of these communities. With this project, we look to identify and address pharmacy deserts where residents faced significant challenges in accessing essential pharmacy services. We chose Avondale, Ohio as our pilot activation site. We help facilitate an expedited path to an independent pharmacy ownership in the local community, and we opened the pharmacy this past December.', 'I had the opportunity to be there personally and experience the joy of those who live in that community appreciating something that most of us take for granted, a pharmacy near our house. We look forward to making a lasting difference in more communities like Avondale in the future. We also support and fund many charitable works through the McKesson Foundation. This past year marked an important milestone for the foundation as it celebrated its 80th anniversary.', ""During the last year alone, it funded nearly 50 organizations through its grant-making program and disbursed approximately $9 million, one-third of which supported direct patient care and assistance. We're also pleased to see continued increase in employee participation in these impactful initiatives. In fiscal 2024, McKesson employees put in over 44,000 volunteer hours with charities across the U.S. and Canada."", ""I'm truly proud of what we have achieved as a team to support the communities and to live our purpose of advancing health outcomes for all. Now, let me pull that all together. McKesson delivered performance above our initial expectations in fiscal 2024, underpinned by continued momentum across the businesses. We finished the year with a growing portfolio of oncology and biopharma services solutions and an expanded core distribution business and a stronger culture that unites us all."", ""As we look ahead to our fiscal 2025, we're excited about the opportunities to grow our differentiated assets and capabilities. We remain deeply committed to our strategies and priorities, and we're confident in our ability to drive sustainable business growth and generate attractive shareholder return. Team McKesson is more focused and more agile as we enter this new fiscal year with strength and confidence. With that, Brett, I'll hand it over to you."", 'Britt Vitalone -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Great. Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. Fiscal 2024 marks another year of strong execution and financial performance. We entered fiscal 2025 with the momentum to deliver growth and create value for our customers, partners, and shareholders.', ""Today, I'll discuss our fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2024 results. Then I'll provide an overview of our fiscal 2025 outlook. My comments today will refer to our adjusted results unless I state otherwise. We're exiting fiscal 2024 with solid performance, delivering earnings per diluted share of $6.18 in the fourth quarter and $27.44 for the full year."", 'Our fourth quarter results were in line with our expectations and with the earnings per diluted share guidance range that we provided on our third quarter earnings call, demonstrating our ability to consistently execute against company priorities and create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders. For the full year, when excluding fiscal 2023 contributions from COVID-related programs and McKesson Ventures, adjusted operating profit grew 9% and adjusted EPS increased 17%. These results are above our long-range targets and reflect the strength of our products, services, and operating execution. Let me start with a review of the fiscal fourth quarter.', 'Revenues increased 11% to $76.4 billion, led by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, resulting from increased prescription volumes, including higher volumes from specialty products, retail national account customers, and GLP-1 medications. Gross profit was $3.3 billion, an increase of 7% and primarily a result of specialty distribution growth within the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, including our leading plasma and biologics business.', ""Operating expenses increased 11% to $2.1 billion driven by higher costs to support growth across the businesses. During the quarter, we recorded a reserve for environmental matters of $0.09 per share for increased remediation costs related to McKesson's former chemical business which we disposed of several years ago. The environmental reserve was recorded in our corporate segment. Operating profit was $1.3 billion, which was flat to the prior year driven by growth in the U.S."", 'Pharmaceutical segment, offset by increased corporate expenses, which included the previously outlined environmental reserve. Year-over-year results were also impacted by anticipated lower contributions from U.S. government COVID-19 programs in both the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Medical-Surgical Solutions segments when compared to the prior year.', 'When adjusting for the COVID-19 programs and a modest McKesson Ventures loss in fiscal 2023, adjusted operating profit increased 4% in the quarter. Moving below the line. Interest expense was $75 million, an increase of 7%, driven by higher short-term borrowings of commercial paper compared to the prior year. The higher short-term borrowings resulted from lower average cash balances in part due to the impact from the Change Healthcare outage.', 'The effective tax rate for the quarter was 28.1%, which is in line with our previous guidance and driven by a discrete tax item. Fourth quarter diluted weighted average shares outstanding was $131.6 million, a decrease of 5% year over year. Wrapping up our consolidated results, Earnings per diluted share was $6.18, again, in line with the implied earnings per diluted share that we provided on our third-quarter earnings call. While this represents a decrease of 14% compared to the prior year.', 'Fourth quarter results were principally driven by a higher tax rate and lower COVID-19 program contributions in fiscal 2024, partially offset by a lower share count and growth in U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. Turning now to our fourth quarter segment results, which can be found on Slides 7 through 11 and starting with U.S. Pharmaceutical.', 'Revenues were $68.8 billion, an increase of 12% and driven by increased prescription volumes, including higher volumes from specialty products, retail national account customers, and GLP-1 medications. As we have previously guided, GLP-1 medications continue to show growth year over year, but despite this increase, the rate of growth continues to moderate. In the quarter, GLP-1 revenues were $7.5 billion, an increase of approximately $1.5 billion or 24% compared to fiscal 2023. However, GLP-1 revenues were flat on a sequential basis.', 'For the quarter, operating profit increased 5% to $901 million driven by growth in the distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems and increased contributions from our generics program. The creative capabilities and assets continued to deliver robust value to our stakeholders. Our Prescription Technology Solutions segment, revenues were $1.2 billion, which were flat to the prior year. Lower contributions from the third-party logistics business were offset by growth across our technology services products and primarily our access solutions.', 'Within this segment, CoverMyMeds continues to deliver value for our partners by increasing connectivity between pharmacies, providers, payers, and biopharma manufacturers through next-generation access, affordability, and adherence solutions that are automated and integrated into provider workflows. Results in the fourth quarter reflect organic growth across our access solutions, including prior authorization services as we extended existing partnerships with biopharma manufacturers. In addition to the strength of our Access Solutions, year-over-year performance was also supported by higher volumes across our affordability solutions. Operating profit decreased 3% to $212 million, driven by higher costs and investments to sustain the momentum and growth across the biopharma services platform.', 'This included incremental infrastructure investments and costs to deliver increasing levels of ROI for our customers. Operating profit was also impacted by lower third-party logistics performance in the quarter compared to the prior year. Turning to Medical-Surgical Solutions. Revenues were $2.8 billion, an increase of 6%, and operating profit was $248 million, which was flat versus the prior year.', ""Fourth quarter results reflect growth in the Primary Care and Extended Care businesses, including higher volumes of illness season testing, partially offset by lower contributions from the kitting storage and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government's COVID-19 program compared to the prior year. As a reminder, each illness season is unique, depending on the onset and severity of various respiratory illnesses during that particular year. Next, let me address our international results."", 'Revenues were $3.5 billion, an increase of 6%, and operating profit was $94 million, an increase of 18%. These strong results were driven by higher pharmaceutical distribution volumes in the Canadian business compared to the prior year. Wrapping up our segment review. Corporate expenses were $193 million in the quarter, an increase of 30%, driven by the previously discussed environmental reserve and higher technology infrastructure and compliance spend.', 'Let me now turn to cash and capital deployment, which can be found on Slide 12. We ended the quarter with $4.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents. For the fiscal year, we generated $3.6 billion in free cash flow, including $687 million of capital expenditures, which included new and existing distribution centers as well as investments in technology, data, and analytics to support our growth priorities. During the quarter, several of our customers were impacted by the Change Healthcare outage, delaying billing functions and claims payments.', ""This outage created a timing impact on McKesson's cash flows. However, the impact was less severe than we had previously indicated. We continue to focus on capital deployment to drive value for our stakeholders. In fiscal 2024, we returned $3.3 billion of cash to shareholders."", 'We returned $3 billion through share repurchases at an average price per share of approximately $436, including $678 million of share repurchases in the fiscal fourth quarter. Additionally, we paid dividends of $314 million for the full year. When combining share repurchases with dividends paid, we returned approximately 92% of free cash flow to shareholders in fiscal 2024. Since the beginning of fiscal 2019, we have returned $16.2 billion of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.', ""Of this amount, approximately $14.5 billion has been returned through share repurchases, reducing our total average shares outstanding by nearly 36%. The strength of our balance sheet and strong credit metrics, supported by our strong operating performance and disciplined and balanced financial policy was recognized in the quarter by the recent Moody's credit rating upgrade to A3 from BAA1. We are now A-rated by two of the three major credit rating agencies. Our strong balance sheet and consistently robust cash flow generation, along with disciplined capital allocation continues to provide us with the financial flexibility to invest in our growth initiatives, pursue strategic opportunities, and return capital to shareholders, all while maintaining a durable capital structure."", 'Now, let me discuss our fiscal 2025 outlook. The breadth of our capabilities and leading portfolio of assets across oncology and biopharma services have led to value creation for our customers, partners, and shareholders over the last five years. Our fiscal 2025 outlook is a continuation of this momentum. Let me start with our segments.', 'We anticipate U.S. pharmaceutical revenues to increase 16% to 19% and operating profit to increase 8% to 10% and propelled by sustainable momentum in the core distribution business and growth across our oncology platform. We continue to make investments in the core distribution network to deliver more efficiency and value for our stakeholders. The strength of our value proposition was highlighted by the recent agreement to build on our existing pharmaceutical distribution partnership with Optum.', 'This five-year contract begins on July 1, 2024. The fiscal 2025 segment outlook incorporates stable, growing prescription utilization trends, bolstered by further growth in our generic sourcing programs and specialty distribution, including our leading plasma and biologics business. We anticipate further growth from our differentiated oncology platform through the breadth of our assets, U.S. Oncology Network, Ontada, and the Sarah Cannon Research Institute joint venture.', ""As Brian mentioned, as of April 2024, the U.S. oncology network has grown to approximately 2,600 providers in 31 states, and we're pleased with the advancements we've made with Ontada and Sarah Cannon Research Institute supporting our mission to advance cancer care. We are pleased with the growth we're seeing in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment as our assets and capabilities and core distribution, and the oncology platform continued to accelerate growth."", ""In the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, we anticipate revenues to increase 18% to 22% and operating profit increased 12% to 16%. This outlook reflects organic growth across our solutions and services as we expand and extend partnerships with biopharma manufacturers and increase the number of brands utilizing our access affordability and adherence programs. Throughout fiscal 2024, we continue to see increased demand for our access and affordability solutions, particularly those related to GLP-1 medications. As a reminder, McKesson's prior authorization products serve the majority of the brands for GLP-1 medications."", 'Our products continue to generate value for our partners. Looking ahead to fiscal 2025, we anticipate that this demand will remain elevated, yet lessen as the rate of increase will be slower than prior years for GLP-1 medications. Medical Surgical business remains well positioned to leverage the breadth and depth of its services and assets across all alternate sites of care, including growth in the primary care business and our comprehensive private label portfolio. We anticipate Medical Surgical Solutions revenues to increase 4% to 8% and operating profit to increase 6% to 8%.', ""Within the primary care market, we anticipate continued growth in Lab Solutions and Specialty Pharmaceuticals. Our scale sourcing and distribution footprint has propelled expansion and growth of our private label portfolio, providing superior value for our customers. while maintaining sound economics for McKesson. In fiscal 2025, we're making investments in this segment to support the recent acquisition of Compile, a healthcare data platform that captures and aggregates data to provide insights and analytics for biopharma."", ""We believe there's an initial use case across the breadth of the Medical Surgical Solutions segment. The Medical Surgical Solutions segment has broad relationships with providers and extensive data sets, meeting opportunities to develop incremental value creation opportunities. Longer term, there are increased opportunities to integrate the capabilities in commercial applications across our oncology and biopharma services platforms. These investments will deliver meaningful returns to the segment and to the enterprise."", 'In fiscal 2025, we anticipate that these investments will account for an approximate 2% operating profit headwind in the Medical segment as compared to the prior year. Finally, the international segment, we anticipate revenues to increase 4% to 8% and operating profit to increase 6% to 10% year over year. Our diversified set of assets within our Canadian business, including the scale distribution business, continues to support growth in the International segment. We continue to make investments in our Canadian technology footprint to create a more custom and integrated supply chain for specialty drugs.', 'As a reminder, Norway remains the only operating country in Europe that we have not entered into an agreement to sell, and contributions related to operations in Norway are included in the fiscal 2025 outlook for the segment. We intend to exit Norway as part of the completion of our European exit. In the Corporate segment, we anticipate expenses to be in the range of $580 million to $640 million, which includes increased technology spend to support the growth of our businesses and infrastructure and compliance investments. We will also continue to invest in data and analytics, including the acceleration of several investments in artificial intelligence.', ""We are leveraging AI to increase the efficiency across our operations and increase automation and productivity for our customers. Our investments in AI and other advanced technologies play an important role in improving customer service and provider productivity. We continue to build these tools across the value chain to increase speed and success rates. One example where we're implementing AI is in our oncology platform."", ""The EHR contains structured data that can often be sparsely entered for patients' longitudinal records. Instead, unstructured data such as uploaded documents and provider-authored notes, are used to capture details on patients' disease condition in response to treatment as well as many core clinical factors to have complete longitudinal patient records for real-world research core variables are required to be extracted from the unstructured data into a well-organized database. Natural language process is the only scalable solution to achieve more than 100 million documents in [Inaudible] today and growing at the rate of 1 million documents per week. The application of AI reduces clinicians' exhaustive burden in finding related documents for care and reimbursement workflows, ultimately leading to practice efficiencies and better patient care."", ""This is just one example of many where we're using AI to power insights and deliver clinical and financial value to our stakeholders. We've been pleased with our progress to date as we work to develop and implement various AI technologies, and we remain committed to increased investment to further extend our leadership position and deliver value to our partners and stakeholders. Now, moving below the line. We anticipate interest expense to be approximately $220 million to $240 million and income attributable to noncontrolling interest to be in the range of $140 million to $160 million."", 'We anticipate the full-year effective tax rate will be in the range of approximately 18% to 20%. And as a reminder, the timing and amount of discrete tax items are difficult to predict, and therefore, we do not provide quarterly effective tax rate guidance. Turning now to cash flow and capital deployment. We anticipate free cash flow of approximately $4.8 billion to $5.2 billion.', 'Our working capital metrics and resulting free cash flow will vary from quarter to quarter and are impacted by timing including the day of the week that marks the close of a quarter. Our guidance reflects plans to repurchase approximately $2.8 billion of shares in fiscal 2025. As a result of the share repurchase activity, we estimate weighted average diluted shares outstanding to be in the range of approximately $128 million to $130 million. The strength of our balance sheet and operating cash flows provides the financial flexibility to incrementally invest both organically and inorganically for growth as well as return capital to our shareholders.', 'Wrapping up fiscal 2025 guidance. We anticipate revenue growth of 15% to 17% and an operating profit growth of 9% to 14% as compared to the prior year. For fiscal 2025, we anticipate earnings per diluted share of $31.25 to $32.05, which represents growth of 14% to 17% as compared to fiscal 2024. We expect earnings per share will be more heavily weighted toward the second half of the fiscal year.', 'We also anticipate the first quarter to have the lowest contribution. As a reminder, we had a lower effective tax rate in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 due to a discrete tax item. In summary, we see strength and stability in the underlying fundamentals across our businesses. Our sustained financial performance over the past several years has been bolstered by the strength of our financial position and the consistent operating execution, leading to compelling value creation for our customers, partners, and shareholders.', ""We're pleased with the strong fiscal 2024 performance and the fiscal 2025 outlook reflects our continued confidence in the operating profit growth momentum across all segments of the business, supplemented by the strength of our balance sheet and strong financial position.

I just want to delve into a little bit of the pharma growth increase.', ""How much of that is related to Optum? And were there any costs onboarding costs associated with bringing a contract like that on board, meaning did it dilute the impact this year -- and then as a quick follow-up, I noticed you didn't mention Optum as being part of the MedSurg guidance. There is some belief that that was also a potential contract win for you or an incremental contract win for you there. Is that not true? Or is there just no impact this year?"", 'Britt Vitalone -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Thanks for the question, Kevin. I'll start. Maybe I'll go in reverse order. Our win of the Optum contract, and we're certainly pleased to extend and expand our partnership, as Brian mentioned, is pharmaceutical related only."", ""As we think about next year, Optum is included in our guide. As you know, we do not specifically talk about customer contract details. And so, we have not provided specific contributions for Optum, and we don't intend to do that going forward. This is a recent contract win."", 'We have not incurred any costs yet related to that transition. We do expect that there will be some costs in the transition, but not material and certainly included in our guidance.', 'Rachel Rodriguez -- Vice President, Investor Relations', 'Next question, please.', 'Operator', 'Next will be Allen Lutz with Bank of America. Please go ahead.', 'Allen Lutz -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""Good afternoon, and thanks for taking the questions. One for Britt, I want to ask about the prior authorization business in RSTS -- we've heard that employer coverage for GLP-1s doubled year over year. So, the amount of employees that have coverage of GLP-1 is now twice as high as it was in 2023. So, even though the amount of GLP-1 that you're dispensing is lower, we would have still expected that prior authorization activity in that business would have benefited pretty significantly in calendar 1Q."", 'Did any of the GLP-1-related prior authorizations get pushed out of calendar 1Q? Was there any impact from change? And can you just speak to the growth rate of that business more broadly? Thanks.', 'Britt Vitalone -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. Thanks for the question. I'll start, and certainly, Brian could add to this. I think when we've talked about the segment in the past, there are many different things that go through the segment."", ""One of those being our 3PL business, our 3PL business, as we talked about in the past is slightly more than half of the revenue and as I mentioned in my comments, the 3PL performance was lower than the prior year for various customer contract considerations. We're certainly pleased with what we're seeing in our prior authorization business. We continue to see growth in that business, and we continue to see growth in our fiscal fourth quarter as well. We did make a number of investments, as I talked about."", ""And we also made some investments for future years to continue our growth and continue the value that we're providing to our customers. So, underlying all of that, we had a very strong year. The business grew on the bottom line 23% year over year. So, there's great momentum there."", 'Prior authorization business as part of our Access Solutions did have growth in the first quarter. But as I mentioned, we had slower 3PL performance, and we continue to make some investments into the business for future growth.', 'Brian Tyler -- Chief Executive Officer', ""As it relates to payer and, frankly, employer behavior as it relates to the coverage of these drugs, I think you've got to probably bifurcate it into diabetes, which is a more mature indication, weight loss, which is tied up emerging tracking follow-on conditions that it may or may not be applicable to. So, I think it's in the early days of employers and payers figuring out and handle this. And across that spectrum, it can be quite different."", 'Rachel Rodriguez -- Vice President, Investor Relations', 'Next question, please.', 'Operator', 'Next will be Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.', 'Lisa Gill -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', ""Thanks very much. I just want to go back to the pharmaceutical operating profit for 2025. If I go back and I look at kind of your long-term outlook, you talked about 5% to 7% growth. You're now talking about 8% to 10%."", ""And one, I know you don't want to talk about specific customers, but is this tied to the new customer win? Or is there something else that's propelling that -- and then as I think about Optum, your comments were that you started a relationship last year. You've increased the scope of services. You're now doing sourcing, distribution, oncology. Can you maybe just help us understand, one, in winning that business and, secondly, how we look at Optum versus maybe some of your other clients? And any incremental opportunities you see with Optum going forward?"", 'Brian Tyler -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Thank you, Lisa. I appreciate the question. Look, we're obviously really excited to get the privilege and the opportunity to expand our relationship with Optum. And I think it's a testament to the differentiated services and solutions, the breadth of our diversified healthcare service offerings."", ""Optum itself is a big, complicated entity with lots of services and lots of solutions. So, we're really happy to have the opportunity. I do think it's a reflection on the investments that we've made over the past several years and the efficiency of our core operations, our commitment to continuing to make those investments, not just in efficiency, but in innovations and thinking about how we use our tools to solve different problems. This is very much today a distribution agreement."", ""We'll be servicing Optum home delivery to Optum infusion, OptumCare, the specialty pharmacy. So, is very broad with that regard. But I do think it's a reflection of past investments that we've made in not just in distribution, but in the portfolio of capabilities that we offer."", 'Britt Vitalone -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Lisa, maybe I'll answer your question. Maybe I would just start with just a little bit of a foundation building here. If you think about the U.S. Pharma segment over the last four years, the adjusted operating profit has grown at a compound annual growth rate of about 6%."", ""So, really right in the middle of the long-term targets that we provided -- there are long-term targets for a reason. It's what we expect as a sustainable growth rate for the segment. We're certainly pleased with the growth that we saw in FY '24. And if you exclude the impact of COVID-related programs in FY '23, segment grew 12%."", ""So, we certainly have a lot of momentum in that business as we enter into FY '25, as Brian mentioned, we're certainly pleased with the opportunity to serve Optum as well. So, this is a business that we've been making a lot of investments in. It's a business that -- we have some expertise that we're continuing to add to in terms of our sourcing capabilities, providing value back to our customers. And we have a lot of momentum in this segment."", ""And so, I think the growth rate that we've outlined here for '25 is a continuation of the momentum that we've seen now over the last several years."", 'Rachel Rodriguez -- Vice President, Investor Relations', 'Next question, please.', 'Operator', 'And next will be Michael Cherny with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.', 'Mike Cherny -- Leerink Partners -- Analyst', ""Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question, and congratulations on a really nice guide. As we think forward, both for '25 and beyond, I want to ask a little bit about the oncology side of your assets and maybe wrap it into the secondary question, but you continue to scale stuff like U.S. and alongside, obviously, everything inside the pharma solution -- Pharma Services segment."", 'As you think about the totality of the assets and the ability to build off of that platform, how does that postal with your ability also to utilize your ever-growing free cash flow to continue to drive inorganic growth on top of organic and within that portfolio of, again, broad-based oncology assets, what are the best areas you have to continue to expand beyond where you already are?', 'Brian Tyler -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Yeah. Thank you. Michael, I appreciate that. We talked about many times our capital allocation strategy, and our first priority in that strategy is to invest to grow the business either through internal development and investments in innovation or inorganic opportunities.', ""Certainly, when we look at inorganic opportunities or M&A, we like that to be very, very tightly aligned to our articulated strategy with the associated proper financial returns, of course. And so, oncology is one of those growth areas and one of those growth priorities and being a pretty significant player in the oncology space in general and the leading player in the community oncology space. We're very familiar with a lot of, I would call, emerging tools, technologies, and companies out there. And anywhere that we can find an asset that's aligned to our strategy in community oncology that we think is additive to either the footprint that we have in U.S."", ""oncology or our leading EMR or our adds capability to our data insight business or accelerates clinical trials would be very much a sweet spot for us. And Britt actually referenced in his comments some internal stuff we're doing around AI. And we have made some small acquisitions past that bring us capabilities in this area that are helping us improve our -- our efficiency in serving those patients and improving the practice quality or the lifestyle basically of our oncologists, the practice part of U.S. Oncology."", ""And we think that's part of the overall formula that's been really supporting and enabling well, quite frankly, the record growth that we had last year."", 'Rachel Rodriguez -- Vice President, Investor Relations', 'Next question, please.', 'Operator', 'And next will be Charles Rhyee with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.', 'Charles Rhyee -- TD Cowen -- Analyst', ""Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to circle back to RxTS, obviously, looking at a really positive outlook. But thinking about what -- the preliminary fiscal '25 guide you kind of gave for this segment last quarter."", ""The final guide actually is a little bit better here. Any sort of comments on what is driving sort of the increased optimism here? Is it solely just as we're thinking about maybe GLP-1s? Or maybe can you talk about sort of any kind of gains at Relay Health as it relates to the Change Healthcare outage? Any comments there would be helpful. Thanks."", 'Britt Vitalone -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Thanks for the question. I'll start. So, the AOP growth guide that we provided you for FY '25 is really right in the range of what we've seen for growth over the last four years, maybe just slightly below, we had 16% compound annual growth rate in this business on operating profit since FY '20. So, the growth rate that we've provided you this year is really kind of right in line with that."", ""And we intend to continue to make investments in this business as we go forward to develop additional solutions and capabilities for our customers. So, we expect that our technology solutions and services will continue to grow as they have over the last few years. The value that we're providing for our partners is continuing to resonate and we see stable prescription growth. It's really underpinning a lot of the programs and solutions that we have."", ""And the growth rate that we expect for next year is really in line with what we've been able to deliver over the last several and we'll continue to, as Brian talked about, we'll use our free cash flow to invest in our growth opportunities as we go forward."", 'Rachel Rodriguez -- Vice President, Investor Relations', 'Next question, please.', 'Operator', 'The next will be Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.', 'Eric Percher -- Nephron Research -- Analyst', ""Thank you. A question relative to competitive intensity. And specifically, contract movement we've seen. I think with Optum, there was a real concern that the contract could even be outsourced or element of specialty could be outsourced, and yet here, it comes to you, and we've also seen CVS outsourcing scale to you."", ""So, my question would be, do you believe that you've developed a scale advantage and main specialty that is unique relative to other distributors, or how important is the specialty footprint in driving the value that has led to these significant gains?"", 'Brian Tyler -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Thanks, Eric. Well, look, I'm not going to comment much on the competitive set. But I can say we have made pretty significant investments in the business and to modernize our distribution infrastructure, think about cold chain, how you handle cold chain efficiently, have a highly compliant distribution network. We certainly have scale."", ""And in this business, I've been in this business 28 years, and scale does tend to help. But I really come back to the fact that we've made the investments in core distribution excellence. We clearly understand this piece of the market quite well. and that we think of ourselves as a solution-oriented value-added kind of partner and try to paint a broad picture of not just what we could do if we had a relationship but how we could grow that relationship through time using an array of the capabilities represented within McKesson."", 'Britt Vitalone -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. Eric, I would just add to that. If you think about the strategy that we've executed on over the last several years, we've been very disciplined and focused and really growing our capabilities in oncology and pharma services, including the investments that Brian spoke of in terms of our distribution network. So, the breadth of capabilities that we have today is more significant than it was a few years ago."", ""And the value that we're able to provide now through the investments that we've made through some of the other acquisitions that we've made in like oncology as an example. We believe that that value is what is attractive and the breadth of capabilities that we have as well."", 'Rachel Rodriguez -- Vice President, Investor Relations', 'Next question, please.', 'Operator', 'The next will be Stephanie Davis with Barclays. Please go ahead.', 'Stephanie Davis -- Barclays -- Analyst', ""Hey, guys, thank you for taking my question, and congrats on a really good guidance. I was hoping to get a little bit more color about the nature of the biopharma investments you're making in the prescription transaction business. Just kind of nature of it, whether they're on more of a recurring expense, like head count compared to more near-term pockets of them like platform development? And anything you can give us on that?"", 'Brian Tyler -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. So, I'll start, and if Britt wants to add anything he can. I mean, we have a pretty differentiated set of assets in this business scale -- multiple scaled networks as what we call them, which includes connectivity into provider workflow, and we very much fundamentally think part of our job is to continue to innovate off of those to both enhance the value and the return our products provide to biopharma and to continue to solve new problems for them. So, we have historically always invested in this business."", ""And when we see an opportunity ahead of us, we are not afraid to increase that investment to run at that because we think these differentiated assets allow us to solve problems in unique ways. Most of this investment has been in technology. And that's probably about all I would say."", 'Rachel Rodriguez -- Vice President, Investor Relations', 'Next question, please.', 'Operator', 'The next will be Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.', 'Elizabeth Anderson -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', ""Hi, guys. Thanks so much for the question, and congrats on a nice guide. I was intrigued by your comments about the med surg segment and sort of how you're thinking about data and the use of assets new acquisition you just made. It seems like a little bit of a shift into more sort of additional value-added services in that segment."", 'Could you give a little bit more color on that and sort of how you see that evolving over the next couple of years?', 'Brian Tyler -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Sure. I mean, in many ways, we thought of Compile as a foundational data investment for us. And we like the business by itself, but we also thought, given some of the other data sets transaction sets that reside in the company, we could augment and add and accelerate that. And we chose the first use case in the medical business, where we have extensive hundreds of thousands of relationships with providers and data that complement their already strong provider data service offering.', ""So, we think we can both augment that and unlock unique value because of the footprint and reach in MedSurg. And so, we're making an investment into that thesis."", 'Rachel Rodriguez -- Vice President, Investor Relations', 'Next question, please.', 'Operator', 'The next will be Daniel Grosslight with Citi. Please go ahead.', 'Daniel Grosslight -- Citi -- Analyst', ""Hey, guys, thanks for taking the question. I want to go back to the question that Charles asked on RCS. But really on the top line, you're seeing a material acceleration in growth next year, while, as you mentioned, the adjusted operating income is kind of in line with where you've been historically. So, that does imply a bit of a degradation in margin."", ""So, I was hoping you could put a finer point on the growth acceleration on the top line and margin compression you're seeing. Is that mix shift to lower-margin businesses? Is that the increased investments you're making? Any color there would be great. Thanks."", 'Britt Vitalone -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Thanks for that question. I can answer that. The growth that we're seeing next year on the top line is more accelerated growth in our 3PL business. As we've talked about before, the 3PL business generally represents a little more than half of the revenue in the segment."", ""but less than 10% of the adjusted operating profit. And so, as we expect to win some additional business next year and see some of our customers continue to grow, that revenue will be faster rate than we've seen in prior years. And given the mix that that represents in the segments driving faster top line, again, at a lower margin rate on the bottom line from that particular business, 3PL business, so the underlying technology businesses are continuing to grow in a consistent manner, and we're really pleased with the growth that we're seeing there. But what you're seeing is a mix impact in FY '25 from the 3PL business."", 'Rachel Rodriguez -- Vice President, Investor Relations', 'Next question, please.', 'Operator', 'Next will be Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.', 'Erin Wright -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst', ""Great. Thanks. I wanted to get a little bit of color on what you're seeing and what's embedded in your guidance in terms of the pricing environment on the U.S. pharma business and what assumptions you're making in terms of generic pricing trends and environment that you're seeing as well as kind of on the branded side."", ""I know that's less of a swing factor for you, but how is that playing out relative to your expectations here? Thanks."", 'Britt Vitalone -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Sure. Happy to answer that question. As we think about the pricing environment for branded products, it is going to be -- our anticipation is to be very consistent with what we've seen in the past several years. So, stable and competitive branded price environment."", ""And in the generic space, again, we look to drive value for our customers through our working operations looking to drive the lowest cost at the highest availability supply. And we believe that the -- in our outlook for FY '25, we expect to see a competitive and stable environment in the generic space as well. So, we don't see a lot of changes in the environment for both branded and generics pricing in our outlook versus FY '24. And we anticipate that we can continue to drive good value in the generics space for our customers."", 'Rachel Rodriguez -- Vice President, Investor Relations', 'I think we have time for probably one more question.', 'Operator', 'Certainly. That question will come from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.', 'Stephen Baxter -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', 'Thanks for the question. You know, much of the guidance, I wanted to ask one on the quarter. Just on the Pharma revenue growth rate, I was wondering if you could help us think about any impact you might have seen from insulin list price changes in the quarter. It sounds like that was probably a headwind to your revenue growth rate.', 'And any contribution from commercial COVID vaccines in the quarter that we should be mindful of? Thanks.', 'Britt Vitalone -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Yeah. Nothing really specific to call out there, Steve. And as it relates to COVID vaccines, as I mentioned, we are lapping the COVID programs that we had last year, and from a commercial vaccine perspective, lower contribution that we saw in the third quarter, really a nonmaterial amount of contribution to our fourth-quarter results.', 'Brian Tyler -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Hey, well, thanks again, everyone, for joining our call this evening.

But one of the simplest and most effective means of generating income is to invest in dividend stocks, while provide passive income without the need to sell an asset, while also allowing you to participate in the stock market.', ""Finding a company that can grow in value while distributing dividend payments is a dream come true for long-term investors. And that's exactly what Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Air Products and Chemicals (NYSE: APD) are."", ""Meanwhile, the J.P. Morgan Equity Premium Income ETF (NYSEMKT: JEPI) yields a whopping 7.6% and includes exposure to top companies from Amazon to ExxonMobil. Here's what makes Microsoft, Air Products, and the J.P. Morgan Equity Premium Income ETF worth buying now."", ""Daniel Foelber (Microsoft): Microsoft's mere 0.7% dividend yield results from its outperforming stock price, not a lack of raises. Over the last five years, the stock is up 223%, but the dividend has increased by 63%. Zoom out over the last decade, and Microsoft is up a jaw-dropping 906%, while the dividend is up 168%."", ""Given the stock's strong performance, Microsoft investors surely don't mind the low yield. But investors who don't own Microsoft and are considering buying the stock may wonder why the 0.7% yield is worth it, let alone grounds for a lifetime of passive income."", 'The reason is that Microsoft can easily afford to make sizable increases to its dividend every year. Earnings have grown at a faster rate than dividend raises, which is why the payout ratio is now at a 10-year low of less than 25%.', ""A payout ratio under 75% is good for a reliable company, but below 50% is even better if a company has cyclical earnings. Part of the reason for Microsoft's low payout ratio is that it rewards its shareholders with stock repurchases and dividends. Microsoft has reduced its share count despite its sizable stock-based compensation expense. Buybacks are an important means of preventing dilution, and we can expect buybacks to continue to accelerate and the outstanding share count to meaningfully decrease over the coming years."", 'If Microsoft keeps outperforming the S&P 500, then the dividend will merely be a cherry on top of a winning position. But if Microsoft languishes, expect the yield to noticeably increase thanks to strong dividend growth and room for the payout ratio to go up if needed. Either way, Microsoft has what it takes to reward shareholders.', ""Scott Levine (Air Products): It may be impossible to look into the future and see which stocks will provide investors with years of passive income, but it's certainly helpful to turn your attention to the past. With a peak at a company's previous performance, you can gain insight into how strong a candidate it is to achieve years of returning capital to shareholders. Air Products is a prime option."", ""Over its 80-year history, Air Products has emerged as a leading provider of industrial gases and related equipment to businesses operating in a variety of industries, including energy, aerospace, and healthcare, to name a few. For forward-looking investors, today's a great time to gas up on Air Products stock, which currently has a 2.9% forward-yielding dividend and is hanging on the discount rack."", ""Growing its dividend for 42 consecutive years, Air Products has demonstrated a steadfast commitment to rewarding shareholders. With respect to the more recent past, it's worth noting the company's dedication to its payout. From 2014 through 2024, Air Products has hiked its dividend at a 9% compound annual growth rate, while averaging a payout ratio of 62.3% over the past 10 years."", ""Because the company serves a wide variety of industries, it's unlikely a downturn in any one would wreak havoc with the company's financials, thus jeopardizing the dividend. Moreover, the company has a strong competitive advantage. Operating over 750 production facilities and over 1,800 miles of industrial gas pipeline, Air Products has developed a robust infrastructure that could hardly be disrupted by upstart industrial gas companies. Add to this the company's commanding position as a hydrogen supplier, and the allure of Air Products becomes even more obvious."", 'With shares of Air Products valued at about 15.2 times operating cash flow -- a discount to their five-year average cash flow multiple of 17.4 -- now seems like a great opportunity to start of position in this industrial gas powerhouse.', ""Lee Samaha (J.P.

I've covered it in more detail as an ETF to buy elsewhere, but I'll run through the key points here for brevity."", 'In a nutshell, the ETF invests at least 80% of its assets in actively managed U.S. equities and up to 20% in a strategy of selling call options on the S&P 500 index.

This AI technology, trained extensively on vast data sets, enables the company to efficiently recognize and generate text or email responses back to customers.', '“Before generative AI, replying to that email request defied automation.

When capacity is tighter, route guides fail more often and more freight falls into the spot market,” she explained in an email.', '“But that’s just one use of this tech. The true beauty of it is that it opens the door to automate virtually any type of email transaction. It can be trained to recognize any type of email, as long as we receive enough of those emails for the model to learn from, and we can also train it to classify emails in multiple ways.”', 'C.H.

Our organization is equipped with diverse equipment and skills to address a variety of equine-related needs, as well as other large animals. We will also go to horse shows and serve as emergency personnel in case of any issues, and we host obstacle course clinics and de-sensitization classes to help people train their horses."", 'How does the organization engage with the local community?', 'We engage in extensive outreach efforts with members, the public, and first responders. We recently received a grant from Maryland to provide Large Animal Technical Rescue training for first responders, helping them understand how to handle animal emergencies. This training is crucial because many first responders and even veterinarians need more expertise in technical rescue for animals. We also conduct outreach for children and youth, including school visits and working with local 4H clubs.', 'Can you tell us a little about your horse?', ""I met my horse, Finn, when his previous owner had been told by doctors that she was no longer able to ride. Originally, I just started riding him to get him out of the barn, but I fell in love with him - it was very serendipitous. He is a total rock star and is absolutely perfect for me. He is a seven-year-old Bay Roan Quarter Horse, and I'm looking forward to a long time with him."", 'How has this organization impacted your life?', ""It has deepened my appreciation for the effort required to manage these situations. I've had horses for a long time, but I've been fortunate to avoid major issues. However, there have been instances where we needed urgent assistance, which wasn't readily available, underscoring the importance of having a solid plan and access to resources, especially as I age. There's a growing need in our community for this type of service, which is evident from the significant increase in our call volume. Initially, we barely received a handful of calls in a year, but now, we're surpassing that in just a few months. The word is spreading among the community, EMTs, and police about our availability as a resource. Assisting someone in distress holds immense value for me, especially knowing that support would be reciprocated if I were ever in a similar situation."", 'What is one call that stands out to you?', ""We had a horse that was hit by two cars and lived. We were able to get him on the ambulance and to New Bolton, the premier equine veterinary hospital in the area. Not only did he live, but he's actively enjoying a happy and fulfilling life."", 'As part of your Exelon Powering Communities Employee Volunteer Award, FHERT received a $5,000 grant. How is that being used?', ""We were able to purchase a dedicated truck for the ambulance. We've had a trailer for some time, but relying on individual member's trucks wasn't ideal for a variety of reasons. The truck is a reliable way for us to answer calls quickly and transport horses and other large animals when needed."", ""Exelon's strong support for volunteerism is truly inspiring, and it's incredible to be recognized with this award. I'm deeply grateful for the company's commitment to empower employees to get out there and champion causes that we're passionate about."", 'View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Delmarva Power on 3blmedia.com.', 'Contact Info:Spokesperson: Delmarva PowerWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/delmarva-power Email: info@3blmedia.com', 'SOURCE: Delmarva Power', 'View the original press release on accesswire.com']"

I’m also bullish on VDC based on its low fee, long dividend history, and the strong Smart Scores its top holdings boast.', 'VDC was launched by index fund pioneer Vanguard more than 20 years ago, in January 2004. In that time, the fund has grown to $6.5 billion in assets under management (AUM). According to Vanguard, VDC “seeks to track the performance of a benchmark index that measures the investment return of stocks in the consumer staples sector.”', 'VDC’s underlying index “includes stocks of companies that provide direct-to-consumer products that, based on consumer spending habits, are considered nondiscretionary.”', 'We’ll get into what types of stocks this encompasses in the section below.', 'VDC owns 105 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 60.7% of the fund.\xa0Below, you’ll find an overview of VDC’s top 10 holdings from TipRanks’ holdings tool.', 'As you can see, VDC owns a group of high-profile, blue-chip U.S. consumer staples stocks.', 'The fund owns the makers of everyday household staples like detergents, deodorants, soaps, shampoos, and more, like Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Colgate-Palmolive. These companies may not sound like the most exciting in the world, but they sell products that people need every day and are loath to cut from their budgets. This puts them in a strong position no matter how the economic tides ebb and flow from one day to the next.', 'Colgate recently shook off inflation and economic uncertainty to report strong 9.8% organic sales growth for the first quarter and increased pricing of 8.5%, encapsulating the strength these consumer staples stalwarts have in this environment. Colgate also used the strong start to the year as an opportunity to increase revenue guidance for the year.', 'Meanwhile, VDC has positions in soft drink giants like Coca-Cola and Pepsi (NASDAQ:PEP), which sell the sodas and other drinks that many people consume on a daily basis, regardless of how the macro economy is doing or where interest rates stand.', 'Like Colgate, Coca-Cola recently reported earnings and overcame any macroeconomic challenges, beating on both revenue and earnings. Coca-Cola says that it expects to grow organic revenue by an impressive 8-9% this year, along with comparable currency-neutral EPS growth of 11% to 13%.', 'Tobacco stocks like Philip Morris and Altria (NYSE:MO) are in a similarly strong position, as tobacco users buy their products on a routine, habitual basis and are unlikely to eschew this habit just because the economy is slow. Inflation and the uncertain economy aren’t hurting demand for Philip Morris’ red-hot nicotine pouch product Zyn, which saw shipment volume increase by an incredible 79.7% year-over-year during its first quarter of the year.', 'Big box retailers like Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) are competitive in any type of economic environment, thanks to their low-cost offerings.', 'Lastly, Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ), the maker of popular snacks like Oreos and Chips Ahoy! is the type of company many consumers will buy products from as an affordable pick-me-up when they may not be able to afford other luxuries in a down economy.', 'Other notable VDC holdings from beyond the top 10 include Hershey, Keurig Dr Pepper (NYSE:KDP), Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST), and Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH). Hershey just reported impressive first-quarter earnings in which it brushed off rising cocoa prices to beat estimates. Its earnings grew 3.7% year-over-year, and revenue increased 8.7%. ', 'As these results show, top consumer staples stocks like these have strong brands and persistent demand to succeed during a challenging macroeconomic environment.', 'In addition to these resilient business models and strong demand, another thing that VDC’s top holdings have in common is their strong Smart Scores.\xa0The Smart Score is a proprietary quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from 1 to 10 based on eight market key factors. A score of 8 or above is equivalent to an Outperform rating.', 'Eight out of VDC’s top 10 holdings have Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores of 8 or above, and VDC itself has an Outperform-equivalent ETF Smart Score of 8 out of 10.', 'Whether it’s Pepsi and Coca-Cola or Altria and Philip Morris, many of VDC’s top holdings are lauded for their long dividend histories, so it’s no surprise that VDC is a dividend payer.', 'VDC currently yields 2.5%. While it’s not a huge dividend yield, it trumps that of the S&P 500 (SPX), which yields 1.4%.

This means that an investor in the fund will pay just $10 in fees on an investment of $10,000 annually.', 'Over time, investing in low-cost funds like this can save investors a considerable amount of money. Assuming the fund returns 5% per year going forward and maintains its current expense ratio, the investor putting $10,000 into the fund will pay just $128 in fees over a 10-year time frame.', 'How does this help investors to save? Let’s compare VDC to another consumer staples ETF with a higher expense ratio, the iShares U.S. Consumer Staples ETF (NYSEARCA:IYK), which has $1.3 billion in AUM and charges an expense ratio of 0.40%. An investor putting $10,000 into IYK will pay $40 in fees annually, and assuming the same parameters as above, this investor will pay a much higher $505 in fees over a 10-year time horizon, illustrating the considerable savings offered by a low-cost fund like VDC.', 'Below, you can check out a comparison of VDC and IYK using TipRanks’ ETF Comparison Tool, which allows users to compare up to 20 ETFs at a time based on a variety of inputs.', 'Turning to Wall Street, VDC earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 56 Buys, 43 Holds, and six Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average VDC stock price target of $220.16 implies 8.8% upside potential.', 'I’m bullish on consumer staples and VDC in particular. The economy goes through ups and downs, and the stock market ebbs and flows, but consumers always need the basics that consumer staples companies sell, whether it’s their favorite soft drink from Coca-Cola or Pepsi or toothpaste from Colgate-Palmolive. It may not be the sexiest sector, but these companies have strong and consistent earnings and revenue.', 'Throughout earnings season, we’ve seen companies like Coca-Cola, Hershey, Philip Morris, Colgate-Palmolive, and other consumer staples names prove this.', 'I’m also bullish on VDC, specifically because of its holdings’ strong Smart Scores, low expense ratio, and attractive dividend.', 'Disclosure']"

If you want to skip our overview of O'Leary's investment philosophy and learn about some more companies in his stock portfolio, go directly to Kevin O'Leary’s Stock Portfolio: 5 Stock Picks for 2024."", 'Kevin O\'Leary, affectionately known as Mr. Wonderful to fans and fellow venture capitalists, is renowned as one of the venture capitalists on ""Shark Tank"" and a commentator on economic news. The Irish-Canadian kickstarted his business journey by establishing the educational software company Softkey in 1986 by leveraging the proceeds from the sale of his SET share and a $10,000 investment from his mother. This venture eventually propelled him to the forefront of the business world. Softkey specialized in producing and distributing educational software in CD format, expanding its market presence through a series of mergers and acquisitions in the early 1990s. Notable acquisitions included WordStar, Spinnaker Software, and The Learning Company, the latter of which Softkey adopted as its name following the acquisition.', ""In terms of investing in securities, O'Leary, Chairman of O’Shares Investment Advisors, advocates for including high-quality businesses with strong balance sheets and robust financial performance in investment portfolios. Additionally, he stresses the importance of diversification across various market sectors, with dividend payments from the companies under consideration deemed as perhaps the most vital factor. To that end, O’Shares Investment Advisors' ETF, ALPS O'Shares U.S. Quality Dividend ETF (BATS:OUSA), holds stocks embodying a blend of these three attributes. The ETF has delivered growth rates of 11.55% over the past year, 38.69% over the last five years, and an impressive 86.92% since its inception. Some notable names held by the ETF include the likes of Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)."", 'The venture capitalist recently outlined his investment approach on LinkedIn, stressing the significance of cash-flow-positive investments within a diversified portfolio. Here is what he said:', '“A couple of years back, I sold my ETF company to Alps, the biggest ETF player in the States. It’s called O’Shares, and that’s where my family’s wealth is parked. OUSA is part of the S&P 500, cherry-picking the highest quality balance sheets with positive cash flow from around 100 out of the 500 names. Then there’s OUSM, which grabs the Russell 2000 and weeds out the underperformers – those companies not making any real dough. Forget Shark Tank, forget Bitcoin. Sure, I’ve got a 5% stake in Bitcoin and another 5% in gold, but the meat of my US portfolio? It’s in OUSA or OUSM.”', 'Speaking further on this, Kevin O’Leary, during his appearance on \'Good Morning America,\' used some of his time to unveil a number of good stock picks for first-time investors, with The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) being one of his recommendations. While investors widely regard the home improvement retailer as a dependable choice, O’Leary is particularly fond of it due to its substantial size, robust balance sheet, and consistent dividends. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is also among O\'Leary\'s top picks, and he holds a strong affinity for the company. ""I love it,"" he said, highlighting the company\'s diversified product portfolio ranging from COVID-19 vaccines to Tylenol.', ""On the other hand, despite his reservations regarding Bitcoin ETFs, O'Leary acknowledges their regulatory approval as a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency industry. He believes that only a select few, particularly those backed by major industry players like Fidelity and BlackRock Inc., will thrive. O'Leary sees this as a step towards broader acceptance of digital payment systems, such as the USDC stablecoin. While exercising caution with Bitcoin ETFs, Mr. Wonderful remains optimistic about Bitcoin's future value, estimating it could reach between $150,000 and $250,000 by 2030. However, he disagrees with Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood's more ambitious prediction of Bitcoin hitting $1.5 million by 2030, unless there is an economic catastrophe, arguing that such a rapid surge in Bitcoin's value would imply a significant downturn in the US economy."", 'The ""Shark Tank"" star also expressed concerns about the current state of the commercial real estate market, suggesting that it is on the verge of collapse. He believes that this downturn will have far-reaching consequences, particularly for investors and small business owners. O\'Leary emphasized that the current situation is unprecedented, as the commercial real estate market is not anticipated to fully recover to pre-pandemic levels. Speaking to FOXBusiness,\xa0the venture capitalist made the following comments on office spaces:', '“Most of these buildings were built over the last 30 years and [have mortgages with] interest rates of less than 4%,” he said. “Now the Fed has raised rates to 5.5% terminal rate, which means these mortgages are going to be refinanced at 9% to 11% — so a 3x cost. So many of these buildings won’t be economically viable.”', 'Helga Esteb/Shutterstock.com', 'Our Methodology', ""In this article, we'll explore Kevin O'Leary's top 10 stock picks for 2024, which reflect his investment philosophy and offer insights into asset management. O'Leary typically favors equities of well-established, financially stable companies with strong balance sheets and a history of consistent dividend growth.

With outsized returns of this magnitude, it should come as no surprise that Berkshire\'s annual shareholder meeting draws around 40,000 investors each year who want to hear the affably dubbed ""Oracle of Omaha"" speak about investing philosophy and the U.S. economy.', ""But while Berkshire's annual shareholder meetings are filled with nuggets of investing wisdom from Warren Buffett, they also often contain confessions."", ""On Saturday, May 4, the Oracle of Omaha specifically called out two holdings that he and his top investment aides -- Ted Weschler and Todd Combs -- were selling during the March-ended quarter. Meanwhile, Berkshire's first-quarter operating results spilled the beans on another brand-name company that also looks to have been trimmed."", ""Arguably the most surprising admission during Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting was that Buffett and his team jettisoned approximately 115 million shares of tech stock Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) during the March-ended quarter. We won't know the exact figure until Berkshire files its Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 15."", ""This is actually the second consecutive quarter that Berkshire's largest position by market value has been pared down by the company's brightest investment minds. The logic behind this recent selling likely has to do with corporate taxation. Whereas the roughly 10 million shares of Apple sold during the fourth quarter were to offset select investment losses, the capital gains Buffett's company recognized from selling 115 million shares of Apple in the first quarter may have to do with front-running fiscal policy changes in Washington, D.C."", ""At the moment, the peak federal corporate income tax rate is 21%. President Joe Biden has proposed increasing the peak rate to 28%. With higher tax rates likely in the future, Buffett has opined that investors won't gripe about locking in gains now at a lower corporate tax rate."", ""Despite selling around 125 million shares of Apple, combined, over the previous two quarters, the Oracle of Omaha has made clear that it's going to be a longtime holding for Berkshire Hathaway."", ""Although Apple's iPhone is the domestic leader in smartphone market share, and CEO Tim Cook is overseeing the steady transformation of his company to promote subscription services, you'd be hard-pressed to find a catalyst Buffett appreciates more than Apple's market-leading capital-return program."", ""Last week, Apple increased its quarterly dividend by $0.01/share -- Apple is set to dole out more than $15.4 billion in annual payouts to its shareholders -- and its board authorized up to $110 billion in additional share buybacks. Since the start of 2013, Apple has repurchased $674 billion worth of its common stock. Over time, these buybacks are incrementally increasing Berkshire's stake in the second-largest publicly traded company."", 'The second high-profile stock the Oracle of Omaha confessed to selling during Berkshire Hathaway\'s annual shareholder meeting is underperforming media titan Paramount Global (NASDAQ: PARA). Buffett commented that he sold the entire stake (more than 63.3 million shares, as of December 31), and that ""we lost quite a bit of money.""', 'Buffett also silenced ongoing rumors about the losses Berkshire absorbed from its stake in Paramount Global by absolving Todd Combs and Ted Weschler and noting that ""I was 100% responsible for the Paramount decision.""', ""The thumping Buffett took on his investment in Paramount can be traced to a couple of challenges. To start with, it's been tough sledding for certain types of advertisers over the past year and change. Specifically, legacy TV networks have seen ad dollars shift to streaming platforms. Between ongoing cord-cutting and select money-based indicators forecasting a recession, advertising revenue for its legacy networks has declined."", ""The other issue for Paramount Global has been its need to build out its streaming assets and content library to counter cord-cutting. Although revenue for its direct-to-consumer (DTC) segment surged 37% last year to $6.74 billion, the DTC segment is still losing a boatload of money. While increasing monthly subscription prices is part of the recipe to shrink these losses, Paramount's streaming segment is an undeniable drag on the company's bottom line."", ""Given these challenges, Paramount Global's future might entail it being acquired. Private equity company Apollo Global and Sony Pictures have sent a letter to Paramount's board where they've expressed interest in paying $26 billion, including debt, to acquire the company. Paramount has also had discussions about a potential merger with Skydance Media."", ""While the advertising landscape should meaningfully improve this year, thanks in large part to higher spending during an election year, Paramount is going to need to address its steep DTC losses if it's to right the ship."", ""Even though Warren Buffett didn't confess to selling shares of energy juggernaut Chevron (NYSE: CVX) in the March-ended quarter, Berkshire's first-quarter operating results appear to have spilled the beans."", 'As of the end of March, the fair value of Berkshire\'s investments in Chevron were listed as ""$19.4 billion."" But based on Chevron\'s closing value of $157.74 on March 28, along with the 126,093,326 shares Berkshire held, as of Dec. 31, 2023, this position should have been fairly valued at nearly $19.9 billion. This roughly $500 million difference in fair value implies that the Oracle of Omaha and his team sent around 3 million shares of Chevron to the chopping block during the first quarter.', ""Similar to reducing his company's enormous stake in Apple, I wouldn't read too deeply into Buffett and his aides paring back their position in Chevron by a relatively small amount."", ""For starters, Berkshire's smartest investing minds realize how critical energy commodities like oil are to the U.S. and global economy. Buffett, Combs, and Weschler generally take a long-term view on the investments they make and realize that the U.S. economy tends to grow over long periods."", ""To add, Chevron should benefit from the tight global supply of crude oil. Major energy companies (including Chevron) were forced to pare back their capital spending for years during the pandemic. Further, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has created energy supply concerns for Europe. As long as the supply of crude oil remains constrained, there's a reasonable likelihood that the spot price of crude will head higher. That's great news for Chevron's high-margin drilling segment."", 'Another reason Buffet & Co. trust in Chevron is its integrated operating structure. In addition to its drilling operations, Chevron owns transmission pipelines, chemical plants, and refineries. These are segments that provide steady operating cash flow and a hedge against a move lower in the spot price of crude oil.', ""Lastly, Chevron has one heck of a capital-return program. It recently raised its base annual dividend for a 37th consecutive year, and its board OK'd a repurchase program of up to $75 billion last year."", 'More than likely, Buffett and his team paring down their stake in Chevron represents nothing more than some minor profit-taking.', 'Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

If you want to skip our coverage of the latest developments in the artificial intelligence scene, then you can skip ahead to 5 Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy Now According to Wall Street Analysts. ', 'As companies are reporting their financial results for the first quarter of 2024, artificial intelligence once again appears to be one of the leitmotifs of the current earnings season.\xa0While the data for the current earnings season is unavailable, FactSet estimated that out of 179 companies that had earnings calls between December 15 and March 15, the term AI was mentioned on average 13 times. The tally of 179 marked the second highest for the term ""AI"" in the transcripts over the course of the past ten years, and was just three shy of the current record of 181 set during Q2 2023.', 'Within that dataset, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) led the pack, as it mentioned the term AI 114 times during the company’s latest earnings call. The chip maker, known for its GPUs, has seen a significant boost in its stock price on the back of strong demand for semiconductors that power various AI applications. Its shares are up by a cool 216% since May 2023, after CEO Jensen Huang shared that he foresaw a the need for a ""trillion dollars of installed global data center infrastructure"" to transform computing from ""general purpose to accelerated.""', ""Since then, NVIDIA's CEO, who is widely credited by the industry to have lead the development of GPU-accelerated computing applications such as medical imaging, reiterated his estimates of the AI industry. The latest on this front came in February 2024, when at the World Government Summit, Huang not only elaborated on his vision for accelerated computing but went on to stress that continued advancement of processors to fuel AI use cases will be energy efficient as well. According to him:"", '""So now, we\'re in the beginning of this new era. And what\'s going to happen is, there\'s about a trillion dollars worth of installed base of data centers around the world. And over the course four, five years, we\'ll have two trillion dollars worth of data centers that will be . .uh. . powering software around the world. And this architecture for accelerated computing is ideal for this next generation of software called generative AI. So that\'s really at the core of what is happening. While we\'re replacing the installed base, of, general purpose computing, remember that the performance of the architecture is going to be improving at the same time. So, you can\'t assume, just that you will buy more computers; you have to also assume that the computers are going to become faster.', 'And, therefore, the total amount that you need is not going to be as much. Otherwise the mathematics that we just assumed, that computers never get any faster, you might come to the conclusion, we need fourteen different planets, and three different galaxies, and you know, four more Suns, to, to fuel all this. But obviously, computer architecture continues to advance.""', ""All this focus on NVIDIA and AI means that its upcoming earnings release will be closely watched by investors and analysts worldwide. Another firm that once again has become the center of attention after quarter earnings is the Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp parent Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Meta's stock had a strong run in February 2024 on the back of its fourth-quarter earnings report, which was accompanied by a surprise $0.5 quarterly dividend announcement. However, in April nearly all of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s gains were wiped out as investors looked past better-than-expected results and focused on the forward guidance that included Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s plans to spend $40 billion this year, most of which will go towards its AI initiatives."", ""On the other hand, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) have managed to keep investor pessimism at bay, at least for now. Both companies reported their earnings a day after Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Investors were pleased to see both Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) report robust growth in the Core segments, where artificial intelligence served as a major catalyst. Microsoft and Google's parent reported revenue and earnings above expectations and expressed optimism regarding maintaining the same momentum going forward."", 'For Microsoft and Alphabet, the earnings from their cloud business divisions provide a glimpse into the firms\' AI performance in the first quarter. Microsoft\'s overall results saw it beat analyst revenue and EPS estimates of $60.8 billion and $2.82, respectively, by posting revenue of $61.9 billion and earnings of $2.94 per share. Microsoft\'s Intelligent Cloud segment\'s sales sat at $26.7 billion, while Azure, the cloud computing platform, grew by 31%. At the earnings call, CFO Amy Wood also briefly commented on AI revenue growth by sharing that ""AI services contributed 7 points of growth as expected.""', 'Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\'s first quarter earnings also highlighted AI due to strong performance by the Google Cloud segment. The company\'s Cloud business, which offers AI product bundles like Google One, posted $9.57 billion in revenue and marked a 28% growth on the year. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai shared details for Google Cloud\'s AI Hypercomputer, as he outlined that ""60% of funded Gen AI startups and nearly 90% of Gen AI unicorns are Google Cloud customers."" The executive added that business and corporate interest in AI was proceeding smoothly, with firms such as Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) ""deploying Gen AI-driven tools to its nearly 10,000 call center agents to achieve faster resolution times for customers.""', '""And we shared that more than one million developers are now using our generative AI across tools, including AI Studio and Vertex AI. We spoke about how customers like Bristol-Myers Squibb and Etsy can quickly and easily build agents and connect them to their existing systems. For example, . Customers can also now ground their Gen AI with Google Search and their own data from their enterprise databases and applications.""', 'So, as Wall Street adapts and adjusts to AI, we decided to take a look at which AI stocks analysts are in love with.

If you want to skip our coverage of the latest developments in the artificial intelligence scene, then you can skip ahead to 5 Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy Now According to Wall Street Analysts. ', 'As companies are reporting their financial results for the first quarter of 2024, artificial intelligence once again appears to be one of the leitmotifs of the current earnings season.\xa0While the data for the current earnings season is unavailable, FactSet estimated that out of 179 companies that had earnings calls between December 15 and March 15, the term AI was mentioned on average 13 times. The tally of 179 marked the second highest for the term ""AI"" in the transcripts over the course of the past ten years, and was just three shy of the current record of 181 set during Q2 2023.', 'Within that dataset, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) led the pack, as it mentioned the term AI 114 times during the company’s latest earnings call. The chip maker, known for its GPUs, has seen a significant boost in its stock price on the back of strong demand for semiconductors that power various AI applications. Its shares are up by a cool 216% since May 2023, after CEO Jensen Huang shared that he foresaw a the need for a ""trillion dollars of installed global data center infrastructure"" to transform computing from ""general purpose to accelerated.""', ""Since then, NVIDIA's CEO, who is widely credited by the industry to have lead the development of GPU-accelerated computing applications such as medical imaging, reiterated his estimates of the AI industry. The latest on this front came in February 2024, when at the World Government Summit, Huang not only elaborated on his vision for accelerated computing but went on to stress that continued advancement of processors to fuel AI use cases will be energy efficient as well. According to him:"", '""So now, we\'re in the beginning of this new era. And what\'s going to happen is, there\'s about a trillion dollars worth of installed base of data centers around the world. And over the course four, five years, we\'ll have two trillion dollars worth of data centers that will be . .uh. . powering software around the world. And this architecture for accelerated computing is ideal for this next generation of software called generative AI. So that\'s really at the core of what is happening. While we\'re replacing the installed base, of, general purpose computing, remember that the performance of the architecture is going to be improving at the same time. So, you can\'t assume, just that you will buy more computers; you have to also assume that the computers are going to become faster.', 'And, therefore, the total amount that you need is not going to be as much. Otherwise the mathematics that we just assumed, that computers never get any faster, you might come to the conclusion, we need fourteen different planets, and three different galaxies, and you know, four more Suns, to, to fuel all this. But obviously, computer architecture continues to advance.""', ""All this focus on NVIDIA and AI means that its upcoming earnings release will be closely watched by investors and analysts worldwide. Another firm that once again has become the center of attention after quarter earnings is the Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp parent Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Meta's stock had a strong run in February 2024 on the back of its fourth-quarter earnings report, which was accompanied by a surprise $0.5 quarterly dividend announcement. However, in April nearly all of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s gains were wiped out as investors looked past better-than-expected results and focused on the forward guidance that included Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s plans to spend $40 billion this year, most of which will go towards its AI initiatives."", ""On the other hand, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) have managed to keep investor pessimism at bay, at least for now. Both companies reported their earnings a day after Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Investors were pleased to see both Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) report robust growth in the Core segments, where artificial intelligence served as a major catalyst. Microsoft and Google's parent reported revenue and earnings above expectations and expressed optimism regarding maintaining the same momentum going forward."", 'For Microsoft and Alphabet, the earnings from their cloud business divisions provide a glimpse into the firms\' AI performance in the first quarter. Microsoft\'s overall results saw it beat analyst revenue and EPS estimates of $60.8 billion and $2.82, respectively, by posting revenue of $61.9 billion and earnings of $2.94 per share. Microsoft\'s Intelligent Cloud segment\'s sales sat at $26.7 billion, while Azure, the cloud computing platform, grew by 31%. At the earnings call, CFO Amy Wood also briefly commented on AI revenue growth by sharing that ""AI services contributed 7 points of growth as expected.""', 'Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\'s first quarter earnings also highlighted AI due to strong performance by the Google Cloud segment. The company\'s Cloud business, which offers AI product bundles like Google One, posted $9.57 billion in revenue and marked a 28% growth on the year. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai shared details for Google Cloud\'s AI Hypercomputer, as he outlined that ""60% of funded Gen AI startups and nearly 90% of Gen AI unicorns are Google Cloud customers."" The executive added that business and corporate interest in AI was proceeding smoothly, with firms such as Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) ""deploying Gen AI-driven tools to its nearly 10,000 call center agents to achieve faster resolution times for customers.""', '""And we shared that more than one million developers are now using our generative AI across tools, including AI Studio and Vertex AI. We spoke about how customers like Bristol-Myers Squibb and Etsy can quickly and easily build agents and connect them to their existing systems. For example, . Customers can also now ground their Gen AI with Google Search and their own data from their enterprise databases and applications.""', 'So, as Wall Street adapts and adjusts to AI, we decided to take a look at which AI stocks analysts are in love with.

This platform caters to the evolving consumer preference for digital banking services, positioning FIS as a forward-thinking leader in financial technology. Additionally, the company's strategic investments in complementary technologies through internal development and external opportunities enhance its competitive edge."", ""Market Consolidation Risks: The financial technology industry is susceptible to consolidation, which poses a risk to FIS. Mergers and acquisitions among financial institutions can lead to a loss of clients if FIS's solutions are not chosen by the newly formed entities. Additionally, larger institutions resulting from these consolidations may have increased bargaining power, potentially impacting FIS's pricing strategies and profitability."", 'Competitive Pressures: FIS operates in a highly competitive market, facing challenges from both established players and emerging fintech innovators. The pressure to innovate and keep up with new technologies is intense, and failure to do so could result in the loss of market share. Furthermore, the unbundling of individual solutions from comprehensive suites, which FIS provides, by international competitors and global banks, adds to the competitive landscape.', ""Demand for Digital and Payment Solutions: The shift towards digital banking and payment solutions presents a significant opportunity for FIS. The company's investment in platforms like Digital One positions it to capitalize on this trend, as financial institutions seek to provide integrated banking experiences across multiple channels. FIS's ability to offer innovative and modern solutions aligns with the market's direction and can drive growth."", 'Strategic Partnerships and Acquisitions: FIS has a history of strategic acquisitions that have expanded its service offerings and market reach. The company can continue to pursue partnerships and acquisitions to enter new markets, acquire advanced technologies, and enhance its product portfolio. These strategic moves can provide access to new customer segments and drive long-term growth.', ""Economic Downturns: Economic downturns can adversely affect FIS's clients, particularly financial institutions, leading to reduced spending on technology solutions. This, in turn, can impact FIS's revenue and growth prospects. Additionally, recent U.S. bank failures, while having limited current exposure, could have broader implications for the industry and FIS's client base."", 'Regulatory and Security Risks: FIS operates in a highly regulated environment, and changes in regulations or failure to comply with existing ones can result in significant penalties and reputational damage. Moreover, cybersecurity threats and data breaches are constant risks for companies dealing with sensitive financial data. FIS must continuously invest in security measures to protect its systems and maintain customer trust.', ""In conclusion, Fidelity National Information Services Inc (NYSE:FIS) exhibits a robust financial foundation with strong recurring revenue streams and a diversified product portfolio. However, it faces challenges from market consolidation and competitive pressures. Opportunities for growth lie in the increasing demand for digital banking and payment solutions, while economic downturns and regulatory risks pose significant threats. FIS's strategic focus on innovation and customer-centric solutions will be crucial in navigating the dynamic financial technology landscape."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value.

Motley Fool Money starts now. I'm Dylan Lewis, and I'm joined over the airwaves by Motley Fool Analyst Asit Sharma. Asit, thanks for joining me."", 'Asit Sharma: Dylan, thank you for having me.', ""Dylan Lewis: It's a big week for earnings. We've got results from two major names that are painting a cloudy picture of the consumer, maybe a conflicting picture of the consumer. Asit, I want to start with Starbucks. Shares down 15% after the company earnings update showed a 2% decline on the top-line and also earnings that missed expectations. What was the culprit here behind the pullback?"", ""Asit Sharma: Dylan, the culprit was declining traffic in North America, which is a core market, and also in the major investment markets that Starbucks has emphasized, like China. You had declining same-store sales, which is never a good sign, and this is something that the market is really trying to digest. It was a surprise that the company missed estimates, and the outlook is gloomy. When you have lower same-store sales that are predicated on less traffic, even if you've got a little bit of pricing power, which Starbucks has, that always makes investors worry. When are you going to pick that traffic back up? I think there are some reasons why the traffic is declined. That's easy to see, especially in North America, but we can get into that as we go."", ""Dylan Lewis: You mentioned price power there, and I couldn't help as I was looking through the results and seeing some of these year-over-year declines, to think this is a company that has flexed their pricing power and been able to continually move things up. Are we seeing people say, you know what, it's just not worth it for me to pay that little bit much more this many times a month. I'm going to cut back the number of visits that I'm making to Starbucks because the pricing is just getting a little out of hand."", ""Asit Sharma: I think there could be some of that for sure, and we see that in places like California where, like other restaurant systems which have to serve people on a unit basis very quickly, raising prices because California's implemented some new wage standards is causing this weird dislocation, where investors are having to make that very same decision. The other place we see it is in throughput, and this gets to maybe some of the issues that Starbucks is having that's going to last more than just a few quarters. Management talked about the fact that they really can't serve everyone in their morning daypart. If you drive by a Starbucks in the morning, you've seen the lines of cars that pile up there. This is something that really didn't matter to consumers outside of the pandemic. People want their coffee. There was a lot of still disposable income sloshing around, so it didn't matter. The company could both make customers wait and charged more for the same product. Now the dynamic is different. Starbucks management is acknowledging that consumers are a little more jumpy. They're watching their dollars more carefully, thus if you're in a line, and it's expensive anyway, and you're waiting and waiting, you have a tendency to just pull off that line, so this becomes a problem of throughput. How fast can you get consumers through that drive-through or in and out of the stores? Starbucks has been working on this problem for a while, and they've got some solutions. Some listeners may be familiar with, it's a thing called Clover. This is a small company that Starbucks bought several years ago, and they took those machines and modernized them. They're basically machines that give you a lot of variability in the components, how you make a cup of coffee. It can make a cup of coffee faster than a barista can, and this has been modernized. Now we're seeing Clover in some more Starbucks locations that's supposed to help speed up the whole process of serving a cup of coffee. They have a similar system for the more difficult part of their service, which is serving cold drinks, that's called Siren. The Siren System is supposed to be a solution, but Dylan, there's a bottleneck on the bottleneck. If traffic is a bottleneck, Starbucks is taking a lot of time to test this system. It's been slow to roll this out. We've been hearing about it for a couple of years, so management talks about this as an opportunity. Hey, if we sped up the lines, we actually could record more sales, but so far, management hasn't been able to operationalize on these enhancements, and that's also causing investors to worry."", ""Dylan Lewis: You mentioned the dayparts there. That came up in management commentary as one of the main things that they see as an execution opportunity to address. It was interesting. They dove a little bit into this idea that they are seeing all of these people in Mobile Order and Pay, in particular, go begin to order something and then abandon, and my takeaway there, Asit, is you can make something expensive as long as it's convenient, but if it's expensive and inconvenient, you are going to see consumers vote with their dollars a little bit more. Some of the other execution opportunities that management identified was continuing to launch new and exciting products. I think that is a little bit tougher for investors to say, OK, we are definitely going to see signs of success there, there have been some really breakthrough products for them, but they tend to be very seasonal and a little bit harder to predict. The third thing that they threw out was reaching and demonstrating more value for occasional and non-Starbucks rewards consumers. What I think I'm reading there, if this is correct, is they are seeing strength with their loyal consumers, but a lot of their more occasional buyers are those more price-sensitive folks that maybe are turning away and not going quite as often now."", ""Asit Sharma: It could be. I seem to think similarly. Here Starbucks has some opportunities. They really have done a great job with incentivizing their loyal customers to come in, but at the same time, they've degraded the value of the Starbucks points over the years. We've seen that with airlines as well. I'm not so sure that it's the best solution to reach the occasional customers much. I feel like maybe some reinvestment in the value of the Starbucks loyalty program would help them first. You always have an easier lift incentivizing the core customer versus coming in and trying to entice a customer who hasn't visited as much, but I see and acknowledge the need to to try to get as broad a swath of customers coming in as possible because, if there is this traffic problem, so why not try to fill those gaps in different dayparts with folks who don't come in to smudge?"", ""Dylan Lewis: One of the other ways the company is looking at their dayparts and their operations is testing some after-hours concepts and delivery. They piloted serving customers between 5:00 PM and 5:00 AM and said that, based on the success they were seeing there, they see that this could potentially be a $2 billion business over the next five years. They're going to continue to expand, so we are seeing experimentation. We're seeing innovation in different ideas here with Starbucks. It just feels like one of those quarters where we saw some hints of this last time. We're really seeing the brunt of it this time. Asit, I look at the five-year chart for Starbucks, and we have seen them down around where they are now twice in the last five years, both of those times have been very short-lived. One of them was March 2020 with the COVID reaction. The other was in 2022 with the very broad market sell-off. Shares did not stay around where they are right now for very long. This company certainly has challenges, but it seems like it also has opportunities. Do you feel like Starbucks is worth looking at right now?"", ""Asit Sharma: I think Starbucks is always worth looking at, Dylan. The question is though, what's going to happen in the next couple of years with the macro economy? We're learning that even Starbucks customers have their point of price sensitivity. In 2020, as you rightfully point out, that was a short-lived drop, but the Fed was also sloshing money around, so the effect was easy enough to bounce back from. What I'm worried about here is, if the customer remains crimped for the next couple of years, what will Starbucks rely on to get that revenue growth jump-started? It's not going to be in building more stores. It could be in converting more stores to the self-serve model, where they take out the seats and use simply order and take your drink away, more of the conversions to drive-throughs. Those could be really solid growth propellants, but short of that, investors are wondering, how are you going to come back from what looks like a little bit of deceleration here? That's always harder to do. Starbucks has the tools, it's got the brand power, but it may not be a quick bounce-back. This could be a place to buy Starbucks, but I'm not so sure we'll see that six-month resumption of a very strong chart here. There's something a little amiss underneath all of this that I think management is still working through itself, and it may take a couple more quarters to unravel exactly what's going on, but from the top, i think your census is correct that part of it is this consumers is pulling back."", ""Dylan Lewis: We had a more certain picture with Amazon's results and maybe more of a business-as-usual type story. Revenue up 13% in the company's report to 127 billion. The number that jumped out to me though is operating income up over 200% year-over-year to over 15 billion. I did the math on operating margin here and did a look-back quarter-to-quarter. Asit, I don't think the company has ever touched 10% for an operating margin. Is this a new normal for Amazon?"", ""Asit Sharma: It could be, Dylan. One thing that Amazon has now, which it didn't have before, is sustained profitability in its e-commerce operations, and it got there by doing something. it's used as an explainer for why Amazon Web Services hasn't been as profitable lately, cost optimization. So when you look at Amazon Web Services in quarters before this quarter, management was saying, look, all our customers want to watch their spend because of this uncertain economy, so our profits are a little smaller. They were doing the same thing over in the business of logistics in distribution for the e-commerce side. I think that's a more solid business day. All the work Andy Jassy has done in terms of looking at each business division within Amazon as a holistic enterprise and then paring away what doesn't work is starting to show up in these numbers. So they could be there, and Amazon Web Services itself is doing well. Digital advertising is a nice contributor to that profit margins. You put it all together, I think we could be here, and as you point out, that's not a huge margin, but at a scale when the sales are in the hundreds of billions, it starts to make a difference."", ""Dylan Lewis: Let's talk about that advertising segment for a second. It was up 24% this quarter. That is better growth than its AWS segment. I'll say it is at about half the size of the AWS segment as it currently is, but this was the first time that we had a look at their advertising segment with the benefit of Prime Video being included. I think we have just continued to see the success in what Amazon is able to do. I have to think that this segment is going to become a bigger contributor for the company going forward."", ""Asit Sharma: It should. It's such a high-margin segment for them, and it shows too you don't have to be necessarily the best in terms of content quality. We do know that Amazon has a lot of scale now, so it is a pretty worthy competitor to other streaming businesses, but technology matters. Their technology is pretty good. We see this with Netflix as well, the ability to show advertisers very good conversion on display. They've got that. I think the way that Amazon has approached this isn't the most exciting business, but it's been a steady builder. Again here's this theme coming in Del, now it's reaching scale so it starts to impact that bottom line."", ""Dylan Lewis: Shares were up about 3% on the report, and I feel like people were saying, these are strong results. They're not blowing the, the cover off the ball, but looking pretty good, if there were any things to take exception to and nitpick on, maybe it was the guidance we saw that they were coming in a little bit below expectations for some of the out quarters this year. I do wonder if they are signaling a little bit of that concern that you're mentioning earlier around consumer tightness and just wondering if the macro picture may affect spend a bit."", ""Asit Sharma: I think it's smart of them to do that. It's a business which again, has so many different contributing parts and pieces, but there's not a dominant piece of this business, so if the macro economy gets soft again, each of the big segments, think about AWS, think about those online sales, they'll have some marginal reduction, so it is smartest management to do that. I'll pick a quibble here too with the results. So one thing that I'd been counting on for a long time is, after Amazon built out its distribution network, its logistics fulfillment network, we were supposed to enjoy a lot of amazing free cash flow, and we're seeing it. It's there. It's grants. Now looking forward, some of that free money is going to get eaten up because Amazon is investing in generative AI. That's a benefit to the business, but all the free cash flow, some of the grander numbers that I saw analysts project, I don't think they're going to materialize now. I think Amazon is going to keep investing its spare cash in providing a multilayer of services for AI. That's to the benefit of Amazon long-term, and management talked about this on the call. They go through cycles of investment and then expanding margin and then lower-margins investments."", ""It never ends. I guess there's always something that eats up the available supply of capital that we keep thinking Amazon one day is going to throw off nonetheless. It's really hard to argue with this report in general."", ""Dylan Lewis: Asit, no quibbles with your analysis or ever having you on the show. Thanks for joining me today. My colleague Mary Long caught up with David Henkes, a food and beverage analyst at Technomic to learn about McDonald's CosMc's content."", ""Mary Long: David, you are one of my go-to's when I want to understand what's happening in the food and beverage industry, and I really wanted to talk with you because McDonald's, at the end of last year, launched a pretty interesting new venture. It's called CosMc's. It's a space-themed beverage outpost. It also sells some snacks there, the first launched outside of Chicago. There's a couple of now in Texas. The plan, if I remember correctly, by the end of the year, is to have 10. I've got some business and strategy questions for you that center around what this means for McDonald's, what this means for the beverage space more largely, but I think you're one of the lucky few that have actually been to a CosMc's, so maybe we can start by having you tell us what that experience was like."", ""David Henkes: Thanks for having me on. I did go to the CosMc's. I live just outside of Chicago, and the one here is in Bolingbrook, which is a western suburb of Chicago. I went there. It's a drive-through only concept. It's got golden arches hidden among all of its CosMc's brand name, so it's certainly not trying to hide the fact that it's a McDonald's concept. Interestingly enough, the one in Bolingbrook is right next to a McDonald's, and so as I waited in line for about 40 minutes to get through the drive-through, I watched the McDonald's drive-through which was essentially empty. So they've clearly had a lot of success in terms of driving interests, traffic, sales to the one here in Bolingbrook and to your point, they've I believe they've got two maybe three now in Texas with and my understanding is the same as yours is they want to have 10, so it's something that I think the entire restaurant industry is keeping an eye on and is fascinated by, and we'll see where it goes."", ""Mary Long: The menu is pretty funky. I'm going to just list off a few offerings that listeners, that maybe are unfamiliar, have an idea of what's actually being offered. There's a Sour Cherry Energy Burst, which is like a slushy that comes with caffeine syrup, sour cherry flavoring, as you might expect from the name, and boba balls. There's a Beach Protein Frappe, so a milkshake-like offering with banana flambe flavoring and protein powder. A churro cold brew frappe, that's probably more self-explanatory but interesting flavor combinations there. There's an assortment of coffees, hot and cold, sour and tea-like beverages. Some more familiar items you mentioned the golden arches are hidden within this whole concept, plus some new sandwiches and bakery items. When I hear all that, who is this menu trying to cater to? Is there a specific demographic that McDonald's might be trying to attract here?"", ""David Henkes: I think when you look at a lot of this beverage innovation that they've got on the CosMc's menu, it's clearly aimed toward the younger demographic, Gen Z. Primarily when you talk about these energy drinks, cold coffees, the refresher style drinks that Starbucks has been introducing and has had wild success with, all of these are really aimed toward, certainly not my generation, but they tend to be sugary drinks but high energy and a lot of innovation flavors. To your point about boba, boba has been on a tear lately. So the menu, I think, is built around what McDonald's considers some of the emerging opportunities in beverage, and beverage frankly right now is a hot area ripe for innovation. We see a lot of these stand-alone beverage concepts, Dutch Bro's HTO. There's a number of these beverage forward drive-through concepts that have emerged over the past year or two years. It seems that they've really popped on the scene. McDonald's, within its current four walls of existing McDonald's finds it very difficult to innovate and test out some of these new products. It gets in the way of the flow of the operation. and it's challenged. One of the things that I think CosMc's does for it is it really provides an incubator for them. But it also then doesn't allow them to necessarily alienate the consumers that are coming into McDonald's, and so it gives a separate outlet for them to test some of these things with perhaps this demographic, and McDonald's caters to everybody, and so they, I think, are not trying to be super cutting-edge within their McDonald's menu. What they're trying to do is figure out maybe some opportunities for growth that could be incorporated into McDonald's, and I believe, and I think it's true, that they're using CosMc's as that incubator, as a test site, to try out a lot of these with Gen Z and with the younger consumers especially, but just to see how they resonate and to use it as a test site."", ""Mary Long: I think when news of this launch first came out, a lot of people made the observation that this was McDonald's trying to compete with Starbucks and maybe Duncan and other players in that beverage only type lane or beverage forward type lane. It sounds like you, rather than direct competition, you see this as more like an experimentation space. If that's the case, what do you think the longer-term play is here? Is it to build beyond those proposed 10 CosMc's locations and make this a really substantial stand-alone brand or more so to maybe bring one winner from a CosMc's hub, a CosMc's experimentation place into a full-time McDonald's."", ""David Henkes: McDonald's won't come out to say it, but I think if you read between the lines, listen, whether they have 10 or 100 or even 1,000 CosMc's, McDonald's has roughly a little over 13,000 McDonald's locations in the U.S. They've got about 42,000 globally, so this thing could be a wild success, and it's still going to be a rounding error for McDonald's. McDonald's generates something around $130 billion globally in terms of sales. We see it actually just today. Chipotle just announced today that they're discontinuing their, I think is, Farmesa concept. It's a bowl concept that they were trying. The restaurant industry has a lot of examples where secondary brands do not get the attention, the focus, the investments when you've got a big brand that's growing pretty well, and so there's no question that if this were intended to be a stand-alone brand that they wanted to grow, the success of similar brands in the industry would suggest that it's probably not going to work, including, by the way, McDonald's which used to own Chipotle and spun it off because it was a distraction. The only way, in my opinion, that this really makes sense for McDonald's to grow this and to invest in it, is to use it as an area to test things, to fail quickly, to incubate new ideas, to be unencumbered by how McDonald's currently does things and do things completely different. I think what it means is that beverage as the platform for competition in the future has been acknowledged by a lot of QSR fast food chains. This is McDonald's way of testing and getting more into beverage and figuring out things that work and items that their customers like without completely impacting their McDonald's operations, which by the way is humming along. They grew 9% last year, so the McDonald's business by itself is doing just fine and they don't want to touch that, impact that, slow down drive-through lanes, or impact operational effectiveness, so CosMc's really gives them the chance to have a new sandbox, new playground to try things out in and do it unencumbered by the equipment or the training that their existing McDonald's staff has. They can be as, as out there as they want. The real value then is how you monetize some of these learnings into the $130 billion globally that McDonald's sells because, if you can grow that 5% based on some new beverage learnings, that's a whole lot more impactful than having 50 or 60 CosMc's restaurants which, while they might be successful, are not going to have a material impact on the McDonald's business."", ""Mary Long: CosMc's is a full-on drive through, and it's completely cashless. You order and pay at a drive-through kiosk. Is this the future of fast food, people lists cashless, automated order takers and kiosks?"", ""David Henkes: Yeah. Listen, there's a lot of automation that's happening, primarily in fast food, quick service, fast casual right now. You see some but lessened full service, and a lot of it's driven by the labor situation, so you've got this law in California now, minimum wages are going through the roof. That's having a knock-on effect throughout the country, and so a tight labor market compounded with higher minimum wages makes it tougher and tougher for restaurants, A, to be profitable and, B, to find the people that are going to drive restaurant sales. Automation is certainly an output of that, but listen, labor, we went back to some work we did in 1970. You know what the number one issue facing the restaurant industry in 1970 was? It was labor. Labor is not a new issue for the restaurant industry. What is new is the technology and the ability to drive some incremental sales with it, but realistically, this automation doesn't really replace labor for the most part. It really redeploys labor, and so you're never going to totally take the people aspect out of it. What labor does is it enables more frictionless transactions. Hopefully it drives speed of service, and especially in a convenient environment like QSR is, unlike where there's drive-throughs or a high throughput necessary, the more you can eliminate obstacles and barriers and create that frictionless environment,the better guest satisfaction you have, and hopefully you can redeploy your labor into some higher value added activity. I think that's what a lot of the technology is doing nowadays. They're not necessarily taking labor out, but they're trying to redeploy it and use technology to drive guest satisfaction and, hopefully, drive some incremental sales."", ""Dylan Lewis: As always, people on the program may own stocks mentioned, and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell anything based solely on what you hear.

This week's Motley Fool Money radio show starts now."", ""It's the Motley Fool Money radio show. I'm Dylan Lewis. Joining me in the studio, Motley Fool Senior Analysts Ron Gross and Jason Moser. Gentlemen, great to have you both here."", 'Ron Gross: How are you doing, Dylan?', ""Dylan Lewis: We've got fast food brands signaling that consumer is getting a little pickier and also radar stocks. Ron, generally this time of year, our eyes are on earnings, but we do take a peek at the big macro to make sure that we're not missing anything. For a while, the story was rates are going down. We've had a more recent idea of our rates going up. We had comments from Fed Chair Powell this week. We have fresh labor data. What are you seeing with the rate story?"", ""Ron Gross: Two big stories that this week, on Wednesday, the Fed left interest rates unchanged at 5.3% and commented how they were wary about how stubborn inflation was proving to be. They signaled that rates will likely continue to stay higher for longer. That's been the mantra, higher for longer. It is interesting to see how sticky inflation has been. The Fed's preferred inflation index, while down from 7.1 for sure, which is great, still stands at 2.8%, higher than their target of 2%. Now investors did share the fact that Powell said he thought the next policy move was unlikely to be an increase, and the market actually rallied on that. You'll take what you can get, I guess, in this market. Now fast-forward to Friday, jobs report came out solid but much weaker than expected, which in a vacuum would not be so great, but in the context of an environment where you're looking for a soft landing for the economy, it's actually been heralded as a Goldilocks report. Weakness but not too bad. Its economy appears to be slowing. Market rallied significantly on the hopes that now one or potentially two rate cuts would happen this year. We will see."", 'Dylan Lewis: The big macro can, sometimes, be the big metric soup. I appreciate you helping us wade through that one, Ron.', 'Ron Gross: Very good.', ""Dylan Lewis: We have another monster earnings week to run through. That means we're recovering results all the way from A to W, Apple to Wayfair. Jason, let's start at the top of the alphabet shares of Apple, up 6% this week after the company's second fiscal quarter results. Revenue, down slightly year-over-year but came in ahead of expectations along with earnings. It seems a little bit of a wait-and-see quarter for Apple."", ""Jason Moser: It definitely feels that way. They did not knock the cover off the ball here, but the results seem good enough for Wall Street. and like Ron, it's that you take what you can get. To your point, yeah, revenue, down 4%, and they saw products revenue actually down 10%. Now they blamed this partly on timing and a tough comp from a year ago when supply chain bottlenecks were eased up. Take that for what it's worth, but when you look at the segments, we had iPhone revenue down 10%, services revenue was up 14%. Mac was up 4%. iPad, down 17%. Then I thought this was interesting, wearables, home, and accessories was down 10%, so just hoping to keep an eye on there, but China, always a big point of conversation with Apple. China was down again, but Tim Cook noted in the call that the results there are improving from a quarter ago, so they're seeing a reacceleration there in China. It's becoming less bad as what it was before, but we'll have to see how that shakes out because it's become a very competitive market. We know these replacement cycles are only getting longer as these phones continue to get better, and there are a lot of really good phones out there now, particularly when you look in the China market. Conversation about AI, but still nothing really to report there."", ""Dylan Lewis: I think a lot of people have been waiting for Apple's move when it comes to AI, and CEO Tim Cook alluded to give gifts, a little nugget of something saying, we're looking forward to sharing some very exciting things with customers at events later this year. Jason, what would you want to be seeing from Apple?"", ""Jason Moser: I think the idea, at least probably what people are looking for, is for AI to be incorporated somehow into the device. Primarily that would be the phone, I would guess. Again it's a wait-and-see in a lot of regards because I think that one of the problems with AI right now, just in general, is understanding its implications and how we as consumers might use it or how businesses might use it in the form factor that takes. So I appreciate the fact that they're being deliberate and taking their time there, but yeah, they need to bring something to the table because this conversation regarding AI is only growing louder."", ""Ron Gross: I think the Worldwide Developers Conference in June is probably something to keep an eye on where the next big AI announcement would be. Interesting that the stock rallied significantly on this report. It's all about expectations, really, even though there were some weakness here. It was better than expected. Repurchasing $110 billion of stock continues to return a significant amount of capital to investors, shareholders, in addition to their dividend only trading at 25 times forward, but they do have a China problem, so it's going to be interesting to watch."", ""Dylan Lewis: For context, $110 billion of stock is a Boeing or an Airbnb in market cap. Apple is just saying, yeah, sure, we throw off enough cash. That's not going to get in the way of us doing our R&D investments. We can buy that back. We can also raise our dividend 4%. That's fine. We've got all this stuff in spades."", ""Jason Moser: I will say, with the dividend, it tilts me that it's so low."", ""Ron Gross: It's so [inaudible]."", ""Jason Moser: Exactly. I appreciate what they're doing. Slow and steady wins the race. This is 12 consecutive years they've raised the dividend, and credit where credit's due, it requires looking further out in saying, in year '25, this is ultimately going to be a Dividend Aristocrat® and probably more. [The term Dividend Aristocrats® is a registered trademark of Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC.] Man, I'll tell you, share repurchases are fine. I would love to see them make a little bit more of a material boost to that dividend."", 'Ron Gross: Here.', ""Dylan Lewis: They're setting a low hurdle to keep going up every single year on their path to becoming an aristocrat. Ron, Amazon not really needing to wait for growth in the same way that Apple investors are. The machine just continues to churn their revenue up 13% to over 125 billion for the quarter. It seems like an incredibly strong earnings results for the company, especially with its operating income."", ""Ron Gross: Agreed. Record First Quarter sales. As AI, we have to mention AI in every story, we're contractually obligated. AI, the boom, it would just powered growth through their cloud computing unit. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has tried to shift the company to focus more on AI innovation, both in the Amazon platform as well as the Cloud AWS platform. They were significantly behind Microsoft, Google, some others, attempting to make their way back into that space earlier this month. In a letter to shareholders, he laid out his vision for how generative AI could be a critical building block in their next pillar of growth. You had the website. You had Amazon Prime. You have AWS now. What's going to come next? Perhaps it's AI, but we will see. As you noted, the metrics are wonderful. Revenue, up 13%. North America, up 12%. Amazon Web Services, up 17%. Really strong. Net income increased to $10.4 billion, and that includes a $2 billion loss from their Rivian Automotive investment. Theoretically, from an operating perspective, as you mentioned, even higher. Free cash flow came in at $50 billion for the quarter. They're putting up some real good numbers. Their guidance was pretty strong. As well at CapEx, it's going to be pretty high now as they make investments for AI and other things, so we'll keep an eye on what that does to free cash flow. A pretty strong report trading at 38 times, it's not the cheapest stock in the world, but it is Amazon."", 'Dylan Lewis: We were talking dividend just a minute ago with Apple, and I do have to ask because everyone else in big tech is getting on the bandwagon.', 'Jason Moser: [laughs]', 'Dylan Lewis: Jason, do you think that Amazon would ever consider issuing a dividend?', ""Jason Moser: I think one day they probably will, but I think that they also are not going to feel pressured to do so. They're going to do it on their own timeline, and into Ron's point about the investments they're making in Cloud and AI and whatnot, i t's also nice to see that Jassy is very focused on costs as well with business, so they are not just spending money freely, which is very encouraging. I think probably what comes with that is a singular focus on the balance sheet, net cash flow, and making sure they have the capital that they need to make all of those investments. My guess is a dividend would probably follow years down the line, but I could be wrong."", ""Ron Gross: They do need to continue to make sure their cost structure is right. They laid off 27,000 employees, I want to say, last year, and they keep doing it selectively to make sure their overall head count is where they want it to be. That obviously could cruise right down to the bottom line. As they save money, it pops free cash flow up, it creates more money to potentially pay a dividend and buy back stock, make investments. I think they're closer to getting their expense structure correct, certainly more than they were in the past."", ""Dylan Lewis: Coming up after the break, earnings palooza continues with a look at how Medicare is eating into CVS's results. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Ricky Mulvey with Motley Fool Money here to tell you about a vehicle that is redefining sporting luxury, the Range Rover Sport.

Investors wanted nothing to do with this company as they missed both revenue estimates, and they decreased their guidance. As you said, revenue growth, anemic at 3.7%. The problem with their Medicare unit and their insurance unit, two things. Increased utilization, and that means more money spent on insurance as people continue to seek treatment more and more post-COVID. Everybody put off some elective surgeries. Believe it or not, we're still dealing with that. It seems like COVID has been a while now but not in this case, much higher utilization rates that eats into bottom line. Medicare reimbursement rates, those were cut, and that continues to pressure the company for the remainder of the year and potentially 2025 and forward, but that remains to be seen. They got hit double whammy there. Like Aetna's revenue, for example, was up 25%, but their adjusted operating income fell 60%. They've got some work to do, and CVS is really paying the price for a really big push into Medicare Advantage plans through their Aetna division, and it's coming back to burn them a little bit. They're going to spend time making sure they right-size their balance sheet. They're going to cut costs if they need to. I think all competitors are likely going to need to take similar actions. Even though CVS went hard into Medicare, they are certainly not alone. Earnings, down 33%. Guidance was brought down as well. Stock is only trading for seven times forward guidance, intriguing, but I would be careful."", 'Dylan Lewis: Starting to look a little interesting?', 'Ron Gross: Seven times.', ""Dylan Lewis: This is a company that is very different than the CVS of about five years ago, with the focus on health, with the focus on insurance, the Medicare exposure. A lot of that has happened under CEO Karen Lynch's guidance. Is she on the hot seat?"", ""Ron Gross: I would think for sure. She used to run Aetna, so the fact that CVS has moved big into Aetna-based products, probably not surprising, but that could be a mistake into 2025. We'll have to keep an eye on it but hot seat for sure."", ""Dylan Lewis: Much more favorable reaction to Wayfair's results. Shares, up 20% this week. Jason, I'm probably part of the reason why their sale story is doing OK. Two new kitchen stools and a mirror in my house. Revenue was down slightly but ahead of expectations. I'm glad I could do what I can now."", 'Jason Moser: It sounds like Dylan is a happy resident of the Wayborhood, right?', ""Dylan Lewis: They've got just what he needs."", ""Jason Moser: Get used to that one, right, the Wayborhood. That's going to be a big marketing platform for them, big campaign in the next several years, but yeah, like Apple, they didn't knock the cover off the ball by any means, but the results were good enough. Clearly, the market responded very positively to it, and management did paint a picture of better days ahead. Revenue, $2.7 billion is actually down 1.6% from a year ago. When you look at the metrics that really matter for this business, active customers, 22.3 million now, that was up 2.8% from a year ago. Revenue per active customer actually fell 2.8%, and orders per customer remained relatively flat. Any one of the key metrics we've always kept an eye on with Wayfair is that repeat customer business because acquiring those customers is expensive, so when you get them, you want to keep them. We've seen this metric really perform over time. Now repeat customers placed 80.5% of total orders delivered in the quarter, that was versus 79.1% a year ago, so that number continues to move in the right direction as well. I think that this is a business that, over the last three years, they, like many of these e-commerce businesses, went just through some really very difficult to support growth. A lot of that growth was pulled forward. They're normalizing now, still working toward sustainable profitability, but you keyed in on it there at the very beginning. We're all using it in one way or another. If you have a home or if you rent a place, they've got everything, so it's a nice place to be able to go look and find stuff that you need, unless you're a true Amazon loyalist, I guess."", ""Dylan Lewis: [laughs] I'm going to take some cues here from the key business metrics and, I think, paint a little bit of a picture with the consumer and the story there. Their active customers, as you highlighted, going up, but the spend per customer on average, going down. I feel like that is a sign of something we're going to continue to see this earning season with other companies."", ""Jason Moser: I agree. It feels like we're seeing that type of behavior across the spectrum of businesses, particularly in things like retail and restaurants and whatnot, but we're just seeing a lot of signs with a lot of these reports that, while there is some growth there, it's very clear that the consumer is stretched and starting to make concessions and deliberate and postpone purchasing. Now with that said, I think one thing they noted on the call was very encouraging. They said for the first time since 2019, they're seeing their suppliers starting to introduce large groups of new products into their catalogs as they try to build momentum for this recovery going beyond this year, so that's encouraging. With Wayfair, it's ultimately a network. They're not holding all of that in inventory, but they're connecting suppliers to customers, and to see those suppliers introducing a lot of new stuff, that's a good thing, and when the consumers start to feel a little bit better, Wayfair likely is going to get a few of those dollars."", ""Dylan Lewis: Jason, I know this is a company you've followed for quite some time, going back pre-pandemic. We're seeing this business normalize a little bit. Do you see a return-to-growth story here for them?"", ""Jason Moser: I do to an extent. I think it's a very competitive market to be sure. You look at Amazon. They're the most obvious competitor that really is a threat to a business like this, but they've done a very good job through the years of maintaining the narrative, investing for growth. They're not worried about that profitability and cash flow right now because they feel they're building this network out, and the market opportunity is just so big, and they continue to grow that international business out. It does feel like there's another leg up to go here."", ""Dylan Lewis: More stools and mirrors in my future, it turns out. We're going to wrap this earnings rundown with a look at Coke. Revenue coming in a little bit ahead of expectations, up 3% year-over-year. Ron, when you look at the results from the company, maybe not quite as subject to some of the consumer whims because they are on the lower-priced end, but what did you see?"", ""Ron Gross: The two main things were anemic volume growth of only 1%. You really would like to see that be stronger, but the report was relatively strong and that's because of a 13% price increase across their product line. It's the age-old story of why Warren Buffett has always said he liked Coke besides his addiction to Cherry Coke. It's because of the pricing power, and they have that ability to continually raise prices over time. They attributed about half of the price increase to inflation, the other half was to keep pace with competitors, but for the most part, consumers accepted it. They are seeing inflation decelerate. Corn syrup, sugar, aluminum cans are coming down, so pricing will probably moderate as the year progresses. Net revenue, only up 3%, if we remove currency, up 11%, a little bit better than that. Adjusted earnings per share, up 7%. That's what Coke does. Coke's going to really knock it out of the park, but they've got to continue to come up with new entries into the marketplace. They have this new Happy Tears Zero Sugar you may have heard about sold exclusively on social media. I don't know, I don't get it, but they upped their guidance by 4-5% expected EPS growth. Again it's Coca-Cola. It trades at 22 times guidance. Pepsi's at 21 times guidance, right in line there."", 'Dylan Lewis: You really came out swinging there, Ron. Anemic growth.', ""Ron Gross: I don't know, I don't get it. When it comes to the social media, I absolutely love the spice."", 'Jason Moser: You need to get more salty snacks in that portfolio.', ""Dylan Lewis: Up next, the numbers just keep coming in. We've got details on Starbucks' 15% drop this week and updates on two major fast-food chains. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money."", ""Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis, joined again in the studio by Ron Gross and Jason Moser. We've got earnings from three of the biggest food chains in the world this week, Starbucks, McDonald's, and Domino's, slightly different outlooks across all of them. Jason, I want to start with Starbucks. Shares down 15% and this is not something that we see all that often with a company like Starbucks. There seemed to be a lot of concerns and not a lot of inspiration in the results that we saw from the company. Also, not a lot of inspiration, the commentary from management after the results."", ""Jason Moser: I think you could say that again. These were not good numbers clearly, and we'll get to that in a second, but I think see CEO Laxman Narasimhan seemed very caught on the defensive, whether it was the earnings call or whether it was interviews that he was offering financial media. I don't want to say detached from reality, but it just didn't seem like he really had a focus on what the real problems were. He kept on throwing around a lot of catchphrases and buzzwords, and there were some assigning of blame to the customer and whatnot. It just I don't know. To me, he really has work cut out for him, but I think even more so, to me, the drumbeat is only going to grow louder. He's been there for a year now. Stock is down 35% under his watch. This is Starbucks. That's a big move. It's only going to get louder. We're going to start hearing the question, is he the man for the job, and that's a really fair question, I think, at this point. Particularly after this report, revenue was down 1%. Global comps, down 4%. They saw particular weakness in China. That was down 11%. They noted that in this very competitive market that there are plenty of options there in the Chinese market. They don't have unlimited pricing power there. They do continue to open stores, so there is room to grow there and room to succeed, but they've run into a little bit of a buzzsaw there. You saw operating margin, down 140 basis points, earnings-per-share, down 7%, and I think really what got the market worked up, this guide down was significant. They were calling for earnings-per-share growth in that 15-20% range earlier. Now that's been whittled down to just flat to low single digits. That's a big deal, and so the market's reaction, I think, was absolutely right. Now the good news is, I think, a lot of this is very fixable. These are fixable problems. Much like Disney's got an Iger problem, Starbucks seems to still have a Schultz problem, and that is not going to be going away anytime soon."", ""Dylan Lewis: The results weren't particularly strong, and I don't think the picture is going to get that much better that quickly. Management did identify three different execution opportunities, they call them, for getting back on track, particularly in the United States."", 'Jason Moser: This is separate from the triple shot with two pumps win.', 'Dylan Lewis: This is a separate.', ""Jason Moser: Now, see, I'm already confused."", ""Dylan Lewis: Cringy. The first they identified was meeting demand across dayparts to drive future growth, so essentially meeting the demand of people who are coming into the store because it seems like, especially during some of their more peak hours, they're actually supply constrained with what they're able to give consumers."", ""Jason Moser: Yeah. If you are waking up in the morning, and Starbucks is a part of your routine, and it is for a lot of people, that is one of the peak traffic parts of the day for them, and then they noted in the call, people will go on there to the app, put an order together, and then see how long that order is going to take to fulfill, and they bag it, and they go somewhere else. That's just unacceptable, right? We've seen restaurants that have to deal with those throughput issues. The one that stands out is Chipotle. Do you remember back in the day, you knew if you went to Chipotle at lunchtime, you were waiting in the line starting outside, but it was almost like magic how quickly they got you through that line. Starbucks needs a little Chipotle right now, if they want to fix that throughput, and that to me, I think, is a key issue that needs to have 100% of their focus."", ""Ron Gross: This is a little Wall Street-y and not company-focused, but the reason that the stock got slammed so much is because the investment community was so taken by surprise about how weak the numbers were. I saw some comments from analysts who were, like, they were stunned and they've got to improve communication. They don't have to, but they should improve communications, so investors have a better understanding. I don't know how they missed it so bad. They could have pre-announced. They could have updated guidance. I'm happy to see that they brought guide down significantly for this quarter. At least it's better communication. Rip the Band-Aid off now, better than later."", ""Jason Moser: Maybe they can improve, right? Maybe that guide down is sandbagging. We won't know until we get there. You made a good point there, I think, in regard to the pre-announce. We've seen pre-announcements all the time, and whatever the reaction is, if they pre-announced this four weeks ago, probably the market has a very similar reaction. Wouldn't you say? Assuming they pre-announced four weeks ago, then there's some time there to digest, to get through it, put together some communication, and again how you're going to solve these problems. It does feel like a pre-announcement would've been apropos in this case."", ""Ron Gross: As you say, they would've taken the hit, maybe not as badly back then, but it's better to see a company being proactive and communicative than not, and so even if you're going to take the hit, be upfront. Let us know how the business is doing, the shareholders are the owners of the company, and just don't play it so close to the vest."", ""Dylan Lewis: Jason, after this decline, post-earnings shares are down around a level that has only really happened a couple of times over the last five years for this business. Generally, when they've fallen down to this level, they haven't stayed there very long. We've seen them rebound pretty quickly. When you see Starbucks at this point in time and the challenges that they currently face, are you interested, or are you sitting on the sidelines?"", ""Jason Moser: I'm getting interested. I'm a shareholder in Starbucks today, thankfully to much lower cost basis, so it's still working out OK. It's a retirement portfolio holding. I own it primarily for the dividend income, and so when they start to see this, I do start to get interested. Now the flip side to that, I think things are going to get worse before they get better. I am not convinced that Laxman is the man for the job, and this quarter really reinforced that. Again I think the drumbeat is going to continue to grow louder in regard to that. He said they didn't pre-announce because they were focused on putting together their game plan or an action plan. You can do both. You're getting paid an awful lot of money to do this job. It didn't seem like it's that difficult of a hurdle, but to me, I think patience probably works out well here. It does feel like it might get worse before it gets better because they are noting as most everyone else is the stretch consumer, right? They can't keep on raising prices to the moon, so they're going to run into a little bit of a wall there."", ""Dylan Lewis: We're going to stick with food and look at results from Domino's. Ron, going through all of this, I am not seeing all of the same stretched consumer elements quite showing up in the numbers for Domino's. It seems like they've been able to weather this environment a little bit better than Starbucks."", ""Ron Gross: They're mediocre pizza is reasonably priced, [laughs] and that appeals to quite a number of people, including my son from time to time who was born in New York and his dad is from New York, and we just deal with it."", ""Jason Moser: It's the throughput, and they get you this stuff quickly."", ""Ron Gross: Let's look at the stock up 30% this year, up 50% over the last year, and this report was pretty strong, thanks to promotions and marketing. That actually paid off. That doesn't always, but the spend paid off. They revamped their loyalty program. They're advertising on Uber Eats. Delivery and pickup orders, both increasing. We saw their network sales, though it's mostly a franchise business, but their total network sales, up 7%. Their revenue were up 6%. US same-store sales growth up 5.6%. Higher numbers of carry-out and delivery orders across all income groups. The income group part is interesting. They started to work with Uber Eats back in 2023, and it was because they wanted to reach wealthier households who are willing to pay a delivery fee and use a program like Uber Eats to improve sales in that channel. They are making nice headway. They expect Uber sales to reach 3% of total sales by the end of the year. That's an addition to the revamp loyalty program, 33 million-plus active members, more than 2 million of whom joined since the relaunch in September. Margins are up. Net income, up 20%. They're launching a New York style pizza, Dylan."", 'Dylan Lewis: Hey.', ""Ron Gross: I don't know, we'll see, but long-term clients, they're sticking to their long-term hungry for more plan, I think, which is pretty good, 31 times forward earnings, something like Chipotle at 54, something like McDonald's at 22."", ""Dylan Lewis: I will note, as someone who grew up in New Jersey, spent my time going into New York every now and then, I will occasionally get Domino's Pizza. It is not my favorite, Ron, but it exists in a class of its own. It is not pizza in the conventional sense. You just have to say, I'm having Domino's."", ""Ron Gross: I've been a recommender of this stock for a long time as we have been at the Fool from time to time, and they provide a product that people want."", ""Dylan Lewis: We'll stick with a product that people want, and maybe a different idea of burger. Looking at results from McDonald's, not so much fanfare with their earnings results, Jason. It seems there are though some similar threads showing up in McDonald's earnings and the commentary around it that we've been seeing with Domino's and with Starbucks."", ""Jason Moser: It was a fairly benign quarter but definitely fell in line with the theme that we're seeing more widely across the industry. The consumer getting stretched, making concessions, starting to focus a little bit more on value. The good news for McDonald's is that's the play. It's a value play. They are focused on value, which is something that Starbucks can't necessarily claim, and so even when it gets difficult for McDonald's, they still have that to fall back on. Like I said, a relatively benign quarter, global comps were up 2%, but they did grow operating income 8%, which is encouraging, and they saw earnings-per-share growth of 2%. Nothing to write home about, but it was the 13th consecutive quarter of positive comp sales growth, and they are continuing to focus on opening stores. McDonald's is everywhere, but this is amazing to think about. They're targeting 50,000 restaurants by the end of 2027 from just over 40,000 today. They still feel they've got a long [inaudible]"", 'Ron Gross: Where are they going?', ""Jason Moser: I know, and Ron, you'll have one in your garage. I think that's a fair question because Starbucks is doing the same thing. They're targeting opening up thousands of new stores as well, and you start going back to that Onion headline of A Starbucks Inside Of The Starbucks' Bathroom or something like that. You just saturate the market at some point, and you can't open stores forever, but they did just open their 6,000th store in China. They see that opportunity, still with plenty of runway there. I think when you look at it from a global perspective, and you look at this as a value proposition. They're, I guess you'd say, in the right place at the right time. It's not a stock that's going to double over the course of the next five years probably, but again, you probably own this one because of the income, because of the dividend, and it feels like they're doing a good job with the difficult conditions."", ""Dylan Lewis: Jason, you were talking about how McDonald's, being a value provider, plays very well right now with the market and with a pinched consumer. It's really interesting to me as we process results from all of the different restaurant fast-food, quick-serve, fast-casual brands because we had results from Chipotle that were absolutely stellar earlier in this earnings season. They are, I'd say, more in the upper middle-class as a standard customer, and then we see Starbucks in the middle getting waxed because they are both appealing to a value audience, appealing to not-so-much-of-a-value audience and seemingly having a harder time operating this environment."", ""Jason Moser: I think what Chipotle has done so well over the course of time is just basically remaining true to what they are. Along the way, they fiddled around with different concepts and maybe were going to try to open a pizza joint or burger joint, and they quickly realized that wasn't really a very good idea, but I will say that ShopHouse restaurant, I really wish they'd pursued that one, but they didn't. It does feel Chipotle has just remain true to what they do so well. When you look at Starbucks today versus the Starbucks that we knew 20 years ago, they're selling more cold beverages now, and that's different. It's not necessarily just coffee anymore. What comes with all of those cold beverages? A lot of different ingredients, a lot of management which breeds a lot of mismanagement, very difficult supply chain to manage there. We always make fun of them because they just have never nailed the food part right on Starbucks. I think that the juxtaposition there is interesting because you've got one business in Chipotle. They continue to do what they know how to do so well. It feels like Starbucks is a little bit aimless these days, and the market is making it pay the price for it."", ""Ron Gross: When I think of a company that does what they do so well, I think of a Chick-fil-A. Chick-fil-A knows what they're doing from a throughput, from a food perspective. I think, Cava, although it's in its infancy, could end up being like that as well, but you have to know who you are, and you have to know who your consumers are, and you have to deliver the quality product at the right price point. Not the easiest thing to do. Restaurants are notoriously tough things to run and tough things to invest in, but those that do it right, it really pays off."", ""Dylan Lewis: Coming up after the break, we've got stocks on our Radar. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money."", ""As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about, and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell anything based solely on what you hear. I'm Dylan Lewis, joined in the studio by Ron Gross and Jason Moser. This weekend is Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting up in Omaha, Nebraska. Gentlemen, as we tape here on Friday we're a day away from the Woodstock of Capitalism. Ron, what are you looking for this year in Berkshire's annual meeting?"", ""Ron Gross: It's the first one without Charlie Munger, so there's certainly going to be a lot of emotion in the room. It'll just be interesting to see how Mr. Buffett handles that, but I'm interested to hear, of course, about the health of the various businesses, what their plans are for stock buybacks. Shares are probably around two times tangible book value right now. It might be a little pricey for Warren, but if they're not going to find any huge acquisitions as they continue to struggle with, I'd like to see them continue to purchase stock back in a pretty meaningful way. It's always an interesting time to see what they're doing over there."", 'Dylan Lewis: Of course, be looking for the quotes. The quotes as well. Jason, what about you?', ""Jason Moser: I think with Berkshire, for me, especially with all of this dividend target, it comes back down to, at some point, are we going to see this company pay a dividend? It seems like now might be just an ideal time to do it. Buffett said here I think here recently that Berkshire is not set up to be some company that just presents these out-sized returns going forward, understandable. It's a big company, a lot of things going on. We know he likes dividends, Dylan. He loves it."", ""Dylan Lewis: He gobbles them up, and he doesn't want to pay them out."", ""Jason Moser: If we're looking at this new growth profile for Berkshire, at least according to his projections, I wonder if maybe now isn't a good time to consider a rewarding shareholders with a dividend policy because, obviously, he's not going to be there forever. You wonder if that's something where he wouldn't like to leave that as part of his legacy."", ""Dylan Lewis: Let's get over to stocks on our radar. Our man behind-the-glass, Dan Boyd, is going to hit you with a question. Ron, you're up first. What are you looking at this week?"", ""Ron Gross: I'm taking a look at Wingstop, W-I-N-G, a company I've never owned, but I have contributed to their sales quite a bit. Shares are up 75% over the last year, 450% over the last five years. We do like our wings. Obviously, they're a wing restaurant, 2300 restaurants systemwide. They're going to grow those well over 3,000. The numbers are very impressive: 34% increase in revenue, 66% in earnings per share. Hundred times forward earnings. I got to dig in a little bit more there. Their wings are good, but they're not that good."", ""Dylan Lewis: Wow, but I love that you're bringing it to us, Ron. Dan, a question about Wingstop."", ""Dan Boyd: Not really a question, more of a quick story. During the Super Bowl this year, I had to run out to the store to get something, and I drove past a Wingstop. I got to tell you, it is standing room only in there at halftime on the Super Bowl. When you'd think that people will be getting them delivered or already have eaten them, I've never had it, there's something going on over there."", ""Ron Gross: Digital sales, 68% of sales in Q1, so lots of people on their phones, but also a lot of people in the stores say I'm a wing snob ever since I got that trigger. I only like to make wings at home anymore."", ""Dylan Lewis: I will say, of the ones that you can go out and get, Wingstop is one of my favorites. A lot of the chains are doing very well. They do a pretty good job. Jason, what's on your radar this week?"", ""Jason Moser: Taking a look, a little bit of a closer look at CrowdStrike, ticker CRWD, I think several weeks back I had a call that Palo Alto Networks as a radar stock. When you look at cybersecurity, few market opportunities really offer the scale and the mission-critical nature that cybersecurity offers. It's an attractive market from that perspective, but it's a difficult one to understand. I am certainly no expert in the matter, and I've always felt maybe just investing in a cybersecurity ETF might be the better way to go, but it also feels maybe we get some winners in the space here, and CrowdStrike seems to be one. This Falcon platform that they have offers 27 modules for its customers to be able to use what they feel is necessary, and then they continue to add on modules. We've seen over time. Those customers that have been with them for longer periods of time, they do. They keep adding those modules all along the way. Twenty-nine thousand subscription customers worldwide. You've got a revenue that's grown about 65% over the last five years annually."", 'Dylan Lewis: Dan, a question about CrowdStrike.', ""Dan Boyd: Before we got on for this segment, I was, like, is it Cloudflare or CrowdStrike?

Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?"", ""Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Prologis (PLD) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage."", 'Prologis currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.52, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 22 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.52 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.', 'Of the 22 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 15 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 68.2% and 9.1% of all recommendations.', 'Brokerage Recommendation Trends for PLD', 'Check price target & stock forecast for Prologis here>>>The ABR suggests buying Prologis, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.', 'Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.', ""In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement."", ""Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision."", 'Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR', 'Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.', 'The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', 'Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.', 'On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.', 'Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.', ""Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements."", 'Is PLD Worth Investing In?', 'In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Prologis, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 1.3% over the past month to $5.44.', ""Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term."", ""The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Prologis.

Their analysts evaluate stocks, considering factors such as market trends, company fundamentals and economic indicators. Therefore today, we discuss JP Morgan price target cuts on three stocks that were issued following the recent earnings releases.', 'This analysis by JPMorgan suggests that these stocks may be overvalued and poised for a potential downward trajectory. Thus, if you own or are thinking of buying any of these shares, you may want to consider doing more due diligence. With that information, here are three JPMorgan price target cuts.', 'Source: Aleem Zahid Khan / Shutterstock.com', 'Wall Street’s love of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has put increased focus on Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), the first of our JPMorgan price target stocks. Since reporting earnings on Apr. 24, Meta shares have come under pressure and are now trading at multi-month lows. The light revenue forecast, increased spending, and concerns about profitability were among the factors that contributed to the plunge in Meta’s shares and average price target cuts by analysts.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Yet, this reaction overshadowed the company’s positive first-quarter 2024 results, which surpassed analyst expectations. Meta reported a 27% year-over-year (YOY) increase in revenue, reaching $36.46 billion. This increase marks the company’s fastest quarterly revenue growth rate since 2021.\xa0Net income also doubled YOY, rising to $12.37 billion or $4.71 per share.', 'However, investor sentiment focused on Meta’s conservative revenue forecast for the upcoming quarter. Management projected sales for the second quarter on average of $37.75 billion, falling short of analyst estimates of $38.3 billion. Additionally, concerns about Meta’s increased spending on non-profitable areas such as AI and mixed reality, contributed to the decline in shares.', 'Despite the recent sharp fall in shares, META stock has enjoyed a strong year-to-date rally of over 20%. Meanwhile Meta’s valuation appears stretched at over 32 times forward earnings and 8 times sales. Yet, Wall Street history shows us that that price declines in mega-caps like Meta Platforms do not typically last for long. Interested investors should do more diligence and keep an eye on the $400 level for potentially buying the dips in META shares.', 'Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com', 'We continue our discussion of companies about JP Morgan price target cuts with Prologis (NYSE:PLD), a real estate investment trust (“REIT”). Management focuses on strategically located logistic facilities, such as warehouses, near major transportation hubs like seaports, airports, and highways. This proximity allows businesses to efficiently receive, store, and distribute goods.', 'The REIT reported mixed financial results for the first quarter of 2024 in April. Net earnings per diluted share were 63 cents for the first quarter of 2024 compared with 50 cents for the first quarter of 2023. Core funds from operations (FFO) per diluted share was $1.28 for the quarter, compared with $1.22 for the same period in 2023.', 'Investors raised eyebrows as the logistics warehouse operator adjusted its 2024 guidance downward. This move reflects a potential moderation in the previously robust warehousing demand. Management acknowledged several factors contributing to this shift, including rising interest rates, a more cautious retail environment, and geopolitical uncertainties. Prologis also noted that these factors are prompting companies to adopt a more conservative approach to leasing decisions.', 'As a result, Prologis stock fell and is now hovering slightly above the 52-week low of $96.64 last seen on October 2023. Despite a 22% year-to-date decline, PLD stock still remains overvalued at around 45x forward earnings and 12x sales. While the shares yield an attractive 3.7% dividend, long-term investors may still want to wait before hitting the “buy” button on Prologis.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'The final pick among JPMorgan price target cuts is the fabless semiconductor business Silicon Laboratories (NASDAQ:SLAB). The company is known for silicon-based devices, software, and related intellectual property used in a wide range of electronic products. Silicon Laboratories focuses on mixed-signal and analog-intensive integrated circuits, catering primarily to the Internet of Things (IoT) market. SLAB provides wireless microcontrollers, sensors, and software development tools for connected devices used in smart homes, industrial automation, and other IoT applications.', 'The semiconductor company reported financial results for the first quarter of 2024 that fell short of expectations. Revenue declined 57% YOY to $106.4 million. Net loss came in at $56.5 million, a sharp reversal from a net profit of $14.0 million in the same period last year. This translated to a loss per share of $1.77, compared to earnings per share of 44 cents in the prior-year period.', 'Adding to investor concerns, management’s guidance for the second quarter was cautious. The company anticipates a diluted loss per share ranging from $1.45 to $1.61. This bleak outlook, coupled with the stock’s already stretched valuation with a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 6.1, prompted a price target cut by JPMorgan. SLAB shares have declined 7% YTD but increased volatility on Wall Street may lead to further downward pressure.', 'Tezcan Gecgil, PhD, began contributing to InvestorPlace in 2018.

That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$234, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. It is worth noting that this sale was only 23% of Stephen Squeri's holding."", 'In total, American Express insiders sold more than they bought over the last year.

I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. American Express insiders own about US$215m worth of shares (which is 0.1% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders."", ""Insiders sold American Express shares recently, but they didn't buy any.

These factors propel the demand for robust data storage solutions, bolstering computer storage product requirements. The same factors are favorable for prominent industry players like Super Micro Computer SMCI, NetApp NTAP and Pure Storage PSTG. The democratization of higher internal memory smartphones, faster Internet speed and 5G will likely act as a tailwind for industry participants. The rapid deployment of 5G networking is driving the proliferation of IoT, Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality (AR/VR) devices. However, cautious IT spending amid global macroeconomic turbulence is a significant headwind in the near term, along with volatile supply chain dynamics and inflation.', 'Industry Description', 'The Zacks Computer-Storage Devices industry houses companies that design, develop, manufacture and market various hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SSDs). These drives are utilized in PCs, laptops, mobiles, servers, network-attached storage (NAS) devices, video game consoles, digital video recorders and other consumer electronic devices. A few industry participants, including Pure Storage, provide software-defined all-flash solutions that are uniquely fast and cloud-capable for customers. Many industry players offer high-performance modular memory subsystems, mount and blade server systems, enterprise storage and data management software and hardware products and services. Some industry participants also provide purpose-built servers for storing and accessing data over a shared network or the Internet.', ""4 Trends Shaping the Computer-Storage Industry's Future"", 'New Normal Trends & Rapid Implementation of 5G Opening New Business Avenues: The accelerated deployment of 5G and rebound in the smartphone market will likely propel the industry to newer heights. Extensive implementation of cloud computing solutions, increased Internet usage and rapidly growing media and regulatory compliance have led to a data explosion for enterprises. The implementation of hybrid work models has triggered the demand for data-intensive applications like video conferencing and cloud services. Adequate storage is essential for harnessing data and is expected to raise demand for high-storage capable SSDs and internal memory in advanced smartphones.', 'Innovation in Cloud Storage Technologies to Drive Adoption: Broader storage options from collocated hardware (such as hard disks and tape drives) to many cloud storage solutions have put the industry on a growth trajectory. The industry players are well poised for growth owing to a rapid increase in data, the complexity of data formats and the need to scale resources at regular intervals. These companies rely on Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps) and machine learning (ML) to manage and optimize storage solutions. To streamline data storage, companies are relying on virtualization technologies. As more data is added from IoT, companies are turning to edge computing architecture to reduce latency and boost flexibility. Kubernetes storage is becoming increasingly popular as it facilitates greater agility and scalability. This has bolstered the deployment of high-capacity mass storage products, a positive for industry players.', 'Increases in IT Spending Bodes Well, Macro Conditions Concerning: Per a report from Gartner, worldwide IT spending is now projected to reach $5.06 trillion in 2024, calling for an increase of 8% from 2023 levels. This is an improvement over the earlier projection of 6.8%. The report also highlighted that spending on IT services is set to become the biggest market, with revenue growth of 9.7% in 2024. Spending on data center systems is expected to increase owing to the focus on planning for generative AI. The data center systems market is set to witness an increase of 10% in 2024 compared with 4% in 2023. Gartner stated that AI servers will comprise nearly 60% of hyperscalers’ total server spending in 2024. The devices segment is expected to bounce back in 2024. The integration of GenAI capabilities in premium and basic phones will fuel growth for this particular market, added the report.', 'However, uncertain global macroeconomic conditions and supply chain dynamics are a persistent concern. Uncertainty in the macro backdrop and inflationary pressure could affect spending across small- and medium-sized businesses globally. The uncertainty in business visibility could dent the industry’s performance in the near term.', 'Momentum in PC Shipments Might Boost Growth Prospects: Worldwide PC shipments are anticipated to increase 3.5% year over year to 250.4 million units in 2024, according to data compiled by Gartner. Gartner expects on-device AI to boost the marketing of PCs throughout the current year and help sustain current anticipated replacement cycles amid geopolitical and economic uncertainties. PC shipments inched up 1.5% in the first quarter, per a report from IDC.', 'Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright Prospects', 'The Zacks Computer Storage is housed within the broader Zacks Computer And Technology Sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #13, which places it in the top 5% of more than 251 Zacks industries.', 'The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.', 'The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a downbeat earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

POST is turning back to the clock by creating a reincarnation of Ralston-Purina, the conglomerate Bill Stiritz ran many years ago with great success. Like Stiritz’s Ralston, POST has been a consistent purchaser of its own shares, demonstrates improved efficiency within its own businesses, and occasionally makes disciplined acquisitions to bolster existing franchises or add new platforms. Additionally, POST is not an empire builder, as it has sold its private label food business to a private equity firm, and spun off BellRing Brands in recent years. With the spinoff of WL Kellogg in recent days, and due to Kellogg’s lower margins, I would be surprised if POST does not try to acquire some portion of WL Kellogg, although it would likely need to divest some cereal assets to avoid regulatory scrutiny.

Good evening all, and thank you for joining us on the call today, continuing our strong momentum from 2023, we've kicked off '24 with another quarter of excellent performance across the board. Vertex continued to reach more CF patients, delivering $2.7 billion in revenue in Q1, representing 13% growth versus the prior year period. We also began our journey of revenue diversification with the launch of CASGEVY in both sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia in multiple regions. In our late stage pipeline, we continue to drive programs into Phase III and towards regulatory approval, creating multiple opportunities for both revenue growth and diversification, including: one, completing our regulatory submissions for the vanzacaftor triple in patients with cystic fibrosis 6 years and older in both the U.S. and the EU, initiating the rolling NDA submission for VX-548 or suzetrigine in moderate-to-severe acute pain; three, advancing inaxaplin into the Phase III portion of its pivotal trial in APOL1-mediated kidney disease and expanding the eligible patient population down to age 10."", 'And four, following the successful completion of the end of Phase II regulatory meeting with the FDA, we are on track to initiate the Phase III trial of suzetrigine in painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy in the second half of this year, and milestones in our early and mid-stage pipeline matched this pace of progress as we resumed the VX-880 trial in type 1 diabetes, initiated clinical development of VX-407 in polycystic kidney disease, and three, achieve regulatory clearances in multiple regions, including the U.S., and initiated the Phase I/II clinical trial of VX-670 in patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1. And of course, we are very excited to expand the Vertex portfolio and team with our definitive agreement to acquire Alpine Immune Sciences announced on April 10.', ""Alpine's lead asset, povetacicept or pove, is a potential best-in-class Phase III-ready molecule for IgA nephropathy or IgAN, a disease with high unmet need. Pove is also a molecule that holds a pipeline in a product potential in a number of other serious autoimmune renal diseases and cytopenias in Phase II development. We see the acquisition as just the right fit with just the right assets at just the right phase of development, where Vertex's capabilities can accelerate pove's development in IgAN and other indications. And lastly, Alpine will add protein engineering and immunotherapy expertise to Vertex' capabilities with particular relevance for our development programs in gentler conditioning for CASGEVY and immune evasion for type 1 diabetes cell therapies."", ""We are excited to begin working with the Alpine team and together advanced pove into Phase III in IgAN later this year. With that overview, let me now turn to a more detailed pipeline review. This quarter, I'll limit my comments to the programs with the most significant recent updates, cystic fibrosis, pain, type 1 diabetes and the pending Alpine acquisition. Starting with CF. We are very pleased with the Phase III results of the vanza triple we announced in early February as we continue to advance towards our ultimate goal of bringing all eligible patients to carrier levels of sweat chloride. Results from the vanza pivotal program met our high expectations, and we're an important milestone in our progress towards this aspiration. Results from the 2 randomized studies in patients 12 and above demonstrated vanza was non-inferior to TRIKAFTA on lung function and superior to TRIKAFTA on sweat chloride including, as measured by the proportion of patients achieving sweat chloride levels below the diagnostic threshold of 60 millimoles per liter and below the carrier level or normal levels of sweat chloride of less than 30 millimoles per liter."", ""Included in the pivotal program was the RIDGELINE study in patients 6 to 11 years of age to underscore the potential impact of vanzacaftor consider 95% of patients age 6 to 11 in this study achieved sweat chloride levels below the level of diagnosis for cystic fibrosis, and more than half reached sweat chloride levels considered to be in the normal or carrier level range of sweat chloride. We believe these results indicate that Vanda could set a new standard in the treatment of CF. To round out the profile of the vanzacaftor triple, it's important to note that the therapy also offers the convenience of once-daily dosing and a substantially lower royalty burden. With these results in hand, we've been working rapidly to compile the regulatory marketing applications, and I am pleased to share that we have completed submissions in the U.S. and EU for patients ages 6 years and older ahead of our midyear goal."", ""In the U.S., we use one of our priority review vouchers, which if the filing is accepted, provides an expedited 6-month review versus the standard 10-month review time line. We're also on track to complete submission in the U.K., Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Switzerland by midyear. I'll close on CF with VX-522, our CFTR mRNA therapy in development with our partners at Moderna for the treatment of the more than 5,000 people with CF, who do not make any CFTR protein and therefore, cannot benefit from CFTR modulators. We continue to enroll portion of the study and expect data late in 2024 or early 2025. Moving to the pain program, and seceptrogene, our novel, highly selective NaV1.8 pain signal inhibitor. Suzetrigine offers a compelling combination of both strong safety and strong efficacy with the potential to treat moderate to severe pain across multiple settings of care."", ""In acute pain, suzetrigine has secured fast track and breakthrough therapy designations, and we were very pleased that the FDA granted us a rolling NDA submission. I'm also pleased to share that multiple modules have already been submitted and we are on track to complete the submission this quarter. Consistent with our serial innovation strategy, the next asset in our Acute Pain pipeline is VX-993. We recently received IND clearance for the intravenous formulation of VX-993 and have already started the Phase I trial. We're also planning a VX-993 oral formulation Phase II study in acute pain, which we expect to initiate later this year. Beyond suzetrigine and VX-993, we continue to innovate in the NAV 1.8 space and are also making strong progress preclinically with our NAV1.7 Pain Signal inhibition program, that may be used alone or in combination with suzetrigine or other NAV1.8 inhibitors."", 'In peripheral neuropathic pain or PMP, we are very pleased with the outcomes from the recently completed end of Phase II meeting with the FDA and and are excited to begin the pivotal program for suzetrigine in painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy, or DPN, in the second half of this year. The program will consist of 2 randomized sister studies of approximately 1,000 patients each with 3 arms in each study. Suzetrigine 70-milligram arm once daily, a placebo arm and a pregabalin or Lyrica arm. The efficacy endpoints are based on the change from baseline to week 12. The primary endpoint is the comparison of suzetrigine versus placebo in the weekly average of the daily pain intensity score or NPRS. The first key secondary endpoint will test for non-inferiority of suzetrigine to pregabalin on the same NPRS pain score, and if successful, we will test for superiority.', ""And finally, the second key secondary is quality of life measures versus placebo. In order to evaluate the long-term safety and effectiveness of suzetrigine, a subset of patients completing the 12-week study will have the opportunity to roll into a 52-week open-label extension study. Our goal continues to be a broad peripheral neuropathic pain label. And in support of this goal, we're also studying suzetrigine in lumbosacral radiculopathy or LSR, a PNP condition for which there are no specifically indicated or approved treatments. LSR accounts for approximately 40% of all PNP patients and together with DPN make up more than 60% of the PNP segment. We are continuing to enroll and dose our Phase II study of suzetrigine in LSR, and I'm pleased to share that the study is on track to complete enrollment by the end of this year."", ""Just as we transform the treatment of CF, we believe we have the potential to transform the treatment of pain, both acute and neuropathic and look forward to helping address the unmet need of the tens of millions of Americans suffering with these conditions. Turning now to type 1 diabetes. VX-880 is a stem cell-derived, fully differentiated iLet cell therapy for patients with T1D and impaired hypoglycemic awareness who suffered from severe hypoglycemic events. I'm pleased to share that after data review by the independent data monitoring committee, the VX-880 study has resumed Parts A, B and C of the global 17 patient study are fully enrolled, and we expect to complete dosing soon. We look forward to sharing updated data this June at the American Diabetes Association Annual Meeting."", ""VX-264, the next asset in our T1D program is our self plus device program. using the same VX-880 cells, which have already demonstrated efficacy VX-264 is designed to eliminate the need for immunosuppression by shielding the cells from the immune system in the proprietary device. This Phase I/II study has completed Part A and Part B is underway. Lastly, our Hyperimmune program, which aims to evade the immune system by introducing certain edits into the same VX-880 cells is yet another approach to avoiding the use of immunosuppressive. This program continues to advance in preclinical development. I'll conclude with a few comments on povetacicept, the lead asset from our pending acquisition of Alpine Immune Sciences. We are excited about the potential of povetacicept across multiple dimensions, including preclinically with its high affinity and potency against both APRIL and BAFF pathways in preclinical assays and as well as high efficacy in cell and animal models of B cell-driven diseases, clinically with patient data in IgAN through Phase II that look potentially best-in-class in proteinuria in hematuria, GFR and clinical remission, better drug-like properties with direct patient benefit, including once every 4-week dosing, subcutaneously with low injection volume, a good safety and tolerability profile, the broadest development plan in the field and a robust IP portfolio."", ""Important upcoming pove milestones in the second half of this year include initiation of the Phase III study in IgAN, and readouts from the ongoing RUBY03 and RUBY-4 basket studies in autoimmune renal diseases and cytopenias, respectively. With that, I'll turn it over to Stuart for a commercial overview."", ""Stuart Arbuckle: Thanks, Reshma. I'll first discuss CF. And then as we're entering a new era of commercial diversification provides some highlights of the ongoing CASGEVI launch and the outlook for suzetrigine in acute pain. As Reshma noted, we once again delivered strong results in CF as we continue to grow the number of eligible patients receiving our CFTR modulators. First quarter year-over-year U.S. growth was driven by continued strong performance of TRIKAFTA, including in patients ages 2 to 5 years old following the approval in this patient population in April of last year. Outside the U.S., we also saw growth this quarter, driven by the rollout of KAFTRIO in the EU in patients ages 2 to 5, following approval in this age group in November 2023, and we will continue to drive access and uptake in more EU countries over the course of the year."", 'Our outlook in CF is bright in the short, medium and long term. We will drive growth in the near term by reaching more eligible patients, including younger age groups and additional geographies. For example, we recently received EU approval of KALYDECO in patients between the ages of 1 month up to 4 months old. We also expect regulatory approvals for additional rare genotypes for KAFTRIO in the EU and TRIKAFTA in the U.S. and Canada later this year. And Brazil is a good example of a new geography. Up to now, some patients in Brazil have been able to benefit from our CFTR modulators through named patient sales. We recently secured government reimbursement for TRIKAFTA in ages 6 and are in the process of launching TRIKAFTA for all eligible patients there.', 'We will then look to drive further CF growth over the medium term with the vanzacafta triple combination launch, as many existing TRIKAFTA patients may seek to achieve even greater levels of CFTR function with the added convenience of once-daily dosing. And there are also more than 6,000 patients who have discontinued one of our current CFTR modulators, who may be interested in a new treatment option. Furthermore, there are some additional rare mutations, not previously respond to our other CFTR modulators that are responsive to the vanzacafta triple. Our launch preparations are well underway, including pre-approval information exchange with payers, and we are both encouraged by our interactions to date and excited by the opportunity to launch our fifth medicine in CF.', 'Longer term, we expect continued growth in CF from our mRNA program, VX-522 for the more than 5,000 people with CF, who do not respond to CFTR modulators. Now turning to CASGEVY and our launches in sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. We are making strong progress with ATC activation, physician and patient engagement and payer conversations. Enthusiasm from stakeholders is high in all regions, and our teams are working to translate this historic scientific achievement into meaningful patient benefit in the real world. Let me provide some insights on the launch with 2 key metrics we are sharing externally as important markers of our early launch progress, the number of activated authorized treatment centers or ATCs, and patient cell collections.', 'Recall that Vertex will recognize revenue for CASGEVY near the end of the patient journey at infusion. Starting with ATC activation. You may recall, we are prioritizing approximately 75 ATCs globally and already had 9 ATCs activated at launch, even ahead of knowing the final label or pricing for CASGEVY. We are pleased with our progress as we now have more than 25 activated centers including centers in all regions where CASGEVY is approved. Even more important than the number of ATCs activated is patient initiations and cell collections. Many patients have begun the treatment journey, and as of mid-April, 5 patients already had cells collected. This is excellent progress given the short time frame since approval and the complexity and length of the patient journey.', 'These sales collections have occurred across all regions where CASGEVY is approved, the U.S., Europe and the Middle East. We also continue to make great progress with payers, who recognize the transformative clinical benefits of CASGEVY and are moving quickly to provide rapid and equitable access. In the U.S. commercial market, we have contracts and/or published policies in place for over 200 million lives or nearly 65% of total lives. In the government Medicaid sector, we have policies in place or active contract negotiations ongoing with 18 states. And in the meantime, all states have confirmed their intent to provide case-by-case coverage. Outside the U.S., we are also making progress with reimbursement and access, either through formal reimbursement agreements or early access programs.', ""In Europe, we see strong traction in France with a reimbursed early access program in TDT. We're particularly pleased with our progress in the Middle East, which is a new region for Vertex and especially important for CASGEVY given the high prevalence of sickle cell disease and the government's clear focus on elevating the health of their citizens. Since receiving regulatory approvals from KSA and Bahrain, we have worked with local health care authorities and refined our epidemiology estimates for the region. Our work indicates that the eligible 12-plus sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia population in KSA and Bahrain that we could serve is in excess of 23,000 patients, a potentially larger opportunity than even the U.S. These regions have the infrastructure to administer medicines like CASGEVY given the prevalence of the diseases and relatively high volume of allogeneic stem cell transplants performed annually."", ""And importantly, we have already secured reimbursement agreements in KSA and Bahrain, allowing certain eligible patients to access CASGEVY for both sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent thalassemia. In addition to having activated ATCs and collected cells from our first patients in the Middle East, we continue to work with local health care professionals to increase the number of ATCs and expand patient access in the region. Shifting now to suzetrigine. We believe this highly selective NaV1.8 pain signal inhibitor has the potential to provide a transformative treatment option for the millions of patients suffering from acute and peripheral neuropathic pain. This quarter, I'm going to limit my commercial comments to the opportunity in acute pain."", 'Throughout its clinical trials to date, suzetrigine has shown a compelling combination of efficacy and safety with strong potential to be used across a range of moderate to severe acute pain conditions, both surgical and nonsurgical and across a range of settings. This profile will ideally address the clear unmet need among both patients and physicians, effective pain relief with a favorable safety and tolerability profile. On prior investor webcast, we provided details on this opportunity, including the magnitude, approximately 80 million patients are prescribed a medicine for moderate-to-severe acute pain each year in the U.S. and the high concentration with approximately 2/3 of patients being treated in the institutional setting. There is further concentration within that setting in approximately 2,000 institutions that roll up to around 150 IDNs. Accordingly, they can be served with a specialty commercial infrastructure.', ""We have also detailed the mix of settings for their over 1 billion calendar days of acute pain treatment, 15% are prescribed and dispensed in an institutional setting. 35% are prescribed discharge and 50% are prescribed in physicians' offices. This quarter, I'll provide you with some insights on our go-to-market strategy and an update on the legislative and payer landscape. We are focused on the institutional setting, given these approximately 2,000 institutions account for 50% of acute pain prescriptions. Extensive market research has also helped us identify an initial set of specific acute pain conditions and procedure types with high clinical fit, such as high-volume surgical procedures, pain conditions that typically require prescription pay medicines at discharge or where we can seek to replace or significantly reduce opioid utilization."", 'And the related physician specialties that are likely to adopt and champion suzetrigine. The key health care professionals we will be targeting include orthopedic, general and plastic surgeons, emergency department physicians anesthesiologists and pain medicine specialists. Given the dynamics for new medicines to be approved for use in institutions, we expect the earliest uptake of suzetrigine will occur at discharge. Recall, this discharge segment represents roughly 35% of the approximately 1.1 billion calendar days of acute pain treatment in the U.S. each year. The average prescription length in this setting is approximately 2 weeks. Treatment in this setting commonly includes opioids where prescription length is shorter 4 to 5 days due to side effect profile, addiction concerns and prescribing limits at the state and IDN and hospital level.', ""We are already engaging with key decision-makers across the formulary and access landscape, including pharmacists, PBMs, payers, IDNs and GPOs. We expect these stakeholders to make formulary and coverage decisions throughout the first year of the launch and thus plan to engage in contracting discussions in the second half of this year, ahead of launch to support the potential for accelerated formulary adoption. We've also made great progress in the build-out of our commercial team. Our field leadership team are now on board and fully trained and have engaged in the hiring of the field force until after the Phase III data we are now finalizing the hiring of 150 new customer-facing colleagues. Finally, we know the significance of policy in the world of pain treatment with important legislation like the No Pain Act already on track for implementation in 2025 and bills like the alternatives to Pain Act recently introduced."", ""Our long-standing efforts continue to help shape state and federal policy initiatives to: one, encourage consideration and use of non-opioid alternatives; and two, remove financial barriers to choosing a branded non-opioid. Overall, we plan for a high science, digitally enabled commercialization approach with a strong focus on population health decision makers. In addition, both patient advocacy and public policy efforts complement and supplement our commercial activities. In conclusion, it's an exciting time to be at Vertex. We continue to treat more CF patients around the world and are well advanced in planning for the launch of the vanzacafta triple combination. We are entering a new era of commercial diversification with the launch of CASGEVY in the U.S., Europe and the Middle East."", ""And our launch preparations for suzetrigine in acute pain are well underway as we seek to fundamentally redefine the treatment of pain and drive further diversified revenue growth. I'll now turn the call over to Charlie to review the financials."", ""Charles Wagner: Thanks, Stuart. Vertex's excellent start to the year demonstrates once again our consistent strong performance and attractive growth profile. First quarter 2024 revenue increased 13% year-over-year to $2.7 billion with solid growth of 8% in the U.S. and 21% outside the U.S. The drivers of this strong start were in line with our expectations with some outperformance due to channel inventory phasing in select international markets. First quarter U.S. growth was driven by continued strong performance of TRIKAFTA, including in patients ages 2 to 5 following the approval in this patient population in April of last year partially offset by the typical pattern of seasonally higher gross to net in the first quarter. Outside the U.S., growth was also driven by KAFTRIO '25 launch and a benefit from channel inventory phasing is expected to reverse in subsequent quarters, similar to the dynamics we saw in the first half of 2023."", ""We First quarter 2024 combined non-GAAP R&D acquired IP R&D and SG&A expenses were $1 billion compared to $1.2 billion in the first quarter of 2023. Included in Q1 '24 results, our $77 million of acquired IP R&D charges compared to $347 million of such charges in the first quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP R&D expenses in Q1 '24 were relatively flat year-over-year and reflect growing investment in the advancement of our broad earlier-stage R&D portfolio offset by reduced costs from the recent successful completion of multiple late-stage clinical trials for CASGEVY, vanzacaftor and suzetrigine as well as the associated transition of certain costs from R&D to COGS and inventory. The increase in non-GAAP SG&A costs versus Q1 '23 includes investment in the commercial organization and launch activities for CASGEVY and acute pain."", ""We anticipate the quarterly non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses will increase over the remainder of 2024 as we advance inaxaplin into Phase III development in AKD initiate the suzetrigine Phase III program in painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy and continue to invest in preparation for upcoming potential new commercial launches, including the further build-out of our suzetrigine team. First quarter 2024 non-GAAP operating income was $1.3 billion, a 48% increase compared to $902 million in non-GAAP operating income in the first quarter of 2023. We First quarter 2024 non-GAAP effective tax rate of 17.4% compares to 21.3% in Q1 '23 and includes a benefit from a discrete adjustment to Vertex's income tax reserves. First quarter 2024 non-GAAP earnings per share were $4.76 and including benefits from revenue and expense phasing as well as a lower tax rate compared to $3.05 in the first quarter of 2023."", ""We ended the quarter with $14.6 billion in cash and investments. We will use a portion of this cash on hand to fund the $4.9 billion acquisition of Alpine Immune Sciences, which is expected to close this quarter, subject to certain customary conditions. Alpine is a prime example of our priority for capital deployment, to invest in innovation, including external innovation via business development. We see multibillion-dollar potential for Phase III-ready povetacicept given the transformative and best-in-class potential in IgAN, a disease area with high unmet need. We also look forward to exploring pove's full potential in other serious diseases. Additionally, we deployed over $140 million of cash in the first quarter to repurchase 336,000 shares."", 'Now switching to guidance. There is no change to our 2024 total product revenue guidance range of $10.55 billion to $10.75 billion, representing revenue growth of 8% at the midpoint at current exchange rates. We have high visibility into this revenue outlook. We expect continued growth in CF as we continue to reach more patients, including younger ones, in core markets and select other countries as well as contribution in the second half of the year from the commercial launch of CASGEVY in approved indications and geographies. For total Vertex operating expenses, we continue to project $4.3 billion to $4.4 billion in full year 2024 combined non-GAAP SG&A, R&D and acquired IP R&D. This operating expense range continues to include approximately $125 million in currently anticipated IP R&D charges.', ""Upon the close of the Alpine acquisition, we expect Alpine's projected non-GAAP operating expenses for the remainder of 2024 to be absorbed within this guidance range but note the potential impacts of transaction accounting, including any potential acquired IPR&D charges will be determined at the time of closing. There's also no change to our full year 2024 non-GAAP effective tax rate guidance range of 20% to 21%. In closing, Vertex posted excellent results yet again to start off the year as we delivered strong revenue growth, regulatory approvals and commercial launches. We also strengthened our capabilities in preparation for additional near-term launches, progressed our mid- and earlier-stage pipeline and entered the clinic in our 10th disease area of ADPKD."", ""Importantly, we also announced the anticipated acquisition of Alpine Immune Sciences, a compelling fit with Vertex's strategy. Post close, we aim to leverage Vertex's clinical, regulatory and commercial capabilities to accelerate development and commercialization of pove. We are targeting approval in IgAN in 2027 and and contribution to Vertex's revenue growth and diversification beginning in 2028, leveraging a specialty market approach with attractive margins. As we move through 2024, we anticipate further important milestones as detailed on Slide 18 to mark our continued progress in multiple disease areas. Please note that this pipeline slide will not reflect programs from Alpine Immune Sciences until post transaction close.

Good evening all, and thank you for joining us on the call today. Continuing our strong momentum from 2023, we've kicked off '24 with another quarter of excellent performance across the board.Vertex continued to reach more CF patients, delivering $2.7 billion in revenue in Q1, representing 13% growth versus the prior year period. We also began our journey of revenue diversification with the launch of CASGEVY in both sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia in multiple regions.In our late stage pipeline, we continue to drive programs into Phase III and towards regulatory approval, creating multiple opportunities for both revenue growth and diversification, including: one, completing our regulatory submissions for the vanzacaftor triple in patients with cystic fibrosis 6 years and older in both the U.S. and the EU; initiating the rolling NDA submission for VX-548 or suzetrigine in moderate-to-severe acute pain; three, advancing inaxaplin into the Phase III portion of its pivotal trial in APOL1-mediated kidney disease and expanding the eligible patient population down to age 10; and four, following the successful completion of the end of Phase II regulatory meeting with the FDA, we are on track to initiate the Phase III trials of suzetrigine in painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy in the second half of this year.And milestones in our early and mid-stage pipeline matched this pace of progress as we resumed the VX-880 trial in type 1 diabetes; initiated clinical development of VX-407 in polycystic kidney disease; and three, achieve regulatory clearances in multiple regions, including the U.S., and initiated the Phase I/II clinical trial of VX-670 in patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1.And of course, we are very excited to expand the Vertex portfolio and team with our definitive agreement to acquire Alpine Immune Sciences announced on April 10. Alpine's lead asset, povetacicept or pove, is a potential best-in-class Phase III-ready molecule for IgA nephropathy or IgAN, a disease with high unmet need. Pove is also a molecule that holds a pipeline in a product potential in a number of other serious autoimmune renal diseases and cytopenias in Phase II development.We see the acquisition as just the right fit with just the right assets at just the right phase of development, where Vertex' capabilities can accelerate pove's development in IgAN and other indications. And lastly, Alpine will add protein engineering and immunotherapy expertise to Vertex' capabilities, with particular relevance for our development programs in gentler conditioning for CASGEVY and immune evasion for type 1 diabetes cell therapies. We are excited to begin working with the Alpine team and together, advance pove into Phase III in IgAN later this year.With that overview, let me now turn to a more detailed pipeline review. This quarter, I'll limit my comments to the programs with the most significant recent updates: cystic fibrosis, pain, type 1 diabetes and the pending Alpine acquisition. Starting with CF. We are very pleased with the Phase III results of the vanza triple we announced in early February as we continue to advance towards our ultimate goal of bringing all eligible patients to carrier levels of sweat chloride.Results from the vanza pivotal program met our high expectations, and were an important milestone in our progress towards this aspiration. Results from the 2 randomized studies in patients 12 and above demonstrated vanza was non-inferior to TRIKAFTA on lung function and superior to TRIKAFTA on sweat chloride, including as measured by the proportion of patients achieving sweat chloride levels below the diagnostic threshold of 60 millimoles per liter and below the carrier level or normal levels of sweat chloride of less than 30 millimoles per liter.Included in the pivotal program was the RIDGELINE study in patients 6 to 11 years of age. To underscore the potential impact of vanzacaftor, consider 95% of patients age 6 to 11 in this study achieved sweat chloride levels below the level of diagnosis for cystic fibrosis, and more than half reached sweat chloride levels considered to be in the normal or carrier level range of sweat chloride. We believe these results indicate that vanza could set a new standard in the treatment of CF.To round out the profile of the vanzacaftor triple, it's important to note that the therapy also offers the convenience of once-daily dosing and a substantially lower royalty burden. With these results in hand, we've been working rapidly to compile the regulatory marketing applications, and I am pleased to share that we have completed submissions in the U.S. and EU for patients ages 6 years and older ahead of our midyear goal.In the U.S., we use one of our priority review vouchers, which, if the filing is accepted, provides an expedited 6-month review versus the standard 10-month review time line. We're also on track to complete submission in the U.K., Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Switzerland by midyear.I'll close on CF with VX-522, our CFTR mRNA therapy in development with our partners at Moderna for the treatment of the more than 5,000 people with CF who do not make any CFTR protein, and therefore cannot benefit from CFTR modulators. We continue to enroll in the multiple ascending dose portion of the study and expect data late in 2024 or early 2025.Moving to the pain program and suzetrigine, our novel, highly selective NaV1.8 pain signal inhibitor. Suzetrigine offers the compelling combination of both strong safety and strong efficacy with the potential to treat moderate to severe pain across multiple settings of care. In acute pain, suzetrigine has secured Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designations, and we were very pleased that the FDA granted us a rolling NDA submission. I'm also pleased to share that multiple modules have already been submitted and we are on track to complete the submission this quarter.Consistent with our serial innovation strategy, the next asset in our acute pain pipeline is VX-993. We recently received IND clearance for the intravenous formulation of VX-993 and have already started the Phase I trial. We're also planning a VX-993 oral formulation Phase II study in acute pain, which we expect to initiate later this year. Beyond suzetrigine and VX-993, we continue to innovate in the NaV1.8 space and are also making strong progress preclinically with our NaV1.7 pain signal inhibition program that may be used alone or in combination with suzetrigine or other NaV1.8 inhibitors.In peripheral neuropathic pain or PNP, we are very pleased with the outcomes from the recently completed end of Phase II meeting with the FDA and are excited to begin the pivotal program for suzetrigine in painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy or DPN in the second half of this year. The program will consist of 2 randomized sister studies of approximately 1,000 patients each, with 3 arms in each study: a suzetrigine 70-milligram arm once daily, a placebo arm and a pregabalin or Lyrica arm.The efficacy endpoints are based on the change from baseline to week 12. The primary endpoint is the comparison of suzetrigine versus placebo in the weekly average of the daily pain intensity score or NPRS. The first key secondary endpoint will test for non-inferiority of suzetrigine to pregabalin on the same NPRS pain score, and if successful, we will test for superiority.And finally, the second key secondary is quality of life measures versus placebo. In order to evaluate the long-term safety and effectiveness of suzetrigine, a subset of patients completing the 12-week study will have the opportunity to roll into a 52-week open-label extension study. Our goal continues to be a broad peripheral neuropathic pain label.And in support of this goal, we're also studying suzetrigine in lumbosacral radiculopathy or LSR, a PNP condition for which there are no specifically indicated or approved treatments. LSR accounts for approximately 40% of all PNP patients, and together with DPN, make up more than 60% of the PNP segment. We are continuing to enroll and dose our Phase II study of suzetrigine in LSR, and I'm pleased to share that the study is on track to complete enrollment by the end of this year.Just as we've transformed the treatment of CF, we believe we have the potential to transform the treatment of pain, both acute and neuropathic, and look forward to helping address the unmet need of the tens of millions of Americans suffering with these conditions.Turning now to type 1 diabetes. VX-880 is our stem cell-derived, fully differentiated islet cell therapy for patients with T1D and impaired hypoglycemic awareness who suffer from severe hypoglycemic events. I'm pleased to share that after data review by the independent data monitoring committee, the VX-880 study has resumed. Parts A, B and C of the global 17 patient study are fully enrolled, and we expect to complete dosing soon. We look forward to sharing updated data this June at the American Diabetes Association annual meeting.VX-264, the next asset in our T1D program, is our cells plus device program. Using the same VX-880 cells, which have already demonstrated efficacy, VX-264 is designed to eliminate the need for immunosuppression by shielding the cells from the immune system in the proprietary device. This Phase I/II study has completed Part A and Part B is underway. Lastly, our hypoimmune program, which aims to evade the immune system by introducing certain edits into the same VX-880 cells, is yet another approach to avoiding the use of immunosuppresses. This program continues to advance in preclinical development.I'll conclude with a few comments on povetacicept, the lead asset from our pending acquisition of Alpine Immune Sciences. We are excited about the potential of povetacicept across multiple dimensions, including preclinically, with its high affinity and potency against both APRIL and BAFF pathways in preclinical assays as well as high efficacy in cell and animal models of B cell-driven diseases; clinically, with patient data in IgAN through Phase II that look potentially best-in-class; in proteinuria; in hematuria; GFR; and clinical remission; better drug-like properties with direct patient benefit, including once every 4-week dosing, subcutaneously, with low injection volume; a good safety and tolerability profile; the broadest development plan in the field; and a robust IP portfolio.Important upcoming pove milestones in the second half of this year include initiation of the Phase III study in IgAN, and readouts from the ongoing RUBY-3 and RUBY-4 basket studies in autoimmune renal diseases and cytopenias, respectively.With that, I'll turn it over to Stuart for a commercial overview."", 'Stuart A. Arbuckle', ""Thanks, Reshma. I'll first discuss CF, and then as we're entering a new era of commercial diversification, provide some highlights of the ongoing CASGEVY launch and the outlook for suzetrigine in acute pain. As Reshma noted, we once again delivered strong results in CF as we continue to grow the number of eligible patients receiving our CFTR modulators.First quarter year-over-year U.S. growth was driven by continued strong performance of TRIKAFTA, including in patients ages 2 to 5 years old following the approval in this patient population in April of last year. Outside the U.S., we also saw growth this quarter, driven by the rollout of KAFTRIO in the EU in patients ages 2 to 5 following approval in this age group in November 2023, and we will continue to drive access and uptake in more EU countries over the course of the year.Our outlook in CF is bright in the short, medium and long term. We will drive growth in the near term by reaching more eligible patients, including younger age groups and additional geographies. For example, we recently received EU approval of KALYDECO in patients between the ages of 1 month up to 4 months old. We also expect regulatory approvals for additional rare genotypes for KAFTRIO in the EU and TRIKAFTA in the U.S. and Canada later this year.And Brazil is a good example of a new geography. Up to now, some patients in Brazil have been able to benefit from our CFTR modulators through named patient sales. We recently secured government reimbursement for TRIKAFTA in ages 6 plus and are in the process of launching TRIKAFTA for all eligible patients there. We will then look to drive further CF growth over the medium term with the vanzacaftor triple combination launch, as many existing TRIKAFTA patients may seek to achieve even greater levels of CFTR function with the added convenience of once-daily dosing. And there are also more than 6,000 patients who have discontinued one of our current CFTR modulators, who may be interested in a new treatment option.Furthermore, there are 31 additional rare mutations not previously responsive to our other CFTR modulators that are responsive to the vanzacaftor triple. Our launch preparations are well underway, including pre-approval information exchange with payers, and we are both encouraged by our interactions to date and excited by the opportunity to launch our fifth medicine in CF. Longer term, we expect continued growth in CF from our mRNA program, VX-522, for the more than 5,000 people with CF who do not respond to CFTR modulators.Now turning to CASGEVY and our launches in sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. We are making strong progress with ATC activation, physician and patient engagement and payer conversations. Enthusiasm from stakeholders is high in all regions, and our teams are working to translate this historic scientific achievement into meaningful patient benefit in the real world.Let me provide some insights on the launch with 2 key metrics we are sharing externally as important markers of our early launch progress: the number of activated authorized treatment centers or ATCs, and patient cell collections. Recall that Vertex will recognize revenue for CASGEVY near the end of the patient journey at infusion. Starting with ATC activation. You may recall we are prioritizing approximately 75 ATCs globally and already had 9 ATCs activated at launch, even ahead of knowing the final label or pricing for CASGEVY.We are pleased with our progress as we now have more than 25 activated centers, including centers in all regions where CASGEVY is approved. Even more important than the number of ATCs activated is patient initiations and cell collections. Many patients have begun the treatment journey, and as of mid-April, 5 patients already had cells collected. This is excellent progress given the short time frame since approval and the complexity and length of the patient journey. These cells collections have occurred across all regions where CASGEVY is approved: the U.S., Europe and the Middle East.We also continue to make great progress with payers, who recognize the transformative clinical benefits of CASGEVY and are moving quickly to provide rapid and equitable access. In the U.S. commercial market, we have contracts and/or published policies in place for over 200 million lives or nearly 65% of total lives. In the government Medicaid sector, we have policies in place or active contract negotiations ongoing with 18 states. And in the meantime, all states have confirmed their intent to provide case-by-case coverage.Outside the U.S., we are also making progress with reimbursement and access, either through formal reimbursement agreements or early access programs. In Europe, we see strong traction in France, with a reimbursed early access program in TDT. We're particularly pleased with our progress in the Middle East, which is a new region for Vertex and especially important for CASGEVY given the high prevalence of sickle cell disease in particular, and the government's clear focus on elevating the health of their citizens.Since receiving regulatory approvals from KSA and Bahrain, we have worked with local health care authorities and refined our epidemiology estimates for the region. Our work indicates that the eligible 12-plus sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia population in KSA and Bahrain that we could serve is in excess of 23,000 patients, a potentially larger opportunity than even the U.S. These regions have the infrastructure to administer medicines like CASGEVY, given the prevalence of the diseases and relatively high volume of allogeneic stem cell transplants performed annually.And importantly, we have already secured reimbursement agreements in KSA and Bahrain, allowing certain eligible patients to access CASGEVY for both sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent thalassemia. In addition to having activated ATCs and collected cells from our first patients in the Middle East, we continue to work with local health care professionals to increase the number of ATCs and expand patient access in the region.Shifting now to suzetrigine. We believe this highly selective NaV1.8 pain signal inhibitor has the potential to provide a transformative treatment option for the millions of patients suffering from acute and peripheral neuropathic pain. This quarter, I'm going to limit my commercial comments to the opportunity in acute pain. Throughout its clinical trials to date, suzetrigine has shown a compelling combination of efficacy and safety, with strong potential to be used across a range of moderate to severe acute pain conditions, both surgical and nonsurgical, and across a range of settings. This profile will ideally address the clear unmet need among both patients and physicians: effective pain relief with a favorable safety and tolerability profile.On prior investor webcasts, we provided details on this opportunity, including the magnitude: approximately 80 million patients are prescribed a medicine for moderate-to-severe acute pain each year in the U.S.; and the high concentration, with approximately 2/3 of patients being treated in the institutional setting. There is further concentration within that setting in approximately 2,000 institutions that roll up to around 150 IDNs. Accordingly, they can be served with a specialty commercial infrastructure.We have also detailed the mix of settings for their over 1 billion calendar days of acute pain treatment: 15% are prescribed and dispensed in an institutional setting, 35% are prescribed at discharge and 50% are prescribed in physicians' offices. This quarter, I'll provide you with some insights on our go-to-market strategy and an update on the legislative and payer landscape. We are focused on the institutional setting, given these approximately 2,000 institutions account for 50% of acute pain prescriptions.Extensive market research has also helped us identify an initial set of specific acute pain conditions and procedure types with high clinical fit, such as high-volume surgical procedures, pain conditions that typically require prescription pain medicines at discharge, or where we can seek to replace or significantly reduce opioid utilization. And the related physician specialties that are likely to adopt and champion suzetrigine. The key health care professionals we will be targeting include orthopedic, general and plastic surgeons, emergency department physicians, anesthesiologists and pain medicine specialists.Given the dynamics for new medicines to be approved for use in institutions, we expect the earliest uptake of suzetrigine will occur at discharge. Recall this discharge segment represents roughly 35% of the approximately 1.1 billion calendar days of acute pain treatment in the U.S. each year. The average prescription length in this setting is approximately 2 weeks. Treatment in this setting commonly includes opioids, where prescription length is shorter, 4 to 5 days, due to side effect profile, addiction concerns and prescribing limits at the state and IDN and hospital level.We are already engaging with key decision-makers across the formulary and access landscape, including pharmacists, PBMs, payers, IDNs and GPOs. We expect these stakeholders to make formulary and coverage decisions throughout the first year of the launch, and thus plan to engage in contracting discussions in the second half of this year ahead of launch to support the potential for accelerated formulary adoption.We've also made great progress in the build-out of our commercial team. Our field leadership team are now on board and fully trained, and having [gated] the hiring of the field force until after the Phase III data, we are now finalizing the hiring of 150 new customer-facing colleagues.Finally, we know the significance of policy in the world of pain treatment, with important legislation like the NOPAIN Act already on track for implementation in 2025 and bills like the Alternatives to PAIN Act recently introduced. Our long-standing efforts continue to help shape state and federal policy initiatives to: one, encourage consideration and use of non-opioid alternatives; and two, remove financial barriers to choosing a branded non-opioid. Overall, we plan for a high science, digitally-enabled commercialization approach with a strong focus on population health decision makers. In addition, both patient advocacy and public policy efforts complement and supplement our commercial activities.In conclusion, it's an exciting time to be at Vertex. We continue to treat more CF patients around the world and are well advanced in planning for the launch of the vanzacaftor triple combination. We are entering a new era of commercial diversification with the launch of CASGEVY in the U.S., Europe and the Middle East, and our launch preparations for suzetrigine in acute pain are well underway as we seek to fundamentally redefine the treatment of pain and drive further diversified revenue growth.I'll now turn the call over to Charlie to review the financials."", 'Charles F. Wagner', ""Thanks, Stuart. Vertex' excellent start to the year demonstrates once again our consistent strong performance and attractive growth profile. First quarter 2024 revenue increased 13% year-over-year to $2.7 billion, with solid growth of 8% in the U.S. and 21% outside the U.S. The drivers of this strong start were in line with our expectations, with some outperformance due to channel inventory phasing in select international markets.First quarter U.S. growth was driven by continued strong performance of TRIKAFTA, including in patients ages 2 to 5 following the approval in this patient population in April of last year, partially offset by the typical pattern of seasonally higher gross to net in the first quarter. Outside the U.S., growth was also driven by KAFTRIO 2 to 5 launch, and a benefit from channel inventory phasing is expected to reverse in subsequent quarters, similar to the dynamics we saw in the first half of 2023.First quarter 2024 combined non-GAAP R&D, acquired IPR&D and SG&A expenses were $1 billion compared to $1.2 billion in the first quarter of 2023. Included in Q1 '24 results are $77 million of acquired IPR&D charges compared to $347 million of such charges in the first quarter of 2023.Non-GAAP R&D expenses in Q1 '24 were relatively flat year-over-year and reflect growing investment in the advancement of our broad earlier-stage R&D portfolio offset by reduced costs from the recent successful completion of multiple late-stage clinical trials for CASGEVY, vanzacaftor and suzetrigine as well as the associated transition of certain costs from R&D to COGS and inventory.The increase in non-GAAP SG&A costs versus Q1 '23 includes investment in the commercial organization and launch activities for CASGEVY and acute pain. We anticipate the quarterly non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses will increase over the remainder of 2024 as we advance inaxaplin into Phase III development in AMKD, initiate the suzetrigine Phase III program in painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy and continue to invest in preparation for upcoming potential new commercial launches, including the further build-out of our suzetrigine team.First quarter 2024 non-GAAP operating income was $1.3 billion, a 48% increase compared to $902 million in non-GAAP operating income in the first quarter of 2023. First quarter 2024 non-GAAP effective tax rate of 17.4% compares to 21.3% in Q1 '23 and includes a benefit from a discrete adjustment to Vertex' income tax reserves. First quarter 2024 non-GAAP earnings per share were $4.76, including benefits from revenue and expense phasing as well as a lower tax rate, compared to $3.05 in the first quarter of 2023.We ended the quarter with $14.6 billion in cash and investments. We will use a portion of this cash on hand to fund the $4.9 billion acquisition of Alpine Immune Sciences, which is expected to close this quarter, subject to certain customary conditions. Alpine is a prime example of our priority for capital deployment: to invest in innovation, including external innovation via business development.We see multibillion-dollar potential for Phase III-ready povetacicept given its transformative and best-in-class potential in IgAN, a disease area with high unmet need. We also look forward to exploring pove's full potential in other serious diseases. Additionally, we deployed over $140 million of cash in the first quarter to repurchase 336,000 shares.Now switching to guidance. There is no change to our 2024 total product revenue guidance range of $10.55 billion to $10.75 billion, representing revenue growth of 8% at the midpoint at current exchange rates. We have high visibility into this revenue outlook. We expect continued growth in CF as we continue to reach more patients, including younger ones in core markets and select other countries as well as contribution in the second half of the year from the commercial launch of CASGEVY in approved indications and geographies. For total Vertex operating expenses, we continue to project $4.3 billion to $4.4 billion in full year 2024 combined non-GAAP SG&A, R&D and acquired IPR&D. This operating expense range continues to include approximately $125 million in currently anticipated IPR&D charges.Upon the close of the Alpine acquisition, we expect Alpine's projected non-GAAP operating expenses for the remainder of 2024 to be absorbed within this guidance range, but note the potential impacts of transaction accounting, including any potential acquired IPR&D charges, will be determined at the time of closing. There's also no change to our full year 2024 non-GAAP effective tax rate guidance range of 20% to 21%.In closing, Vertex posted excellent results yet again to start off the year as we delivered strong revenue growth, regulatory approvals and commercial launches. We also strengthened our capabilities in preparation for additional near-term launches, progressed our mid- and earlier-stage pipeline and entered the clinic in our 10th disease area of ADPKD.Importantly, we also announced the anticipated acquisition of Alpine Immune Sciences, a compelling fit with Vertex' strategy. Post close, we aim to leverage Vertex' clinical, regulatory and commercial capabilities to accelerate development and commercialization of pove. We are targeting approval in IgAN in 2027 and contribution to Vertex' revenue growth and diversification beginning in 2028, leveraging a specialty market approach with attractive margins.As we move through 2024, we anticipate further important milestones as detailed on Slide 18 to mark our continued progress in multiple disease areas. Please note that this pipeline slide will not reflect programs from Alpine Immune Sciences until post transaction close.We look forward to updating you on our progress on future calls, and I'll now ask Susie to begin the Q&A period."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) And the first question will come from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America.', 'Geoffrey Christopher Meacham', ""I had a few on the filings. So the first question is for vanza. Do you think you guys will get a claim for the sweat chloride benefit? It seems like, obviously, you'll have the Phase III data on the label. I'm just curious what you can do from a regulatory perspective to kind of elevate the sweat chloride benefit. So that's the first question.The second one, kind of the same question for 548 in acute pain. Do you think that -- are you guys going to push to make a claim for -- as an option to opioids or to Lyrica? I wondered if the regulatory climate can drive that."", 'Reshma Kewalramani', ""Yes. Geoff, this is Reshma. Let me take those questions. On the vanzacaftor triple, if you go back and look at all of the CFTR modulated labels, you'll see that we always have sweat chloride in the labels, and they are reflected because it is indeed a pharmacodynamic or PD marker. So I fully expect that the sweat chloride data from the vanza triple studies will be reflected in the label. Obviously, we are just at the point of having submitted the filing, so we're not at the point of label negotiations yet. But if history serves as a guide, I expect the sweat chloride will absolutely be in the label.On VX-548, Geoff, I think your question was about the DPN, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, study, but let me broaden the question about 548 and acute pain because that's the filing that we have already initiated the rolling submission. We've already submitted a few of the modules, and we expect, as I said in my prepared remarks, to complete the filing this quarter. We are submitting all of the data that we generated in acute pain, and the same will be true when it comes to the diabetic peripheral neuropathy data.And insofar as the acute pain Phase III results are versus placebo as the primary end point but there are data that have the opioid arm in there, I expect that it will be a discussion with the regulators about how exactly they want to display it. We are not at the point for the acute pain studies to have label negotiations and quite a bit far away from it for the DPN studies, which are just starting Phase III. But I will say that the reason we have a pregabalin arm in the Phase III DPN study is exactly for that reason, for us to be able to share the data with prescribers."", 'Geoffrey Christopher Meacham', ""Reshma, just a quick follow-up to that. Just on the alternative to opioids. I mean, obviously, you don't know yet when it comes to the label, but do you think you'll need that to help with Medicare kind of reimbursement?"", 'Reshma Kewalramani', ""Yes. So on the acute pain side, Geoff, I think that the most important data are going to be the primary endpoint data, and I'll ask Stuart to comment on that in a minute. And with regard to securing reimbursement and ensuring that there are no barriers to prescribing a non-opioid, we see that as a very important place for policy. Stuart?"", 'Stuart A. Arbuckle', ""Yes. Thanks, Reshma. So first thing I would say, Geoff, is remember, we are seeking a broad moderate to severe acute pain label so that the product could be used, if the physician decides and the patient wants to, for any type of acute pain, and so we're not really looking for a label that's looking to niches or pre-position us relative to other agents that are out there. We want physicians to have the broadest possible ability to use the product in the patients they see fit.As Reshma said, the primary endpoint, which talks to the really strong efficacy we see in moderate-to-severe acute pain, is clearly very important as is all the additional safety and tolerability data that we have to support VX-548 in combination with the fact that given its mechanism, it doesn't have addictive potential. So we're really looking at the full range of efficacy and safety, which I think is going to be the most important thing that's going to allow physicians to decide who they want to prescribe the product for."", 'Operator', 'Your next question will come from Jessica Fye with JPMorgan.', 'Jessica Macomber Fye', ""I'm curious. For your various NaV1.8 and 1.7 programs, would you consider advancing maybe another molecule for musculoskeletal pain, perhaps engaging a commercial partner to the extent it's not a Vertexian sales detail? Just curious if you kind of have any thoughts about that, so as to like not leave potential value on the table."", 'Reshma Kewalramani', ""Yes. Thanks for that question, Jess. So just to set the stage, we see 3 distinct areas in pain: acute pain, neuropathic pain and then everything else. And in everything else, I would add, musculoskeletal pain. It's the kind of osteoarthritis kind of pain. We fully intend to serve all patients, and I fully do expect that our NaV1.8, and when the time is right, the NaV1.7 or the NaV1.7, 1.8 combinations, our pain assets, will serve patients with musculoskeletal pain.And I say that because, as you know, the predecessor molecule to VX-548, VX-150, already demonstrated that potential. But we want to go one step at a time here. So first, we're going to do acute and neuropathic pain, and we see the research development and commercialization is completely Vertexian. And then for the musculoskeletal pain, whether that's with VX-548, the next-in-class medicine, VX-993, or the ones that come after that, again, either NaV1.8 or NaV1.7 alone or in combination, any of those for musculoskeletal pain.We will get them to patients, but we will not be commercializing that ourselves because it is a primary care sell. But we do absolutely see value there, and we see a need to help those patients. But one step at a time. First, neuropathic and acute pain, and that, we will do ourselves."", 'Operator', 'Your next question will come from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs.', 'Salveen Jaswal Richter', 'Two part here on the acute pain program. With regard to engaging with key decision makers, can you help us to understand the importance of the hospital administrators who are taking into account the legislative tailwinds versus the physician treaters here in the specific verticals that you cited and how they might make -- or work together here to make a decision?And my second question is what hospitals really need to make an argument for using it in lieu of opioids, and whether outcomes data is required, be it reduction in recovery room time or lower usage of opioids or rates of addictions being reported?', 'Reshma Kewalramani', 'Sure, Salveen. Let me ask Stuart to comment.', 'Stuart A. Arbuckle', ""Yes. So Salveen, all of the stakeholders that you described are going to be important in making decisions on the use of a new medicine in the institutional setting. So administrators are certainly going to be important, but as are our physician advocates who are going to advocate based on the efficacy and safety of the medicine.And the process is a relatively standardized process. It's not going to be created newly for suzetrigine. This is a standard process that hospitals go through to decide whether they're going to put it on their formulary, and typically go through some sort of P&T committee process where all of the various stakeholders, be it physicians, be it the pharmacy team, be it the administrators, are all going to be making that decision collectively.They're particularly interested in the use, obviously, within the institutional setting. Use in the discharge setting is typically something which is a little bit more straightforward, and that's why I suggested in my prepared remarks that we see that as the likely setting where there is going to be the earliest uptake of a medicine like suzetrigine.In terms of some of the outcomes data that you were referring to, I think the clearest way of describing is every patient that is treated with suzetrigine when the other choice would have been an opioid is essentially providing opioid-sparing for that patient.So that data, in many ways, is kind of already sort of readily available just from the data that we've already shared, and I think that data in addition to all the other efficacy and safety data we've got is going to be pretty impactful and compelling to the various stakeholders we've described."", 'Operator', 'The next question will come from Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital.', 'Evan David Seigerman', ""Love to know if you to provide any additional color on how many patients in the United States have gotten their cells collected, and maybe how we should think about the growth of cell collections in the U.S. going forward. I'm just trying to understand what the trajectory of this could be like this year and next year."", 'Reshma Kewalramani', ""Yes. Evan, just to set expectations, we're not going to comment very specifically on patients and exactly where they are in the cell collection process in each region, but I will ask Stuart to give you a little bit of color commentary on what we're seeing.And if I was stealing Stuart's thunder, if you really think about when CASGEVY was approved, which is December and January, I am so very pleased that the number of ATCs that are activated around the globe and the number of patients who have already started cell collection. Stuart, is there anything you want to add?"", 'Stuart A. Arbuckle', ""Only that we are expecting the momentum to build based on all of the feedback that we've got and the trends that we're seeing in activations and cell collections, as Reshma said. We're delighted to have had 5 cell collections already.As she also mentioned, that represents patients in every region in which we are operating, including obviously, the United States, and we expect those trends to continue to ramp up during the course of 2024, which we've always said was going to be a foundational year for CASGEVY."", 'Operator', 'The next question will come from Colin Bristow with UBS.', 'Colin Nigel Bristow', ""Maybe first on the pain pipeline. I see you're advancing 993 to Phase 2. Could you just give us any sort of color or detail on how you expect this to be differentiated? And does this advancement mean you won't be taking 973 forward, which I think also recently completed Phase I? And then if I may, a quick housekeeping one. Any inventory moves in the quarter that we should be aware of?"", 'Reshma Kewalramani', ""Colin, let me break that up into 2 questions. One on inventory, which I will ask Charlie to comment on first, and then I'll come back on 993 and 973."", 'Charles F. Wagner', ""Colin, in my prepared remarks, I mentioned that we saw some benefit in the first quarter from phasing of international channel inventory, so I assume that's what you're talking about. That benefit was on the order of $75 million to $100 million in the quarter, and I expect that to begin to reverse in the second quarter."", 'Reshma Kewalramani', ""On 993, 973, Colin, this is all part of serial innovation. 993 is a little bit further ahead than 973 in terms of the preclinical package, the manufacturing and all of the things we need to do to get our medicines ready to go into Phase II. That's why that one is ready to go. 973 is just a little bit further behind.What are we looking for in terms of differentiation? There's really 2 major elements other than our overarching serial innovation strategy. But very specifically, one, we are looking for molecules that can be both oral and IV, VX-548 is oral only, because our goal here is to own the waterfront on pain management, including for those patients who may be just coming out of surgery or for other reasons, not able to take by mouth.The second big goal here is to ensure that we have medicines with the right drug-like properties that can be therefore combined with the NaV1.7, which is also making good progress in preclinical development. So that's what we're really looking for. And why 993 next? It's because it's a little bit further ahead. And 973, we're going to be working on just as soon as all of the data already there."", 'Operator', 'Your next question will come from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley.', 'Terence C. Flynn', 'Great. Maybe a two-part for me as well. I was just wondering if you can give us any insight on a potential presentation venue for the 548 Phase III data. And then the second question relates to CASGEVY. I was just wondering, any directional insight on pricing and reimbursement in the Middle East?', 'Reshma Kewalramani', ""Yes, on VX-548, fall meetings, shall we say. You should expect more data on 548 with those Phase III results. certainly not only in Congress form but in publications. So I'd say fall meetings. And let me ask Stuart to comment on CASGEVY in the Middle East. It is a really exciting opportunity for us."", 'Stuart A. Arbuckle', ""Yes, super exciting opportunity for us, Terence, which is why we provide a little bit more color on it. Specifically to answer your question, we don't provide pricing data at an individual country level, but suffice to say, the price we are receiving in the existing reimbursement agreements that we've signed there reflect the transformative value of the product and the lifetime benefits that patients can accrue from it. And that's going to be the same kind of philosophy we're going to have everywhere around the world where we're commercializing CASGEVY."", 'Operator', 'The next question will come from Phil Nadeau with TD Cowen.', 'Philip M. Nadeau', ""Two from us. So first on the suzetrigine formulary and access discussions. Stuart, I think you made an interesting comment that you thought enabling reimbursement ahead of opioids in the acute pain setting will be something that government programs could help incentivize it or something to that effect.Could you speak a bit more about that? And in particular, are your formulary and access discussions suggesting that in the absence of legislative initiatives, it's likely that 548 will be reimbursed after opioids in the acute pain setting?And then second, small commercial question. Can you give us some sense of how big Brazil could be for the CF franchise?"", 'Reshma Kewalramani', 'Yes. Phil, I will ask Stuart to comment on both CF in Brazil. You know that we have regulatory approval and reimbursement there as well as formulary discussions on suzetrigine. But just to make sure we are on the same page, the formulary discussions are separate from our discussions with policymakers.The common theme is that both of those stakeholders, and frankly, all of the stakeholders are very aware of the opioid crisis. They have high awareness of suzetrigine, and there is enthusiasm to using non-opioids. But those discussions are separate. Over to you, Stuart.', 'Stuart A. Arbuckle', ""Yes. So just to add to that, Reshma, what I would say, Phil, is that the policy initiatives that we've seen so far are really looking at trying to reduce financial disincentives for patients and indeed for institutions to selecting a branded non-opioid in a market which is obviously currently dominated by generic opioids. And so that's why things like NOPAIN, which is providing an additional payment above the DRG in the outpatient and ambulatory surgical center setting, is important there.And then on the patient side, the Alternatives to PAIN Act is looking at in Medicare Part D, ensuring that there are no co-pay disadvantages to a patient for using a branded non-opioid in a market where there are already generic opioids. So I'd say that's the kind of the policy landscape.Those are kind of slightly different discussions that we're having with the institutions and the stakeholders there, which were much more clinically based on whether this is the right medicine to be using in the patients who are being prescribed and dispensed medicines in the institutional setting. So that's how I would describe the difference between the conversations. They're obviously linked in some ways, but they are -- they have a different focus from the policy side to the institutional side."", 'Philip M. Nadeau', ""Maybe just a follow-up. The basis for our question is we recently did a survey, and 75% of physicians thought that patients would have to step through a generic opioid. Is that Vertex' expectation as well?"", 'Stuart A. Arbuckle', ""I can't really speculate on exactly what's going to happen with, for instance, 2,000 institutions. But my hope would be that, that's not what's happening. I don't think it's very reasonable to expect a patient to have to step through a therapy which has significant side effect liability, including addictive potential, when there is a product available, which has very good efficacy from a pain control perspective and has an excellent safety and tolerability profile, including lack of addictive potential. So I don't think that would be something that we would -- certainly wouldn't be advocating and I don't think would be particularly medically reasonable.I didn't answer the second part of your question, which was around Brazil. We estimate there's around 1,500 patients who are eligible for TRIKAFTA. That's 6 and over in Brazil. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, a number of those patients did already have access to TRIKAFTA through named patient sales, but we now have a reimbursement agreement with the national government there, which is going to allow us to launch the medicine and make it available for all of those patients now."", 'Operator', 'The next question will come from Olivia Brayer with Cantor Fitzgerald.', 'Olivia Simone Brayer', ""What's your level of confidence that you'll get priority review in acute pain? And Stuart, I know you've talked about the commercial build-out, but what's your base case for when you'll start to actually see revenue recognition from that program? And just a quick clarification on CASGEVY. Just wanted to clarify that I heard 5 patients have already finished collection versus just having initiated the cell collection process."", 'Reshma Kewalramani', ""Olivia, this is Reshma. Let me take 1 and 3, and then I'll ask Stuart to take the question on where are we exactly with paying commercialization. On number 3, again, just to set expectations on CASGEVY. We're thrilled with the number of ATCs, 25 since approval, which has been in just the last few months, and we commented on the cell collection, but we're not going to comment any further on exactly where each one patient is in their journey.On VX-548 and acute pain, 3 things to say. Maybe the most important thing is we'll know whether or not we've received priority review in about -- after we complete the submission, and then it takes some 60 days or so for the FDA to tell us what the final review time lines will be. However, the leading indicators of whether or not we will get priority review are all quite favorable. We have Fast Track status, we have Breakthrough Designation and our conversations with the FDA have shown me that they have high enthusiasm for a medicine that has high efficacy and does not have addictive potential.I'll turn it over to Stuart for the question about where are we with the acute pain launch, and when we're going to be out there."", 'Stuart A. Arbuckle', ""Yes. So the recruitment of our teams is going very well. Obviously, we are in the middle of our rolling submission here. Obviously, once we've completed that, we'll get an indication from the regulators on when we could expect our PDUFA date to be, and we are going to be launch ready.In terms of the question around revenue recognition, this is unlike CASGEVY, I would say, which has an extended treatment process where revenue recognition is at infusion. This is a small molecule, and therefore, we're going to be kind of selling and distributing it in the normal way. And so there really isn't going to be that kind of lag, I would suggest, around revenue recognition that people are aware of with CASGEVY."", 'Operator', 'Next question will come from Debjit Chattopadhyay with Guggenheim Securities.', 'Debjit D. Chattopadhyay', ""I got a couple. First on IgAN, when Vertex is ready to launch in IgAN, it's likely Otsuka will have GFR data. How are you thinking about navigating this commercially?And then on DM1, with the IND cleared and the Phase I/II underway, do you think myotonia is an approvable endpoint? Or is the agency going to ask for [splicing] correction with strength or force measurements?"", 'Reshma Kewalramani', ""Debjit, let me take both of those. On DM1 or myotonic dystrophy type 1, we actually haven't had a chance to talk about it extensively. But this is a program that is in Phase I/II in patients. So we are going to have the opportunity in this study to not only assess safety, but to assess efficacy as well. With regard to what the agency might want to see for the endpoint for approval, the real answer is I don't know yet because we haven't gotten to that phase in the clinical trial.But your point around, is myotonia possible? Insofar as this is a disease that is a rare disease, a serious disease and one that doesn't have any therapies that target the underlying cause of the disease or very specifically works on the genetic defect, I think that opportunity is there. And I've seen -- and we've seen a lot of openness for accelerated end points in these kinds of rare serious diseases.On IgA nephropathy, so the most important thing to know about IgA nephropathy is that it's a serious chronic disease, and this is a disease that over time leads to decline in GFR and end-stage renal disease, death or transplantation. The most important thing that I would be looking at as a nephrologist is efficacy. Because proteinuria is known to translate to GFR and therefore, the decline in renal function, so if we have a medicine that has high reductions in proteinuria, and as I said in my prepared remarks, everything that we've seen from pove, preclinically and clinically through Phase II, is best-in-class across many dimensions, but certainly including efficacy. I think that's the drug that physicians will choose."", 'Susie Lisa', 'One last quick question, please, Chuck.', 'Operator', 'That will come from Ms. Liisa Bayko with Evercore ISI.', 'Liisa Ann Bayko', ""So just 2 from me. Just a follow-up on IgA nephropathy. Have you thought any more about how you might highlight having [BAFF]? Because in addition to APRIL, I think that's one kind of key differentiator of this program. And just wondering how you're thinking about how you could differentiate on that point. I don't know if there's biopsies or some kind of different points that you could really highlight the potential benefits of BAFF.And then just for the -- for CF and TRIKAFTA for the quarter, I noticed you had your price increase yet sales looked slightly down quarter-over-quarter. Can you kind of just describe in the U.S. what's going on? Was there some higher gross to net inventory changes, whatnot? Maybe -- great for some color there."", 'Reshma Kewalramani', ""Let me take the IgAN question first, and then I'll ask Charlie to comment on CF. On IgAN, you are correct in pointing out that it's a dual inhibitor. It's an inhibitor of BAFF as well as APRIL. And this is one of the most attractive features of povetacicept is this dual inhibition. Yes, preclinically, we can certainly share when we have information, and you'll certainly see all of this with the fullness of time, the inhibition of BAFF and the measurement of that, and how we can show that preclinically. We can also do that with APRIL.However, I think the data that's more interesting is the clinical data which is already available, and that is with this dual APRIL, BAFF inhibitor on proteinuria, but I'd encourage you to look at the poster from the WCN meeting that Alpine showed. It has proteinuria results, it has hematuria results, it has GFR results, and it has a composite of remission. And I find those data very, very interesting, particularly the hematuria results clinically, because as you know, hematuria is a hallmark of this disease along with proteinuria.Let me turn it over to Charlie on the question about CF and U.S."", 'Charles F. Wagner', ""Yes, Liisa. On the quarter, I wouldn't read too much into sequential quarter fluctuations. We saw strong volume growth in the U.S. year-over-year. As we normally do, we see some seasonal gross to net in the first quarter, and the benefit of the price increase really isn't fully reflected in the quarter that comes throughout the balance of the year. So all of those factors affect the comparison. But overall, very, very strong year-over-year growth in the U.S. and outside the U.S."", 'Susie Lisa', 'Thanks. Chuck?', 'Operator', ""This concludes our question-and-answer session as well as our conference call for today. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

You can skip our detailed analysis on defense spending patters in the continent and head over directly to the 5 Weakest Militaries in Africa.', 'Global military spending increased 6.8% from 2022 – the steepest rise since 2009 – to reach a record-high of $2.44 trillion in 2023, according to latest figures released by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). This is the ninth successive year of growth in defense expenditure, with spending increasing across all regions of the world.', 'The United States continued to remain the largest military spender in the world, having spent a whopping $916 billion on defense in 2023, representing 37% of the world’s total defense expenditure. China, Russia, India, and Saudi Arabia retained their positions in the top five, while Ukraine climbed from 11th spot in 2022 to become the eighth largest spender on defense, having spent $64.8 billion in 2023. Combined, the top ten countries accounted for 74% of the world’s total defense expenditure during the year.', 'In Africa, the military spending totaled $51.6 billion in 2023, which was 22% higher than in 2022, and represented 2.1% of the global defense expenditure. Of this, $28.5 billion was spent in North Africa, with Algeria and Morocco together accounting for 82% of the military spending in the region. This spike was driven by Algiers’ defense bills soaring 76% compared to 2022 to reach $18.3 billion, made possible by an increase in demand for Algerian gas exports amid sanctions against Russia. On the other hand, $23.1 billion was incurred on defense by states in Sub-Saharan Africa, with 20% of the amount attributed to Nigeria. As is evident from these numbers, while defense spending continues to rise each year, the increase is not even. Neither across continents, nor within.', 'Russia is Africa’s largest arms trade partner, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, with the country’s exports to the continent increasing 23% between 2016 and 2020, compared to 2011 and 2015. This is seen by analysts as a strategic move by Moscow to facilitate trade and soft power in Africa, which would enable Russia to build a presence at NATO’s southern flank. That being said, sanctions against Moscow in recent years have created an opening for Chinese armament manufacturers as well, with the Asian giant exporting over $2 billion worth of military supplies to Sub-Saharan Africa between 2010 and 2021. Arms sales of the United States to the subregion during this period were estimated to be $473 million, according to the Atlantic Council.', ""The situation is strikingly different in North Africa, where American defense companies play a much more active role, driven by the decades-long arms race between Algeria and Morocco, coupled with President Sisi's quest for Egypt to become a major regional power. Washington in April last year, approved the potential sale of HIMARS and related equipment to Rabat under a $524 million deal, with Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LHX), and RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) being among the major contractors of the deal. The Pentagon also approved selling Joint Stand Off Weapons to Morocco for a cost of $250 million, with RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) being the primary contractor of the project."", 'On the other hand, Cairo has also been looking to upgrade its defense systems with advanced American air radars. In January 2022, the US approved the sale of three L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LHX) SPS-48 land-based radars for $355 million to Egypt, which would offer the African nation jamming capabilities and help it detect even extremely small targets. A year prior to this in February 2021, it was reported that Egypt also received the Rolling Airframe Missiles manufactured by RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) under a $197 million agreement.', 'Moreover, elsewhere in the African continent, the United States has actively begun donating military equipment to several countries in the region to aid them in combating terrorism and crime. In 2014, the United States gave away two Cessna 208 Caravan aircraft to Mauritania to help the country in its fight against maritime time and terrorist groups. Both the aircraft were manufactured by Cessna, owned by Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT), and were valued at $21 million each at the time.', 'More recently in 2021, the American government donated a Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) C-130 aircraft to Niger to use in operations related to humanitarian assistance and mobility of UN peacekeeping missions. The C-130 is one of the top-selling tactical aircraft in the world, and has been continuously manufactured by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) since its first flight in 1954.', 'Last year, the United States announced an $80 million grant to donate four Bell 412EP helicopters built by Bell Helicopters, a subsidiary of Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT), to the Zambian Air Force. Under the grant, the US was also to provide three years of service and training for the helicopter. The Zambian government thanked Washington for the donation, and stated that the helicopters would assist the country in enhancing regional security, and in supporting UN peacekeeping missions in the continent.', 'Also see 15 Most Powerful Militaries in Africa.', 'Several weighted metrics have been considered to rank the weakest militaries in Africa. These include capabilities of ground forces (40%) determined by manpower, tanks, and armored fighting vehicles; naval and aerial strength (30%), and economic potential and defense spending (30%).

A defeat of current Norfolk Southern management, credited with improving safety practices at the railroad since the February 3, 2023 derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, could make management at other railroads reluctant to take steps to improve safety if it means reduced profit margins.', 'The fight has split the railroad’s unions, who disagree which management team – the current Norfolk Southern leadership or one proposed by activist investor Ancora Holdings – would be best for safety and the railroad’s employees.', 'Ancora, which seeks to have its own slate of directors elected and a new CEO and COO put in charge of the railroad, insist current management has proven incapable of running a safe and profitable railroad. It wants to improve profitability at the railroad by greater emphasis on the operating philosphy known as Precision Scheduled Railroading, or PSR, which leads to longer trains making fewer stops at customers’ locations to pick-up or drop-off rail cars.', 'PSR is generally opposed by both rail unions and many rail customers, and Norfolk management appeared to be taking steps away from PSR in the wake of the East Palestine derailment.', 'Norfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw and his management team received praised by some who, in the past, criticized the railroad’s performance, including Amit Bose, administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration, the nation’s rail regulator.', 'In a letter to Norfolk Southern in February soon after the takeover effort started, Bose praise the railroad instituting a “confidential close call reporting system” similar to one in place for decades at the nation’s railroads to allow employees to report safety issues without fear of reprisal, as well as increasing staffing and training. He said Shaw’s safety efforts “are important and demonstrate the ability to make progress when railroads make safety a priority.” And he said that NS was the only Class I railroad to achieve significant reductions in the rate of mainline derailments last year.', 'His letter suggested his concerns that that progress could be lost due to the takeover battle.', '“While I recognize NS for the meaningful steps and results seen so far, often in notable contrast to industry peers, I want to emphasize the importance of a durable and lasting path forward that continues to prioritize safety,” he wrote. “Any backsliding, as a result of a change in leadership or otherwise, on the safety-oriented path you have laid out and communicated to us will likely attract renewed oversight attention from my office.”', 'After initially being united in opposition to the takeover effort, the railroad’s unions are now split on the takeover battle.', 'Most of the unions remain supportive of current CEO Alan Shaw and Norfolk Southern’s current board.', '“NS and Shaw have placed a unique focus on establishing a culture that addresses safety concerns that other carriers have not,” said a letter from Jeremy Ferguson, president of SMART-TD, the union that represents more than 5,000 conductors at the railroad.', 'The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET), which represents more than 3,000 engineers at the railroad, joined the other unions at the railroad in initially endorsing Norfolk management, saying that Ancora’s plans for Norfolk would be\xa0“reckless” and “likely to lead to more train wrecks.” It said Ancora’s PSR plan “requires railroads to do more with less which equates to longer trains, deferred maintenance of track and equipment, shorter inspections of rolling stock and a reduction in staffing numbers.”', 'And it praised the changes that Shaw had made to improve safety since the February 2023 derailment in East Palestine, Ohio.', '“Shaw was only on the job for a few months prior to the disaster.\xa0Since the derailment last year, NS’ CEO has risen to the occasion and, through his leadership, NS has become a safer, more efficient and customer focused company again,” said\xa0Jerry Sturdivant, a BLET union official at Norfolk Southern, back in February.', 'But the BLET said the changes that Norfolk Southern has made to try to answer Ancora’s takeover efforts are taking the railroad in the wrong direction. It is particularly upset with the work of the railroad’s new chief operating officer, John Orr, hired in March from Canadian Pacific Kansas City, for a pay package with a target value of $10.3 million.', 'BLET said that Orr’s appointment shows that Norfolk Southern is committed to additional use of PSR, no matter which side wins the the proxy fight. And it said it has received assurances of other safety improvements from Ancora, including dropping all plans to have single-person crews on long-distance trains.', 'The current labor contract requires both an engineer and a conductor in the locomotive, and a recent proposed federal rule would codify the requirement. Although that rule has yet to take effect and could be reversed in the future. And the nation’s major railroads would still prefer to remove the conductors from the trains, arguing it can be done without reducing safety.', '“Although we initially supported Mr. Shaw and Norfolk Southern’s management in this contest, today he leads a different team with\xa0an unproven strategy,” said a statement from three BLET officials at the railroad. “The ever-changing and inconsistent policies that we have been hearing from the railroad’s current leadership in recent weeks forced BLET to take another look at Ancora and its nominees. We ultimately made a final decision to support the Ancora slate and CEO choice.”', 'The Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees Division (BMWED) whose members perform track maintenance, joined the BLET in switching support to Ancora.', '“For many months since East Palestine, the BMWED has not been able to get assurances from the current leadership to implement needed policy and procedural changes to prevent such tragedies from reoccurring,” it said. “At this juncture, seeing no path forward, we see no reason to support the current administration at Norfolk Southern.”', 'Ancora has tapped former UPS executive Jim Barber to be the next CEO if it wins. Both BLET and BMWE are part of the Teamsters union, which has more than 300,000 members working for UPS.', 'Shaw and Norfolk Southern’s management still has the support of the other unions at the railroad, which between them represent about 60% of the unionized employees there. SMART-TD issued a statement calling the BLET “Judas,” saying union leadership “should be ashamed.”', '“They were willing to hand over everything our movement has done to defend our men and women against PSR at NS,” said SMART-TD.', 'Shaw and current Norfolk Southern management “have made a conscious effort to diverge from the operating ratio-obsessed mentality that has degraded rail service and safety… and have made safety, employees and customers their priority,” it said in a separate statement.', 'But no matter what the unions and safety regulator thinks about the choices, the decision will ride with shareholders who are likely displeased by the performance of the company’s stock, and the financial results.', 'Shares of Norfolk Southern are down 8% from where they were before the February 3 2023 derailment, compared to a 5% gain in CSX shares and 13% rise in shares of Union Pacific. Norfolk’s profit margin is also lower than industry averages and it shrank in the first quarter compared to a year earlier, even when stripping out the cost of the derailment.', 'The Ancora takeover effort has gotten endorsement from two leading shareholder services firms, Glass Lewis and ISS.', '“Having given due consideration to the arguments presented by each side, we believe Ancora has presented a compelling case for supporting a substantial overhaul of the Company’s current leadership,” said a statement from Glass Lewis.', 'For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com']"

If you wish to skip our analysis of transportation sector of the world and the metro rail infrastructure market, you can go directly to 5 Largest Metro Networks in The World.', 'Growth of cities has been phenomenal in the recent times, with more and more people starting to live in cities. As of 2023, round about 56% of the world’s population, equaling 4.4 billion people, are residing in cities, according to World Bank. However, rapid growth in urbanization requires efficient transportation networks across cities. Thus, the need to curtail traffic congestion issues, and the need to up the overall public transit system because of increasing urbanization, have driven the global public transit sector – the market struck $215.54 billion mark in 2022, and further projections indicate towards a whopping 7.6% annual growth rate of the market from 2023 to 2030! In terms of the overall transportation system, Stockholm (Sweden), Helsinki (Finland), and Zurich (Switzerland) are 3 cities of the world with the best public transit system, according to Insider Monkey article. Moreover, London (U.K.), Copenhagen (Denmark), and Berlin (Germany) are few others which are ranked amongst the best in Europe, and in the world, as well.', 'As such, the metro network becomes highly relevant to our discussion, as it is increasingly preferred by the people because of its reliability and environmentally efficient aspect. Moreover, metro network also results in significant reduction of traffic jams and pollution. In U.S. alone, in 2022, 134 billion gallons of gasoline was burnt out through the consumption of it in the transportation sector, which caused 1,476 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions, which results in climatic issues like global warming, according to Coltura.', 'The metro rail infrastructure market hit the $46.8 billion mark in 2023, with further expectations saying that it will continue to grow 6% annually, till 2032, according to Global Market Insights. The projection of the market is based on the increasing urbanization and resultant growth in cities. Moreover, environmentally friendly modes of doing anything is preferred in today’s era, and hence, more investments are put into transportation network, which requires a great deal of long-term commitment, to be transitioned into greener industry – and metro networks are one way to do it. For example, a new installation, the Grand Paris Express, is planned for the Paris Métro, which would add up a range of 120 miles through 4 new lines and 68 new stations.', 'According to a report from McKinsey, Asia is expected to spend the most money on building new metro and light-rail systems. Between the time frame of 2019 to 2025, they had put forward a goal to invest around $920 billion, back in 2020; the Middle East and Europe regions are also aiming to spend a lot, between $135 and $145 billion each. Few cities which are hoping to transition their rail system the most are Beijing, Kuala Lumpur, Shenzhen, and Singapore, each planning at least one rail project worth more than $5 billion, according to McKinsey.', ""In 2023, North America was seen to be involved in betterment of its metro network system. Money from the federal, state, and local governments is key for planning, building, and keeping up with metro systems. For example, in November 2023, the Biden Administration granted $1.64 billion to help expand the Metro-North Railroad's Penn Station access, which included addition of four new stations in the Bronx."", 'Major companies in the US market are actively pursuing strategic initiatives to uphold and expand their market presence. Companies like AECOM (NYSE:ACM), Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), and Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE:NSC), are prioritizing innovation, investing in research and development, and utilizing advanced technologies to improve the efficiency and sustainability of railway systems.', ""In January 2024, Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE:NSC) teamed up with 62 customers to complete industrial development projects in 2023. These projects, which expanded operations or established new facilities along Norfolk Southern's rail network, totaled $3.1 billion in investment, creating over 4,150 new jobs as a result. According to Ed Elkins, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer, this collaboration reflects Norfolk Southern's (NYSE:NSC) commitment to facilitating industrial growth and enhancing productivity. The company aims to demonstrate its reliability and efficiency as a railroad partner, supporting both existing and potential customers in their growth endeavors."", ""In February 2022, AECOM (NYSE:ACM) obtained funding for several significant rail projects across the U.S., through the Federal-State Partnership for Intercity Passenger Rail Grant Program. This program has allocated approximately $16.4 billion for various essential rail infrastructure projects along the Northeast Corridor and nationwide. AECOM's (NYSE:ACM) ongoing projects include the California High-Speed Rail, the Lyon-Turin high-speed rail link, and the Metro Tunnel Melbourne in Australia."", ""Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) is another key player in rail transportation, linking the western two-thirds of the United States by rail. It provides rail services from major West Coast and Gulf Coast ports to eastern gateways, interfaces with Canada's rail systems, and serves major Mexico gateways. In late July 2022, Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) announced a significant deal with Wabtec to modernize around 600 locomotives. The agreement, valued at over $1 billion, is the largest investment in modernized locomotives in the rail industry history, which aims to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of Union Pacific's locomotive fleet, according to Wabtec."", 'Few of the biggest metro networks in the world are in New York, Beijing and Shanghai; and to delve deeper into the realm of biggest metro networks existing in the world, let’s now jump to our list of 15 Largest Metro Networks in the World.', 'To rank 15 Largest Metro Networks in the World, we used a weighted ranking system to assign a score to each metro system. This took into account three parameters, which included, number of stations, length of track, and number of lines. The figures for these have been sourced from various sources like CNN Travel\xa0and World Metro Database. The first two parameters, that are considered more noteworthy to describe the size of Metro Networks, were given a higher weightage of 40% each, whereas the third parameter was given a weight of 20%.

Of course, I am talking about the proxy battle initiated and being fiercely — I might even say viciously — waged by Ancora against the current leadership of Norfolk Southern.”', '', 'Whether Oberman’s comments would have made any difference weeks ago is questionable. It is even less certain whether they had an impact just nine days before Norfolk Southern’s (NYSE: NSC) annual meeting, as many proxy votes presumably have already been cast.', 'Ancora is seeking to oust Shaw as well as Norfolk Southern’s newly appointed COO, John Orr, and several members of the board of directors, including Chair Amy Miles. Ancora’s picks to replace Shaw and Orr are, respectively, Jim Barber, a former UPS executive, and Jamie Boychuk, a former CSX executive.', 'While Oberman has often discussed railroad staffing levels in his critiques, one of the first issues he raised in his Chicago address was what he said was a plan by Ancora to deemphasize intermodal traffic in favor of manifest trains, which have multiple cars carrying different types of freight.', '“They want to deemphasize intermodal — for only one reason,” he said. “Manifest traffic is carried at a lower OR than intermodal. Not that intermodal isn’t profitable. It’s just not as profitable, Ancora says, to make their shareholders richer faster. This is a short-sighted strategy which cannot be sustained in the long run.”', '', 'Oberman said intermodal is crucial. “Intermodal now accounts for about 50% of all rail traffic, and that is where the future is,” he said.', 'He cited the work of well-respected rail consultancy Oliver Wyman, which he said sees $177 billion in revenue that would be jeopardized if trains keep losing business to trucks at the current pace.', '“If railroads just hold on to their current percentage of intermodal, they will keep that $177 billion,” Oberman said. “But most importantly, if they simply employ their existing capacity, they can not only keep the $177 billion but add an additional $61 billion in intermodal by 2030. And that is profitable traffic.', '“Rather than detailing plans for adding carloads to the railroad, what you find in the endless pages of Ancora’s presentations are detailed spreadsheets how they are going to cut, cut, cut resources and how fast their [operating ratio] is going to come down in the next few years if they prevail.”', 'Oberman said Norfolk Southern “has made more progress in building a resilient railroad” than any other Class 1 railroad in recent years.', '“But Ancora has missed the boat on resiliency,” he added. “Indeed, its attack on NS is centered on its view that resiliency is a huge mistake and needs to be eliminated.”', 'He then turned his attention to Barber. According to Oberman, Barber, a former executive at UPS, has boasted of hiring 100,000 employees around Christmas who would then be let go, with the idea that a new round of employees could be hired the next holiday season. According to Oberman, Barber will seek similar “resiliency” at Norfolk Southern.', 'And in characteristic bluntness, Oberman said, “Indeed, with due respect to the hard-working folks at UPS, it just doesn’t take as much skill and training to load a cardboard carton into the back of a van as it does to drive a locomotive or handle complex rail car movements in a yard.”', '', 'NS published a press release Monday touting Oberman’s comments.\xa0 That press release became the basis for a proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.', 'Proxy filings submitted to the SEC by either Ancora or Norfolk Southern total 16 just since May 1. Eight were filed on Monday alone.', 'In a sign that Ancora considers everything fair game, one of the activist investor’s two filings Monday called for the resignation of board member Claude Mongeau because of his role as a board member of TD Bank. TD Bank is the subject of a recently launched money laundering probe.', 'Meanwhile, the six proxy filings from Norfolk Southern besides Oberman’s comments also included pro-management statements from several shippers, including such companies as Lincoln Energy Solutions and Centennial Energy.

I’m also bullish on VDC based on its low fee, long dividend history, and the strong Smart Scores its top holdings boast.', 'VDC was launched by index fund pioneer Vanguard more than 20 years ago, in January 2004. In that time, the fund has grown to $6.5 billion in assets under management (AUM). According to Vanguard, VDC “seeks to track the performance of a benchmark index that measures the investment return of stocks in the consumer staples sector.”', 'VDC’s underlying index “includes stocks of companies that provide direct-to-consumer products that, based on consumer spending habits, are considered nondiscretionary.”', 'We’ll get into what types of stocks this encompasses in the section below.', 'VDC owns 105 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 60.7% of the fund.\xa0Below, you’ll find an overview of VDC’s top 10 holdings from TipRanks’ holdings tool.', 'As you can see, VDC owns a group of high-profile, blue-chip U.S. consumer staples stocks.', 'The fund owns the makers of everyday household staples like detergents, deodorants, soaps, shampoos, and more, like Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Colgate-Palmolive. These companies may not sound like the most exciting in the world, but they sell products that people need every day and are loath to cut from their budgets. This puts them in a strong position no matter how the economic tides ebb and flow from one day to the next.', 'Colgate recently shook off inflation and economic uncertainty to report strong 9.8% organic sales growth for the first quarter and increased pricing of 8.5%, encapsulating the strength these consumer staples stalwarts have in this environment. Colgate also used the strong start to the year as an opportunity to increase revenue guidance for the year.', 'Meanwhile, VDC has positions in soft drink giants like Coca-Cola and Pepsi (NASDAQ:PEP), which sell the sodas and other drinks that many people consume on a daily basis, regardless of how the macro economy is doing or where interest rates stand.', 'Like Colgate, Coca-Cola recently reported earnings and overcame any macroeconomic challenges, beating on both revenue and earnings. Coca-Cola says that it expects to grow organic revenue by an impressive 8-9% this year, along with comparable currency-neutral EPS growth of 11% to 13%.', 'Tobacco stocks like Philip Morris and Altria (NYSE:MO) are in a similarly strong position, as tobacco users buy their products on a routine, habitual basis and are unlikely to eschew this habit just because the economy is slow. Inflation and the uncertain economy aren’t hurting demand for Philip Morris’ red-hot nicotine pouch product Zyn, which saw shipment volume increase by an incredible 79.7% year-over-year during its first quarter of the year.', 'Big box retailers like Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) are competitive in any type of economic environment, thanks to their low-cost offerings.', 'Lastly, Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ), the maker of popular snacks like Oreos and Chips Ahoy! is the type of company many consumers will buy products from as an affordable pick-me-up when they may not be able to afford other luxuries in a down economy.', 'Other notable VDC holdings from beyond the top 10 include Hershey, Keurig Dr Pepper (NYSE:KDP), Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST), and Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH). Hershey just reported impressive first-quarter earnings in which it brushed off rising cocoa prices to beat estimates. Its earnings grew 3.7% year-over-year, and revenue increased 8.7%. ', 'As these results show, top consumer staples stocks like these have strong brands and persistent demand to succeed during a challenging macroeconomic environment.', 'In addition to these resilient business models and strong demand, another thing that VDC’s top holdings have in common is their strong Smart Scores.\xa0The Smart Score is a proprietary quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from 1 to 10 based on eight market key factors. A score of 8 or above is equivalent to an Outperform rating.', 'Eight out of VDC’s top 10 holdings have Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores of 8 or above, and VDC itself has an Outperform-equivalent ETF Smart Score of 8 out of 10.', 'Whether it’s Pepsi and Coca-Cola or Altria and Philip Morris, many of VDC’s top holdings are lauded for their long dividend histories, so it’s no surprise that VDC is a dividend payer.', 'VDC currently yields 2.5%. While it’s not a huge dividend yield, it trumps that of the S&P 500 (SPX), which yields 1.4%. Plus, VDC has a reliable track record as a dividend payer, having made dividend payments to its holders for 18 years in a row.', 'Like many of its Vanguard peers, it features a modest expense ratio of just 0.10% (a 0.09% management fee plus 0.01% in other expenses). This means that an investor in the fund will pay just $10 in fees on an investment of $10,000 annually.', 'Over time, investing in low-cost funds like this can save investors a considerable amount of money. Assuming the fund returns 5% per year going forward and maintains its current expense ratio, the investor putting $10,000 into the fund will pay just $128 in fees over a 10-year time frame.', 'How does this help investors to save? Let’s compare VDC to another consumer staples ETF with a higher expense ratio, the iShares U.S. Consumer Staples ETF (NYSEARCA:IYK), which has $1.3 billion in AUM and charges an expense ratio of 0.40%. An investor putting $10,000 into IYK will pay $40 in fees annually, and assuming the same parameters as above, this investor will pay a much higher $505 in fees over a 10-year time horizon, illustrating the considerable savings offered by a low-cost fund like VDC.', 'Below, you can check out a comparison of VDC and IYK using TipRanks’ ETF Comparison Tool, which allows users to compare up to 20 ETFs at a time based on a variety of inputs.', 'Turning to Wall Street, VDC earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 56 Buys, 43 Holds, and six Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average VDC stock price target of $220.16 implies 8.8% upside potential.', 'I’m bullish on consumer staples and VDC in particular. The economy goes through ups and downs, and the stock market ebbs and flows, but consumers always need the basics that consumer staples companies sell, whether it’s their favorite soft drink from Coca-Cola or Pepsi or toothpaste from Colgate-Palmolive. It may not be the sexiest sector, but these companies have strong and consistent earnings and revenue.', 'Throughout earnings season, we’ve seen companies like Coca-Cola, Hershey, Philip Morris, Colgate-Palmolive, and other consumer staples names prove this.', 'I’m also bullish on VDC, specifically because of its holdings’ strong Smart Scores, low expense ratio, and attractive dividend.', 'Disclosure']"

Gentlemen, great to have you both here."", 'Ron Gross: How are you doing, Dylan?', ""Dylan Lewis: We've got fast food brands signaling that consumer is getting a little pickier and also radar stocks. Ron, generally this time of year, our eyes are on earnings, but we do take a peek at the big macro to make sure that we're not missing anything. For a while, the story was rates are going down. We've had a more recent idea of our rates going up. We had comments from Fed Chair Powell this week. We have fresh labor data. What are you seeing with the rate story?"", ""Ron Gross: Two big stories that this week, on Wednesday, the Fed left interest rates unchanged at 5.3% and commented how they were wary about how stubborn inflation was proving to be. They signaled that rates will likely continue to stay higher for longer. That's been the mantra, higher for longer. It is interesting to see how sticky inflation has been. The Fed's preferred inflation index, while down from 7.1 for sure, which is great, still stands at 2.8%, higher than their target of 2%. Now investors did share the fact that Powell said he thought the next policy move was unlikely to be an increase, and the market actually rallied on that. You'll take what you can get, I guess, in this market. Now fast-forward to Friday, jobs report came out solid but much weaker than expected, which in a vacuum would not be so great, but in the context of an environment where you're looking for a soft landing for the economy, it's actually been heralded as a Goldilocks report. Weakness but not too bad. Its economy appears to be slowing. Market rallied significantly on the hopes that now one or potentially two rate cuts would happen this year. We will see."", 'Dylan Lewis: The big macro can, sometimes, be the big metric soup. I appreciate you helping us wade through that one, Ron.', 'Ron Gross: Very good.', ""Dylan Lewis: We have another monster earnings week to run through. That means we're recovering results all the way from A to W, Apple to Wayfair. Jason, let's start at the top of the alphabet shares of Apple, up 6% this week after the company's second fiscal quarter results. Revenue, down slightly year-over-year but came in ahead of expectations along with earnings. It seems a little bit of a wait-and-see quarter for Apple."", ""Jason Moser: It definitely feels that way. They did not knock the cover off the ball here, but the results seem good enough for Wall Street. and like Ron, it's that you take what you can get. To your point, yeah, revenue, down 4%, and they saw products revenue actually down 10%. Now they blamed this partly on timing and a tough comp from a year ago when supply chain bottlenecks were eased up. Take that for what it's worth, but when you look at the segments, we had iPhone revenue down 10%, services revenue was up 14%. Mac was up 4%. iPad, down 17%. Then I thought this was interesting, wearables, home, and accessories was down 10%, so just hoping to keep an eye on there, but China, always a big point of conversation with Apple. China was down again, but Tim Cook noted in the call that the results there are improving from a quarter ago, so they're seeing a reacceleration there in China. It's becoming less bad as what it was before, but we'll have to see how that shakes out because it's become a very competitive market. We know these replacement cycles are only getting longer as these phones continue to get better, and there are a lot of really good phones out there now, particularly when you look in the China market. Conversation about AI, but still nothing really to report there."", ""Dylan Lewis: I think a lot of people have been waiting for Apple's move when it comes to AI, and CEO Tim Cook alluded to give gifts, a little nugget of something saying, we're looking forward to sharing some very exciting things with customers at events later this year. Jason, what would you want to be seeing from Apple?"", ""Jason Moser: I think the idea, at least probably what people are looking for, is for AI to be incorporated somehow into the device. Primarily that would be the phone, I would guess. Again it's a wait-and-see in a lot of regards because I think that one of the problems with AI right now, just in general, is understanding its implications and how we as consumers might use it or how businesses might use it in the form factor that takes. So I appreciate the fact that they're being deliberate and taking their time there, but yeah, they need to bring something to the table because this conversation regarding AI is only growing louder."", ""Ron Gross: I think the Worldwide Developers Conference in June is probably something to keep an eye on where the next big AI announcement would be. Interesting that the stock rallied significantly on this report. It's all about expectations, really, even though there were some weakness here. It was better than expected. Repurchasing $110 billion of stock continues to return a significant amount of capital to investors, shareholders, in addition to their dividend only trading at 25 times forward, but they do have a China problem, so it's going to be interesting to watch."", ""Dylan Lewis: For context, $110 billion of stock is a Boeing or an Airbnb in market cap. Apple is just saying, yeah, sure, we throw off enough cash. That's not going to get in the way of us doing our R&D investments. We can buy that back. We can also raise our dividend 4%. That's fine. We've got all this stuff in spades."", ""Jason Moser: I will say, with the dividend, it tilts me that it's so low."", ""Ron Gross: It's so [inaudible]."", ""Jason Moser: Exactly. I appreciate what they're doing. Slow and steady wins the race. This is 12 consecutive years they've raised the dividend, and credit where credit's due, it requires looking further out in saying, in year '25, this is ultimately going to be a Dividend Aristocrat® and probably more. [The term Dividend Aristocrats® is a registered trademark of Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC.] Man, I'll tell you, share repurchases are fine. I would love to see them make a little bit more of a material boost to that dividend."", 'Ron Gross: Here.', ""Dylan Lewis: They're setting a low hurdle to keep going up every single year on their path to becoming an aristocrat. Ron, Amazon not really needing to wait for growth in the same way that Apple investors are. The machine just continues to churn their revenue up 13% to over 125 billion for the quarter. It seems like an incredibly strong earnings results for the company, especially with its operating income."", ""Ron Gross: Agreed. Record First Quarter sales. As AI, we have to mention AI in every story, we're contractually obligated. AI, the boom, it would just powered growth through their cloud computing unit. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has tried to shift the company to focus more on AI innovation, both in the Amazon platform as well as the Cloud AWS platform. They were significantly behind Microsoft, Google, some others, attempting to make their way back into that space earlier this month. In a letter to shareholders, he laid out his vision for how generative AI could be a critical building block in their next pillar of growth. You had the website. You had Amazon Prime. You have AWS now. What's going to come next? Perhaps it's AI, but we will see. As you noted, the metrics are wonderful. Revenue, up 13%. North America, up 12%. Amazon Web Services, up 17%. Really strong. Net income increased to $10.4 billion, and that includes a $2 billion loss from their Rivian Automotive investment. Theoretically, from an operating perspective, as you mentioned, even higher. Free cash flow came in at $50 billion for the quarter. They're putting up some real good numbers. Their guidance was pretty strong. As well at CapEx, it's going to be pretty high now as they make investments for AI and other things, so we'll keep an eye on what that does to free cash flow. A pretty strong report trading at 38 times, it's not the cheapest stock in the world, but it is Amazon."", 'Dylan Lewis: We were talking dividend just a minute ago with Apple, and I do have to ask because everyone else in big tech is getting on the bandwagon.', 'Jason Moser: [laughs]', 'Dylan Lewis: Jason, do you think that Amazon would ever consider issuing a dividend?', ""Jason Moser: I think one day they probably will, but I think that they also are not going to feel pressured to do so. They're going to do it on their own timeline, and into Ron's point about the investments they're making in Cloud and AI and whatnot, i t's also nice to see that Jassy is very focused on costs as well with business, so they are not just spending money freely, which is very encouraging. I think probably what comes with that is a singular focus on the balance sheet, net cash flow, and making sure they have the capital that they need to make all of those investments. My guess is a dividend would probably follow years down the line, but I could be wrong."", ""Ron Gross: They do need to continue to make sure their cost structure is right. They laid off 27,000 employees, I want to say, last year, and they keep doing it selectively to make sure their overall head count is where they want it to be. That obviously could cruise right down to the bottom line. As they save money, it pops free cash flow up, it creates more money to potentially pay a dividend and buy back stock, make investments. I think they're closer to getting their expense structure correct, certainly more than they were in the past."", ""Dylan Lewis: Coming up after the break, earnings palooza continues with a look at how Medicare is eating into CVS's results. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money."", ""Ricky Mulvey: Ricky Mulvey with Motley Fool Money here to tell you about a vehicle that is redefining sporting luxury, the Range Rover Sport. The first thing I noticed when I sat down in the driver's seat is that I felt like I was in a cockpit. You're up off the ground in a focused interior that promotes exhilarating driver engagement. I also really appreciated the overhead 360-degree camera view that let me know exactly where I was going as I was backing out of the parking space. I went for a drive in the Range Rover Sport out in Littleton, Colorado, tested the accelerator just a little bit, and felt the performance and agility. It's an instinctive drive with engaging on-road dynamics and effortless composure. To put it plainly, the Range Rover Sport is powerful. It's also quiet and comfortable. Advanced cabin technologies such as active noise cancellation and cabin air purification offer new levels of comfort and refinement. The third-generation Range Rover Sport is the most desirable, advanced, and dynamically capable yet. I'd like to invite you to visit landroverusa.com to learn more about the Range Rover Sport."", ""Dylan Lewis: Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis joined in the studio by Ron Gross and Jason Moser. Our earnings rundown continues with a look at CVS, Wayfair, and Coke. Ron, CVS, logging its worst day in about 15 years after reporting earnings this week. Sales up slightly from a year ago but wide losses, in particular, tied to the company's Medicare operations. Walk me through this. This is an in-depth category here."", ""Ron Gross: Yeah. The stock got just murdered. Investors wanted nothing to do with this company as they missed both revenue estimates, and they decreased their guidance. As you said, revenue growth, anemic at 3.7%. The problem with their Medicare unit and their insurance unit, two things. Increased utilization, and that means more money spent on insurance as people continue to seek treatment more and more post-COVID. Everybody put off some elective surgeries. Believe it or not, we're still dealing with that. It seems like COVID has been a while now but not in this case, much higher utilization rates that eats into bottom line. Medicare reimbursement rates, those were cut, and that continues to pressure the company for the remainder of the year and potentially 2025 and forward, but that remains to be seen. They got hit double whammy there. Like Aetna's revenue, for example, was up 25%, but their adjusted operating income fell 60%. They've got some work to do, and CVS is really paying the price for a really big push into Medicare Advantage plans through their Aetna division, and it's coming back to burn them a little bit. They're going to spend time making sure they right-size their balance sheet. They're going to cut costs if they need to. I think all competitors are likely going to need to take similar actions. Even though CVS went hard into Medicare, they are certainly not alone. Earnings, down 33%. Guidance was brought down as well. Stock is only trading for seven times forward guidance, intriguing, but I would be careful."", 'Dylan Lewis: Starting to look a little interesting?', 'Ron Gross: Seven times.', ""Dylan Lewis: This is a company that is very different than the CVS of about five years ago, with the focus on health, with the focus on insurance, the Medicare exposure. A lot of that has happened under CEO Karen Lynch's guidance. Is she on the hot seat?"", ""Ron Gross: I would think for sure. She used to run Aetna, so the fact that CVS has moved big into Aetna-based products, probably not surprising, but that could be a mistake into 2025. We'll have to keep an eye on it but hot seat for sure."", ""Dylan Lewis: Much more favorable reaction to Wayfair's results. Shares, up 20% this week. Jason, I'm probably part of the reason why their sale story is doing OK. Two new kitchen stools and a mirror in my house. Revenue was down slightly but ahead of expectations. I'm glad I could do what I can now."", 'Jason Moser: It sounds like Dylan is a happy resident of the Wayborhood, right?', ""Dylan Lewis: They've got just what he needs."", ""Jason Moser: Get used to that one, right, the Wayborhood. That's going to be a big marketing platform for them, big campaign in the next several years, but yeah, like Apple, they didn't knock the cover off the ball by any means, but the results were good enough. Clearly, the market responded very positively to it, and management did paint a picture of better days ahead. Revenue, $2.7 billion is actually down 1.6% from a year ago. When you look at the metrics that really matter for this business, active customers, 22.3 million now, that was up 2.8% from a year ago. Revenue per active customer actually fell 2.8%, and orders per customer remained relatively flat. Any one of the key metrics we've always kept an eye on with Wayfair is that repeat customer business because acquiring those customers is expensive, so when you get them, you want to keep them. We've seen this metric really perform over time. Now repeat customers placed 80.5% of total orders delivered in the quarter, that was versus 79.1% a year ago, so that number continues to move in the right direction as well. I think that this is a business that, over the last three years, they, like many of these e-commerce businesses, went just through some really very difficult to support growth. A lot of that growth was pulled forward. They're normalizing now, still working toward sustainable profitability, but you keyed in on it there at the very beginning. We're all using it in one way or another. If you have a home or if you rent a place, they've got everything, so it's a nice place to be able to go look and find stuff that you need, unless you're a true Amazon loyalist, I guess."", ""Dylan Lewis: [laughs] I'm going to take some cues here from the key business metrics and, I think, paint a little bit of a picture with the consumer and the story there. Their active customers, as you highlighted, going up, but the spend per customer on average, going down. I feel like that is a sign of something we're going to continue to see this earning season with other companies."", ""Jason Moser: I agree. It feels like we're seeing that type of behavior across the spectrum of businesses, particularly in things like retail and restaurants and whatnot, but we're just seeing a lot of signs with a lot of these reports that, while there is some growth there, it's very clear that the consumer is stretched and starting to make concessions and deliberate and postpone purchasing. Now with that said, I think one thing they noted on the call was very encouraging. They said for the first time since 2019, they're seeing their suppliers starting to introduce large groups of new products into their catalogs as they try to build momentum for this recovery going beyond this year, so that's encouraging. With Wayfair, it's ultimately a network. They're not holding all of that in inventory, but they're connecting suppliers to customers, and to see those suppliers introducing a lot of new stuff, that's a good thing, and when the consumers start to feel a little bit better, Wayfair likely is going to get a few of those dollars."", ""Dylan Lewis: Jason, I know this is a company you've followed for quite some time, going back pre-pandemic. We're seeing this business normalize a little bit. Do you see a return-to-growth story here for them?"", ""Jason Moser: I do to an extent. I think it's a very competitive market to be sure. You look at Amazon. They're the most obvious competitor that really is a threat to a business like this, but they've done a very good job through the years of maintaining the narrative, investing for growth. They're not worried about that profitability and cash flow right now because they feel they're building this network out, and the market opportunity is just so big, and they continue to grow that international business out. It does feel like there's another leg up to go here."", ""Dylan Lewis: More stools and mirrors in my future, it turns out. We're going to wrap this earnings rundown with a look at Coke. Revenue coming in a little bit ahead of expectations, up 3% year-over-year. Ron, when you look at the results from the company, maybe not quite as subject to some of the consumer whims because they are on the lower-priced end, but what did you see?"", ""Ron Gross: The two main things were anemic volume growth of only 1%. You really would like to see that be stronger, but the report was relatively strong and that's because of a 13% price increase across their product line. It's the age-old story of why Warren Buffett has always said he liked Coke besides his addiction to Cherry Coke. It's because of the pricing power, and they have that ability to continually raise prices over time. They attributed about half of the price increase to inflation, the other half was to keep pace with competitors, but for the most part, consumers accepted it. They are seeing inflation decelerate. Corn syrup, sugar, aluminum cans are coming down, so pricing will probably moderate as the year progresses. Net revenue, only up 3%, if we remove currency, up 11%, a little bit better than that. Adjusted earnings per share, up 7%. That's what Coke does. Coke's going to really knock it out of the park, but they've got to continue to come up with new entries into the marketplace. They have this new Happy Tears Zero Sugar you may have heard about sold exclusively on social media. I don't know, I don't get it, but they upped their guidance by 4-5% expected EPS growth. Again it's Coca-Cola. It trades at 22 times guidance. Pepsi's at 21 times guidance, right in line there."", 'Dylan Lewis: You really came out swinging there, Ron. Anemic growth.', ""Ron Gross: I don't know, I don't get it. When it comes to the social media, I absolutely love the spice."", 'Jason Moser: You need to get more salty snacks in that portfolio.', ""Dylan Lewis: Up next, the numbers just keep coming in. We've got details on Starbucks' 15% drop this week and updates on two major fast-food chains. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money."", ""Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis, joined again in the studio by Ron Gross and Jason Moser. We've got earnings from three of the biggest food chains in the world this week, Starbucks, McDonald's, and Domino's, slightly different outlooks across all of them. Jason, I want to start with Starbucks. Shares down 15% and this is not something that we see all that often with a company like Starbucks. There seemed to be a lot of concerns and not a lot of inspiration in the results that we saw from the company. Also, not a lot of inspiration, the commentary from management after the results."", ""Jason Moser: I think you could say that again. These were not good numbers clearly, and we'll get to that in a second, but I think see CEO Laxman Narasimhan seemed very caught on the defensive, whether it was the earnings call or whether it was interviews that he was offering financial media. I don't want to say detached from reality, but it just didn't seem like he really had a focus on what the real problems were. He kept on throwing around a lot of catchphrases and buzzwords, and there were some assigning of blame to the customer and whatnot. It just I don't know. To me, he really has work cut out for him, but I think even more so, to me, the drumbeat is only going to grow louder. He's been there for a year now. Stock is down 35% under his watch. This is Starbucks. That's a big move. It's only going to get louder. We're going to start hearing the question, is he the man for the job, and that's a really fair question, I think, at this point. Particularly after this report, revenue was down 1%. Global comps, down 4%. They saw particular weakness in China. That was down 11%. They noted that in this very competitive market that there are plenty of options there in the Chinese market. They don't have unlimited pricing power there. They do continue to open stores, so there is room to grow there and room to succeed, but they've run into a little bit of a buzzsaw there. You saw operating margin, down 140 basis points, earnings-per-share, down 7%, and I think really what got the market worked up, this guide down was significant. They were calling for earnings-per-share growth in that 15-20% range earlier. Now that's been whittled down to just flat to low single digits. That's a big deal, and so the market's reaction, I think, was absolutely right. Now the good news is, I think, a lot of this is very fixable. These are fixable problems. Much like Disney's got an Iger problem, Starbucks seems to still have a Schultz problem, and that is not going to be going away anytime soon."", ""Dylan Lewis: The results weren't particularly strong, and I don't think the picture is going to get that much better that quickly. Management did identify three different execution opportunities, they call them, for getting back on track, particularly in the United States."", 'Jason Moser: This is separate from the triple shot with two pumps win.', 'Dylan Lewis: This is a separate.', ""Jason Moser: Now, see, I'm already confused."", ""Dylan Lewis: Cringy. The first they identified was meeting demand across dayparts to drive future growth, so essentially meeting the demand of people who are coming into the store because it seems like, especially during some of their more peak hours, they're actually supply constrained with what they're able to give consumers."", ""Jason Moser: Yeah. If you are waking up in the morning, and Starbucks is a part of your routine, and it is for a lot of people, that is one of the peak traffic parts of the day for them, and then they noted in the call, people will go on there to the app, put an order together, and then see how long that order is going to take to fulfill, and they bag it, and they go somewhere else. That's just unacceptable, right? We've seen restaurants that have to deal with those throughput issues. The one that stands out is Chipotle. Do you remember back in the day, you knew if you went to Chipotle at lunchtime, you were waiting in the line starting outside, but it was almost like magic how quickly they got you through that line. Starbucks needs a little Chipotle right now, if they want to fix that throughput, and that to me, I think, is a key issue that needs to have 100% of their focus."", ""Ron Gross: This is a little Wall Street-y and not company-focused, but the reason that the stock got slammed so much is because the investment community was so taken by surprise about how weak the numbers were. I saw some comments from analysts who were, like, they were stunned and they've got to improve communication. They don't have to, but they should improve communications, so investors have a better understanding. I don't know how they missed it so bad. They could have pre-announced. They could have updated guidance. I'm happy to see that they brought guide down significantly for this quarter. At least it's better communication. Rip the Band-Aid off now, better than later."", ""Jason Moser: Maybe they can improve, right? Maybe that guide down is sandbagging. We won't know until we get there. You made a good point there, I think, in regard to the pre-announce. We've seen pre-announcements all the time, and whatever the reaction is, if they pre-announced this four weeks ago, probably the market has a very similar reaction. Wouldn't you say? Assuming they pre-announced four weeks ago, then there's some time there to digest, to get through it, put together some communication, and again how you're going to solve these problems. It does feel like a pre-announcement would've been apropos in this case."", ""Ron Gross: As you say, they would've taken the hit, maybe not as badly back then, but it's better to see a company being proactive and communicative than not, and so even if you're going to take the hit, be upfront. Let us know how the business is doing, the shareholders are the owners of the company, and just don't play it so close to the vest."", ""Dylan Lewis: Jason, after this decline, post-earnings shares are down around a level that has only really happened a couple of times over the last five years for this business. Generally, when they've fallen down to this level, they haven't stayed there very long. We've seen them rebound pretty quickly. When you see Starbucks at this point in time and the challenges that they currently face, are you interested, or are you sitting on the sidelines?"", ""Jason Moser: I'm getting interested. I'm a shareholder in Starbucks today, thankfully to much lower cost basis, so it's still working out OK. It's a retirement portfolio holding. I own it primarily for the dividend income, and so when they start to see this, I do start to get interested. Now the flip side to that, I think things are going to get worse before they get better. I am not convinced that Laxman is the man for the job, and this quarter really reinforced that. Again I think the drumbeat is going to continue to grow louder in regard to that. He said they didn't pre-announce because they were focused on putting together their game plan or an action plan. You can do both. You're getting paid an awful lot of money to do this job. It didn't seem like it's that difficult of a hurdle, but to me, I think patience probably works out well here. It does feel like it might get worse before it gets better because they are noting as most everyone else is the stretch consumer, right? They can't keep on raising prices to the moon, so they're going to run into a little bit of a wall there."", ""Dylan Lewis: We're going to stick with food and look at results from Domino's. Ron, going through all of this, I am not seeing all of the same stretched consumer elements quite showing up in the numbers for Domino's. It seems like they've been able to weather this environment a little bit better than Starbucks."", ""Ron Gross: They're mediocre pizza is reasonably priced, [laughs] and that appeals to quite a number of people, including my son from time to time who was born in New York and his dad is from New York, and we just deal with it."", ""Jason Moser: It's the throughput, and they get you this stuff quickly."", ""Ron Gross: Let's look at the stock up 30% this year, up 50% over the last year, and this report was pretty strong, thanks to promotions and marketing. That actually paid off. That doesn't always, but the spend paid off. They revamped their loyalty program. They're advertising on Uber Eats. Delivery and pickup orders, both increasing. We saw their network sales, though it's mostly a franchise business, but their total network sales, up 7%. Their revenue were up 6%. US same-store sales growth up 5.6%. Higher numbers of carry-out and delivery orders across all income groups. The income group part is interesting. They started to work with Uber Eats back in 2023, and it was because they wanted to reach wealthier households who are willing to pay a delivery fee and use a program like Uber Eats to improve sales in that channel. They are making nice headway. They expect Uber sales to reach 3% of total sales by the end of the year. That's an addition to the revamp loyalty program, 33 million-plus active members, more than 2 million of whom joined since the relaunch in September. Margins are up. Net income, up 20%. They're launching a New York style pizza, Dylan."", 'Dylan Lewis: Hey.', ""Ron Gross: I don't know, we'll see, but long-term clients, they're sticking to their long-term hungry for more plan, I think, which is pretty good, 31 times forward earnings, something like Chipotle at 54, something like McDonald's at 22."", ""Dylan Lewis: I will note, as someone who grew up in New Jersey, spent my time going into New York every now and then, I will occasionally get Domino's Pizza. It is not my favorite, Ron, but it exists in a class of its own. It is not pizza in the conventional sense. You just have to say, I'm having Domino's."", ""Ron Gross: I've been a recommender of this stock for a long time as we have been at the Fool from time to time, and they provide a product that people want."", ""Dylan Lewis: We'll stick with a product that people want, and maybe a different idea of burger. Looking at results from McDonald's, not so much fanfare with their earnings results, Jason. It seems there are though some similar threads showing up in McDonald's earnings and the commentary around it that we've been seeing with Domino's and with Starbucks."", ""Jason Moser: It was a fairly benign quarter but definitely fell in line with the theme that we're seeing more widely across the industry. The consumer getting stretched, making concessions, starting to focus a little bit more on value. The good news for McDonald's is that's the play. It's a value play. They are focused on value, which is something that Starbucks can't necessarily claim, and so even when it gets difficult for McDonald's, they still have that to fall back on. Like I said, a relatively benign quarter, global comps were up 2%, but they did grow operating income 8%, which is encouraging, and they saw earnings-per-share growth of 2%. Nothing to write home about, but it was the 13th consecutive quarter of positive comp sales growth, and they are continuing to focus on opening stores. McDonald's is everywhere, but this is amazing to think about. They're targeting 50,000 restaurants by the end of 2027 from just over 40,000 today. They still feel they've got a long [inaudible]"", 'Ron Gross: Where are they going?', ""Jason Moser: I know, and Ron, you'll have one in your garage. I think that's a fair question because Starbucks is doing the same thing. They're targeting opening up thousands of new stores as well, and you start going back to that Onion headline of A Starbucks Inside Of The Starbucks' Bathroom or something like that. You just saturate the market at some point, and you can't open stores forever, but they did just open their 6,000th store in China. They see that opportunity, still with plenty of runway there. I think when you look at it from a global perspective, and you look at this as a value proposition. They're, I guess you'd say, in the right place at the right time. It's not a stock that's going to double over the course of the next five years probably, but again, you probably own this one because of the income, because of the dividend, and it feels like they're doing a good job with the difficult conditions."", ""Dylan Lewis: Jason, you were talking about how McDonald's, being a value provider, plays very well right now with the market and with a pinched consumer. It's really interesting to me as we process results from all of the different restaurant fast-food, quick-serve, fast-casual brands because we had results from Chipotle that were absolutely stellar earlier in this earnings season. They are, I'd say, more in the upper middle-class as a standard customer, and then we see Starbucks in the middle getting waxed because they are both appealing to a value audience, appealing to not-so-much-of-a-value audience and seemingly having a harder time operating this environment."", ""Jason Moser: I think what Chipotle has done so well over the course of time is just basically remaining true to what they are. Along the way, they fiddled around with different concepts and maybe were going to try to open a pizza joint or burger joint, and they quickly realized that wasn't really a very good idea, but I will say that ShopHouse restaurant, I really wish they'd pursued that one, but they didn't. It does feel Chipotle has just remain true to what they do so well. When you look at Starbucks today versus the Starbucks that we knew 20 years ago, they're selling more cold beverages now, and that's different. It's not necessarily just coffee anymore. What comes with all of those cold beverages? A lot of different ingredients, a lot of management which breeds a lot of mismanagement, very difficult supply chain to manage there. We always make fun of them because they just have never nailed the food part right on Starbucks. I think that the juxtaposition there is interesting because you've got one business in Chipotle. They continue to do what they know how to do so well. It feels like Starbucks is a little bit aimless these days, and the market is making it pay the price for it."", ""Ron Gross: When I think of a company that does what they do so well, I think of a Chick-fil-A. Chick-fil-A knows what they're doing from a throughput, from a food perspective. I think, Cava, although it's in its infancy, could end up being like that as well, but you have to know who you are, and you have to know who your consumers are, and you have to deliver the quality product at the right price point. Not the easiest thing to do. Restaurants are notoriously tough things to run and tough things to invest in, but those that do it right, it really pays off."", ""Dylan Lewis: Coming up after the break, we've got stocks on our Radar. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money."", ""As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about, and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell anything based solely on what you hear. I'm Dylan Lewis, joined in the studio by Ron Gross and Jason Moser. This weekend is Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting up in Omaha, Nebraska. Gentlemen, as we tape here on Friday we're a day away from the Woodstock of Capitalism. Ron, what are you looking for this year in Berkshire's annual meeting?"", ""Ron Gross: It's the first one without Charlie Munger, so there's certainly going to be a lot of emotion in the room. It'll just be interesting to see how Mr. Buffett handles that, but I'm interested to hear, of course, about the health of the various businesses, what their plans are for stock buybacks. Shares are probably around two times tangible book value right now. It might be a little pricey for Warren, but if they're not going to find any huge acquisitions as they continue to struggle with, I'd like to see them continue to purchase stock back in a pretty meaningful way. It's always an interesting time to see what they're doing over there."", 'Dylan Lewis: Of course, be looking for the quotes. The quotes as well. Jason, what about you?', ""Jason Moser: I think with Berkshire, for me, especially with all of this dividend target, it comes back down to, at some point, are we going to see this company pay a dividend? It seems like now might be just an ideal time to do it. Buffett said here I think here recently that Berkshire is not set up to be some company that just presents these out-sized returns going forward, understandable. It's a big company, a lot of things going on. We know he likes dividends, Dylan. He loves it."", ""Dylan Lewis: He gobbles them up, and he doesn't want to pay them out."", ""Jason Moser: If we're looking at this new growth profile for Berkshire, at least according to his projections, I wonder if maybe now isn't a good time to consider a rewarding shareholders with a dividend policy because, obviously, he's not going to be there forever. You wonder if that's something where he wouldn't like to leave that as part of his legacy."", ""Dylan Lewis: Let's get over to stocks on our radar. Our man behind-the-glass, Dan Boyd, is going to hit you with a question. Ron, you're up first. What are you looking at this week?"", ""Ron Gross: I'm taking a look at Wingstop, W-I-N-G, a company I've never owned, but I have contributed to their sales quite a bit. Shares are up 75% over the last year, 450% over the last five years. We do like our wings. Obviously, they're a wing restaurant, 2300 restaurants systemwide. They're going to grow those well over 3,000. The numbers are very impressive: 34% increase in revenue, 66% in earnings per share. Hundred times forward earnings. I got to dig in a little bit more there. Their wings are good, but they're not that good."", ""Dylan Lewis: Wow, but I love that you're bringing it to us, Ron. Dan, a question about Wingstop."", ""Dan Boyd: Not really a question, more of a quick story. During the Super Bowl this year, I had to run out to the store to get something, and I drove past a Wingstop. I got to tell you, it is standing room only in there at halftime on the Super Bowl. When you'd think that people will be getting them delivered or already have eaten them, I've never had it, there's something going on over there."", ""Ron Gross: Digital sales, 68% of sales in Q1, so lots of people on their phones, but also a lot of people in the stores say I'm a wing snob ever since I got that trigger. I only like to make wings at home anymore."", ""Dylan Lewis: I will say, of the ones that you can go out and get, Wingstop is one of my favorites. A lot of the chains are doing very well. They do a pretty good job. Jason, what's on your radar this week?"", ""Jason Moser: Taking a look, a little bit of a closer look at CrowdStrike, ticker CRWD, I think several weeks back I had a call that Palo Alto Networks as a radar stock. When you look at cybersecurity, few market opportunities really offer the scale and the mission-critical nature that cybersecurity offers. It's an attractive market from that perspective, but it's a difficult one to understand. I am certainly no expert in the matter, and I've always felt maybe just investing in a cybersecurity ETF might be the better way to go, but it also feels maybe we get some winners in the space here, and CrowdStrike seems to be one. This Falcon platform that they have offers 27 modules for its customers to be able to use what they feel is necessary, and then they continue to add on modules. We've seen over time. Those customers that have been with them for longer periods of time, they do. They keep adding those modules all along the way. Twenty-nine thousand subscription customers worldwide. You've got a revenue that's grown about 65% over the last five years annually."", 'Dylan Lewis: Dan, a question about CrowdStrike.', ""Dan Boyd: Before we got on for this segment, I was, like, is it Cloudflare or CrowdStrike? There's just so many of these big cybersecurity companies, and they're all faceless."", ""Dylan Lewis: You know, Dan, it sounds like you might be a better fit for the ETF, and you got to be honest. Dan, which one's going on your watch list as well?"", ""Dan Boyd: Even though I do love a good ETF, I'm going to go Wingstop this time around. [laughs]"", ""Dylan Lewis: I love it.

As of 10:20 a.m. ET on Monday, Coca-Cola Consolidated stock was up almost 16%.', ""As far as growth goes, Coca-Cola Consolidated doesn't really have any. Its first-quarter volume was down less than 1% year over year. And with slightly higher prices, its net sales rose 1%."", ""Regarding profitability, there was improvement in the company's first quarter. Its operating margin was 13.1% in the prior-year period, but it improved to 13.5% in the first quarter. That's good but hardly worthy of a massive 16% jump for the stock."", ""The real surprise today was Coca-Cola Consolidated's announcement of a plan to repurchase up to $3.1 billion of its stock. For perspective, the company had a market cap of $8 billion before the announcement. Therefore, its buyback plan represented nearly 40% of the company, which is unheard of."", ""Buying back this much stock would greatly increase earnings per share (EPS). And that's why the stock was up even though growth is quite modest."", ""Coca-Cola Consolidated doesn't have $3.1 billion just lying around, but management says that now is the right time to take on debt to reward shareholders."", 'In 2023, the company achieved more cash than debt for the first time in 40 years — a point that management made sure to highlight. Many companies, including Apple, have grown shareholder value by taking on debt. But for Coca-Cola Consolidated, it seems like taking on debt is a change from what management was prioritizing in recent years.', ""That said, at its size, the company could struggle to find avenues for growth, as evidenced by the quarter's results. Therefore, growing its EPS will also be hard, and EPS growth often drives stock performance. With this in mind, reducing its share count might be the company's best option for growing EPS at this point, so the move is understandable."", 'Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola Consolidated, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola Consolidated wasn’t one of them.

The Fed maintained the federal funds rate at 5.25% to 5.5% and said that while the economic activity has been solid, with robust consumer spending and job gains, inflation remains a concern. The unemployment rate remains low at 3.8%, but the GDP growth moderated from 3.4% in the fourth quarter of 2023 to 1.6% in the first quarter of 2024. The market remained strong after the Fed meeting as the S&P 500 was 2.21% higher between May 1 and May 3 market close."", 'Billionaire Leon Cooperman of Omega Advisors believes that the current US debt levels could be too high to manage. He expressed concern about the growing debt crisis in the United States in a CNBC interview on April 23, adding that leadership has failed to address it effectively. Cooperman referenced past endorsements of the Simpson-Bowles report by political figures like Mitt Romney and Senator Joe Manchin, emphasizing that the problem has only worsened since then. He believes that deficits do matter and warns that the country is heading towards a financial crisis due to the lack of action on this issue.', ""The Simpson-Bowles report refers to the recommendations put forward by the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform in 2010 to address the United States' fiscal challenges. The growing debt problem was one of the main concerns of the commission, and their report proposed a comprehensive set of measures to reduce the deficit through a combination of spending cuts, tax reforms, and changes to entitlement programs."", 'If we take Leon Cooperman’s warnings into consideration, investors are more likely to favor defensive sectors like consumer defensive, health care, and utilities. Major companies from these sectors thrived during the financial crisis of 2007-2009. During that crisis, the S&P 500 lost over 56% of its value. On the other hand, between the start of 2007 and the end of 2009, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) share price gained nearly 13%.

Furthermore, the company has been increasing its dividends for 52 years and has a dividend yield of 1.39%, as of May 3. At its latest earnings call, Walmart Inc.’s (NYSE:WMT) CEO, Doug McMillon made the following comments:', '“We were strong in the U.S., Mexico, Canada, and India, where we had the best Big Billion Days ever, and we continued the strong performance in China with the start of Chinese New Year. Typically, we see some of our customer experience scores dip during the high-volume hours and days we experience during the holidays. But during Q4, the Walmart U.S. team delivered three-year high customer scores in our stores for pickup and delivery from stores and for those orders that flow directly from our e-commerce fulfillment centers.', ""I'm excited about the omnichannel net promoter score trends the team is driving. Across countries, we continue to see a customer that's resilient but looking for value. As always, we're working hard to deliver that for them, including through our rollbacks on food pricing in Walmart U.S. Those were up significantly in Q4 versus last year, following a big increase in Q3.”"", 'While Abbott Laboratories’ (NYSE:ABT) revenue declined in 2023, it still grew at a CAGR of 5.6% over the last 5 years. Additionally, the company’s stock price resilience isn’t the only thing that makes it a good buy during a financial crisis, it is also a magnificent dividend growth stock. Similar to Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), the company has raised its dividend for the 52nd consecutive year. As of May 3, the company has a dividend yield of 2.08%.

Each of these companies is durable and available at attractive valuations, in our view, for the growth we see ahead. In fact, in the case of ThermoFisher, Nike, and Abbott Labs, we expect accelerating earnings growth in the back half of 2024 after more difficult earnings growth periods pass for each of these companies. ThermoFisher and Abbott will finally wind down most of their COVID-19 testing and vaccine-related efforts due to a lack of demand, so these should no longer be revenue growth headwinds.”', 'While analysts keep mixed views on the economy, investors can look toward the companies with consistent top-line growth regardless of the economic conditions.

Bard (the company’s model preceding Gemini) was previously ranked by analysts as the best AI tool for stock picking, even outperforming human stock pickers a test run. However, Gemini has become far more conservative over the months. It is a challenge to elicit any\xa0kind of\xa0stock recommendations now.\xa0Thankfully, you can still coax\xa0out\xa0some picks if you twiddle around\xa0for\xa0long enough.', 'There is still value in examining such AI stock predictions. These predictions provide perspective and predictive capability beyond what most human analysts can match.\xa0You still should approach\xa0Gemini’s recommendations as an additional data point rather than a definitive forecast. That said, here are three stocks that Gemini seems bullish on right now.', 'Source: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.com', 'Gemini: “As a leading appliance manufacturer, Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR) has a solid market position and a history of profitability. The stock has been trading at a relatively low valuation, potentially offering an opportunity for value investors.”', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'I agree with Gemini and think that the market may have gone too far with Whirlpool’s selloff. Currently, WHR stock is down nearly 62% from its highs and is going back towards its COVID trough. These levels are very enticing. The stock definitely looks risky if you are looking at the short term, but buying WHR stock now will likely yield significant returns if you hold for many years.', 'You should keep in mind that Whirlpool is quite a cyclical business. Interest rates have a big impact on the company. That’s mostly why the company’s stock has been plunging even after it beat earnings and revenue estimates in Q1. Whirlpool reported earnings per share of $1.78. This was above the analyst estimates of $1.61. Additionally, the company reported revenue of $4.49 billion, which was 1.58% better than the analyst estimate for revenue of $4.4 billion.', 'Moving forward, I expect that the stock will likely bottom out soon and climb higher.

With the continued growth of e-commerce, Shopify’s (NYSE:SHOP) platform is well-positioned for further expansion.”', 'Gemini’s explanation about why Shopify is well-positioned for growth is quite oversimplified, but is still true. E-commerce is the future and will continue to grow fast. There are lots of competitors in this space, but Shopify has significant advantages in how it operates.', 'First, what makes Shopify unique is that it is an e-commerce platform. That means that businesses can have their\xa0own\xa0standalone store using the platform.

Paying 71-times earnings and 11-times sales for that growth is certainly expensive, but it still leaves room for upside in the coming years.', 'Source: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com', 'Gemini: “This company provides content delivery network services, cybersecurity solutions, and other cloud-based tools.

Back then, the stock was seen as very expensive, and rightfully so.\xa0In fact,\xa0it currently trades around 154-times forward earnings and 18.4-times forward sales. This is much more expensive than it was back then, and I believe it can go even higher from here.', 'I am a strong believer in fundamentals, but sometimes it pays to be flexible. Cloudflare has an unusual monopoly in the cybersecurity sector, especially when it comes to small and medium businesses. You may have likely come across a Cloudflare captcha or seen a few Cloudflare messages while browsing.

With that, please turn to Slide 4, and let me hand the call over to Jeff."", 'Jeffrey Walker Martin', ""Thank you, Glen, and thank you all for joining us today. We're pleased to report our first quarter financial results. It's a great start to the year and sets us up well to provide strong financial performance for 2024. In addition to the strength of our financial performance, the market backdrop for energy infrastructure continues to be very constructive. We're seeing strong macroeconomic fundamentals supporting U.S. energy demand, with the economy continuing to grow at a steady pace, with manufacturing production gains, easing of supply chain constraints, and continued job creation. We previously discussed the view that our industry is experiencing a super cycle of growth and believe Sempra's strategy and portfolio are well positioned to benefit from current trends. In addition to the long-term demand from reshoring and electrification of transportation, artificial intelligence and data centers are driving new growth in digital infrastructure with demand estimates tripling from 2.5% of total U.S. electric consumption to 7.5% by 2030. Growth in Texas is also particularly remarkable with ERCOT recently raising its forecasted peak demand by the end of the decade to over 150 gigawatts. Of note, that's 65 gigawatts higher than the all-time record in the state. Against the backdrop of strong industry fundamentals, Sempra offers several competitive advantages: First, in California, we're at the forefront of the energy transition, serving 25 million consumers in the country's largest economy and one of the largest manufacturing bases in the U.S. And through our general rate cases, we're expecting to make new investments that support electrification and decarbonization while also improving affordability, safety, and reliability. Turning to Texas, we're seeing diverse industrial, C&I and residential growth, which is creating jobs, increase in electricity demand and requiring significant investments to modernize and expand the electricity grid. With economic expansion, the safety and resilience of the grid becomes even more critical, and in part, that's why Oncor's recently filed system resiliency plan is both timely and important. Allen will speak to this in greater detail later in today's presentation. And finally, at Sempra Infrastructure, we're supporting global demand for energy security are in the midst of a second wave of LNG developments expected to support over 700 million tonnes per annum of demand by 2050. Our dual-coast LNG strategy is contributing to this push with approximately 16 million tonnes per annum of new export capacity currently under construction, which would more than double our existing LNG operating footprint. The key takeaway is we're excited about the opportunities ahead as Sempra Infrastructure looks to provide cleaner and more reliable sources of energy to its customers while charting a course for attractive built-in growth through the end of the decade. It's also important to note that Sempra Infrastructure's growth forecasts are based solely on projects that have reached FID and are under construction and doesn't yet include expected upside from a series of other projects still in development. Turning now to our financial results. We reported first quarter 2024 adjusted EPS of $1.34. In addition, we're pleased to also affirm our full year 2024 adjusted EPS guidance range of $4.60 to $4.90 and 2025 EPS guidance of $4.90 to $5.25. As a reminder, when you look at our adjusted EPS guidance range from 2023 to 2025, it reflects approximately 7% annual growth, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth expectations of 6% to 8%. Please turn to the next slide where I'll turn the call over to Karen to provide several business updates."", 'Karen L. Sedgwick', ""Thank you, Jeff. We've previously said that 2024 will be an important year of execution at each of our growth platforms, and I'm excited to provide an update on our progress. At Sempra California, we continue to see constructive regulatory outcomes. In March, the CPUC issued a proposed decision supporting the updated return on equity that was implemented this year as part of the CCM trigger. The commission agreed that the current cost of capital mechanism operated as designed, and the recently established returns on equity at SDG&E of 10.65% and at SoCalGas of 10.5% should remain in place through 2025 unless market conditions result in a trigger. Importantly, this improves regulatory certainty by affirming the protection that the CCM provides to customers and shareholders. And the key takeaway is that this is another constructive data point for California's regulatory framework. Another example of this is rate reform. Improving affordability for all of our utility customers is a top priority. And I'm pleased to share that a proposed decision was issued at the CPUC in March to implement a fixed charge for residential electric customers. As currently proposed, this will reduce volumetric rates, support a more fair rate structure, and help California meet its clean energy goals. A final decision is expected in the second quarter of 2024, and the fixed charge would then be expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2025. During the quarter, we also made a joint filing with the other California utilities to develop projects that successfully demonstrate blending hydrogen into the natural gas system. These projects will begin blending at up to 5% on isolated sections of the natural gas system and incrementally increase the hydrogen concentration based on safety and technical feasibility. Hydrogen blending has been demonstrated safely and reliably around the world for decades. And we look forward to working with our partners to support new and improved ways to expand decarbonization efforts here in the state. Turning to the GRC. We expect a proposed decision in the second quarter and a final decision this year. Once the final decision is obtained, it will be retroactive to the beginning of the year. As a reminder, after we receive a final decision, we will have a clear regulatory pathway for execution on our utility-focused capital plan through 2027. Lastly, CAISO updated SDG&E that it was not selected to move forward on the Imperial Valley transmission line and substation. It's important to note that we were financially disciplined in how we developed our bid, and we look forward to supporting the project's successful development as well as building the other transmission projects that were directly awarded to SDG&E by CAISO. Turning to Texas, we continue to see significant growth across Oncor's service territory. Just last month, ERCOT issued an updated transmission planning report, forecasting approximately 40% higher load in 2030 than in last year's report. And yesterday, Oncor made its inaugural SRP filing, which includes approximately $3 billion of capital investments. In addition to SRP, the 2023 legislative session was particularly constructive for the state's utilities. We're already seeing the positive impacts at Oncor in terms of the planning and execution that support the state's priorities and improve the timing of the company's returns on capital. Moving to Sempra Infrastructure. We're very excited about the opportunity to help deliver cleaner energy to our customers and partners. Recently, we declared a positive FID at our Cimarrón Wind Expansion project. This project demonstrates our ability to generate attractive returns while utilizing existing company-owned transmission capacity to serve the California market and targeting O&M efficiencies based on locational advantages. Additionally, we're making great progress at ECA LNG Phase 1 and Port Arthur LNG Phase I. ECA is roughly 80% complete and remains on target to start commercial operations in the summer of 2025. Port Arthur also remains on schedule with significant ongoing construction activity, including excellent progress around soil stabilization, new foundations, and the commencement of concrete pouring and structural steel work. Turning to our marketing efforts. The LNG market is long term by nature, and while the DOE pause has received a lot of press, we remain confident in our ability to deliver projects that offer long-term, secure, and cleaner energy to customers. Sempra Infrastructure benefits from experienced project development teams that continue to make progress on critical work streams, including permitting, engineering, and commercial negotiations. Moreover, the referenced pause does not impact our confidence in the overall competitive positioning of our development projects, and we're strategically utilizing this time to steadily advance our opportunities. Also of note, even if you only take into consideration projects that have reached FID, Sempra Infrastructure has incredible built-in growth. With 16 million tonnes per annum of LNG export facilities, associated infrastructure, and a new wind project under construction, we're improving visibility to attractive earnings growth through the end of our planning period in 2028. And that's all before taking into account our development project pipeline, which Jeff referenced earlier and offers notable upside. We can now turn to the next slide where Allen will discuss ERCOT's new planning processes."", 'E. Allen Nye', ""Thank you, Karen. As we have been discussing for several quarters now, Texas continues to experience strong demand growth. Oncor now serves close to 13 million customers and has now surpassed over 4 million meters. ERCOT is adapting to this growth with a recently announced new planning process to account for higher expected electricity needs in the future. In April, ERCOT announced that peak load is expected to reach 152 gigawatts in 2030, nearly double the record set last year of 85 gigawatts. This load growth is coming from a wide range of industries across the state, including new and expanded C&I, electrification of oil and gas operations, data centers, manufacturing, and residential.To put this growth in context, the change from 2023 to 2030 would be like adding load greater than the size of the entire California power market. Currently, we anticipate that approximately 40% of the new load will come from Oncor service territory. So from our perspective, as one of the premier builders of T&D infrastructure in America, we are excited about the opportunity to continue to scale our investments in electric infrastructure. Since 2018, Oncor has constructed approximately 13,000 miles of transmission and distribution lines, approximately 6 miles per day. We have an active planning process underway and are confident in our ability to secure the materials and labor necessary to serve our customers in the ERCOT market.Please turn to the next slide. Given the growth in the state, resiliency is more critical than ever. In 2023, the Texas legislature passed House Bill 2555, which allows electric utilities to file system resiliency plans proposing capital and operational expenditures to improve overall grid resiliency. We made our first filing yesterday for approximately $3 billion of new capital expenditures and just over $500 million of operating expenditures to be made over a period of 3 years. This investment would address overhead and underground system resiliency and modernization, flexible and self-healing distribution system, vegetation management, wildfire mitigation, and cyber and physical security.To provide some additional color, the majority of our proposed spend is in the modernization and hardening of the older parts of our distribution system by adding lightning protection, stronger class poles and cross arms, and addressing capacity constrained parts of the grid during extreme temperatures. Furthermore, we are proposing significant technology and infrastructure investments that will help enable the automated reconfiguration of our system when extreme storms hit, quickly restoring service to customers on undamaged segments by intelligently rerouting power.I would also like to highlight that we have invested in wildfire mitigation for many years, including effectively partnering with industry leaders like SDG&E and the Texas [A&M] Forest Service. Now thanks to HB 2555, Oncor has an additional opportunity to further accelerate our wildfire mitigation strategies across our service territory. We estimate that approximately $900 million of the total proposed spend, including both CapEx and OpEx, will focus on expanding our wildfire mitigation tools and implementing our grid modernization and hardening measures in wildfire-prone areas.Procedurally, the SRP statute provides 180 days for the PUCT to review the filing, and we anticipate having a decision by the end of the year. The SRP program, with approximately $3 billion of capital expenditures if approved, would be incremental to Oncor's $24.2 billion of planned CapEx announced earlier this year for the 5-year period 2024 to 2028. We believe our proposed SRP creates an opportunity to fundamentally improve customer reliability and overall customer service during and after extreme weather events while also helping to mitigate other risks. I will now turn the call back to Karen to walk through Sempra's financial update."", 'Karen L. Sedgwick', ""Thanks, Allen. Earlier today, Sempra reported first quarter 2024 GAAP earnings of $801 million or $1.26 per share. This compares to first quarter 2023 GAAP earnings of $969 million or $1.53 per share. On an adjusted basis, first quarter 2024 earnings were $854 million or $1.34 per share. This compares to our first quarter 2023 earnings of $922 million or $1.46 per share.Please turn to the next slide. Variances in the first quarter 2024 adjusted earnings compared to the same period last year can be summarized as follows: at Sempra California, we had $24 million primarily from higher net interest expense and lower income tax benefits and $12 million of lower CPUC base operating margin, net of operating expenses, offset by higher authorized cost of capital. As a reminder, because our GRC is still pending, our CPUC revenues in first quarter 2024 are still based on 2023 authorized levels. This is important because any true-up later this year will be retroactively applied to January 1 when the final decision is approved.Turning to Sempra Texas. We had $56 million of higher equity earnings attributable to rate updates, increased invested capital, and consumption, partially offset by higher interest and operating expenses. At Sempra Infrastructure, we had $13 million of lower transportation revenues and higher O&M, partially offset by higher power results, and $27 million of lower asset and supply optimization, partially offset by lower net interest expense due to capitalized interest, lower taxes and other. As a note, beginning this year, the waterfall numbers are presented after noncontrolling interest to improve comparability.At Sempra Parent, the $48 million quarter-over-quarter change is primarily due to higher taxes from the interim period application of an annual forecasted consolidated effective tax rate, which is expected to turn around over the course of the year.Please turn to the next slide. Before we close out our prepared remarks, I want to outline Sempra's value proposition as we execute our corporate strategy. At Sempra, our management team is committed to challenging the status quo in all aspects of our business operations. We offer exposure to growth in some of North America's largest economic markets. Our position as a leader in the infrastructure development in these markets translates into a record $48 billion capital campaign through 2028.In addition, we make energy infrastructure investments that target attractive mid-teens returns on equity, and we understand that disciplined capital allocation is central to our success. And we understand the importance of returning capital to our owners and expect to continue growing our dividend. Of note, we've successfully grown our dividend at a rate of roughly 7% annually over the last 10 years. This is particularly noteworthy, given the expected strength of our future earnings growth.To conclude, the role of our industry is becoming increasingly important to society, and at Sempra, we're excited about the prospects ahead of us. Sempra is competitively positioned to capitalize on opportunities, and we'll continue to invest in our people, prudently manage risks, efficiently finance our businesses, and be good stewards of the capital entrusted to us. We thank you for joining us, and I'd now like to open the line for your questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) And our first question will come from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners.', 'Shahriar Pourreza', ""Maybe just starting off on the kind of the incremental upsides that's starting to build versus the 4Q plan, including at SIP and the SRP in Texas. I guess, does the existing financing plan have room to support the spend in '25 through '27? And would you look to maybe utilize some SIP balance sheet capacity to offset potential equity needs from incremental CapEx that we could see coming?"", 'Jeffrey Walker Martin', ""Yes, I appreciate the question. And I think we're in good shape on our balance sheet. I'll remind everyone, Shar, that we have a track record of efficiently financing our growth and that's been a big part of our success, as you know, since 2018. In fact, over the last 5 years, we've been successful at growing our adjusted EPS at roughly a 10% annual growth rate. Our current plan, as you know, contemplates we'll make about $48 million of investments through 2028. We certainly think there's opportunities to continue to grow that plan.But I would also mention that well in advance of announcing our capital plan, Shar, we got our equity needs out of the way last fall. So the key takeaway is we're in great shape with no need for additional equity. We have great visibility to our future growth, and I think you indicated a couple of levers that we have to pull. And we have a plan in place that should allow us to officially finance our growth."", 'Shahriar Pourreza', ""Perfect. So you're comfortable with the balance sheet and if there's incremental CapEx coming? That's helpful, Jeff."", 'Jeffrey Walker Martin', 'Yes, we are.', 'Shahriar Pourreza', 'Perfect. And then just given the cost of capital affirmation in California, I guess, how are you planning maybe to recognize the impacts of the CCM? Is there a customer reinvestment plan? And would you kind of plan to provide an update on the California Utilities earnings after the PD?', 'Jeffrey Walker Martin', ""Yes. I think there's going to be an opportunity as we get through our rate case. You'll recall that we're expecting to have our proposed decision later this quarter and a final decision at the end of the year. And those are the type of issues that we would reconcile on the then next earnings call, which could be as early as Q3 to make sure we provide real clear visibility to the impact of the rate case on our forward earnings."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan Securities.', 'Jeremy Bryan Tonet', 'Turning to Texas, I was just wondering if you could frame this latest ERCOT load growth outlook against the last capital plan raised by Oncor. Is that level of system investment contemplated consistent with this load growth? Or is there even more, I guess, upside down the pipe here? And if so, what time frame do you think that could make it into the plan?', 'Jeffrey Walker Martin', ""Well, it's certainly a great question. Obviously, ERCOT just released their latest information in the last couple of weeks. Allen noted this in his prepared remarks, but it's pretty amazing that you could take the peak demand load in America's largest economic environment, which is California, and the expectation is in Texas that look to grow back much between now and 2030. The key thing that Allen has mentioned before, too, is ERCOT is right in the middle of this growth story, right? So as you think about growth opportunities, we think that between 40% and 50% of that would fall to his service territory. And there's no question that this will be evaluated in the fall as Allen and his team put their plan together."", 'Jeremy Bryan Tonet', ""Got it. That's very helpful there. And then digging again on the SRP a little bit more, I was just wondering if you could kind of bracket what this work will accomplish over the next 3 years relative to overall resiliency needs you see in the system."", 'Jeffrey Walker Martin', ""Yes, let me make a couple of kind of contextual comments, and I'll turn it over to Allen. Just yesterday, they made their inaugural filing. You know from our materials, it's $3 billion over 3 years. And one of the things that we're interested in at Sempra, very much like all the investments that we make across our different growth platforms, this plan is intended to harden our system to withstand extreme weather conditions, reduce restoration outage times and improve overall reliability.I would also note, Jeremy, that the requested capital is incremental to Oncor's existing capital plan. But Allen, what might be helpful, and I think this will go to the heart of this question is, can we just take a step back, talk about your overall $24 billion capital plan? Why the SRP piece is so important? And maybe I'll return to kind of the value proposition to your regulator."", 'E. Allen Nye', ""Yes, sure, Jeff. And thanks for the question, Jeremy. Going back to Jeff's point to our original -- our current 5-year capital plan is presently at $24.2 billion. And that breaks down generally into about $5.1 billion for distribution expansion, about $13.5 billion for transmission expansion, $4.2 billion for maintenance, and about $1.4 billion for technology. And again, as I've said before, that demonstrates about 70% of our capital plan is growth. 97% of our capital plan or more is recoverable through our trackers, and that provides us right now with a very, we think, solid industry-leading rate base CAGR of around 11%.Now obviously, that's before the SRP and whatever the commission ultimately rules on our SRP. We feel -- we're very excited about the plan we filed. I think our team has done a great job in preparing a very strong plan that will have, I think, significant benefits for our customers. And if I can, I can break it down a little more into what we filed. Our SRP is generally broken down into 6 major categories. The first one being overhead and underground resiliency and modernization. That includes things like new and repaired poles, cross arms, lightning protection, increased capacity for high demand days, rehab or replacement of underground conductor. And so in that first category, that's around $1.830 billion in the first category.Our second category is continued optimization of distribution automation. And what we're talking about there is expansion of our distribution automation program through new ties, increased capacity and the addition of intelligence switches. And we have about $510 million in that bucket. The third category is expanded vegetation management or VM. We're going to do that primarily on a bunch of lateral circuits, and we're going to leverage remote sensing capabilities such as satellite and LiDAR to better direct our VM program moving forward through this program. We have about $285 million allotted to expand the VM in this plan.Fourth category is enhancing our cyber risk management. That means all things cyber risk-related mitigation as well as enhancement in security related to Oncor's digital backbone. And we have about $525 million allocated to that category. Fifth, improved physical security. Like all utilities, many around the country, we're facing additional intrusions and risk to our physical assets. And so we have about $80 million allocated in our plan to things such as -- video and event correlation systems to insist law enforcement as well as just general asset protective measures to try and better protect our assets and equipment. And we have about $80 million in that category.Finally, we have about $900 million total in the plan, but about $182 million specifically related to wildfire mitigation measures. And that would include things like strengthening and protection of assets in higher-risk wildfire zones, safe device deployment, advanced wildfire risk modeling, overhead and underground resiliency measures and again, increased distribution, automation in higher wildfire risk areas. And I would say, just lastly on that last piece, that's a continuation of wildfire risk mitigation and prevention that we've had going on for a number of years. But with this additional $900-or-so million that we have allocated to this category in this plan, we think we can make some real headway on that issue as well as the other ones I described."", 'Jeffrey Walker Martin', ""Allen, if you would, maybe as a follow-up, going to kind of the heart of Jeremy's question, I don't want to get in front of your regulator, but could you just kind of define the value proposition that you think that the plan will deliver?"", 'E. Allen Nye', ""Well, sure, Jeff, and I think you said it very well. And I've said on prior calls, I view this and I think we view this as a historic opportunity to really directly take action on our system to the benefit of our customers in the ERCOT market. And I think each one of these categories would provide very specific benefits from resiliency to avoidance and prevention of wildfires to better reliability, all things that will benefit our customers very directly."", 'Jeffrey Walker Martin', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Durgesh Chopra from Evercore ISI.', 'Durgesh Chopra', 'Maybe just can you just figure your thoughts on the pause on the FDA permit and how do you see that progressing?', 'Jeffrey Walker Martin', ""Yes. Thank you for asking me that question, Durgesh. I think I would start by saying that 2 things come to mind. First is, we believe the permitting pause is temporary and that permits will be issued in the future. I mean, many of you followed the comments that were made at the CERAWeek. I think Secretary Granholm has repeatedly now said that she anticipates this issue will be in the rearview mirror at some point early next year.Secondly, I would also remind folks that it only really impacts Port Arthur Phase 2. We already have existing Department of Energy non-FDA permits for Cameron Phase 1, which is in operations, ECA Phase 1, and Port Arthur Phase 1, both of which are in construction as well as Cameron Phase 2, ECA Phase 2, and Vista Pacifico. So this is really something that really impacts directly Port Arthur Phase 2, and we expect to work through that early next year. I would note that Justin's team continues to work diligently to advance Port Arthur Phase 2, which we continue to believe has tremendous commercial value.But I also thought it might be helpful if I return to what we think are probably the most important points around our LNG strategy. We have quality LNG development projects, which obviously include the expansion of Port Arthur. They are geographically advantaged. There's no other developer out there that has the opportunity to directly access Asia and also dispatch into the Atlantic through the Gulf. The next 2 in the queue have the advantage of being brownfield sites. That's another economic advantage for us at Port Arthur Phase 2 as well as Cameron expansion.And we're advancing these projects in a disciplined manner for the benefit of our shareholders. I would also note that they are effectively upside to our current $48 billion capital plan, and they are also upside to our long-term growth rate."", 'Durgesh Chopra', ""Jeff, I appreciate all that color. And I think you did answer my question I was just going to ask you. If there is a time line that we should follow as you think about FID, whether it's Port Arthur Phase 2 or the Cameron expansion."", 'Jeffrey Walker Martin', ""Sure. I would mention 2 things. One is we have guided our expected FID for Cameron expansion to the first half of 2025. We have not yet set an FID expectation for Port Arthur Phase 2. But I can assure you that Justin's team continues to make steady progress. I mean, as you go quarter-over-quarter, we are continuing to make progress and commercially developing both of those projects, and I think the momentum inside of our company continues to build on their overall success."", 'Durgesh Chopra', 'Excellent quarter, guys.', 'Jeffrey Walker Martin', 'Thank you so much.', 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Carly Davenport from Goldman Sachs.', 'Carly S. Davenport', 'Wanted to just go back to the SRP filing. Really appreciate all the detail there so far. Just wanted to get a sense of how we should think about the timing and the cadence of that spend, assuming that the plan sort of goes into effect in the 2025 time frame. And then can you just remind us how procedurally you expect this to play out between now and year-end?', 'Jeffrey Walker Martin', ""Yes. Let me start with the procedural point and then I'll pass it on to Allen to talk about how he expects that capital to go forward. Obviously, they've made the filing yesterday, which was contemplated in the legislative bill that passed last year. The commission has a statutory 180 days to review and approve the filing. So I think for now, we're expecting that to be in hand in the fourth quarter.And then in terms of that rolling out, suspend over 3 years. And maybe, Allen, you can talk about it on a going-forward basis, how you think that capital would lay in, obviously subject to the commission's approval and the final number."", 'E. Allen Nye', ""Yes, you bet, Jeff. Pretty simply, it's basically 2025 through 2027 for those outlays and it's slightly backloaded."", 'Carly S. Davenport', ""Got it, great. And then to follow up just on, you've talked a lot about these robust load growth opportunities in Texas supporting infrastructure investment. Just could you talk a little bit about if there's any sort of supply chain or other constraints that you're running into in terms of executing on that T&D build out at Oncor?"", 'Jeffrey Walker Martin', ""Yes. I said something about this in my prepared remarks. We continue to see some supply chain constraints in some areas, but in general, we're seeing obviously load growth across all of our markets and there's been some relaxation of the supply chain issue. I think Oncor in particular, and both Justin and I serve on their Board of Directors, have done a really good job of going into the marketplace to secure the appropriate contractors and hard goods. But Allen, perhaps you could talk about the work that the team has done. And over what period of time do you feel like you've got what you need locked in?"", 'E. Allen Nye', ""Sure. Yes. Carly, it's a great question. Again, as Jeff said, we at Oncor and our operations and our supply chain people had been working to get in position to be able to execute on this plan for quite a while now. And we've done a number of things, including diversifying our supply chain, adding additional suppliers 5 and 6 years ago that have put us in a position now to while there certainly are issues out there with supply chain, we feel extremely confident in the first 2 years.I've said it to my Board. I think we have the first 2 years effectively in the box with what we need from both an equipment perspective and from a vendor perspective. And we've made very significant progress on the outer 3 years as well. And what we're doing now is filling in the gaps and waiting to assign things out like engineering studies. Those aren't completed yet for the outer years because we wouldn't assign them out until we know exactly what we're facing. But we've managed, I believe, to work through supply chain issues very effectively, and we feel very good about where we are right now."", 'Jeffrey Walker Martin', ""And then, Carly, the only other thing I would add to Allen's comments is think about his base capital plan, which is just over $24 billion, is really organized around growth. And specifically, it is weighted toward transmission. So roughly 60% of that spend is transmission. And I think that's why this SRP filing is so important. It really creates a second leg of growth specifically around building in redundancy and resiliency in the system, which is equally important to the state of Texas."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe.', 'Steven Isaac Fleishman', ""Just one question. Just I think Conoco might have said they have interest in selling down a stake in Port Arthur, but I did not see it myself so I'd just be curious what you're hearing from them."", 'Jeffrey Walker Martin', ""Yes, I'll make a couple of comments here. One is, Steve, Conoco is a very important strategic partner for us at Port Arthur. I would note that we've got a lot of respect for their management team and certainly have great relationships across both companies and I think a strong alignment of interest, and this is the key point around both Phase 1 and Phase 2.So whether they elect to put new capital into Phase 2 is an open matter. I'd certainly refer that to their management team. But just remember, in the first phase, they took roughly half of the offtake or 5 million tonnes per annum, they own 30% of the project level equity, and they are also the gas manager for the first phase. The second phase is, important context, I believe, on Conoco because the second phase will be taking gas supply, Steve, from the Permian Basin, which has significant strategic considerations for a variety of commercial parties, and that's particularly true for ConocoPhillips.So I would just note that this is an area we're working closely with a variety of counterparties who want to collaborate with us on the success of Phase 2. And based on the conversations we're currently having, we continue to be very excited about moving forward with that project."", 'Operator', 'And our next question will come from Anthony Crowdell from Mizuho.', 'Anthony Christopher Crowdell', ""If I could, I guess, jump on Carly's question. I guess hers is more specific maybe supply chain to the regulated utility. If I think about the Infrastructure business, particularly with Port Arthur 2 and Cameron Phase 2, any big changes or estimates you're seeing in the E&C contracts that maybe Bechtel is looking into?"", 'Jeffrey Walker Martin', ""Yes. What might be helpful here, Anthony, is Justin, if you just take us through maybe a little bit of a construction update as well as what you're doing to secure some long lead time items on some of the projects to your near-term focused, and that might be helpful for his question."", 'Justin Christopher Bird', ""Yes, yes. Hi, Anthony, and thank you, Jeff. Yes. So let me start with construction and then I'll go to the heart of your question. So we're seeing solid progress at construction at both ECA Phase 1 and Port Arthur Phase 1. I've had opportunities to visit both sites recently. Jeff and I were at ECA just 2 weeks ago observing construction. And I was at Port Arthur recently for the 1-year commemorative groundbreaking. Both projects remain on track. We're not seeing the supply chain issues.At ECA Phase 1, we remain on track for COD in the summer of 2025. We're now more than 80% complete. Construction is ongoing across all areas of the project. We have about 4,000 people deployed on-site and have over 15 million hours worked with no lost time incidents. Bechtel at Port Arthur Phase 1, construction activities are progressing well. As Karen mentioned in remarks, we're focused on the foundation stage construction, soil stabilization, piling, concrete pouring, and it's exciting to see we recently commenced structural steel.In terms of our development projects, we remain excited about these projects. We're continuing to see strong market interest and do expect these projects to advance. In terms of construction contracts or progress at Port Arthur Phase 2, while we're awaiting our DOE non-FDA export permit, we're continuing to work with Bechtel on an EPC agreement that can optimize efficiencies with the Phase 1 construction schedule. We're also continuing marketing efforts for offtake and equity.On Cameron Phase 2, we're currently working with the Cameron partners to optimize cost through value engineering. And as Jeff mentioned, we're also exploring the procurement or reservation of long lead time and critical path equipment. Cameron Phase 2 is a comparatively low emission project, and it's a brownfield asset sourcing low-cost gas. So we think this is really important. And as Jeff had previously mentioned, we're advancing that with a view toward taking FID in the first half of 2025.I guess as a takeaway, I talk about the reverse Field of Dreams model when they come and when we achieve the right returns, we'll build it. Along these lines, we'll only move forward with our projects when we have the right cost and risk structure and long-term contracted cash flows that support our corporate strategy, our targeted mid-teen equity returns and create value for our shareholders."", 'Jeffrey Walker Martin', ""Anthony, I'd also mention to the heart of your question, the Bechtel relationship is a strategic relationship for us. They're very, very helpful, kind of the best in the business in the [Gulf]. And that's why Justin commented on the importance of not demobilizing Phase 1 and going right into a continuous build into Phase 2 at Port Arthur. I would also note that his team has master purchase agreements with all the key vendors in place. And there's a lot of focus on making sure we're sourcing the key equipment and particularly planning in advance to long lead time items. So that all goes into the box of how we manage risk to make sure that we're delivering projects that create the right risk reward for our owners."", 'Anthony Christopher Crowdell', ""And then if I get one follow-up, and I know it's a very small part of SIP. It's the Cimarrón Wind. The company has been very successful at recycling capital and sold a renewable portfolio several years ago. Very opportunistic there. And now the company is -- should we think of more wins coming on or more renewable coming on to rebuilding a renewable portfolio with SIP? And I'll leave it there."", 'Jeffrey Walker Martin', ""Yes, let me provide a little bit of context for that because we're excited about that project. Let me start, Anthony, with the fact that we rolled out our new corporate strategy back in 2018. And really, at the heart of that strategy was a more narrow focus on 2 things, the first of which was building leadership and scale advantages in large economic markets; and number two, more narrowly invested in the energy value chain around T&D type of infrastructure investments like Cimarrón where we can produce highly recurring cash flows.So when you turn that corporate strategy back to Mexico, we built a leadership position there going back to the 1990s. It's a market with over 130 million consumers. When I became CEO in 2018, Anthony, it was the 15th largest economy in the world. Today, the IMF has it ranked as the #12 economy in the world. And PricewaterhouseCoopers now forecasts it will be #7 in the world by 2040. It's also our largest trading partner with an energy network that's highly integrated with the United States. And that really plays to our strategy along the border and particularly the wind projects that you're referencing is located right along the U.S. border, is an expansion of a very large ESJ wind complex that we already own.It's integrated electrically with a high-voltage system and does serve California and it's being built using SI's operating cash flows from Mexico. So I think the key point here is, and we've referenced it several times in our prepared remarks, there is a very strong built-in growth story at SI based upon projects that have already taken FID, and the opportunity with this land position we have adjacent to California is to efficiently and cost effectively build some additional solar and wind to serve the California market, which is integrated with Mexico and fill in and continue to improve on that recurring cash flow growth story that Justin has been talking about."", 'Operator', 'And we have time for one more question. And our next question will come from Craig Shere from Tuohy Brothers.', 'Craig Kenneth Shere', ""I'd like to dovetail a little on Anthony's first question about labor and the LNG markets and kind of feed that into a broader question for Justin. In the last 2, 3 months, we've seen some peer projects announce potential delays, unskilled labor issues. For the same reasons, you've announced increasing demand in your domestic utility networks and T&D networks from data centers to AI, but also coal-to-gas fuel switching and other.We've kind of seen a stabilization and rebound in the LNG markets with some sense that this digestion period everybody was looking for in the second half maybe soft and short or not exist at all. And in this context of the last 2, 3 months kind of change, I'm wondering if you're seeing any change in body language and a desire to kind of seize the day on prospective off-takers."", 'Justin Christopher Bird', ""Yes, thanks for the question, Craig. I think you talked a little bit about supply chain, about labor, but let me go to the heart of your question at the end there. So I think the LNG pause, I would say, I think there was some time to react to that in the marketplace. You saw some people step back maybe with a little less desperation than they maybe had as part of the war in Ukraine. But I will say, and I think we've said it multiple times on this call, we are still seeing a robust commercial interest in our projects, our projects, our expansion opportunities. We've been a strong partner. So we're seeing robust interest. And I'd say currently, we have teams around the world actively engaged in commercial discussions for long-term contracted volumes."", 'Jeffrey Walker Martin', ""I would also add, Craig, I appreciate your question. If it's all about seize the day, I'm betting on Justin's team. We're very excited about the progress we're making on the LNG front and look forward to providing updates in the future."", 'Operator', ""And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back to Jeff Martin for any additional closing remarks."", 'Jeffrey Walker Martin', ""Let me just start by thanking everyone for joining us today. I know there were competing calls this morning so we appreciate everyone making the time to join us. As Karen mentioned, we certainly believe we have a compelling value proposition with a strong growth and income story. Our management team is committed to the long-term success of Sempra, and we believe there's an incredible opportunity for us to continue innovating and finding new and better ways to serve customers while also delivering strong financial returns to our owners.If there are any follow-up items, please reach out to our IR team with your questions, and we look forward to seeing you in California at AGA on May 20 and 21. This concludes our call."", 'Operator', 'Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.']"

I'm Douglas Constantine, Director of Investor Relations, and I will be moderator for today's event.The company will not make detailed comments related to its results in addition to those provided in its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and the letter to shareholders, which have been posted to the company's website.Although our quarterly Investor Relations events often include a presentation on a specific portion of our business, we will instead use the 60 minutes scheduled for today's event for introductory comments by our CEO and a question-and-answer session with members of our leadership team. The introductory comments by our CEO were previously recorded.Upon completion of the previously recorded remarks, we will use the balance of the 60 minutes scheduled for this event for live questions and answers with members of our leadership team. As always, discussions in this event may include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those discussed during today's event.Additional information concerning those risks and uncertainties is available in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as supplemented by our Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2024. And you will find discussions of the risk factors affecting our businesses, safe harbor statements related to forward-looking statements and other discussions of the challenges we face.These documents can be found via the Investor Relations section of our website at investors.progressive.com. To begin today, I'm pleased to introduce our CEO, Tricia Griffith, who will pick us off of introductory comments. Tricia?"", 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. In many ways, this first quarter has felt like we have turned a page. Since mid-2021, inflationary pressure and its subsequent effect on our profit margins has been a predominant factor in our strategic decision-making. Even in the second half of 2023, when we started to see indications that severity trends were stabilizing, more rate was earning in and accident year loss ratios approached our target. We continue to flex in order to deliver on our calendar year 96 combined ratio goal.In our August Investor Relations call, I was asked if we should put aside our 96 target and instead capitalize on the perceived growth opportunity at the time. In my answer, I cited our core values and the belief that our strategy to put profit before growth would prove to be a winning formula. As we look back to the second half of 2023 and the stellar results of the first quarter 2024, we feel stronger than ever that sticking to the core values that has served us well for so long was absolutely the right call. By adhering to who we are, it looks like we have turned that page and we're now seeing the benefits of the tough decisions and hard work over the last several years since inflation took off. Our first quarter of 2024 has really set the stage for us to capitalize on both growth and profitability. During the quarter, net premiums written grew 18%, and we produced a solid combined ratio of 86.1%.Our profitability was made possible from rate continuing to earn in from the rate revisions we took in the last year, seasonably favorable frequency. Mix changes in our book from the non-rate actions we implemented over the last 2 years continued improvements in segmentation and less prior year loss reserve development, among other factors. In Personal Auto, our calendar year margins mean we've been able to shift more focus into growth with incredible results. In the first quarter, we added over 900,000 policies in force, one of the best quarters in our history and second only to the first quarter of 2023. We did this on the back of strong retention on our renewals and new application growth that is ramping up as we increase our media spend and pull back on some of our non-rate actions.During the first quarter, media spend was down 7% versus the first quarter 2023, and new auto applications were down 9% compared to a record growth in the first quarter last year. The [year to] year gap in both spend and sales declined as the quarter progressed. When comparing March 2024 to March 2023, ad spend was up and new auto applications were nearly flat. We continue to see opportunity for growth as the market is still very tight. We have non-rate actions we are unwinding and still have a few states where we are working to get rate revisions approved.As we look forward to the rest of 2024, we will continue to seek to strike the right balance between efficient marketing spend, our calendar year profit targets and maximizing our growth. In Commercial Lines, the first quarter saw better results as compared to 2023. Our core commercial business continues to run well with almost 10 points of rates still to earn in from revisions in 2023 and 2024. As a reminder, 90% of our policies in commercial lines are on 12-month terms, so it takes much longer for rates to earn in as compared to personal auto. The trucking insurance market continues to be soft due to macroeconomic factors. And as a result, we are experiencing year-over-year decline in policies in force in our for-hire transportation and specialty business market targets. While our other 3 BMTs are growing year-over-year from both a unit and premium perspective, in property, we continue to execute on our strategy to reduce our exposure to catastrophe prone states, growing states that have less volatile weather profiles and improve the underwriting and segmentation of our products. Policies in force in volatile states decreased about 5% year-over-year in the first quarter 2024 and grew about 20% in the nonvolatile state. We now have 5 states on our 5.0 product model, which improves segmentation throughout the product. While results are unpredictable, we shouldn't look too deeply into the results of a single quarter as the uncertainty in the last several years has shown us, it's difficult to predict where the future is heading.Given what we know now, however, we're encouraged about the future. Inflationary trends are showing indications of stabilizing, and we believe we're well positioned to capitalize on a marketplace that is still reeling from the profit challenges of the last 2 years. It's comforting to be able to report that we're pivoting to a more normalized operation where, in most states, we can take small bites of the apple when it comes to rate and can focus on growth and increasing our market share. While challenges undoubtedly lay ahead, we're confident in where we stand today and look forward to maximizing our potential in the future.Thank you again for joining us, and I'll now take your questions."", 'Douglas S. Constantine', ""This concludes the previously recorded portion of today's event. We now have members of our management team available live to answer questions. (Operator Instructions). We will now take our first question."", 'Operator', 'The first question comes from the line of Bob Huang with Morgan Stanley.', 'Jian Huang', ""First question is regarding retention. On your 10-Q, you talked about improved retention, both in personal lines and property business. given that you're unlikely to be the only company that is positioned for growth as we head into 2024, curious to your view on retention going forward in terms of the broader market competitive dynamics, do you see people potentially coming in challenging your market share position just going forward? And then broadly speaking, just retention in general."", 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""Yes. Bob, I think you know our retention is sort of our [holy grail] we continue to feel good about our trailing 12. Our 3 months is flat. We're going to focus now, like we said, like I just said in the opening comments on having more stable rates because that's really what consumers want. So will they go to shop, if the rate is better, then their option is to leave. We've got to make sure we have competitive rates. So as we think about growth, we just think about new business. We think about renewal business, we think about our service and growing PIF, the units of both new and renewals. So we'll continue to focus on that, focus on having more stable rates and continuing to be ahead of the competition."", 'Jian Huang', ""Okay. My follow-up is on the -- your distribution channel, and this is a little bit more hypothetical. Your direct channel, obviously have a little bit less of an underwriting margin versus your agency. As you continue to push for growth going forward, is it fair to assume that that's going to have somewhat of a headwind challenge to your overall combined ratio given your direct channel continue to be sort of a focus on the growth side? Should we expect our current underwriting margin to normalize a bit with the combination of focus on growth, your distribution channel mix and things of that nature for the personal line -- personal model?"", 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""We're going to focus on growth in both channels. But of course, you will see the trend in the expense ratio, specifically on the direct side as we start to increase media. If you look -- if you look at January, it was around 15 points. February was 17.5, March was in the 18 area. That was -- I was putting more and more pressure as the quarter developed on the media spend. Now when we look at we look at non-acquisition expense ratios and then as much as we can spend in media as long as it's efficient. So when we look at overall combined ratios, we're going to look at, obviously, at the type of business we're bringing on. We have a preference to bring on bundled business. And we believe we have the best segmentation model in the industry.So that's a big part of the understanding rate to risk. So all those flow together. But we're excited and really thrilled to be able to continue -- to continue on our growth method because even the last years, with all the headwinds and all the uncertainty we've still been able to grow, but to be able to grow at these margins is really exciting."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from the line of Michael Zaremski with BMO.', 'Michael David Zaremski', ""Question on Personal Auto. Historically, not every year, but historically a disproportionate amount of Progressive's organic growth sales have come in the kind of the January through April time frame. Given the current dynamics, do you feel that that's the right type of seasonality we should be thinking about? And if not, what factors should we be thinking about?"", 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""Yes. I think a lot of that comes from tax refunds and other things that happen in a yearly basis. I wouldn't necessarily think about that this year though, because even last year, we were growing, we are actually trying to kind of stop a little bit because of the pressures on our margin. I feel very bullish about our continued growth on both a premium basis -- unit basis, and that's a -- you know there is our preferred measure of growth. So it's all going to be about our ability to do a couple of things. We want to continue to roll back our nonrate actions, so there's -- we still have more levers there. We have the premium earning in and we believe that we're not going to have to -- at least at this juncture, the wide swath of premium that we had to get to our target margin and then our media spend to be able to have those margins.We're about 10 points better than our target 96. So we have a lot of levers to pull to be able to really maximize growth. You'll notice I said this in my letter, in my opening statements and several times throughout the 10-Q. And we talked about it as we were riding the management discussion and analysis about is maximize growth, the right word, versus optimize. And I felt maximize was absolutely the right word to use because that's exactly what we're going to do."", 'Michael David Zaremski', ""My follow-up, I know you've touched on this a bit even today and past letters, but if I just want to confirm. So if you look at the expense ratio, excluding ad expense, in 1Q of this year, it's about [14.1%], which is a little bit lower than full year levels and the -- so maybe 1 quarter might not make a trend. But the LAE ratio [2] In '23, down a little bit versus the previous couple of years levels. Just wanted to confirm whether this is kind of a structural kind of efficiency run rate? Or is there kind of a cyclicality in here that could bounce those figures around?"", 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""I mean the figures have bounced around, depending on what's happening. Clearly, we're going to want to spend more. And in March, that was on an absolute basis, the highest amount we've ever spent in media. And so we're going to spend more on that as long as it's efficient. I think you want to look at the whole spectrum of what makes up the combined ratio. So we're constantly investing to push down both loss adjustment expense and non-acquisition expense. Figuring out ways with technology, with people, with processes to reduce those expenses, because we can give those back in competitive prices, and that's really important.But remember, anywhere between $0.70 to $0.75 of every dollar that goes out, comes and goes out at LAE and loss. So that segmentation piece is really important, understanding our rate to risk. And I mentioned this in the first question. And I think I don't think I talk about this enough, and you get a little glimpses of it in my letters when I talk about our different product models, be it on the private passenger auto side, commercial lines and now property.It is really a special sauce. And it's not something that you build in a year or two. In fact, we've been building this for many decades. But about 10 years ago, we decided we needed to have continuous product model. And so we continue to do those. We started in 2014, really ramped up in 2015 and '16. So think of it as we put a couple of models out there. No state is ever more than a couple of miles behind, and we're constantly improving that segmentation. That takes a lot of investment.So sometimes you can see the expense ratio peak up with that. But those are built in over a decade. And I talked about the product models, but I don't probably give that enough highlight because our R&D groups and our product groups are phenomenal. They're second to none. They never rest. They continue to understand segmentation, rate to risk, and that's a lot of money that goes into the combined ratio. So while expense ratios kind of can come up and down depending on media spend, et cetera. And I don't -- obviously, we're always trying to push them down. A lot of it is the indemnification understanding accuracy and having great segmentation models."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.', 'Elyse Beth Greenspan', ""In your 10-Q, there was a comment about rate increases having an adverse impact on retention. And then you guys highlighted that the 3-month PLE was slowed in the quarter. I'm just trying to reconcile that with your comments, Tricia, right, that rate increases are slowing in terms of both magnitude and frequency. So any color that you could just help us tie that 3-month PLE and impact comment about rate increases. To your overall comments just about the level of rate increase is slowing?"", 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""Yes. Sure, Elyse. I think at this juncture in its last year so, so many customers are getting their renewal bills and the rate increases that are playing through will cause you to shop. So we're always at risk losing customers when that happens. We knew that was a possibility last year as well when we were first to market, getting the rates that we needed on the street. So while we don't know exactly what the trailing 3 will continue to be, and it's on a lagged basis, we'll obviously inform you next quarter. That's really why we feel like we're in a much better position to take those small bites and take smaller increases just to stay ahead of trend."", 'Elyse Beth Greenspan', ""And then my second question, on last quarter's call, when you guys were asked about advertising, you had pointed to it potentially being more even right through the Q1 and the Q2 and Q3 than normal. It sounds like that's still the plan given how positive you guys are in growth. But can you just give us a sense of how you expect the advertising spend cadence to be this year compared to historical?"", 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""Yes, I'll start. And Pat, if you want to weigh in, you can, if there's anything to add. At this juncture with the margins that we have, we do want to use our spend levels to our advantage as long as it's efficient. So like I said, we've got a lot of other levers. We've pulled back on many non-rate actions that still have room to go on that. And I think if we can spend efficiently in the states where we believe we're adequately priced, we're going to do that, I won't' say to the full capacity, but until we feel like it's inefficient to really leverage this opportunity to maximize on growth. Pat, do you want to add anything?"", 'Patrick K. Callahan', ""No, no, I think that's great. Thanks."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Jimmy [Hummer] with JPMorgan.The next question comes from the line of Gregory Peters with Raymond James.', 'Charles Gregory Peters', ""So I'd like to focus the first question on the customer relationship management organization that you called out in your letter. It feels, at times, like it's almost impossible to get timely service in so many areas compared with what we were used to pre-COVID. And so I'm wondering if you could comment on the CRM piece and the challenges you're having with the growth you're reporting and finding people and making sure they're compensated appropriately?"", 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""That's a really great question. And I should have brought that up when I think about the overall -- our goal is to grow as fast as we can, which we've been doing, $19 billion, [$2.9 billion] comparing quarter-over-quarter and 7% PIF growth. But the caveat always if we can support and serve our customers in the way they deserve to be supported. And that's a big caveat because, there have been times in our history where we've had to slow growth because of that. So a few years ago, we found it really challenging, both from a recruiting and a retention and a compensation perspective in our CRM organization. We made some changes in compensation about 2 years ago. We've invested a lot in the work environment and the digital capacity for our customers to be able to serve themselves should they want to.And we are seeing the fruits of those investments through greater tenure and better customer service. Now we are never at rest in terms of customer service. In fact, we're just working on a new customer commitment. And we need to be, frankly, fanatical about customer service because those that could call in, either they don't want to use our digital online services, which we believe are really best-in-class. So we really need some one to talk to and they need someone to answer the phone. Our phone handling times have been really great for both sales and service. I feel -- I mean, the world of difference than 2 years ago. So I think we've done a great job staffing, training and giving them the tools they need to help our customers in the way they deserve. And that's one of the other reasons why I feel so positive about maximizing on our growth."", 'Charles Gregory Peters', ""Maybe -- in conjunction with that, my follow-up question would be one of the common areas that we're trying to figure out is how you're investing in technology, the generative AI, the large language models, et cetera. So I don't know what you're going to be willing to share with us on that front, whether what -- how much you're spending this year versus last year? Or how you're deploying these tools to make your company more efficient. But any color on technology and the emerging options that you have available to and how you're deploying in your company would be interesting?"", 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""Yes, absolutely. So what I would say is we have been investing well, let me step back -- Peter Lewis used to say, we are a technology company that happens to sell insurance. So everything we do has technology built into it. We have, I believe, again, a best-in-class IT organization. With that, we're always trying to stay ahead of the trends. So think of in the direct channel, think of usage-based insurance, all those things, even though they're -- they become actually a part of the product, they start with IT and our ability to have innovative technology.We started with machine learning and large language models probably over a decade ago, and we put a lot of those in place. So think of like we had a Chatbot that can give you documents without having a human involved. And we've continued on those and progressive.com. We've used a lot of machine learning to give you the best choice for what you need for coverage.Right now, we have well over 100 different models in different formats. Some are tests, some are full, full bore and summer thoughts, including many in generative AI. We did an entire several day session with our Board of Directors a few months ago on all that we're doing in AI. And I got to tell you, it's pretty exciting. And it's exciting because the efficiencies we're going to get. I can't go into a lot of the details, but we have some great models, great tests that we're doing, and we believe it's going to be a game changer really in every single aspect of our company. So think of recruiting, think of media. And in fact, we have a Board meeting this week, and we're going to go over some AI test in media that have proven to be really successful. We lean into that technology. Clearly, you always want to think about biases and you want to have responsible AI. So we have a committee that overlooks every test that we do to make sure that we're doing it responsibly.But I think we're excited just like we have for the last nearly 90 years leaning into technology, I'm using it to benefit really competitive prices, so that our customers come and stay with us and we grow market share."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Bank of America.', 'Joshua David Shanker', ""Obviously, the subject for the quarterly letter was growth, and the company is successfully converting on that. But there are gating factors in terms of capital. And one of the areas where you're growing is in the Robinsons, and it looks like you're picking up more homeowner property exposure than you have in the past. Can you talk about your internal capital model and how much you can grow and the extent to which capital is gating factor? Could you be 10%, 15% larger tomorrow? And still have the capital to do that without earning it. Where does that stand accurate?"", 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""Yes. I'll start and John Sauerland, you can weigh in. We are growing in one. But again, we want to grow across the board, so we'll continue that. Our property profile, as we talked about, we are rowing in what we would call growth states or more non-volatile states as far as weather, and we're shrinking I in the volatile state. So that's been a plan we put into place quite some time ago. A lot of this takes time. As I laid out last year, we're starting to see the over 100,000 homeowners policies in Florida start to non-renew that took a while because we needed to notify the customers and talk with the DOI.So we believe that -- that our long-term strategy has to be -- to have our portfolio sort of across the country. So when you think about capital, you have to have regulatory capital. So think of auto having a 3:1 model. So you need to -- if you write $1 billion, you have to have $300 million in capital. And then we have contingent capital in case something unforeseen happens, a big storm, financial crisis, and then we have capital even above that for that. And there's even more for home because it's more of a volatile product. I would say right now, we are in an incredibly comfortable capital position, which is another reason why I'm so excited about this growth. Do you want to add anything?"", 'John Peter Sauerland', ""Sure. Yes. We are growing Robinsons more than the right now, and some of that requires our own home product, some of it doesn't. So in the direct channel, we sell a number of other competitors' home products. But for our own home product, as Tricia mentioned, we're growing a lot in non-volatile states, shrinking actually in volatile states. And when we look at our PML, so our probable maximum losses that's actually come down as a result of our shift. We also recently wrapped up our June 1 reinsurance renewals, and we are very comfortable with the risk we're taking there. And actually got slightly more competitive rates. So we feel great about that portion of our risk management program. And as Tricia noted, we have -- we're generating ample capital right now. We're growing a lot, certainly, at a $2.9 billion year-over-year in the first quarter. And of course, that requires significant but probably around $1 billion of regulatory capital. But we are generating that with underwriting margins to some degree as well year-to-date on investment returns. So we feel very comfortable with our capital level and our ability to grow as fast as we can, again, hitting those margins."", 'Joshua David Shanker', ""Thank you for all the detail. And one quick question. With the Florida policies that you're not renewing to the Loggerhead company, is that going to be significant enough that we should expect your attritional loss ratios to be higher at the end of this year, although when the added benefit of lower capacity volatility is added, they'll be lower, but on an attritional basis, will they rise?"", 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""I couldn't really answer. I mean a lot, obviously, the first thing is first, we wanted to get off some units that we believe will not be profitable. And a lot of it, of course, from a loss perspective, depends on weather, which has really been the clincher for the last several years. And so that's why we're trying to make sure that we're just more balanced. We are still very large in Florida because we have a large auto base and we believe that we can win in Florida on both the home and auto and especially bundled, but we just need -- we were just a little bit too heavy there in addition to a couple of other states, which makes sense because ASI now Progressive Home was based and kind of grew in that area. But it's hard to think about loss ratios when I don't have sort of the crystal ball of what will happen with weather."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from the line of Michael Phillips with Oppenheimer.', 'Michael Wayne Phillips', ""Speaking of Florida, you mentioned some favorable frequency trends in the state and your auto book because of the total refunds. Can you share any thoughts on what you've seen on the property side because of that?"", 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""Property side. No, we haven't seen much. Those were mostly on the auto side. (inaudible) There's a little bit on the property, have you seen much, Pat?"", 'Patrick K. Callahan', ""It's too early to tell on the property side, right? We've got different statute of limitations. We've got different kind of assignment of benefits that will play through the book over time, but not as immediate as we're seeing on the auto book."", 'Michael Wayne Phillips', ""Okay. And then you mentioned the policy life expectation has been improving month to month to month. I guess given all the dynamics in auto, maybe what's behind that? And is that harder for you to get your hands around and predict when shopping at such a high level?"", 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""Well, we know those shopping happens when rates go up. And I think it's a little bit different, I think, depending on the demographic if you -- when you read through the 10-Q, [Sam's] are much more likely to be shop sensitive because they're price sensitive. And so it's very different. When you kind of peel back the onion, you look at our different demographics as well. But we -- like I said in the last couple of calls, last year, we had seen inflationary factors like that. And so I'm not surprised that there's been a lot more shopping. And that's why the key is to get out ahead of the rate. It's short-term pain for long-term growth, and that's exactly what we did and why we're sitting in this position.So we're going to continue to have -- try to have stable rates. Just stay ahead of the severity trends and go from there. And I think when customers see that and then they are able to also, like I said, have great claims service, have a great service from our CRM. We want to give a reason to stay. And all the products that they can have from Progressive."", 'Operator', 'Next question comes from the line of David Motemaden Evercore.', 'David Kenneth Motemaden', ""Tricia, you had mentioned ad spend was up in March, and it was the highest amount we've ever seen or you've ever seen, but the apps were flat. So it feels like -- I know there's some lag there, but I'm sure that some of the non-rate actions are limiting conversion. Is there any way to size how much of the country still had non-rate actions in place today versus 3 months ago?And how you're thinking about rolling those back throughout the rest of the year?"", 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""Yes, David, that's a great question. And one of the other things you have to compare is our extraordinary growth in quarter 1 in 2023. So that comparison is really off because we were growing a lot. We really didn't want to be a growing as much because we didn't have the margin that we wanted. But that comparison is going to be hard as well. So that's the first factor.We have pulled back our -- and there's a lot of levers of non-rate actions. So there's build plans, there's proof of garaging, there's a bunch of different sort of pre binding things that we do. So there's several different ones. Some we pulled back more quickly and fully. There are some states where we haven't pulled back hardly at all because we don't have the rate that we need yet. But we're working on that pretty diligently. From a percentage wise, I would say we're -- what would you say, Pat, 60% or 70%?"", 'Patrick K. Callahan', 'Yes. I would say, as you broke it down, on the bill plan side, we are getting close back to pre pullback. And on the verification side, it really depends at the state level, right? We still have about 20% of our states where we have media off, which is a good indication that if we have media off, we probably still have significant non-rate actions or verification in place. But we have lots of, I would say, room to run as we unwind those across both channels throughout the remainder of the year.', 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""Yes. And I feel like just even in the last couple of weeks or during the month of March, I feel like in some of the places where we've needed rate, we're starting to have some much more productive conversations."", 'Patrick K. Callahan', ""Yes. I would agree. On the regulatory side, there's certainly -- we've had a couple of recent approvals, and we're getting more comfortable more of our calendar year premium earned in that margins continue to be we expect them to be on -- in more and more of our states. So that gives our general managers and product managers greater confidence that they should open up and write more volume because we think we're priced adequately."", 'Susan Patricia Griffith', 'Thanks, David.', 'David Kenneth Motemaden', ""No, great. That's really helpful. That's encouraging to hear. And then for my follow-up question, it was good to see that Robinsons new apps up almost double digits in the first quarter. It sounded like conversion also increased on Robinsons in the agency channel. Could you maybe just talk about how you're attracting the Robinsons and how you're achieving this increased conversion and whether you're seeing any improvement on the retention of Robinsons as well?"", 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""Yes. I think it's different if you're thinking about it from the agency's channel versus the direct channel on the agency channel. We continue to have our preferred agents, our platinum agents and no, we want the bundle, and they can be compensated for that. And so that is a big part of the agency channel. On the direct channel. We have our HomeQuote Explorer, where we saw Progressive Home, and I know they've been working diligently with some really great unaffiliated partners to be able to place that coverage even if it is not with Progressive Home. And we're continuing to work on having a stable group of companies in that mix.We -- last quarter, we went through sort of how we think about evolving with what we write on our paper and not on our paper. And we think that's good for customers to be able to have an [album] when they come in. So that's proven to be something that we're working diligently on, and we'll continue to work on, especially as the market, I think it's more stable. And I think the Robinsons now they come to us. I remember, years ago, John, you might remember, I remember John standing up here at an IR call and saying that, we want to be the company that when they call, they say, do you have this, we say Yes, we do. And so we're getting closer and closer to being not just a destination insurer but a destination company. So when you come and you -- or you're a Robinson, you're going to want auto home, but you're going to possibly want umbrella. You're going to want some other things. And so each added product increases retention. We don't share those. But if you look at our overall retention of the Robinsons versus the other segments, it's much higher."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from the line of Jimmy Hummer (sic) [Bhullar] with JPMorgan.', 'Jamminder Singh Bhullar', 'So first, I had a question just on the expense ratio. Should we assume that given how much premiums have gone up the last few years, that your expense ratio should be -- especially the non-acquisition or the sort of nondiscretionary expenses should be structurally lower for the next several years? And if that is the case, then would you let that fall to the bottom line and assume a lower combined ratio going forward? Or should we assume the deal use it to be more competitive on pricing and it will show up in the form of better growth potentially? Or gets competed away?', 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""Yes. Good question, Jimmy. Probably a little bit of both. So I think we'll try to continue to push expenses and we need to be efficient. And we don't necessarily though, need to be the lowest cost. We want to have low cost because that equates to competitive prices and that equates to growth. And that growth, of course, is a great cycle because that unit growth is important, especially as you've seen in the past years when severity trends go up and down because those can be less stable than having a unit growth. But yes, I think we're going to spend where we can to maximize on this growth. We're going to continue to think about expenses and utilize the investments that we make across the board to become more efficient. But a lot of it, too, and the reason we're able to do this is because of the investments we've made over the many years on technology, on people, on processes, on just our overall people and culture to be there. So I would expect that we'll be able to do a little bit of both."", 'John Peter Sauerland', ""I'd just add that we have continued to make progress on our non-acquisition expense ratio, and we've been doing so over at least the past decade. So, structurally, as you say, as we increase average premium, not only the efficiencies we plow into our business, but the denominator is a tailwind for sure. But we will always price that 96 combined ratio at the company level. So to the extent we get efficiencies, we're going to pay that back into growth and target the same margin over time."", 'Jamminder Singh Bhullar', ""And then maybe if you could talk about the competitive environment and just competitor behavior. Overall, it seems like almost every company is still in the process of repricing its book, but I'm assuming that trends vary by state. And there are a few states where several other companies beside you are at adequate margins. So are you seeing price competition pick up in those markets? And are companies being disciplined overall? Or are you even seeing some companies maybe be a little bit too loose in terms of pricing and underwriting in areas where the loss trends have been good and states were early in allowing companies to raise prices?"", 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""It's hard to say what other companies are doing. I can say that we still feel like it's a hard market. And we feel like we got ahead of the curve as far as pricing. We're seeing that with our growth, and I hope to continue to see that. I think if you follow, which I'm sure you do, the competition, margins look good. And so I think everyone saw what we saw in terms of trends and reacted. Again, you have a certain period of time where if you react more quickly, you have an advantage, and that advantage sort of begets growth and sort of is like -- I feel like at this juncture, last year when I talked about it in November about starting to think about pulling back some non-rate actions and doing some things as like we kind of put our toe in the water and everybody else wasn't quite there. We then -- we put our whole foot and we set the edge of the pool, and now we're diving in.So I think we feel really great about our ability to grow. People will catch up. That's this industry. It's an ebb and flow of soft markets, hard markets, and it's just about getting out ahead of it. And again, I can't stress enough how much segmentation and our ability to match rate to risk matters. And to not ever rust and say, okay, we've got whatever, [8.8, 5.04]. We were very creative in our model naming. But the bottom line is, is constant, and we don't put one in and say, okay, we'll wait for 10 years and see how that works. And they -- and the interactions with our different variables with each other are so important. So that's a big piece of it as well. So it's about having the right [rate] on the street, of course, that's table stakes. So it's also about having product models where you really understand the ultimate loss costs."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from the line of Meyer Sheilds with KBW.', 'Meyer Shields', ""Great. When we look at year-over-year policy count growth in personal lines, we saw a pickup in direct, but modest sequential slowdown in agency. And I was hoping you could -- sorry, in March, I was hoping you could translate what actually is going on like why we're seeing that sort of different trends?"", 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""Yes. I think if you -- I think agency in March was more flat. I think you'll see that a little bit -- it will be a little bit more delayed than direct, where we have more access to put on the media spend, whereas I think agents -- it's just a different model. Pat, you can add one of that. But if I recall, March started to be a little bit -- the trend started to return a little bit in agency."", 'Patrick K. Callahan', ""Yes. So we've been slower to open things back up in the agency channel and specifically things like returning rates on comparative raters across the board, which, thus, put our rate in a more competitive position and potentially drive more growth. But know that we are leaning into that at this point. And as we're more confident in our rate adequacy we are opening up some of those non-rate actions in the agency channel. We have fewer top-of-funnel levers in the agency channel. It's more mid-funnel. So you will see that delayed effect when, media, we can fill the top of the funnel on the direct channel much more responsibly and quickly when we decide we're rate adequate."", 'Meyer Shields', ""Okay. Perfect. That's very helpful. And to response your comments earlier, would it make sense to have more 6-month policies in commercial lines?"", 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""We've talked about that for years. And I think what I would say it's very dependent on the BMT. When you go in to get a quote and ultimately convert, there are some business marketing tiers that are really complex and time-consuming. And you're gathering information, and it's not an easy process. You don't want to do that every 6 months. So with those, you just have to be priced right and have the ability to do things like debits and credits. To get things right more quickly.We have (inaudible) and we had a lot in the past. And we continue to think about that. I know Karen and your team are thinking about that in some of the BMTs that could be more flexible. That said, I'm super excited, and I'm glad you brought up commercial. I'm super excited to talk about commercial. I feel like we're in a great position. We still have 10 points to earn in, the rest of this calendar year. Again, the key was getting out in front of it, and it's especially important because of those 12-month policies. But one of the things that we did many, many years ago, and I think this might have been the first IR call or maybe in the first year or so after I took over. When team and I develop -- we hadn't developed the horizon concept that came from McKinsey, but we developed how we were going to think about growing the company. And on commercial lines is a big part of that. They were already in Horizon 1 with commercial lodging the #1 writer. But in Horizon 2, we wanted to do is really understand adjacent products that we could develop. And they really mostly within the Commercial Lines organization. So if you think of small fleets, that has tripled business over the last 5 years. You saw that we're now in Florida, we have BOP in 45 states. The new product [files] I've been talking about on the private passenger, auto side or also on the commercial side. And our business model contractor, right now, just recently in the last several weeks, we've seeing new app volume have new all-time highs. And as importantly, the take rate for ProView, which is the usage-based insurance, I think snapshot for the business auto contractor customers has doubled.So really excited about the growth and the different levers because of such a variety of types of products in the Commercial line organization. And what we'll do is we'll look at those and see, is there an opportunity to have more on 6 months, what does that mean to your retention? What does that mean to conversion, et cetera. So we'll test some of those things likely in the next year or so. But I am excited. And even when you think about FHT, we've been talking a lot about macroeconomic trends. When you go back pre-pandemic. And then of course, we were set. We knew that market really well. We leveraged and capitalized on the fact that the trucking industry exploded because people were moving goods across the country, spot rates were high. And now that we're sort of a little bit back to normal. What we're seeing is when we look at Federal Motor Carrier authorizations, we -- they're off a certain amount, we're actually up higher than that on new business with FHT. So I'm going to -- it's hard to not compare the pandemic and subsequently what happened. But what we're really trying to look at is how does growth compare to 2019? And what I would say with FHT, the For Hire Transportation, it looks good."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from the line of Mike Ward with Citi.', 'Michael Augustus Ward', ""I was wondering about Telematics. We noticed adoption was down, I think, 20% in agency. I think you said because of the mix of agencies, just hoping you could help us understand why that is? Is Telematics more specific to certain customer segmentations or geographies? Maybe Robinson just aren't as bigger adopters of it."", 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""Yes. Mark, that was mostly a couple of big national account agencies. That started happening maybe around mid-2023. So nothing much to read into. We're still really excited. In fact, take rate and agency really has peaked up since prepandemic. And so we continue to believe that's a big part of our model. We have 57 billion miles driven. So we have a lot of data, 7 billion trips. So we continue to have that be a big part of it. And we're constantly talking to agents about the importance of that to get those great drivers, great discounts."", 'Michael Augustus Ward', ""Okay. And then maybe just on recent loss experience. We've seen accident frequency ticked down high single digits into last 2 consecutive quarters. Just wondering if you could share your view on maybe what's driving that? Is it mix? And I guess or mild winter? And what are you seeing more recently?"", 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""Yes, that's good. And those are 2 of the variables for sure. So the mile-to-mile quarter helped our mix of business, our sort of self-imposed underwriting actions. And actually, we have seen a tailwind from [House billing 37]. So those would probably be 4 of the contributing factors. What I would look at instead of focusing on the quarter, that would be, I would look at the trailing 12 over prior frequency because those were some factors in this quarter for sure."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Brian Meredith of UBS.', 'Brian Robert Meredith', ""Just following up on the frequency questions. I'm just curious, do you think changes in all terms and conditions or customers maybe raising deductibles or anything is causing the benefit of frequency right now. I think we've seen that in prior kind of cycles like we're in right now?"", 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""It's so hard to discern that. We've been playing around and there could be -- and maybe Mark brought it up a little bit. There could be a little bit of regional differences in terms of frequencies no fault state versus none. It's hard to really pinpoint that. We're going to continue to work on that. But it really is hard to pinpoint those exact things from frequency. So really, what I said before, what we're seeing at least in that first quarter is really our self-imposed underwriting restrictions, some mix difference, which makes sense and then some weather and some changes from the Florida House bill. Those are the parts that we can better quantify."", 'Brian Robert Meredith', ""Right. So you're not pricing for it basically?"", 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""We look at it and we price for frequency and severity, but we can't predict frequency. We know when we see it."", 'Brian Robert Meredith', 'Great. And then my second question, just curious, getting into the smart commercial business, obviously, the homeowners. Can you talk a little bit, do you have or are you thinking about E&S capabilities? And would that be an area into and we get more from the full package business and you have it in the other side?', 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""I'm really sorry, but you broke out completely there. We didn't understand the question."", 'Brian Robert Meredith', 'Sorry, can you hear me now?', 'Susan Patricia Griffith', 'Yes, perfect.', 'Brian Robert Meredith', 'I was asking more about E&S capabilities in maybe homeowners or commercial or plans to have some of those excess and surplus line capabilities. just given the regulatory and risk landscape out there?', 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""Yes, those are things to think about all the time we have. We actually utilize the E&S capabilities in some venues in commercial already. And we always look at kind of the best way to understand if we can't get the rate we need in the admitted market, and we have an opportunity and an ability to do that should that arise."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Yaron Kinar with Jefferies.', 'Yaron Joseph Kinar', 'Thank you. Wanted to start with a couple of mix shifts and the potential impact, if we can. And then maybe we start with the Robinsons. Would the greater weighting of Robinsons ultimately also lead to greater exposure in bodily injury, where I think severity trends remain a bit higher? And if so, how do you address that or price for that keep the profit targets in line with where you want them to be?', 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""Yes. We priced like John was saying, every customer, every state or channel to a lifetime 96 knowing that the limit difference different if you're a preferred if you're going to have higher limits. So we price for that and are very clear on -- and reserved for that. And so that's sort of our secret sauce as well."", 'Yaron Joseph Kinar', 'Okay. And then if we switch to commercial. So historically, if I look at Progressive, I think the company has been able to avoid a lot of the severity pressures that have been that the industry has seen in commercial auto. And I think a lot of that has to do, obviously, with your underwriting and segmentation, but also because you had a small trucking orientation. But now that post the protective acquisition and with the growth in the TNC business, do you see this, I guess, severity trends different in the overall commercial auto book than they had been in the past? And how are you managing those?', 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""I mean commercial is very much -- I mean all of our businesses state-by-state, but commercial has a few states that are much more volatile, and we have to price for those or like Karen's doing now and actually Pat on the PL side is a lot of business restrictions until we can get the prices we need and non-rate actions. But I think, like I said, when I was outlining the variety of BMTs, they react very differently and exposure very differently, and we treat them differently in terms of the segmentation perspective. You mentioned TNC. We needed a huge increase with one of our partners there, and we're able to get that. So our comfort level of success in the TNC organizations is very high now. We feel good about that.But yes, the exposure is different. You just have to stay on top of it from a pricing perspective and from a claims perspective."", 'Douglas S. Constantine', ""Those in the queue appear to be those who've already asked questions. So that concludes our event.Those left in the queue can direct your questions directly to me via e-mail or my direct phone line.

The unemployment rate remains low at 3.8%, but the GDP growth moderated from 3.4% in the fourth quarter of 2023 to 1.6% in the first quarter of 2024. The market remained strong after the Fed meeting as the S&P 500 was 2.21% higher between May 1 and May 3 market close."", 'Billionaire Leon Cooperman of Omega Advisors believes that the current US debt levels could be too high to manage. He expressed concern about the growing debt crisis in the United States in a CNBC interview on April 23, adding that leadership has failed to address it effectively.

Cocoa prices, a key input for HSY, have seen a nearly unprecedented price spike on supply disruptions in West Africa (where the majority of global supply originates). While we cannot predict when cocoa prices deflate, we are confident HSY and its largest competitors will be slow to reverse price increases required to recoup the input cost squeeze. Encouragingly, after being hampered by supply chain constraints in the post-COVID-19 environment, HSY has a greater innovation slate and more capacity in place to grow in the coming years.

To skip our analysis of the recent market trends and market activity, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Investments for Beginners in 2024.', ""With the first quarter of 2024 now concluded, the stock market has evolved. Continuing trends from Q4 2023, the period witnessed the sustained growth of artificial intelligence and technology stocks, with investors remaining optimistic about AI's potential across consumer and business applications, alongside expectations of multiple interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve throughout the year. However, as we move into the second quarter of the year, investor sentiment has shifted from anticipating a strong economic environment to reassessing strategies for allocating significant funds into the stock market."", ""In April, U.S. job growth decelerated more than anticipated, with the annual wage increase dipping below 4.0% for the first time in nearly three years, according to the Labor Department's latest employment report released on April 3. The unemployment rate also rose slightly to 3.9% from March's 3.8%, attributed to a growing labor supply. Nonfarm payrolls expanded by 175,000 jobs last month, marking the lowest increase in six months, with revisions revealing 22,000 fewer jobs created in February and March than initially reported. Despite these figures, the jobless rate persisted below 4% for the 27th consecutive month."", 'The signs of a cooling labor market sparked optimism that the U.S. central bank could orchestrate a ""soft landing"" for the economy, dispelling concerns of stagflation, which had been fueled by reports of subdued economic growth and elevated inflation in the first quarter. In that regard, Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman reiterated her readiness to raise the policy rate if progress stalls or reverses, while expressing confidence that inflation will continue to decline even as the central bank maintains its benchmark interest rate at current levels:', '""My baseline outlook continues to be that inflation will decline further with the policy rate held steady, but I still see a number of upside inflation risks that affect my outlook. While the current stance of monetary policy appears to be at a restrictive level, I remain willing to raise the federal funds rate at a future meeting should the incoming data indicate that progress on inflation has stalled or reversed.""', ""Although inflation has decreased from its peak in mid-2022, it remains significantly above the central bank's target range. Most reports this year have indicated an annual inflation rate of around 3%, with the Fed's preferred measure, the core personal consumption expenditures price (PCE) index, recently standing at 2.8%. Rising prices have led to upward pressure on wages, contributing to an inflationary environment that has prevented the Fed from taking aggressive steps to cut interest rates, despite market expectations suggesting otherwise."", ""If you're a beginner in the world of investments and finance, diving right in can seem daunting with everything mentioned above. However, there are strategies to simplify the process and increase your chances of success. One approach is to focus on established, well-known companies with strong financial foundations. These household names often offer more stability and growth potential over time. By avoiding riskier investments and sticking to proven businesses, beginners can build a solid foundation for their investment journey and increase their likelihood of early success in the stock market.

The S&P 500, one of the leading stock indexes in the world, gained 10.2% in the first three months of 2024, achieving its best first-quarter performance in five years. The impressive performance sparked greater interest among investors in the stock market. In March, investors poured roughly $50 billion into funds focused on purchasing stocks in the US, as reported by EPFR Global Data. That said, it is important to bear in mind that it is the bigger companies that are driving the market upward, especially those that are attentive to the ongoing artificial intelligence wave. The ‘Magnificent Seven’ accounted for 40% of the market’s overall gains in the first three months, according to data by S&P Dow Jones Indices. Meta’s remarkable returns of over 40% during the period were massively driven by the company’s announcement of its first-ever dividend earlier this year.', 'Dividends play an important role in the investment landscape, with approximately 80% of the companies in the S&P 500 paying dividends to shareholders.

Franco, Vornado Realty Trust - President & CFO: The known vacancies are anticipated to impact earnings by about $0.25 to $0.30 per share.

Our senior team is also present and available for questions. I will now turn the call over to Steven Roth."", 'Steven Roth', ""Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. We've been busy. Let's start with Bloomberg. As a reminder, 731 Lexington Avenue, the mixed-use tower, whose 950,000 square foot office condo is Bloomberg's global headquarters is owned by Alexander's, a separately traded public REIT. Vornado owns 32.4% of Alexander's. The background facts are: Bloomberg lease expires in February 2029, and $500 million of debt on the office condo is due next month June 2024. Yesterday, we announced that we renewed and extended the Bloomberg lease for an 11-year term to begin in February 2029 and take us through February 2040. So 16 years of term from now. As you can imagine, a redeveloper in town tried to poach Bloomberg. And of course, they looked at every opportunity as they must. We are delighted that they chose to stay with 731 Lexington. By the way, the building is as much Mike's creation as mine. He had significant input into the design of the original building. The design of the building in Bloomberg's internal fit-out are on par with what we would have built today. But of course, now they don't need to. The terms of the lease was filled out in yesterday's SEC filings, tenant concessions in the form of TIs and free rent have been established and the net rent will be the subject of an appraisal in 2029 with then rent adjusted up or down no more than 10% either way based on the rent market conditions. We're in the process of refinancing this asset, but I must say, I am not excited about paying today's market rate of 7% or even 8% for debt with all the trappings of leasing reserves, cash suites as such, which are admittedly protective of the lender, but don't do much for our equity value. As we speak, my personal favorite is to pay the debt down and maybe even pay the debt off. We shall see.Now let's focus on our credit lines. Traditionally, we've had 2 separate but similar credit lines with staggered maturities. One credit line for $1.25 billion has been renewed through 2027, and the renewal of the second credit line was finalized last Friday at a reduced amount of $915 million, with a term extended to April 2029. As expected in these times, several banks dropped out. We use our credit lines very sparingly, generally for short-term requirements with a known source of repayment and rarely have we exceeded 25% drawdowns. Now to 280 Park Avenue. We own 50% of 280 Park Avenue. Since our joint venture partner has already reported, I'm guessing you are all pretty much up to date on the details. What we did here was extend the maturity of the senior loan for 4 years, keeping the rate constant with no pay down, but posting significant cash reserves for future leasing. Several analysts have commented that the loan and the equity value pretty much cancel out and that fact allowed us to DPO the mezz loan at $0.50 on the dollar, realizing a $31.3 million gain at share, which we will recognize in the second quarter. This is not yet a big win, but it does create a cheap warrant on a wonderful asset located in Prime Park Avenue where there is already a very low 7% vacancy and a shortage of space. We think it's a first-class bet. By the way, we are leasing very well here. We continue to protect our balance sheet with interest rate caps and swaps, but when a 3% loan matures into a 7% market, there really is no place to hide. We continue to prospect for good real estate in distress, where our best-in-class operating platform can be helpful to the lender. We expect these opportunities to accelerate. The gold rush on the part of the luxury brands to own, control and dominate the very best locations is accelerating and the knock-on effect on prime New York City retail space is palpable. It should be noted that in New York, we have much more prime retail space than anyone else by a wide margin. Some commentators have noted that the Fifth Avenue and Times Square values seem to have recovered to the pricing of our retail JV sale 5 years ago, it would seem so. I continue to strongly believe the contrarian bull case I made in my annual shareholders' letter that basically with frozen supply, i.e., no new developer office starts and none on the horizon, tenant requirements picking up and vacancies shrinking, I couldn't be more optimistic about the future. And also note that while the New York market has a huge 422 million square feet, when you cancel out the non-prime space, we really only compete in a much smaller 177 million square foot market. Great things are happening in our PENN District. Come by and take a look. Our team here at Vornado couldn't be more optimistic. Now over to Michael."", 'Michael J. Franco', ""Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. As expected, the financial results for the quarter were down from last year due to items that we previously forecasted. First quarter comparable FFO as adjusted was $0.55 per share compared to $0.60 per share for last year's first quarter, a decrease of $0.05. This decrease is primarily driven by lower NOI from higher net interest expense and no move outs, partially offset by lower G&A expense. We have provided a quarter-over-quarter bridge in our earnings release in our financial supplement. However, from New York business, same-store cash NOI was down 5.1%, primarily due to the aforementioned expirations. As we indicated in our last earnings call, we expect our 2024 comparable FFO to be down from 2023 comparable FFO of $2.61 per share, primarily due to higher projected net interest expense of about $0.30 per share and the impact of known vacancies at certain of our properties, primarily at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, 770 Broadway, 280 Park Avenue. We anticipate the impact of these expirations in 2024 to be roughly $0.25 to $0.30 per share. We expect this impact to be temporary as we have already leased up a good chunk of this space but the GAAP earnings from these leases won't begin until sometime in 2025. We then expect earnings to increase as income from the lease-up of PENN and other vacancies comes online and as rates trend down. Now turning to leasing markets. The New York office market continues to show signs of strengthening. While first quarter office leasing in New York took a bit of a breather from the strong year-end, there is a healthy backlog of activity with a number of large deals in the works. Overall, tenant space requirements continue to trend upward, sublease space continues to fall, best-in-class renovated and amenitized product located in transit hubs continues to dominate leasing and the new supply pipeline is close to 0. These dynamics set the table for continued improvement and conditions in the upper tier of the market, which we are already experiencing in our best-of-class portfolio. Overall, asking rents are stable, even rising in the top-tier properties but concessions remain stubbornly high across all submarkets. The financial services and legal sectors are continuing to drive the leasing activity as both are in growth mode. We are also seeing the first signs of life in the tech sector again after a couple of years of being on pause or downsizing. And our experience is when they grow, they tend to lease big chunks of space. The Midtown and new West side markets are outperforming as leasing activity in Midtown is strong, not only on Park Avenue, but also on Sixth Avenue, in the Fifth Avenue, Madison Avenue Corridor. On the West side, tenant demand continues at pace. If you walk from Seventh Avenue to the Hudson River, you will see why. Turning now to our leasing activity. After completing a slew of large leases in December 2023 and finishing last year with a market-leading 2.1 million square feet of deals, we expect that a more muted first quarter of completed transactions given where our deal pipeline stood in the negotiation process. In the first quarter, we leased 291,000 square feet at a healthy $89 per square foot, reflecting the overall quality and premium locations of our properties. The highlight of the quarter was our 125,000 square foot headquarters lease with Major League Soccer at the new PENN 2. MLS had been in the market for some time, looking mainly in the Midtown core until late in their process when they toured PENN 2 and were wowed by what we've done with the building in the district. The project is now complete and really shows terrifically. Our new town hall event space is open. By the way, we hosted our first event just 2 weeks ago attended by 300 people. And the rooftop, pavilion and park are truly spectacular. Tenants are responding positively to everything that we've done and what's still to come. We have a significant pipeline of PENN 2 and are busy negotiating proposals with tenants across a variety of industry sectors. In addition to the significant Bloomberg lease renewal of almost 1 million square feet we just completed, our leasing pipeline is strong with 370,000 feet of leases in negotiation and another 2.5 million feet of proposals out on the street in different stages. Much of this activity is not only addressing current vacancy, but also forward-looking expirations. As discussed on the fourth quarter call, when we foreshadowed an occupancy decline due to the known Q1 move-outs at properties such as 1296 Avenue and 280 Park. We are pleased to report that we have already taken care of half of the 2024 and 2025 expirations in these properties with more activity on the horizon and [reach]. Turning to retail. The retail leasing market continues to recover. As we discussed in our last call, Prada's and Caring's blockbuster retail deals on Fifth Avenue that occurred in December demonstrated their long-term commitment to Manhattan and has further energized the market and there are other potential sales rumored to be in the works. Vacancy rates are now below prepandemic 2019 levels in most Manhattan submarkets and retailers are willing to pay top dollar for the best locations. Our retail leasing activity has picked up meaningfully in the last couple of quarters with almost all our assets seeing significant interest. As evidence of the rebound this quarter, in addition to signing many leases in the PENN District, we completed an important long-term renewal at one of our Time Square assets at the highest annual dollar rent we've achieved in our portfolio since pre-COVID, over $15 million per year. Turning to the capital markets now. While the financing markets still remain challenging, we are starting to see some stability for high-quality products. The CMBS market has begun to selectively reopen for office, lending at conservative metrics on quality assets with long weighted average lease term. Unsecured bond spreads for office continue to tighten. The market is much more open for high-quality retail. That being said, coupons are still high. Banks remain on the sidelines and generally in workout mode, and there's more pain to come for all lenders given the volume of office maturities in the next few years. This will create opportunities for us. We have been and continue to be very active on the capital markets front. In addition to the recent extensions on 280 Park and 435 Seventh, we are also in the process of extending our other 2024 maturities, which we expect to complete soon. Finally and importantly, as Steve mentioned, just a few days ago, we finalized the recast of our revolver that was scheduled to mature in 2026 for $915 million. Completing this refinancing solidified a key portion of our liquidity through 2029 and gives us significant runway to deal with any challenges over the next few years. It also highlights the continued support of our key banks in this challenging environment. We thank them for their support. Our balance sheet remains in very good shape with strong liquidity. Pro forma for the new revolver size, our current liquidity is a strong $2.7 billion, including $1.1 billion of cash and restricted cash and $1.6 billion undrawn under our $2.17 billion revolving credit facilities. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A."", 'Operator', ""(Operator Instructions) Today's first question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI."", 'Stephen Thomas Sakwa', 'Michael, I was wondering if you could just follow up a little bit on the comments you made about the pipeline? And just maybe help us think through how much of that 2.5 million square feet is maybe earmarked for our PENN 2 in the development? And how much is geared for, I guess, future rollovers? And how much is geared to kind of current vacancy in the portfolio?', 'Michael J. Franco', 'Glen, do you want to take the lead on that?', 'Glen J. Weiss', ""Sure. So I would say it's a very, very balanced mix of what you just described. We're seeing a surge in proposals coming in on PENN -- both PENN 1 and PENN 2 coming off the heels of our Major League Soccer lease. We're seeing expirations -- outbound expirations tenants coming to us to early renew just like we did with Bloomberg this week. And in addition, much of the pipeline is attacking expiration at the buildings where we have space available today. I'd say it's a healthy mix across the portfolio, PENN and otherwise."", 'Stephen Thomas Sakwa', ""Okay. And as a follow-up, Michael, just to -- I guess go back to some of the information you provided on kind of -- I guess, the earnings drag from the lost occupancy this year. Just to be clear, if you took the $0.30 hit from the interest expense and now you're sort of quantifying this $0.25 to $0.30 hit from the known vacate, some of which I know has been released and will rebound maybe in '25 and beyond. You're kind of suggesting that there's sort of $0.60 drag this year as we think about '24 and then other positive offsets that might sort of take that number a little bit up from, say, the $2 level?"", 'Michael J. Franco', ""Yes. So look, in terms of your sort of detail there. I think that's accurate, right? We talked about interest last quarter and sort of reaffirmed the $0.30 this quarter. The $0.25 to $0.30 are sort of the known vacates and as we've mentioned, we've backfilled a lot of that already at 1290 and 280. Like we have a lot that we're working on. There's some things that could certainly make that number more positive. But I think we're trying to give you the downside version today. And so I can't tell you where exactly it's going to come out. But I think if you say, look, let's take sort of worst case, the $0.30 plus the [25 to 30] gets you down $0.55 to $0.60. I think that's a good baseline. And our objective is to beat that, but there's still a lot moving around."", 'Steven Roth', ""Steve, let me just tack on, on that for a second. So I mean, the numbers that you mentioned that and that Michael just mentioned, they're accurate for this year. Let's build from there and see what the company's future looks like on an almost certain basis. So if you start with re-renting the vacancies and we get back from whatever we are now to our normal 96%, 97%, 98% occupancy, that adds a big number to our earnings. When 2 PENN comes online, that's another $100 million give or take of earnings that comes online that is brand new. If interest rates settle down into some kind of stabilized number, that also improves earnings enormously. So the company has the earnings potential of being, we think, pretty spectacular. And that's what we're shooting for. So we're looking at it not 1 month on quarter basis, we're looking at what the company's earning power would be pick a number 2, 3 years out, okay? And we are extremely excited about that."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.', 'John P. Kim', 'Michael, in your prepared remarks, you talked about tech sector coming back to the market in Manhattan and also referenced retailers potentially looking to purchase their flagship stores similar to Prada. Is your commentary more of a market commentary? Or do you see Vornado involved in either one of those 2?', 'Michael J. Franco', ""I think it's both, John. I mean we've got some of the best product in town in both categories. I think we've done more tech leasing than any other landlord in the city. We have all the big 4 in our portfolio. So we maintain an active dialogue with all those players. So I would expect that if the tech sector becomes active again, we're going to get more than our fair share. And in terms of the pipeline, I think the tech sector was pretty dormant for the last 18, 24 months, either on pause or in some cases, downsizing space. And we've seen in the last 90 days, a real pickup there, started small and now we're seeing some more significant requirements. So we do think some of those will convert to activity, and we're quite optimistic about that sector turning on again. On the retail side, I think you know better than anybody, given the discussions we've had in the past. We own the best retail in the city. So if you want to be on Fifth Avenue, particularly given the shrinking amount of availability, that's -- can be leased. We're the first, second, third call Times Square. We own both sides (inaudible). So activity level has picked up significantly in both those submarkets, the animal spirits are alive and well amongst retailers. They see the Manhattan is thriving again, their sales numbers reflected and Prada and Kering's announcements obviously garner worldwide attention. And I think make every other retailer question, what are we doing, right, both from a leasing standpoint and buying standpoint. There's obviously been other transactions rumored but I don't think you've seen the last of the retail purchases. And obviously, given our portfolio, we're fertile ground. So we expect to be in the mix there."", 'John P. Kim', 'Okay. And my follow-up is on 350 Park Avenue. The leasing environment and the interest rate environment or the outlook has changed a lot in the past 1.5 years since you struck the deal. What is the likelihood that either Citadel or you exercise your options at this point?', 'Steven Roth', ""There's always a likelihood. But right now, we're on full steam ahead to build a world-class headquarters for Citadel. We've started the public approval process. And it's a couple of year process to design the building, complete the drawings, get through the public approval process and obviously, we will reappraise the financial markets at that time. Citadel's growing. They want the space. They're committed to the deal as are we."", 'John P. Kim', 'And can you confirm the starting rent for Citadel is reported at $35 million?', 'Steven Roth', ""No, sir, we can't. It's a formulaic rent, which depends upon what the cost of financing is at the time that we -- at the time we go into the financing market."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from Michael Griffin with Citi.', 'Michael Anderson Griffin', ""Michael, I wanted to go back to your comments around concessions being stubbornly high. I imagine that's the case for the market overall. But if you look at maybe better off submarkets like Park Avenue or even some of your properties on the West side, the PENN District, how are you seeing concessions there given that the environment seems to have improved?"", 'Michael J. Franco', 'Glen, do you want to hit that?', 'Glen J. Weiss', ""Yes. Yes, sure. it's Glen. I would tell you no matter the submarket on new leases, TIs there's somewhere between $140, $150 a foot and free rent is somewhere in the 13-month, 15-month range. I think as it relates to submarket specific, it's really about the rent. So in some of the submarkets, we are seeing an uptick in rent where supply is tightening as you would expect."", 'Michael Anderson Griffin', ""Got you. That's helpful. And then maybe just some color on lease expirations this year. It looks like there's a big one in the second quarter, about 3% of the overall rent. The space rent there right now seems pretty high. What's the likelihood of renewing or backfilling the space? Or is this one of those known move-outs that you described earlier?"", 'Glen J. Weiss', ""It's the Meta space that comes back to us in June that we spoke about on our last earnings call. That's the least you're pertaining to."", 'Michael Anderson Griffin', ""And in terms of potential of backfilling or new in the space, what's demand looking like on it?"", 'Glen J. Weiss', ""We have action on this space. That's part of our pipeline that we've described. We feel very good about the asset and very good about backfilling that space. It's the most unique asset in Midtown South, we feel good about it."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from Floris Van Dijkum with Compass Point.', 'Floris Gerbrand Hendrik Van Dijkum', ""Rather than get into the details on the leasing, which obviously is very important as well. But I wanted to ask a question on sort of the market and get Steve and Michael's view on the opportunity that's going to be presenting itself, I think, when the $200 billion of office loans mature over the next -- actually, in '24 as well as the other $100 billion next year. What do you see happening with some of those obviously are unlikely to be refinanced. And so where do you see Vornado in that situation? Do you have -- can you play a role in maybe buying some assets? And maybe does that hope -- cause some of the bullishness in Steve's tone on the outlook for the next 2 years?"", 'Michael J. Franco', ""So like, I think in terms of the debt rolling over, which is significant over the next 2 years, as we all know, the capital markets are not there to support refinancing the vast majority of that. And so I think what happens there is going to take one of a few forms. It depends on the quality asset, the sponsor of the asset and what its future looks like. And we've seen some examples where the older obsolete buildings, where debt rolls doesn't have a future is an office building or certainly with that sponsor and the lenders have taken it back or there's been a consensual sale of some of those assets, something like a 1740 Broadway would be a recent example. So I think we'll see a fair amount of that on some of those older buildings. Then there's a category where they just over leverage where there is a future. And again, I think the lender will assess whether the sponsor has the wherewithal and the capability to either re-tenant or support the asset. And in some cases, they will, in many cases, they won't. We're talking to the lenders about that. And I think they'll look for solutions, right? I think lenders in general know that taking back assets and operating them certainly in the office space is not a winning strategy. Value deteriorates fairly quickly. Tenants don't want to go into those buildings. So we do think there's going to be opportunity to work with existing lenders, be a solutions provider. We have a leading operating platform. We expect to deploy capital there. And I think it could be in either one of those buckets. It could be buildings that are -- that with our capabilities can be leased back up, stabilize, the value could be created or it can be assets that can be repurposed from office to residential potentially. So the answer is we are actively looking. We expect to play in that. And I think we're still at the beginning stages."", 'Floris Gerbrand Hendrik Van Dijkum', ""And I know it's early in terms of what transactions would look like. But presumably, for you to utilize part of your significant cash awards, which again sets you apart from some of your peers, you would have to have, I would imagine, returns that are in excess of the 7% plus financing rates that you would have to pay today if you were to theoretically get assets. Is that the right way to think about it? Your returns..."", 'Michael J. Franco', ""Yes. I mean, look, I think our objective of deploying cash is not to invest in real estate is going to generate core returns, right? And this is an opportunity that is by the way, not for the faint of heart, right? I mean, you're taking risk and you want to get rewarded for that. So the returns need to be attractive. So yes, I think the stabilized yields, I think it depends a little bit on the nature of the asset and where you think ultimate cap rates settle out for particular assets. But no question that the required yield are in the neighborhood that you mentioned."", 'Floris Gerbrand Hendrik Van Dijkum', 'Great. Maybe one follow-up in terms of your retail segment, again, particularly your Fifth Avenue, which is, again, as you highlight, unique. Where do you think market rents are today? And I know you have -- 92%, I think, is your occupancy rate in your Time Square JV, sorry your Fifth Avenue in Times Square JV, but if you were to sign rent today in -- on Fifth Avenue, where would you say market rents are for that space?', 'Michael J. Franco', ""I think it's -- there's been a couple of transactions that we signed probably, I guess, last year. And now it indicates that rents at the time were in the mid- to high $2,000 per square foot, right? Now maybe there was a tick or a bottom in the $1,000, $1,500 neighborhood, but I think realistically, it's back into that mid-2s, maybe even low 3s, depending on the situation. And I think for luxury, given there's such a scarcity it could be higher. So Fifth Avenue, it's hard to paint a broad brush. It's a very scarce asset class. And for the right situation, you can command rents that not too far off the peak. For the wrong asset with retailers don't think it configures well, you can achieve that. So look, I think rents have recovered quite a bit. They're continuing to recover. Obviously, the Times Square lease we signed recently, I think, is evidence of that. And so we expect that to continue."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Dylan Burzinski with Green Street.', 'Dylan Robert Burzinski', 'I guess just sort of going back to the acquisition point. Is there any desire to -- given the lack of debt financing available out there, just sort of go into it from a debt perspective and possibly from a loan to own? Or is this purely as you guys are looking at things more so looking at things on the equity side today?', 'Steven Roth', ""The easiest way to buy a building is through the debt. So that's obviously target #1."", 'Dylan Robert Burzinski', 'Got it. And then as you guys think about opportunities, is this purely -- are you guys purely focused on office? Or are there other retail opportunities that you guys think would also make sense?', 'Steven Roth', ""We're open to buy office, obviously, and retail, obviously. So those are the 2 areas that we specialize in."", 'Dylan Robert Burzinski', 'And then I guess just a broader capital allocation question. I know in the past, you guys have floated opportunistically selling assets. I guess, is that still on the table? Or are you guys now more focused on sort of going out and acquiring assets and growing the company on an external growth basis?', 'Steven Roth', 'We have, I think, basically 4 fairly significant sale transactions that are in various stages of conversation right now as we speak.', 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.', 'Alexander David Goldfarb', ""So 2 questions here. And first, Michael, good to hear about the rebound in street retail rents. That's really amazing what a journey it's been. So the first question is Steve, on the Bloomberg lease, so when we read the Q, the rents that are cited in there are basically a sliding scale that a negotiation in the future will address. So it's not as though we take that the one rent and then it slides up to the next. It's -- that's the range that the negotiation will be in?"", 'Steven Roth', ""Alex, you still published something that said there was a 25% discount in the rent. I don't know how you got that math and that's incorrect. So the way the deal is structured is, the basic rent on that building is basically net. There's a very small portion, maybe 50,000 feet out of the 950,000 feet that's growth. But 900,000 feet of it is net. So let's call it a net lease. The lease has a bump between now and 2029. And so when we get to the end of 2029, where we basically start, the net rent is $98 a foot, which grosses up to well into the $150 a foot. So that's the starting point. Now we established -- first of all, you recognize that we are renewing and extending a lease 5 years before the mature -- before the lease expires. And so you have to take -- affect the future -- unknown future and the contingency. So what we did there was we established what the tenant concessions, TIs and leasing commissions for, those are frozen. The starting rent is frozen. And then from that, there is a market-based appraisal as to what the proper market rate would be if we did (inaudible) then expiry of the lease in 2029, taking into account the already established tenant concession. But the color is though that it can't be more than 10% more than the $98 a foot net or 10% less. So we have certainty on the bottom is what the rent would be and it will be established as the fair rent in the [zen] market, which we think was a very clever. By the way, both tenant landlord think was a fair deal and a clever way of handling the future. There's nothing in this deal whatsoever that contemplates any reduction in the rent. It will be a arbitration on the market."", 'Alexander David Goldfarb', ""Steve, thank you, and I apologize for getting that incorrect. That was -- my apologies. So your clarification is that the rent that's cited it..."", 'Steven Roth', ""Wait a second, I accept your apology. That's very generous of you."", 'Alexander David Goldfarb', ""Well, [I mean it]. So basically, the way the rent is characterized now is the $29 million a quarter is characterized as gross, whereas the rents that are in the queue for the terms are now net. And it sounds like that's the confusion that I had on my end. Is that correct?"", 'Steven Roth', ""I won't get into why you were confused. I'm just happy that you admit that you were confused."", 'Alexander David Goldfarb', ""Okay, Great. The next question is on the rents for this year to Steve Sakwa's question, Michael, you mentioned that originally it was down $0.25 to $0.30. Now it seems to be down $0.55 based on further lease move-outs, what have you. Was there some stuff that fell out of bed that was unexpected? Or what -- or did I not hear correctly? I just want to understand like was there stuff that came up and surprised? Or what drove -- what's driving the additional earnings impact this year?"", 'Michael J. Franco', ""Yes, yes. Maybe a little bit more confusion there, Alex. On the last call, we talked about that it was early in the year. I gave clarity on the interest reduction because a lot of that was baked in with hedges that were going to roll off. We knew those where those are going to roll off to. And we mentioned that there would be an impact from the known move-outs, right? And cited what those were. But obviously, there's a lot moving out. So it was -- we didn't quantify what the impact of those numbers were. We're quantifying that for everybody's benefit on this call. So I don't think -- no surprises, right, just trying to put a little more precision on it now that we're in May as opposed to where we were. And look, there's going to be more that moves around and that number could be less. But I think in terms of where we sit today, we have a known set between particularly 1290, 770, 280 that drive the bulk of that. Obviously, we've talked about re-leasing a lot of that and a lot of those deals have been announced. But just trying to get more precision to just the general statement we made last quarter."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from Michael Lewis with Truist Securities.', 'Michael Robert Lewis', ""I'm just going to follow up on that question about the re-leasing activity on some of the known move-outs. So I could probably triangulate an occupancy rate on that $0.25 drag. But could you share -- maybe just share how much square footage is related to known move-outs this year? And how much of that square footage you've already addressed?"", 'Steven Roth', 'Do anyone want to take that or I take that?', 'Glen J. Weiss', ""So the bulk of the number is at 280 Park, 770 Broadway and 1290 Avenue Americas. At 1290 and 280, we've taken care of as Michael said in his remarks, 51% of the role, so call it 500,000 of 1 million feet. And as we said at 770 Broadway, we have Meta rolling in June. Along with the current vacancy, we have pipeline activity on that space. So that's how we're approaching the big ones that are in that occupancy number. So as we've taken into account our pipeline of deals, as we take into account our expirations going through '24, we may see more of a dip in occupancy. And as we complete transactions during the next 6 to 9 months, we expect that occupancy to then climb back as we get into 2025."", 'Michael Robert Lewis', ""And then my second question is about THE MART. So occupancy dips down to 77.6% in the most recent quarter, prepandemic, that was always 95% to 100%. Could you maybe talk a little bit about kind of the road map there? And what you think stabilized occupancy or given that there's obviously some volatility with that asset. What may be like a stabilized kind of revenue figure might look like for THE MART?"", 'Michael J. Franco', ""So I'll start, Glen, you jump in. Like the Chicago market is obviously challenging right now, probably one of the more challenging ones in the country. But we do have decent activity on the asset. I would say that alluding to some of the prior questions, there's quite a bit of distress in Chicago office. Many landlords do not have the wherewithal to lease our assets given the debt situation there. We have an asset that has no debt on it. And so I think the sponsorship, the strength is well known by the brokers and the tenants, and I think that's helping us. We just finished what we call MART 2.0, which is the second stage of amenities that we have put in business conferencing, et cetera. And again, the reaction has been positive. So the market is tough, cannot dismiss that. But I think we're seeing more than our fair share there. And I think that's going to take probably 3 years to get back to stabilized occupancy realistically, maybe it's 2. But I think when the income fully comes online, it's probably in the neighborhood. And our objective is to get it back into the 90s percent occupied, get a 95-plus percent and get the income back up to that $90 million to $100 million cash NOI basis. So there's a fair amount of growth to come there. But the market is, as I said, challenging right now."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs.', 'Julien Blouin', 'This is Julien on for Caitlin. One quick one. Can you comment on whether the leasing spreads in the quarter benefited from the PENN District leasing? And what that leasing spread might have been ex-PENN leases?', 'Michael J. Franco', ""Yes. I think the answer is that the spreads, PENN 2 is majorly soccer with the big lease in this quarter. That's a new lease, first generation. So didn't affect the spread."", 'Julien Blouin', ""Okay. Good to know. And then a second one on the debt covenant, it looked like interest coverage and fixed charge coverage tightened a bit in the quarter. I know longer term, the metric is going to benefit from the occupancy gain you've talked about from PENN District NOI. And it also sounds like you have some sales underway. But can you give us a sense of maybe the trajectory over the coming quarters given the fact that -- I know there's that sort of big swap expiration at 555 Cal?"", 'Michael J. Franco', ""Yes. No, you're accurate. I think the impact this quarter was predominantly -- the big item was the swap increase on PENN 11 this year coming up. I think if I go from recollection, I think it was 17 basis points, though, too bad that couldn't go forever. But that was the material item this quarter, a couple of other things as well. But that was a big one. Next quarter, second quarter, if you will, you're accurate 555. We put in place another swap that would kick in an increase. So as we look forward, we continue to have sufficient cushion in our covenants, fixed charge will tighten up over the next couple of quarters, but we still have [vision] buffer there. And then as the income comes online from some of these leases that number will grow again. But it will tighten up a little bit based on the 555 swap rate increase."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.', 'Nicholas Philip Yulico', ""I just wanted to go back to the $0.25, $0.30 impact this year from vacancy. So I guess that adds up to about $55 million, $60 million of NOI versus your total NOI share last year of $1.14 billion. So it's somewhere like a 5% NOI loss on that math, that's correct. So I guess I'm just wondering, how does that -- are there other moving parts here besides just some of the vacancy impact you talked about? Because if I look at your supplement, in the fourth quarter, you had 5% of your rent expiring in New York, and you're obviously not all expiring. So the 5% NOI loss number seems a little bit high relative to what your expirations were this year."", 'Michael J. Franco', ""There may be one tenant that expired December 31 last year. But like I think in a nutshell, that's it. I mean it's pure and simple. The vast majority of it is 1296, 280 Park and 770 and you get to that sort of number. I mean there's a little bit of positives, a little bit of negatives, but those are the 3 main drivers. So we just -- we came through a period where there were some known move-outs, and we're backfilling those as we discussed. But that's it. And it just occurred at various stages everywhere from December 31 through probably the last one is Meta, which is in the middle of this year."", 'Nicholas Philip Yulico', ""Okay. And then I just wanted to be clear on the way to think about occupancy and Michael, last quarter when you're talking about sort of a flattish occupancy this year. Does that mean that by the time we get to the fourth quarter of this year, it's a sort of a flat year-over-year occupancy? I'm assuming it's not a sort of average occupancy for the year that would be flat year-over-year based on that."", 'Michael J. Franco', ""Yes. Yes. I would say by the end of the year, I mean, again, it depends on timing of certain things. And I don't know that I can [pay you] with precision. This will happen by the fourth quarter as opposed to January, what not. But we think rough numbers will end up there. So -- but we'll see, there's still -- we're still in the first half of the year, and we just have to see how it plays out. But I think like occupancy, it's down now. It's going to trend down a little bit more, given, for example, the Meta move-out in June, but we have some other things in the works that we can pick that up. So we'll see where it comes out in total. I think as we look at the front line, it will -- we think it increased meaningfully over time. We are going to bring PENN 2 into the numbers next year. Depending on where we are from a leasing standpoint there, that number could bring the average down. But obviously, that's sort of an extraneous event being added to the denominator. So we'll evaluate it as we get closer."", 'Operator', 'The next question is a follow-up from Michael Lewis with Truist.', 'Michael Robert Lewis', ""I just have one more. You sold 2 condo units at 220 Central Park South for about $32 million. Are the remaining 4 units similar in value, roughly $16 million a unit? I don't know if you have -- maybe you have a penthouse left or you have smaller units. I was just wondering about that."", 'Steven Roth', ""No. The remaining 4 units are smaller, lower view impaired, so they're much less valuable. Basically, that job is basically sold out."", 'Operator', 'The next question is a follow-up from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.', 'Alexander David Goldfarb', ""Thank you. Steve, with the new office to conversion incentives, does this open the door for you to contemplate either assets from the existing portfolio or perhaps assets that are -- that you've always eyed is would be great for conversion and seem to maybe have a motivated owner who would be willing. Just seems like the incentive package that they passed is pretty lucrative for office landlords to convert."", 'Steven Roth', ""Alex, yes, the answer is yes, of course. So there's a couple of things. First of all, the building that you're going to be converting, the target building has the price somewhere in the neighborhood of [some $200 a foot or sub-$200 a foot]. So these are really distressed office building. They're not -- they're distressed office building. Let me leave it at that. So the pricing and the economics really don't allow you to pay more, maybe even a pinch more, but probably not. So that's step number one. Step number 2 is, is that obviously, if those are the economics and those are the target building, these are the B and C buildings in the office market. So when those buildings are taken out of the conventional office market, they really don't tell the prime A market because the tenants that we deal is who are interested in A space don't really ever look at that. So the answer is, is that we will be able to, as an industry, convert a decent number of buildings. It will make a dent -- not a big dent, but a dent in the residential market and the demand for residential space. But it will have a marginal effect on the conventional Class A open market. But clearly, we're looking at that. It's an interesting activity and it's something that we will look at. I'm not 100% sure that the returns on capital are going to be what some people think they are. But anyway, we are looking at it pretty aggressively."", 'Operator', 'Thank you very much. There are no further questions at this time.', 'Steven Roth', ""Okay. Thank you all very much. We appreciate you joining us this morning, and we will be anxious to -- we always learn from these calls, and so thank you for that. We are excited about the next -- the quarter and the future, and we'll see you in the next earnings call. Thank you."", 'Operator', ""Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.""]"

The cost of revenue also saw an uptick, but the firm managed to maintain a healthy gross profit margin, with gross profit rising from $113,818 to $182,207. Net income attributable to common stockholders showed a promising leap from $31,512 to $64,846, reflecting a strong bottom line. These financials indicate Celsius Holdings Inc's solid market presence and operational efficiency, setting the stage for a detailed SWOT analysis."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with CELH.', ""Brand Power and Market Growth: Celsius Holdings Inc's revenue surge is a testament to its strong brand presence and market acceptance. The company's focus on natural ingredients and metabolism-enhancing formulations resonates with the growing health-conscious consumer base. The strategic partnership with PepsiCo, which holds an 8.5% stake, has significantly expanded distribution capabilities, allowing Celsius to tap into PepsiCo's extensive network and boost market penetration. This collaboration is not just a distribution advantage but also a vote of confidence from a beverage industry titan."", ""Innovative Product Portfolio: Celsius Holdings Inc's product innovation, including the Celsius Originals, Celsius Essentials, and On-the-Go powder packets, caters to diverse consumer preferences. The company's commitment to research and development is evident in its proprietary MetaPlus formulation, which differentiates its offerings from competitors. The introduction of the CELSIUS Essentials line and the expansion of the ready-to-drink and powder forms have broadened the product mix, catering to various consumption occasions and lifestyle needs."", ""Financial Health: The company's financials reflect a strong balance sheet with a notable increase in net income and comprehensive income.

The financial health of Celsius Holdings Inc is further bolstered by its ability to manage costs effectively, as seen in the proportional increase in gross profit relative to revenue growth."", ""Product Concentration Risk: Despite its strong market position, Celsius Holdings Inc's reliance on a single product line of energy drinks exposes it to risks associated with changing consumer tastes and market dynamics. Diversification into other beverage categories or product lines could mitigate this risk and ensure long-term stability."", ""High Promotional Allowance: The company's promotional allowance as a reduction of revenue is substantial, with $95.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $65.5 million for the same period in 2023.

The global energy drink market is expanding, and Celsius's unique positioning allows it to capture market share in new territories, leveraging its health-focused brand image."", ""Innovation and Product Line Extension: The company's strong R&D focus provides an opportunity to innovate further and extend its product line. Developing new flavors, formulations, and packaging options can attract new customers and meet the evolving demands of existing ones. Additionally, venturing into adjacent categories like non-caffeinated functional beverages could diversify the product portfolio and reduce risk."", ""Health and Wellness Trend: The rising trend in health and wellness aligns with Celsius Holdings Inc's product offerings.

Celsius Holdings Inc must continuously innovate and market effectively to maintain its market position against competitors like Red Bull and Monster Beverage Corporation.', ""Regulatory Risks: The beverage industry is subject to stringent regulations, and any changes in labeling requirements, health claims, or ingredient approvals could impact Celsius's product formulations and marketing strategies.

However, the company faces challenges in product concentration and reliance on key partnerships. Opportunities for global expansion and product innovation are promising, but threats from intense competition and regulatory changes loom.

I’m also bullish on VDC based on its low fee, long dividend history, and the strong Smart Scores its top holdings boast.', 'VDC was launched by index fund pioneer Vanguard more than 20 years ago, in January 2004. In that time, the fund has grown to $6.5 billion in assets under management (AUM). According to Vanguard, VDC “seeks to track the performance of a benchmark index that measures the investment return of stocks in the consumer staples sector.”', 'VDC’s underlying index “includes stocks of companies that provide direct-to-consumer products that, based on consumer spending habits, are considered nondiscretionary.”', 'We’ll get into what types of stocks this encompasses in the section below.', 'VDC owns 105 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 60.7% of the fund.\xa0Below, you’ll find an overview of VDC’s top 10 holdings from TipRanks’ holdings tool.', 'As you can see, VDC owns a group of high-profile, blue-chip U.S. consumer staples stocks.', 'The fund owns the makers of everyday household staples like detergents, deodorants, soaps, shampoos, and more, like Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Colgate-Palmolive. These companies may not sound like the most exciting in the world, but they sell products that people need every day and are loath to cut from their budgets. This puts them in a strong position no matter how the economic tides ebb and flow from one day to the next.', 'Colgate recently shook off inflation and economic uncertainty to report strong 9.8% organic sales growth for the first quarter and increased pricing of 8.5%, encapsulating the strength these consumer staples stalwarts have in this environment. Colgate also used the strong start to the year as an opportunity to increase revenue guidance for the year.', 'Meanwhile, VDC has positions in soft drink giants like Coca-Cola and Pepsi (NASDAQ:PEP), which sell the sodas and other drinks that many people consume on a daily basis, regardless of how the macro economy is doing or where interest rates stand.', 'Like Colgate, Coca-Cola recently reported earnings and overcame any macroeconomic challenges, beating on both revenue and earnings. Coca-Cola says that it expects to grow organic revenue by an impressive 8-9% this year, along with comparable currency-neutral EPS growth of 11% to 13%.', 'Tobacco stocks like Philip Morris and Altria (NYSE:MO) are in a similarly strong position, as tobacco users buy their products on a routine, habitual basis and are unlikely to eschew this habit just because the economy is slow. Inflation and the uncertain economy aren’t hurting demand for Philip Morris’ red-hot nicotine pouch product Zyn, which saw shipment volume increase by an incredible 79.7% year-over-year during its first quarter of the year.', 'Big box retailers like Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) are competitive in any type of economic environment, thanks to their low-cost offerings.', 'Lastly, Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ), the maker of popular snacks like Oreos and Chips Ahoy! is the type of company many consumers will buy products from as an affordable pick-me-up when they may not be able to afford other luxuries in a down economy.', 'Other notable VDC holdings from beyond the top 10 include Hershey, Keurig Dr Pepper (NYSE:KDP), Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST), and Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH). Hershey just reported impressive first-quarter earnings in which it brushed off rising cocoa prices to beat estimates. Its earnings grew 3.7% year-over-year, and revenue increased 8.7%. ', 'As these results show, top consumer staples stocks like these have strong brands and persistent demand to succeed during a challenging macroeconomic environment.', 'In addition to these resilient business models and strong demand, another thing that VDC’s top holdings have in common is their strong Smart Scores.\xa0The Smart Score is a proprietary quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from 1 to 10 based on eight market key factors. A score of 8 or above is equivalent to an Outperform rating.', 'Eight out of VDC’s top 10 holdings have Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores of 8 or above, and VDC itself has an Outperform-equivalent ETF Smart Score of 8 out of 10.', 'Whether it’s Pepsi and Coca-Cola or Altria and Philip Morris, many of VDC’s top holdings are lauded for their long dividend histories, so it’s no surprise that VDC is a dividend payer.', 'VDC currently yields 2.5%. While it’s not a huge dividend yield, it trumps that of the S&P 500 (SPX), which yields 1.4%. Plus, VDC has a reliable track record as a dividend payer, having made dividend payments to its holders for 18 years in a row.', 'Like many of its Vanguard peers, it features a modest expense ratio of just 0.10% (a 0.09% management fee plus 0.01% in other expenses). This means that an investor in the fund will pay just $10 in fees on an investment of $10,000 annually.', 'Over time, investing in low-cost funds like this can save investors a considerable amount of money. Assuming the fund returns 5% per year going forward and maintains its current expense ratio, the investor putting $10,000 into the fund will pay just $128 in fees over a 10-year time frame.', 'How does this help investors to save? Let’s compare VDC to another consumer staples ETF with a higher expense ratio, the iShares U.S. Consumer Staples ETF (NYSEARCA:IYK), which has $1.3 billion in AUM and charges an expense ratio of 0.40%. An investor putting $10,000 into IYK will pay $40 in fees annually, and assuming the same parameters as above, this investor will pay a much higher $505 in fees over a 10-year time horizon, illustrating the considerable savings offered by a low-cost fund like VDC.', 'Below, you can check out a comparison of VDC and IYK using TipRanks’ ETF Comparison Tool, which allows users to compare up to 20 ETFs at a time based on a variety of inputs.', 'Turning to Wall Street, VDC earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 56 Buys, 43 Holds, and six Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average VDC stock price target of $220.16 implies 8.8% upside potential.', 'I’m bullish on consumer staples and VDC in particular. The economy goes through ups and downs, and the stock market ebbs and flows, but consumers always need the basics that consumer staples companies sell, whether it’s their favorite soft drink from Coca-Cola or Pepsi or toothpaste from Colgate-Palmolive. It may not be the sexiest sector, but these companies have strong and consistent earnings and revenue.', 'Throughout earnings season, we’ve seen companies like Coca-Cola, Hershey, Philip Morris, Colgate-Palmolive, and other consumer staples names prove this.', 'I’m also bullish on VDC, specifically because of its holdings’ strong Smart Scores, low expense ratio, and attractive dividend.', 'Disclosure']"

The results are from the ongoing Phase 1/2 CHORD trial, which is currently enrolling infants and children and were detailed during an oral presentation at the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy (ASGCT) annual conference.', '“The opportunity of providing the full complexity and spectrum of sound in children born with profound genetic deafness is a phenomenon I did not expect to see in my lifetime,” said Lawrence R. Lustig, M.D., Chair of Columbia University’s Department of Otolaryngology - Head & Neck Surgery and a clinical trial investigator. “These impressive results showcase the revolutionary promise of DB-OTO as a potential treatment for otoferlin-related deafness, and we are excited to see how this translates into an individual’s development, especially since early intervention is associated with better outcomes for speech development. With the DB-OTO CHORD trial now enrolling participants in sites across the U.S. and Europe, we’re part of the beginning of a new era of gene therapy research that looks to create treatment options that address the root cause of profound genetic deafness.”', 'In the trial, both children received a single intracochlear injection of DB-OTO in one ear. The surgical procedure leverages the same approach used for cochlear implants, which is amenable for use in young infants. Hearing improvements were assessed by pure tone audiometry (PTA) and auditory brainstem response (ABR). PTA is considered by auditory experts to be the gold standard measurement of hearing and is measured through behavioral confirmation of sound (e.g., turning head towards sound) emitted at different intensity levels (measured in decibels or dB). ABR corroborates these behavioral responses, serving as an objective confirmation of hearing function, by measuring electrical brainstem responses to sound emitted at different dBs.', 'At baseline, both participants had no behavioral (PTA) or electrophysiological (ABR) responses at maximum sound levels (≥100 dB). Following treatment with DB-OTO, both children showed auditory responses at the first efficacy assessment of 4 weeks.', 'As presented at ASGCT, the first participant dosed in the trial was 16 months of age at the 24-week assessment and showed:', 'Improvement of hearing to normal levels across key speech frequencies, with an average 84 dB improvement from baseline and one frequency measure reaching 10 dB in hearing level per PTA. Across all tested frequencies, an average 80 dB improvement from baseline was observed.', 'Positive ABR responses, with best frequency reaching 45 dB.', 'The second participant dosed in the trial was 4 years of age at the 6-week assessment and experienced consistent results to the first participant at the same timepoint, including:', 'Initial improvement of hearing with responses to loud sounds, which was observed across key speech frequencies, with an average 19 dB improvement from baseline and one frequency measure reaching 80 dB in hearing level per PTA. Across all tested frequencies, an average 16 dB improvement from baseline was observed.', 'Positive ABR responses, with best frequency reaching 75 dB.', 'Both the surgical procedure (delivery and post-operation) and DB-OTO were well tolerated, and there were no related adverse events or serious adverse events following treatment.', 'DB-OTO received Orphan Drug, Rare Pediatric Disease and Fast Track Designations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Orphan Drug Designation was granted by the European Medicines Agency. The potential use of DB-OTO for otoferlin-related hearing loss is currently under clinical investigation, and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.', 'About Otoferlin-related Hearing LossCongenital deafness (hearing loss present at birth) is a significant unmet medical need that affects approximately 1.7 out of every 1,000 children born in the U.S. Although approximately half of these cases have genetic causes, otoferlin-related hearing loss is ultra-rare. This specific condition is caused by variants in the otoferlin gene, which impairs the production of the OTOF protein that is critical for the communication between the sensory cells of the inner ear and the auditory nerve. While hearing aids and cochlear implants can amplify sound to improve hearing for individuals with a range of hearing loss, these devices do not currently restore the full spectrum of sound.', 'About the CHORD TrialThe CHORD trial (NCT# 05788536) is a Phase 1/2 first-in-human, multicenter, open-label trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of DB-OTO in infants, children and adolescents with otoferlin variants.', 'Currently enrolling children across sites in the U.S., United Kingdom and Spain (<18 years of age; staggered by age in the U.S.), CHORD is being conducted in two parts. In the initial dose-escalation cohort (Part A), participants will receive a single intracochlear injection of DB-OTO in one ear, while in expansion cohort (Part B), participants will receive simultaneous single intracochlear injections of DB-OTO in both ears at the selected dose from Part A.', 'Additional information about the trial, including enrollment, can be obtained by contacting clinicaltrials@regeneron.com.', 'About DB-OTO and the Regeneron Auditory ProgramDB-OTO is an investigational cell-selective, adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy designed to provide durable, physiological hearing to individuals with profound, congenital hearing loss caused by variants of the otoferlin gene. The treatment aims to deliver a working copy to replace the faulty otoferlin gene using a modified, non-pathogenic virus that is delivered via an injection into the cochlea under general anesthesia (similar to the procedure used for cochlear implantation). In this gene therapy, the newly introduced otoferlin gene is under the control of a proprietary cell-specific Myo15 promoter, which is intended to restrict expression only to inner hair cells that normally express otoferlin.', 'The ongoing CHORD trial is Regeneron’s first clinical-stage auditory program. In addition to DB-OTO, AAV.103 is also being investigated for people with GJB2-related hearing loss.', 'About RegeneronRegeneron\xa0(NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents,\xa0develops\xa0and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

If you wish to skip our analysis of transportation sector of the world and the metro rail infrastructure market, you can go directly to 5 Largest Metro Networks in The World.', 'Growth of cities has been phenomenal in the recent times, with more and more people starting to live in cities. As of 2023, round about 56% of the world’s population, equaling 4.4 billion people, are residing in cities, according to World Bank. However, rapid growth in urbanization requires efficient transportation networks across cities. Thus, the need to curtail traffic congestion issues, and the need to up the overall public transit system because of increasing urbanization, have driven the global public transit sector – the market struck $215.54 billion mark in 2022, and further projections indicate towards a whopping 7.6% annual growth rate of the market from 2023 to 2030! In terms of the overall transportation system, Stockholm (Sweden), Helsinki (Finland), and Zurich (Switzerland) are 3 cities of the world with the best public transit system, according to Insider Monkey article. Moreover, London (U.K.), Copenhagen (Denmark), and Berlin (Germany) are few others which are ranked amongst the best in Europe, and in the world, as well.', 'As such, the metro network becomes highly relevant to our discussion, as it is increasingly preferred by the people because of its reliability and environmentally efficient aspect. Moreover, metro network also results in significant reduction of traffic jams and pollution. In U.S. alone, in 2022, 134 billion gallons of gasoline was burnt out through the consumption of it in the transportation sector, which caused 1,476 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions, which results in climatic issues like global warming, according to Coltura.', 'The metro rail infrastructure market hit the $46.8 billion mark in 2023, with further expectations saying that it will continue to grow 6% annually, till 2032, according to Global Market Insights. The projection of the market is based on the increasing urbanization and resultant growth in cities. Moreover, environmentally friendly modes of doing anything is preferred in today’s era, and hence, more investments are put into transportation network, which requires a great deal of long-term commitment, to be transitioned into greener industry – and metro networks are one way to do it. For example, a new installation, the Grand Paris Express, is planned for the Paris Métro, which would add up a range of 120 miles through 4 new lines and 68 new stations.', 'According to a report from McKinsey, Asia is expected to spend the most money on building new metro and light-rail systems. Between the time frame of 2019 to 2025, they had put forward a goal to invest around $920 billion, back in 2020; the Middle East and Europe regions are also aiming to spend a lot, between $135 and $145 billion each. Few cities which are hoping to transition their rail system the most are Beijing, Kuala Lumpur, Shenzhen, and Singapore, each planning at least one rail project worth more than $5 billion, according to McKinsey.', ""In 2023, North America was seen to be involved in betterment of its metro network system. Money from the federal, state, and local governments is key for planning, building, and keeping up with metro systems. For example, in November 2023, the Biden Administration granted $1.64 billion to help expand the Metro-North Railroad's Penn Station access, which included addition of four new stations in the Bronx."", 'Major companies in the US market are actively pursuing strategic initiatives to uphold and expand their market presence.

Baur', ""Thanks, Mary. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. In the third quarter, our people responded well in a challenging demand environment. However, we were surprised at our lower-than-expected net sales for our hardware business. Third quarter net sales declined 15% due to lower demand from our channel partners across our portfolio of technologies. Our strong margins and robust free cash flow reflect the strength of our business fundamentals. We operate in highly specialized technology markets with value-added profit margins because of our expertise. ScanSource benefits from this deep knowledge of our sales and supplier services teams, specific value-added tools and working capital investment that is countercyclical with sales volumes. With our hybrid distribution strategy, we are committed to helping our channel partners execute on the expanded opportunity to sell devices and recurring revenues. For our fiscal year 2024, we identified strong free cash flow and focus on Intelisys as important to management and our shareholders. Again, this quarter, we achieved this aim with free cash flow of $158 million and Intelisys growth of 4% year-over-year. Q3 end user billings for Intelisys increased 7% year-over-year and totaled $2.68 billion annualized. This includes billings growth in Contact Center as a Service, or CCaaS, of 33% growth and UCaaS of 11%. We are expanding our investments in talent, training and tools to increase our value and drive growth as a technology services distributor. As reported by many channel companies and suppliers, we are experiencing softer demand. Our sales partners tell us that they are seeing a more cautious IT spending environment from end customers accompanied by longer sales cycles. For our third quarter, we expected broad-based declines across our hardware technologies. What surprised us, and what caused our revenue shortfall against our plan, was the significant decline in revenue from our networking products across the board, including Cisco networking. Our hardware portfolio is comprised of a diverse set of business-critical technologies. Right now, they are at different stages of their end customer demand cycles following the last 2 years of supply chain and pandemic disruption. We believe we are on a path to return to growth and have confidence in our team's ability to navigate the demand cycles with the support of our channel partners. In the near term, we see both macro uncertainty and the continuing normalization of supply and demand, creating a challenging forecasting environment. We generated another quarter of strong free cash flow and have a disciplined capital allocation plan of share repurchases and M&A. Our preferred use of free cash flow is to fund growth of high margin, recurring revenue businesses that are working capital light. I'll now turn the call over to Steve to take you through our financial results for the quarter and our outlook for fiscal year 2024."", 'Stephen T. Jones', ""Yes. Thanks, Mike. Q3 demand was weaker than we expected. While sales were lower, our business delivered strong gross profit and adjusted EBITDA margins. Free cash flow exceeded our projections for the quarter. Q3 net sales of $753 million declined 15% year-over-year, while our gross profit margin of 12.6% is higher than we expected, benefiting from a higher mix of recurring revenues.We expected softer demand across technologies in our Specialty Technology Solutions segment. For our networking business, we saw sharper declines than we anticipated. Segment net sales declined 14% year-over-year and our gross profits declined 22% year-over-year as we're seeing lower benefits from supplier price increases as compared to last year. In our Modern Communications & Cloud segment, revenues declined 16% year-over-year. Cisco networking sales declined as big deals stalled and demand adjusted for supply chain normalizing. Intelisys revenues grew 4% year-over-year. And our gross profit margins in Modern Communications & Cloud segment declined only 9% year-over-year, reflecting a favorable mix, including higher concentrations of recurring revenues from our Intelisys growth. For the quarter, we delivered $158 million in free cash flow. This reflects lower working capital needed when sales declined and our focus on balancing lasting improvements in our working capital efficiency, without sacrificing profitable growth opportunities. As we look to close our fiscal year, the company expects a challenging demand environment to continue, and we are updating our guidance to reflect our current views of near-term demand. As a reminder, we have very little backlog to give us indication of demand as we ship each day from our inventories based on orders received that day. We are managing our SG&A spending to match our revenue expectations for FY '24 and beyond by redirecting resources and investing in our Intelisys recurring revenue business. We continually review our resource investments. In January, we executed a workforce reduction plan to align our resources with our strategic plans. Q3 GAAP results include restructuring expenses related to employee separation and benefit expenses of $3.9 million. These actions are expected to result in annualized expense savings of approximately $10 million. For FY '24, we now believe that our net sales will be at least $3.3 billion, and our adjusted EBITDA will be at least $140 million, which reflects an EBITDA margin of approximately 4.25%. We are increasing our free cash flow outlook to at least $275 million. Our guidance reflects our expectations of the near-term demand environment. We remain confident in our growth opportunities, the resilience of our business model and the strength of our hybrid distribution strategy. Now going a bit deeper into the balance sheet and cash flows. We are pleased with the progress that we're making with working capital improvement plans. Our goal is to improve our working capital efficiency while maintaining appropriate inventory levels to meet channel partner demand. Q3 inventory turns of 4.8x were negatively impacted by the shortfall in revenue. Inventory levels have decreased $224 million and our paid for inventory days improved to 11.2. Days sales outstanding, DSO, of 71 days is a slight increase quarter-over-quarter, reflecting sales timing at the end of the quarter. Our balance sheet is very strong. We ended Q3 with $159 million in cash and net debt leverage ratio below 0 on a trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA basis. Our capital allocation plans, balanced acquisitions and share repurchases, while maintaining a strong balance sheet with modest levels of leverage. For Q3, share repurchases totaled $20 million. Today, we announced a new share repurchase authorization of $100 million. This is in addition to the $45 million of current authorization remaining as of the March quarter end. Our new repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors reflects our confidence in ScanSource's business and the strength of our long-term free cash flow generation. I'll now turn the call back over to Mike."", 'Michael L. Baur', ""Recently, after much research and market analysis, we identified several key trends affecting the future growth opportunities in our Intelisys business. Since ScanSource acquired Intelisys in 2016, the competitive landscape for our distribution business has been changing. During this time, consolidation reduced the number of TSD competitors from 16 down to 5 today. As we have discussed, we have experienced margin pressure in our Intelisys business, which lowers our Intelisys revenue growth results. However, even with the consolidation, Intelisys remains the largest technology services distributor in the business. During the last 24 months, we've also seen increasing consolidation in our agency partners. This activity also pressures margins. We haven't seen these agency roll-ups deliver innovation or new offerings to drive increased end customer demand. In addition, our TSD competitor have introduced various offers to acquire books of business and contracts from agencies. And in some cases, they acquired the agency itself. It is this last development that has convinced us to introduce our own offer to acquire contracts and agencies. Our partners have asked us repeatedly if we were interested in providing this value proposition to them. This offer would give our channel partners a way to take a few chips off the table or exit their business completely as the last stage in the agency business life cycle. So we announced that ScanSource would create a new business entity, separate from Intelisys, to be a platform for the channel model of the future. We are evaluating opportunities to acquire an existing agency that has a strong leadership team and fits with the ScanSource culture. Second, we are evaluating opportunities to acquire the digital tools our channel partners need to manage supplier and end user contracts. These contract management tools and other best practices we would develop in the new entity will be shared with the Intelisys channel. We expect to have more to share about our investments in the agency channel expansion soon. We look forward to launching the channel model of the future to help all our partners grow their businesses faster and better. We'll now open it up for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Greg Burns with Sidoti.', 'Gregory John Burns', 'In terms of the declines you saw in networking and from Cisco this quarter, I think Cisco has talked about a couple of quarters of backlog of inventory at their customers that still needs to be deployed. Do you have a view on that? How long do you see this hangover lasting on the working side of the business?', 'Tony Sorrentino', ""Greg, this is Tony Sorrentino. There's a lot of uncertainty around when this backlog gets worked through. It's a combination of softer demand and working through that backlog. So I don't know that we have a definitive answer on that."", 'Gregory John Burns', ""Okay. And then in terms of this new agency initiative on the -- for Intelisys, is there any risk of, I don't know, so maybe the industry works, but is there a risk of channel conflict? Any channel conflict there bringing an agency in-house versus servicing your broader agency partners? And what does that do for the margins for the overall Intelisys business?"", 'Michael L. Baur', ""Greg, it's Mike. I'll tackle that one. We absolutely are aware of the potential for channel conflict and actually, we've been doing some surveys of our channel partners just to understand how are our competitors doing this. Because we have learned that our competitors all are doing something like this in different models in different flavors. And we've asked that question, hey, are you concerned? And as it turns out, many of our partners are still working with those distributors that have also created a somewhat competitive model. So we looked at what others are doing. We believe we're creating something that has the right amount of separation. We're going to separate this NewCo, this new entity from Intelisys, so it will report to ScanSource not through Intelisys. We'll have a separate management team. Our goal is to firewall off any data between Intelisys partners and this new agency. And we've shared the idea with our partners before because we acquired a product called RPM that some of our investors remember back 2017 or '18, which is -- which became an industry standard commissioning tool that almost all of our competitors have used. And at the time, I met with each of our competitors and said, we'll firewall off the data, so Intelisys won't see your agency's data. And we've been successfully able to do that for many years. So we've got a track record of separating out the data, that would be the conflict. But we've also gone further. We said that we will make sure that before this new agency brings on a new -- we call it, a new logo, but let's say, a new end customer that they want to sell to, they'll first check within the ScanSource structure, and we'll have someone at the top who will look at the data and say, have we ever had -- or do we have a current Intelisys partners selling into that end customer? And if we see that we do, we'll immediately notify this Intelisys partner and let them know, hey, your customer is looking for a solution. Have you talked to him lately? And so we're going to do everything we know how to do to inform our partners first before we try to go in. So our primary goal here is to get a management team, learn how an agency can work in the future and do some things, frankly, that we don't see being done today in the channel. And then I'll let Steve maybe talk about the second part of that question, which is more about how does this affect margins."", 'Stephen T. Jones', ""Yes. Thanks, Mike. Greg, this is Steve Jones. When we look at the margin opportunity, what's happened in our space is margins have really started to get compressed on the Intelisys side as the agent is taking more of the margin share. So we think for ScanSource, this will help expand our margin opportunity in this agency channel. So that's the way we're looking at it. That's the way we're modeling it."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research.', 'Keith Michael Housum', 'Just obviously, want to continue the line of questioning here on the agency initiative. Mike, can you just give me a little perspective about today, like what is the makeup of the agency market? Are we primarily talking people, like 1 or 2 people and small million-dollar shops? Are we talking an end market that today does tens of millions of dollars of large shops? What kind of market are you guys getting into?', 'Michael L. Baur', ""Yes, Keith. Just as a reminder for everybody, we today have about, I'll just say, about 4,000 Intelisys partners doing business with us, and we have it widely distributed. And I would say the typical partner has 10 employees or less. And remember, their primary function as an agency is selling. They do have technical resources, but they have virtually no back office. Most of these agencies run off of QuickBooks, just to be honest, even the larger one. We process all the commissions, and the end users are billed by the suppliers. And so they don't really have to have a back office of any significance. So they're really sales organizations, and that's really what an agency does is they go out and work with end customers on opportunities for new. Where we think we see an opportunity, though, to help the existing partners is with renewals. One of the challenges is most agencies don't have an efficient way to scale over time renewals of contracts, as technologies change, they need to be renewed with new technologies, and as just contracts expire. So we think that's one of the advantages we can build. If we can build this contract management tool set that goes along with people, we believe we can show the rest of the Intelisys partners how to scale and how to use, frankly, some of our resources to work their installed base so that they have less churn. So this is one of the challenges with the typical agency is they don't have a lot of infrastructure to manage renewals."", 'Keith Michael Housum', ""Okay. I appreciate that. And Steve, explain a little bit more on the margin question about agencies. I guess, I'm just looking for like a margin profile. I mean we know Intelisys has great gross margins. And before the competitive advantage, I mean, I think your EBITDA margins were north of 30% or 35%. Obviously, that's changed quite a bit in the past several years. But how do we think about like an agency's profile? Is it also going to be more -- gross profit's going to be revenue? And then what type of EBITDA margins, I guess, could your average agency experience?"", 'Stephen T. Jones', ""Yes, Keith, thanks. So let me maybe start back at the beginning, as you think through this. So you talked about the Intelisys EBITDA margins being kind of in the 40% when we acquired, that's not really eroded much for us until recently as those margins started getting pressure and that margin started shifting to the agent as we were having to give up more of a split to them in terms of the commission structure. So there's margin setting in the agent that used to be in the TSD that we want to go participate back in. And then when you look at their margins, again, we're probably looking at this as an agent kind of commission. So it's going to be 100% gross margins from a reported perspective. But as you know, Keith, when we look at our business, that has a problem with our top line growth, right? Because it just doesn't grow as fast, or it doesn't materially impact our $3.5 billion kind of top line number as much. So we've got to do a good job of really unpacking how this -- how the economics of this are going to work. But we expect this will be margin accretive to our overall company, and that's why it's interesting to us."", 'Keith Michael Housum', ""Okay. If I think about like the barcoding space, where you got a generation of VARs that are kind of retiring out, do you have the same thing in the agency space where they've been around for long enough that you've got owners that are in that 50- to 60-year-old groups that are looking to get out? Or is this a relatively younger, I guess, makeup of owners today?"", 'Michael L. Baur', ""Yes, Keith, it's Mike again. Exactly right analysis. So the reason that these roll-ups have been happening, there have been investors, let's call them all pretty much private equity investors that have come in and acquired agencies or acquired just their contracts because many of those agency leaders are -- frankly, they're at the end of their cycle. They're ready to exit. And they've asked us for the last few years. And we actually said for the last 2 years, no, we will not do that. It's not in our DNA to sell to the end user and own an agency. So this is a big change for us. And -- but the agency owners, they're actually very interested. And we were nervous about just even talking about it, but it became obvious to us that part of the reason we're getting pressure on our margins from our competitors is because they're already doing this. They're already benefiting from that, and it's because the agents, once they know that there is a buyer out there like, hey, pick me, pick me. And some of them are saying, we don't want to sell the whole business. But as I said in my prepared remarks, they want to take some chips off the table. And unlike the VAR business, you can't easily buy just a part of a VAR business. You can't just buy because it's not recurring. It's deal by deal. Here, these are contracts that we will have a defined term with, defined amount of profitability, and we'll be able to pretty straightforward, make an offer to just buy, let's say, $1 million annualized of recurring revenue from a partner, and they don't have to sell the whole business. And so that has gotten a lot of interest in the market. So again, we're responding to what the market is doing."", 'Keith Michael Housum', ""And you've announced this several months ago at one of your conferences, and you've had these conversations. So I'm assuming that your M&A strategy is you want to buy a more established agency with some digital tools maybe -- to use your words, in establishing good management team. Is it safe to say that you're having these conversations now? And I guess if you're not, is the option to go organically and to build it yourself?"", 'Michael L. Baur', ""For us, we've talked about acquisitions because we want to go faster than we have been, meaning we're catching up. And again, listening to our competitors who have all come out publicly and dodged the question, frankly, of are they doing this, they've already started. We're catching up. So we will absolutely want to do it through acquisition. But then we will grow it with the balance sheet that we have. That means adding headcount, people, tools, and we believe then we can become the player of interest. And what I mean by that is we're not looking to make this agency the largest. It could happen. That's not our goal. Our goal is to create the best agency so that this has the best practices, the best programs so that we can still recruit new and, frankly, younger partners in the Intelisys channel who want to maybe do something with their business 10 years from now or 5 years from now. And so we're trying to create, as I said in my opening remarks, a different model. So we're calling it the channel model of the future, where you can come to your distributor and take some chips off the table or potentially sell the whole business. And again, these are, again, relatively, and maybe the point would be, these are all small businesses. These are not the size of Intelisys was. Now having said that, some of them have already been rolled up. Those entities have gotten large. One of our partners today has already rolled up about 30 agencies. And so they've acquired significant EBITDA by rolling them up."", 'Keith Michael Housum', ""Got it. And I appreciate that you're not going to let time dictate your schedule here. But do you have a goal in your mind about when you want to be able to have an agency under your roof and be running with the strategy?"", 'Michael L. Baur', 'Yes. I think I said earlier, we expect to have more to share about our investment -- channel expansion soon.', 'Keith Michael Housum', ""All right. I appreciate that. I'm going to change gears on you here and just talking about more traditional business, the hardware business. Some of your larger barcoding partners have expressed some optimism for an improvement in the second half of the calendar year. I'm not sure I'm hearing that from your conversation here today. And I appreciate the fact that your backlog is 1 day, 2 days, it's very short. But are you hearing any constructive conversations that would give you optimism for the second half of the calendar year?"", 'Michael L. Baur', ""Yes. Let me have -- I'm going to have Tony comment on that because he can talk about we have different technology, not all of those suppliers have been public. And so maybe Tony can just kind of give you a little summary of where we are."", 'Tony Sorrentino', ""Yes, Keith. It's Tony. So there's certainly still a lot of uncertainty in the near term. But I would say we're seeing green shoots of opportunity for growth in our physical security, barcode and mobility businesses for sure. That said, there's some optimism there, but there's also a lot of concern as well. So I've spent a lot of time with our top customers over the past month and they're cautiously optimistic, but certainly, all the uncertainty in the macro environment is creating concern for them."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Mike Latimore with NCM.', 'Michael James Latimore', ""It looks like another good quarter of CCaaS and UCaaS billings growth. I guess, can you just talk a little bit about the sales cycles you're seeing there? Has there been any change in sales cycles for either one or both those categories?"", 'Michael L. Baur', ""Mike, it's Mike Baur. No real change in that, but what I would say is we're doing a lot of educational seminars around the country, as you probably know. And no surprise, the big story is about how is AI going to affect our business, and the place that everyone is wanting to hear about is AI and contact center. So we're getting a lot of traction with interest. We're going to see how that affects really results, but the contact center story and the contact center space remains very attractive to our agents. They want to learn more. We're having -- again, we're having tremendous attention and attendance at these events. And we're continuing to make sure we're building our team out, so that we learn more about how contact center is probably the best example can utilize AI to drive future revenues. But I think, again, the idea is we see a longer sales cycle when this technology change happens, for sure, because now there might be some hesitation of do I buy what's available today? Or do I wait another 6 months or 12 months? And so I wouldn't be surprised to see some of the transactions slow down. But as we just reported, it was still a very strong growth with our partners. And that's the beauty of this Intelisys recurring revenue model is we're building off of that base every quarter and that's why we're very attracted to this space."", 'Michael James Latimore', 'Yes. Yes. How about the pipeline? Any comment on just pipeline growth in UCaaS and CCaaS?', 'Michael L. Baur', ""Well, we don't typically give out the pipelines. But again, if I just think about the overall opportunity, and that's one reason that we are excited about this new entity and being closer to the end user, Mike, is we believe we'll benefit from understanding better what the end users are thinking about relative to CCaaS and UCaaS and I think that will help inform us for some of our decisions about the future. And what I hope will happen is we're going to develop some best practices to help our Intelisys channel close business actually faster. And that will be one of our goals with some of the tools."", 'Michael James Latimore', 'Great. And just lastly, you talked about some pricing pressure perhaps related to consolidation in the industry. I guess, can you talk about pricing at the end user? Are you seeing pricing pressure for the software vendors themselves and what kind of their charging in the UCaaS, CCaaS market?', 'Michael L. Baur', ""In general, I would say there is absolutely pressure on the seat prices continuing to go down. Significant pressure there. Agents have to decide -- and let's just go back to the obvious, a couple of years ago, UCaaS was growing at the rate CCaaS is growing now. So we can see that the unit price, the seat price going down, makes it harder to grow off the base. And I think that's critically important because the channel needs to know how are they going to sell more in the future. They have to sell more seats for the same amount of revenue that they got 2 years ago. So definitely pressure on the seats, more on the UCaaS today, but CCaaS is also seeing that pressure at the end user."", 'Operator', ""(Operator Instructions) At this time, seeing no further questions, I'd now like to turn it back over to Steve Jones for closing remarks."", 'Stephen T. Jones', 'Well, thank you for joining us today. We expect to hold our next conference call to discuss June 30 quarterly and full fiscal year results on Tuesday, August 22 -- 27 at approximately 10:30 a.m.', 'Operator', ""Thank you for your participation in today's conference.

We have also talked about the issues stemming from overworking. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Countries with the Longest Working Hours in the World.', 'Overworking, especially during young adulthood, comes with a plethora of challenges, according to a study. Surprisingly, only a quarter of participants in the study maintained traditional daytime hours, while the majority had variable schedules such as night shifts and rotating hours. This discrepancy in work schedules resulted in less sleep and increased vulnerability to depression and poor health by the age of 50. Indeed, the toll of overwork manifests in physical and mental health struggles.', ""The repercussions of overwork are particularly stark for marginalized groups. Black men and women and workers with limited education disproportionately bear the burden of night shifts and volatile work schedules. For instance, the study cited above says that white college-educated women with stable daytime jobs reported significantly more sleep than their Black male counterparts with unstable employment histories. Moreover, insufficient sleep resulting from overwork is not just a personal inconvenience; it's a public health concern. Chronic diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and obesity are linked to inadequate sleep, with African Americans facing a higher risk due to systemic factors."", ""In Europe, the specter of overwork also looms large as inflation continues its relentless climb. With costs increasing, many find themselves strapped for cash. Recent data from Qualtrics reveals that nearly half of UK employees are either seeking or considering a second job, with 77% contemplating overtime or extra shifts just to make ends meet. This trend isn't isolated; Germany and France report similar sentiments, with major portions of their workforce contemplating dual employment or higher-paying roles."", 'Apart from France and Germany, Montenegro is one of the countries with the longest work hours in Europe whereas Netherlands is one of the countries with the shortest work hours in Europe.', ""However, in 2024, we do expect overworking culture to change. According to a recent survey by Nous, over 40% of HR leaders acknowledge that employees are now tackling more 'life admin' tasks during work hours. In terms of formal regulations, in California, proposed legislation aims to safeguard employees' personal time by penalizing employers who contact them after work hours. Under the bill, employers breaching this right could face a minimum fine of $100. The bill stipulates clear agreements between employers and employees regarding working hours and thus, allows individuals to ignore non-emergency communications outside these times. Speaking of working hours, the average working hours per day in the US were 8.42 in 2022 on a weekday."", ""To help the compromised state of overworked employees and ensure their retention, Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) engage in employee wellbeing through their volunteering programs.
