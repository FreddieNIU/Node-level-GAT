The USA grappled with record inflation in the year 2022, prompting the Social Security Administration to announce an 8.7% increase in social security benefits for the subsequent year. This increase has been the highest in 40 years, with retirees receiving an average monthly boost of more than $140. Regrettably, benefits do not increase consistently each year, and even when they do, the increments may not necessarily match the levels of the previous year.', 'This means that the 71 million individuals receiving Social Security benefits in 2024 are poised to receive a Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) mirroring the deceleration in inflation. This COLA for 2024 is set to be 3.2% only.', '""Though it\'s less than the COLA for the past two years, next year\'s bump is more in line with the historical average increase. For the past two decades, the average COLA has been 2.6%. In more recent years, it has been as low as 0%."" -Mike Lynch, managing director of applied insights Hartford Funds.', 'The 3.2% COLA means the average monthly benefit for a retired worker will increase by more than $50 per month starting January 2024. According to The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), although this payment may appear modest compared to the 8.9% COLA last year, retirees stand to retain higher benefits if inflation continues to subside in the coming months. Nevertheless, a sizable chunk is going to be eaten away by the standard Medicare Part B premiums too. These premiums have risen to $174.70 per month in 2024 from $164.90 in 2023, and are generally deducted from social security benefits.', '""Social Security benefits generally do keep up with inflation, though there is a lag…If anything, these changes are a reminder that retirees\' incomes aren\'t truly fixed. Social Security benefits can change from year to year, and retirees can and should adjust their spending as their situation and the broader economic and financial environment evolve.""', '-Rob Williams, managing director for financial planning, retirement income, and wealth management at the The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) Center for Financial Research.', 'The 2023 COLA increase had led retirees to raise their spending growth by more than 3%, according to Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC). Most of these retirees were cutting down on expenses previously because of the inflation.', '“What this cost-of-living increase has done is allowed them some breathing space to move their spending higher, But I don’t think anyone would pretend they aren’t facing quite a lot of pressure still.”', '-David Tinsley, senior economist at Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC).', 'Considering these are insights for the current year, it is only obvious that retirees are struggling to come out of the pressures of inflation as yet. Despite inflation cooling down and COLAs helping them keep up, the Senior Citizens League says that the costs of items that older adults spend on consistently outpace the COLA.', 'Moreover, a Spending in Retirement survey by Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI) further reveals that almost half of the responding retirees spend less than $2,000 each month. 1 in 3 reported spending between $2,000 to $3,999 each month. Moreover, 16% spend between $4,000 and $6,999, and 3% spend more than that.

For instance, one of the cheapest states to retire in is West Virginia, based on the 2023 Third Quarter Cost of Living Data Series by MERIC.

In this article, we decided to focus on Walmart's  ROE."", ""Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Walmart ', 'The formula for ROE is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Walmart is:', '19% = US$16b ÷ US$86b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2023).', ""The 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.19 in profit."", 'We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company\'s future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company\'s future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.', ""To begin with, Walmart seems to have a respectable ROE. Especially when compared to the industry average of 15% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. Despite this, Walmart's five year net income growth was quite low averaging at only 4.5%. This is generally not the case as when a company has a high rate of return it should usually also have a high earnings growth rate. We reckon that a low growth, when returns are quite high could be the result of certain circumstances like low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital."", ""As a next step, we compared Walmart's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 11% in the same period."", 'Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock.

So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For example, the business has faced some headwinds."", ""In addition, Walmart has been paying dividends over a period of at least ten years suggesting that keeping up dividend payments is way more important to the management even if it comes at the cost of business growth. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 31% over the next three years. Regardless, the ROE is not expected to change much for the company despite the lower expected payout ratio."", ""Overall, we feel that Walmart certainly does have some positive factors to consider. However, given the high ROE and high profit retention, we would expect the company to be delivering strong earnings growth, but that isn't the case here.

Nordstrom Inc's growth rank of 6 out of 10 suggests that the company has a fair growth outlook.

The low payout ratio may provide some cushion, but the company's profitability and growth metrics suggest that investors should keep a close eye on Nordstrom Inc's financial health and market position.

To skip the detailed analysis of current economic conditions and forecasts, go directly to the 5 Best Very Cheap Stocks To Buy Now According To Hedge Funds.', 'We are at the end of 2023, and recession hasn’t hit the world’s biggest economies like the US and China, as predicted by several analysts earlier. In March, over 70% of the National Association of Business Economics’ (NABE) survey panelists believed that the growth in the consumer price index (CPI) would remain above 4% by the end of the year. Furthermore, 24% of the panelists believed a recession might start in the third quarter of 2023.', 'In the October 31-November 1 meeting, the Federal Reserve did not raise the interest rates for the third time in the last four sessions as the CPI dropped to 3.7% in September and was at 3.2% in October, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The employment rate has remained steady with slight fluctuations, and the stock market has shown resilience as the S&P 500 is up 19.23% and the NASDAQ-100 is up 47.13% year-to-date on November 24. Additionally, the US GDP grew 4.9% in the third quarter of 2023, up from 2.1% in the second quarter.', 'Nonetheless, experts still have different opinions about the economic outlook. While some experts believe that the US will be able to achieve a “soft landing,” others believe that risks of recession are still there.', ""While experts can sometimes correctly predict market conditions and provide close to accurate forecasts, the market remains unpredictable for several reasons. For example, no one could have predicted the COVID-19 pandemic or the Russian invasion of Ukraine, both of which sent the global economy into chaos. Furthermore, many financial news websites suggest investing in utilities, healthcare, and real estate segments during tough economic conditions. However, our previous report suggests that these three were this year's worst performing sectors of the stock market."", 'Despite the unpredictability of the market, there are still some steps that can be taken to avoid losing a lot of money during an economic turmoil. Value stocks are a good option during a recession as it is believed that even though value stocks are not an absolute protection against recession, they are likely to do less damage to your investment portfolio during one. Additionally, it is a good idea to avoid companies with unsustainable debt and high volatility.', 'Another option investors, especially beginners, can opt for is safe, well-established stocks that aren’t affected by short-term economic fluctuations and can safeguard investments for the long term till the economy shows clear signs of recovery.', 'Some examples of safe stocks can be The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM). Both of the companies are old, well-established in their sectors, and have a stable dividend and sustainable payout ratios.', 'Hedge funds are also a great option because leaving it to the experts might be the best option when there is high uncertainty and a lack of knowledge. Some of the most successful hedge fund managers include Warren Buffett, Ken Griffin, and Seth Klarman. Klarman’s Baupost Group has been able to post average annualized returns of 20% since its inception. On the other hand, Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investments posted $16 billion in profits in 2022.', ""While economists and experts are still debating the direction that the economy might take, stocks with low valuations, which are favored by hedge funds, can prove to be beneficial for investors. While the PE ratio is not the absolute metric for defining a cheap stock, it can definitely help an investor determine a stock's relative valuation.

The company has seen faster-than-expected price declines from the highs reached after the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war, as supplies from Belarus and Russia gradually found their way around the global sanctions. Also, higher cost inflation has delayed discretionary fertilizer purchases by farmers. However, we believe the global agricultural cycle remains broadly supportive. With fertilizer prices normalizing above the pre-pandemic levels, pent up demand from farmers’ need to replenish diminished soil land banks, and continued pressure on Belarussian and Russian supplies, we believe the company’s earnings power will remain at above-history levels.

Their defeat shows that in the battle between AI profits and ethics, it’s no contest",Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/openai-board-might-dysfunctional-made-105429320.html,1701082469,STORY,['MSFT'],"['The drama around OpenAI, its board, and Sam Altman has been a fascinating story that raises a number of ethical leadership issues. What are the responsibilities that OpenAI’s board, Sam Altman, and Microsoft held during these quickly moving events? Whose interests should have held priority during this saga and why?', 'Let’s start with the board. We still don’t know in what way Altman was not straightforward with his board. We do know nonprofit boards–and OpenAI is, by design, governed by a nonprofit board–have a special duty to ensure the organization is meeting its mission. If they feel the CEO is not fulfilling that mission, they have cause to act.', 'According to OpenAI’s website, its mission is “to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.” That’s a tall order–and words are important. The distinction of artificial general intelligence from artificial intelligence may be part of the story if the company was close to meeting its own definition of artificial general intelligence and felt it was about to do so in a way that did not benefit humanity. In an interview with the podcast Hard Fork days before he was fired, when asked to define artificial general intelligence, Altman said it’s a “ridiculous and meaningless term,” and redefined it as “really smart AI.” Perhaps his board felt the term and its definition was more important.', 'One issue may be that OpenAI’s mission statement reads more like a vision statement which can be more aspirational and forward-looking than a corporation’s mission statement, which usually captures the organization’s purpose. The real issue here, however, is not whether it is a vision or mission statement: The ethical issue is that the board is obligated to take actions that ensure it is fulfilled.\xa0Moving slowly and not accelerating AI progress may not be a compelling pitch to investors–but perhaps there are investors who want to invest in precisely that. If a cautious approach is what OpenAI’s mission implies, then it’s a worthy goal to pursue, even if it goes against the traditional approach of a more typically structured startup.', 'The board also has a duty to actively participate in oversight of the organization’s activities and manage its assets prudently. Nonprofit boards hold their institutions in trust for the community they serve (in this case, all of humanity). OpenAI’s website also declares it to be a research and deployment company. Neither of those things is possible if most of the staff quits the organization or if funding for the organization is not adequate.', 'We also know more now about the board’s dysfunction, including the fact that the tension has existed for much of the past year and that a disagreement broke out over a paper a board member wrote that seemed critical of the company’s approach to AI safety and complimentary of a competitor. While the board member defended her paper as an act of academic freedom, writing papers about the company while sitting on its board can be considered a conflict of interest as it violates the duty of loyalty. If she felt strongly about writing the paper, that was the moment to resign from the board.', 'As the sitting CEO of OpenAI, the interests Altman needed to keep front and center were those of OpenAI. Given what’s been reported about the additional business interests he was pursuing in the form of starting two other companies, there is some evidence he did not make OpenAI his absolute priority. Whether this is at the heart of the communication issues he had with the board remains to be seen, but it’s enough to know he was on the road working to get these organizations started.', 'Even by his own admission, Altman did not stay close enough to his own board to prevent the organizational meltdown that has now occurred on his watch. This is an unfortunate byproduct, perhaps, of choices made by other CEOs Altman knows and may be emulating.\xa0Elon Musk, an early investor and board member at OpenAI, believes he can shepherd the interests of Tesla, SpaceX and its Starlink network, The Boring Company, and X all at the same time.\xa0Yet each company is deserving of the singular focus of a CEO who clearly sets as priority the interests of that particular company.', 'Or perhaps Altman, like many extremely successful startup CEOs, is a “start-something-new” guy rather than a “maintain-it-once-it’s-built” executive. Perhaps starting new things is what he is best called to do. There is a way to do that without the conflicted interests that come automatically when one is managing more than one company at a time or running a for-profit business as part of a nonprofit. This would also not be the first time Altman left an organization because he was distracted by other opportunities. Ironically, he was asked to leave Y Combinator a few years ago because he was busy with other business endeavors, including OpenAI.', 'Altman seemed to understand his responsibility to run a viable, enduring organization and keep its employees happy. He was on his way to pulling off a tender offer–a secondary round of investment in AI that would give the company much-needed cash and provide employees with the opportunity to cash out their shares. He also seemed very comfortable engaging in industry-wide issues like regulation and standards. Finding a balance between those activities is part of the work of corporate leaders and perhaps the board felt that Altman failed to find such a balance in the months leading up to his firing.', 'Microsoft seems to be the most clear-eyed about the interests it must protect: Microsoft’s! By hiring Sam Altman and Greg Brockman (a co-founder and president of OpenAI who resigned from OpenAI in solidarity with Altman), offering to hire more OpenAI staff, and still planning to collaborate with OpenAI, Satya Nadella hedged his bets. He seems to understand that by harnessing both the technological promise of AI, as articulated by OpenAI, and the talent to fulfill that promise, he is protecting Microsoft’s interest, a perspective reinforced by the financial markets’ positive response to his decision to offer Altman a job and further reinforced by his own willingness to support Altman’s return to OpenAI. Nadella acted with the interests of his company and its future at the forefront of his decision-making and he appears to have covered all the bases amidst a rapidly unfolding set of circumstances.', 'OpenAI employees may not like the board’s dramatic retort that allowing the company to be destroyed would be consistent with the mission–but those board members saw it that way.', 'The board of OpenAI was created, by design, to remove profit interests from the equation. At the end of the day, OpenAI’s employees may be more profit-oriented.', ""Ann Skeet is the senior director of leadership ethics at Markkula Center for Applied Ethics, and co-author of the Center's Institute for Technology, Ethics and Culture (ITEC) handbook, Ethics in the Age of Disruptive Technologies: An Operational Roadmap."", 'Amazon’s $26 billion delivery business\xa0runs on exhausted, sweat-soaked drivers running door to door.

If you want to skip our introduction to the investment bank and the latest saga surrounding its business, then take a look at Goldman Sachs' Top 15 Stock Picks for 2024. "", ""The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is one of the biggest investment banks in the world. It is also one of the oldest banks around since the institution traces its roots back to the 19th century in 1839. While Goldman Sachs' operations have stood the test of time and the bank is still managing money for clients nearly two centuries after its founding, these days, the bank has landed itself into quite a bit of turmoil."", ""This is because the bank's plans to target consumer banking turned out to be rather disastrous, forcing Goldman to take multi-million dollar hits to its income statement. The bank's first quarter of 2023 earnings report revealed that it had taken a massive $470 million loss to its loan portfolio as part of an effort to reorganize the retail banking division. The first quarter was particularly hard for Goldman and the banking industry as a whole as several bank collapsed in the U.S. creating worries about the stability of the entire system."", ""Goldman's second quarter results weren't impressive either as it reported $10.9 billion in revenue and $3.08 in earnings per share, beating and missing analyst estimates for the two segments, respectively. While the first quarter earnings were marred by the consumer banking loan impairments, Q2 was marked by an equally stunning $504 million impairment for the bank's GreenSky buy now, pay later service and $485 million of write downs in real estate. This made it unsurprising that Goldman missed analyst EPS estimates. At the same time, its profit tanked by a painful 60% annually, to touch a three year low. Yet, during the earnings call, Goldman's embattled chief executive officer Mr. David Solomon was in fire control mode as he stressed that momentum in the investment banking business was picking up. During Q2, Goldman's investment banking fees fell to $1.43 billion to miss analyst estimates of $1.49 billion."", ""Unfortunately for Goldman Sachs, the double digit percentage drops during the second quarter wouldn't be its last. The bank's financials for the third quarter saw its profit drop by 33% annually to sit at $2.1 billion for earnings per share of $5.47. This allowed Goldman Sachs to beat analyst EPS estimates during Q3 by a hairline of five cents. The quarterly profit results showed the scale of its troubles since it completed two consecutive years of quarters of annual profit drops. For Goldman, the earnings troubles came at a particularly painful time for the U.S. banking industry which was (and still is) dealing with historically high interest rates and slowing economic output. The bank joined its peers to cut jobs in June 2023, when its chief operating officer shared that a fresh bout of layoffs would cut 250 jobs and build over the thousands more that it had laid off in January."", ""So, what are Goldman Sachs' views about the future? Well, here's what its management had to say during its third quarter of 2023 earnings call:"", 'Most recently, we announced the sale of GreenSky. We also announced the sale of Personal Financial Management this summer. We sold substantially all of our markets loan portfolio. We have reduced our historical principal investments by $9 billion this year. We are confident that the work we’re doing now provides us a stronger platform for 2024 and beyond. As we assess the operating backdrop, the US economy has proven to be more resilient than expected, though there are reasons to remain vigilant. Treasury rates have risen sharply over the past few months with 10-year yields up 75 basis points in the third quarter. On top of that, recent inflation and employment data has come in above estimates, driving market expectations of higher for longer interest rates.', 'And there still are a number of sectors in the economy that have yet to absorb the impact of higher rates, especially in light of the further tightening in financial conditions we’ve seen over the last quarter. At the same time, there has been an escalation of geopolitical stresses around the globe, the [indiscernible] war in Ukraine, tensions with China and now the conflict in the Middle East. Overall levels of risk are more elevated than we’ve seen in quite some time. While we don’t know where this will all lead, it could impact economic growth and stability in the U.S. and around the world, and we remain cautiously positioned.', ""So, with the future still uncertain, what are Goldman Sachs' top stock picks for 2024? We took a look at the bank's latest portfolio and found that its top three picks are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)."", 'Copyright: mikewaters / 123RF Stock Photo', 'Our Methodology ', ""To compile our list of Goldman Sachs' top stock picks for 2024, we scanned through the bank's filings with the SEC and picked out its 15 biggest investment positions."", ""Goldman Sachs' Q3 2023 Investment Value: $2.4 billion "", 'NRG Energy, Inc.

In that time, he told Fortune last month, he’s been able to try many Starbucks drinks—and even learn to prepare the full menu as a barista. Despite his stature as the number-one at Starbucks, he doesn’t have fancy taste. His go-to drink costs just $3.35—on the lower end for the ubiquitous coffee chain, whose prices can cost as much as $5.95 for a seasonal pumpkin spice frappuccino.', '“My favorite go-to drink at Starbucks is the Doppio Espresso Macchiato with some hot milk on the side,” Narasimhan said. He added that he prefers skim milk, because it’s the closest way of replicating the taste of South Indian coffee when in the U.S. Narasimhan is from Pune, a large city in southwest India.', ""Once in a while, the CEO—whose lengthy résumé includes a long C-level career at PepsiCo—will indulge in more ritzy Starbucks offerings. He said he’s tasted and been “very amazingly surprised” by the whiskey barrel-aged Guatemalan coffee, which is available at Starbucks Roastery stores. “It has no alcohol. It has a cube of ice, and it's a wonderful drink that I've enjoyed deeply.”"", 'Narasimhan honed his varied taste through the 40 hours he spent training—and six months he spent working—as a barista alongside Starbucks partners while gearing up for the CEO gig. “The idea was to really immerse myself in the business, understand the culture, understand it from a partner’s lens, and also get really good at coffee, which I love drinking,” he told Alan Murray and Michal Lev-Ram on an episode of the Leadership Next podcast. Working in stores across the continents gave Narasimhan “a real lens into what it meant” to be a Starbucks employee.', 'Since taking the reins from erstwhile CEO and company founder Howard Schultz, Narasimhan has made clear his intentions to prioritize Starbucks corporate’s relationship with its in-store workers. Recent successful financial results, he said, proved that his efforts were paying off. Earlier this month, the chain reported an 11.4% bump in quarterly sales, equaling $9.37 billion. It also shared plans to add nearly 15,000 new locations, mostly outside the U.S. That’s alongside its existing more than 20,000 non-U.S. stores.', 'Narasimhan is avowedly militant about work-life balance; he meditates daily, exercises 150 to 250 minutes a week, and largely avoids answering work calls after 6 p.m. And even the CEO of a Fortune 100 company doesn’t drink too much Kool Aid; he avoids any coffee after 2:00 p.m. At that point, he told Murray and Lev-Ram, he switches over to one of Starbucks’s “wonderful range of teas.”', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

Over the past year, the industry’s earnings estimates for the current year have been revised 31.1% lower.', 'Before we present a few stocks that you may want to keep on the radar despite industry-wide challenges, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.', 'The Zacks Investment Bank industry has underperformed its sector and the S&P 500 over the past two years.

The industry is trading at a considerable discount when compared with the market at large, as the trailing 12-month P/TBV ratio for the S&P 500 is 9.92X and the median level is 10.09X.', 'Finance stocks typically have a lower P/TBV ratio, so comparing investment banks with the S&P 500 may not make sense to many investors. However, comparing the group’s P/TBV ratio with that of the broader sector ensures that the group is trading at a decent discount. The Zacks Finance sector’s trailing 12-month P/TBV ratio of 4.45X and the median level of 4.14X for the same period are above the Zacks Investment Bank industry’s respective ratios.', 'Morgan Stanley: This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock operates globally as an investment banking, securities and investment management company.

If you want to skip our introduction to the investment bank and the latest saga surrounding its business, then take a look at Goldman Sachs' Top 15 Stock Picks for 2024. "", ""The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is one of the biggest investment banks in the world. It is also one of the oldest banks around since the institution traces its roots back to the 19th century in 1839. While Goldman Sachs' operations have stood the test of time and the bank is still managing money for clients nearly two centuries after its founding, these days, the bank has landed itself into quite a bit of turmoil."", ""This is because the bank's plans to target consumer banking turned out to be rather disastrous, forcing Goldman to take multi-million dollar hits to its income statement. The bank's first quarter of 2023 earnings report revealed that it had taken a massive $470 million loss to its loan portfolio as part of an effort to reorganize the retail banking division. The first quarter was particularly hard for Goldman and the banking industry as a whole as several bank collapsed in the U.S. creating worries about the stability of the entire system."", ""Goldman's second quarter results weren't impressive either as it reported $10.9 billion in revenue and $3.08 in earnings per share, beating and missing analyst estimates for the two segments, respectively. While the first quarter earnings were marred by the consumer banking loan impairments, Q2 was marked by an equally stunning $504 million impairment for the bank's GreenSky buy now, pay later service and $485 million of write downs in real estate. This made it unsurprising that Goldman missed analyst EPS estimates. At the same time, its profit tanked by a painful 60% annually, to touch a three year low. Yet, during the earnings call, Goldman's embattled chief executive officer Mr. David Solomon was in fire control mode as he stressed that momentum in the investment banking business was picking up. During Q2, Goldman's investment banking fees fell to $1.43 billion to miss analyst estimates of $1.49 billion."", ""Unfortunately for Goldman Sachs, the double digit percentage drops during the second quarter wouldn't be its last. The bank's financials for the third quarter saw its profit drop by 33% annually to sit at $2.1 billion for earnings per share of $5.47. This allowed Goldman Sachs to beat analyst EPS estimates during Q3 by a hairline of five cents. The quarterly profit results showed the scale of its troubles since it completed two consecutive years of quarters of annual profit drops. For Goldman, the earnings troubles came at a particularly painful time for the U.S. banking industry which was (and still is) dealing with historically high interest rates and slowing economic output. The bank joined its peers to cut jobs in June 2023, when its chief operating officer shared that a fresh bout of layoffs would cut 250 jobs and build over the thousands more that it had laid off in January."", ""So, what are Goldman Sachs' views about the future? Well, here's what its management had to say during its third quarter of 2023 earnings call:"", 'Most recently, we announced the sale of GreenSky. We also announced the sale of Personal Financial Management this summer. We sold substantially all of our markets loan portfolio. We have reduced our historical principal investments by $9 billion this year. We are confident that the work we’re doing now provides us a stronger platform for 2024 and beyond. As we assess the operating backdrop, the US economy has proven to be more resilient than expected, though there are reasons to remain vigilant. Treasury rates have risen sharply over the past few months with 10-year yields up 75 basis points in the third quarter. On top of that, recent inflation and employment data has come in above estimates, driving market expectations of higher for longer interest rates.', 'And there still are a number of sectors in the economy that have yet to absorb the impact of higher rates, especially in light of the further tightening in financial conditions we’ve seen over the last quarter. At the same time, there has been an escalation of geopolitical stresses around the globe, the [indiscernible] war in Ukraine, tensions with China and now the conflict in the Middle East. Overall levels of risk are more elevated than we’ve seen in quite some time. While we don’t know where this will all lead, it could impact economic growth and stability in the U.S. and around the world, and we remain cautiously positioned.', ""So, with the future still uncertain, what are Goldman Sachs' top stock picks for 2024? We took a look at the bank's latest portfolio and found that its top three picks are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)."", 'Copyright: mikewaters / 123RF Stock Photo', 'Our Methodology ', ""To compile our list of Goldman Sachs' top stock picks for 2024, we scanned through the bank's filings with the SEC and picked out its 15 biggest investment positions."", ""Goldman Sachs' Q3 2023 Investment Value: $2.4 billion "", 'NRG Energy, Inc.

Movie” hits the streaming service Sunday, Dec. 3, after its previous run on Peacock. The film, which grossed nearly $1.4 billion in theaters, has fared slightly better than the infamous 1993 “Super Mario Bros.” In my review, I praised the primary-color visuals but wrote that “as nice as it is to look at ‘The Super Mario Bros. Movie,’ it’s not anywhere near as fun as it would be to play it.”', '— Todd Haynes’ “May December” is a deliciously disquieting drama loosely based on a stranger-than-fiction true story. Haynes’ film, which debuts Friday on Netflix, is inspired by Mary Kay Letourneau, the teacher who went to jail in 1997 for a sexual relationship with a student, only to later marry him. In “May December,” Julianne Moore and Charles Melton play a couple years past a similar scandal, while Natalie Portman portrays an actress who’s come to research them for an upcoming film. In her review, AP Film Writer Lindsey Bahr called it “an audaciously self-aware, mischievously funny and emotionally complex drama that defies simple categorization.”', '— Harrison Ford’s last hurrah as Indiana Jones swings onto Disney+ on Friday. “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” had a mixed reception when it launched over the summer. Ford was feted in Cannes. Reviews were mixed. Box office was lackluster. But “Dial of Destiny,” directed by James Mangold (taking over for Steven Spielberg), co-starring Phoebe Waller Bridges and featuring a poignant scene with Karen Allen, has a lot going for itself. In her review, Bahr acknowledged it’s no “Raiders” or “Last Crusade,” “but it’s solid, swashbuckling summer fare and a dignified sendoff to one of cinema’s most flawless castings.”', '— Matthew Heineman’s “American Symphony” captures a whirlwind year for Jon Batiste. The film covers the pianist winning the 2022 Grammy for album of the year, winning an Oscar for co-creating the score to “Soul” and a triumphant concert at Carnegie Hall — all while his wife, Suleika Jaouad, battled leukemia. “American Symphony” is now streaming on Netflix.', '— AP Film Writer Jake Coyle', 'NEW MUSIC TO STREAM', '— A starry special this week honors Elvis. “Christmas at Graceland,” featuring Post Malone, Alanis Morissette, John Legend, Kacey Musgraves, Kane Brown, Lainey Wilson, Lana Del Rey and The War and Treaty. It aired live on Wednesday on NBC and streams on Peacock. “Christmas at Graceland” — airing right after NBC’s “Christmas in Rockefeller Center” — is the first televised concert from the estate and Presley’s granddaughter, Riley Keough, will make special appearances.', '— Peter Gabriel’s sonic teasing is almost over. After releasing 10 singles during 2023 — coinciding with each month’s full moon — the singer-songwriter finally will drop the album they all come from on Friday, “i/o.” The album is available in two distinct mixes: The Bright-Side Mix by Mark “Spike” Stent and the Dark-Side Mix by Tchad Blake. “Tchad is very much a sculptor building a journey with sound and drama, Spike loves sound and assembling these pictures, so he’s more of a painter,” says Gabriel. “i/o” includes contributions from Brian Eno, regular collaborators Richard Chappell, Oli Jacobs, Katie May and Richard Evans.', '— If all you know about Violent Femmes is “Blister in the Sun,” it’s time you went deeper. The 40th anniversary deluxe edition of the band’s self-titled debut is out Friday with over a dozen demos, B-sides and live performances — including alternate versions of iconic songs “Please Do Not Go,” “Gone Daddy Gone” and “Add It Up.” Pop culture fans will know that Ethan Hawke serenaded Winona Ryder with an embittered rendition of “Add It Up” in 1994’s “Reality Bites,” while a 1995 episode of “My So-Called Life” opened on Claire Danes joyfully lip-synching “Blister in the Sun.”', '— Singer-actor Dove Cameron drops her debut album “Alchemical: Volume 1,” which contains six new songs and two previous hits, “Boyfriend” and “Breakfast.” One of the new songs is “Lethal Woman,” a club banger about a woman “sharp as a knife under the table” that includes sounds of banging on a door, a gun being cocked and heavy production elements. The lyrics include the playful rhyme: “Game recognizes game/By the way, what’s your name?” Cameron has had a heady few years, winning new artist of the year honors at the 2022 American Music Awards and being named Best New Artist at the 2022 VMAs. She also was scene-stealer in season two of “Schmigadoon!”', '— AP Entertainment Writer Mark Kennedy', 'NEW SERIES TO STREAM', '— In recent years, Paris Hilton has been determined to (somewhat) drop the cutesy facade and show her layers. The second season of “Paris in Love,” out now on Peacock, leans into that effort. First, it introduces Hilton as a new mom. Hilton and husband Carter Reum welcomed son Phoenix via surrogate earlier this year and just revealed a daughter, London. She managed to keep both births a secret, even from her family, until Hilton was ready to announce the news. “It’s been really important for me to keep this a secret. It’s just the first time that something is just mine,” Hilton says in the trailer. New motherhood is never easy though and Hilton must adjust to the needs of her growing family conflicting with her busy schedule.', ""— Loni Anderson, Morgan Fairchild, Linda Gray, Donna Mills and Nicollette Sheridan star in the new Lifetime movie “Ladies of the ’80s: A Divas Christmas,” premiering at 8 p.m. Eastern on Saturday. The quintet portray former soap opera co-stars who begrudgingly reunite for a live holiday special and end up repairing relationships and playing matchmakers. Executive producer Larry Thompson made sure each of the five actors had their own diva moment in the film. “The ladies loved it,” he tells the AP. “They got to get together, go over old times and and laugh... We want to do a whole franchise with more movies or maybe a series.” (For more holiday TV options, check out AP's guide.)"", '— The creators of “Cobra Kai” are behind a new Netflix series called “Obliterated.” The action comedy stars Nick Zano and Shelley Hennig (“Teen Wolf”) as members of a special task force assigned to prevent a planned terror attack in Las Vegas. Once the mission is completed, the temptations of Sin City sway them to spend the night partying. A call interrupts the fun to inform the group that they didn’t finish the job and need to get back to work, sober or not, to find and deactivate a bomb. “Obliterated” debuted Thursday.', '— It seems there’s no longer bad (tiger?) blood between Chuck Lorre and Charlie Sheen. Lorre has tapped Sheen as a recurring guest star in his new Max series “Bookie.” Stand-up Sebastian Maniscalco plays Danny, as a longtime LA bookie struggling to keep business afloat despite the looming legalization of sports betting. Omar J. Dorsey plays a former pro football player and his best friend, Ray, who is by his side for many of his, er, adventures both on and off the clock. The first two episodes dropped Thursday.', '— A documentary short called “Eddy’s World” follows Eddy Goldfarb, a now 102-year-old toy maker, who has created more than 800 toys (including the Yakity-Yak chattering teeth) and holds more than 250 patents. His story is a lesson that work isn’t work if you love what you do. “Eddy’s World” will be Broadcast on PBS Stations available on PBS.org and the PBS App beginning Saturday.', '— Alicia Rancilio', 'NEW VIDEO GAMES TO PLAY', '— Robin Hood has been stealing from the rich and giving to the poor for centuries, but I don’t think he’s had to battle giant robots before. Gangs of Sherwood, from French publisher Nacon, brings the Merry Men (and a Woman) into a steampunk version of England that the Sheriff of Nottingham oversees from a flying castle. As Robin you have an arsenal of high-tech arrows, and you can invite three friends to the fray: metal-fisted brawler Little John, speedy assassin Maid Marian and mace-wielding healer Friar Tuck. This isn’t Disney’s Robin Hood (or Kevin Costner’s, for that matter). The rebellion began Thursday on Xbox X/S, PlayStation 5 and PC.', '— The soldiers in Last Train Home aren’t out to save the world; they just want to get out of Russia after the end of World War I. Unfortunately, there’s a brutal civil war going on, and the troops won’t make it home to the newly independent Czechoslovakia without a fight. Czech studio Ashborne Games is aiming for a more complex take than your typical military shooter, and there’s more than combat in this strategy/management mashup.

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex."", 'Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model.', ' Check out our latest analysis for Phillips 66 ', ""We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", 'Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:', '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$6.04b', 'US$4.66b', 'US$4.90b', 'US$4.95b', 'US$4.78b', 'US$4.69b', 'US$4.66b', 'US$4.68b', 'US$4.72b', 'US$4.78b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x4', 'Analyst x3', 'Analyst x1', 'Analyst x1', 'Est @ -3.48%', 'Est @ -1.77%', 'Est @ -0.57%', 'Est @ 0.27%', 'Est @ 0.85%', 'Est @ 1.26%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.0% ', 'US$5.5k', 'US$3.9k', 'US$3.8k', 'US$3.5k', 'US$3.1k', 'US$2.8k', 'US$2.6k', 'US$2.3k', 'US$2.2k', 'US$2.0k', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$32b', ""After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 9.0%."", 'Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.8b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (9.0%– 2.2%) = US$72b', 'Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$72b÷ ( 1 + 9.0%)10= US$30b', 'The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$62b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$119, the company appears about fair value at a 16% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.', ""We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Phillips 66 as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.355. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business."", 'Strength', 'Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.', 'Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.', 'Weakness', 'Earnings declined over the past year.', 'Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Oil and Gas market.', 'Opportunity', 'Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.', 'Threat', 'Annual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.', 'Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn\'t be the only metric you look at when researching a company.

You can get your growth and also enjoy dividend payments.', 'To be sure, the adage of something being too good to be true applies. At the end of the day, if an enterprise represents one of the extreme varieties of high-yield dividend stocks, there’s usually a reason for it. Generally, it’s not a good one.', 'On the other hand, the same can be said about blisteringly strong growth stocks. If an enterprise typically commands robust double-digit revenue expansion, it probably hasn’t reached the maturity phase where paying passive income would make sense.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'However, the market features thousands upon thousands of publicly traded opportunities. At some point, you will find an enticing balance between relatively high growth and also high dividends. With that, below are the high-yield dividend growth stocks to consider.', 'Source: monticello / Shutterstock', 'A stalwart in the soft drink industry, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) doesn’t just dominate its core sector; it also represents an icon of American capitalism. As such, it’s a mature business. We’re talking about a company whose roots extend back to the late 1800s! So, it’s one of the high-yield dividend stocks but can it also be classified among growth stocks?', 'At first glance, the answer might appear to be “no.” Per investment data aggregator Gurufocus, Coca-Cola runs a three-year revenue growth rate of 4.6% on a per-share basis. That’s actually worse than 52.58% of the non-alcoholic beverages space. At the same time, 2022’s revenue haul of $43 billion represented a big boost (for a mature enterprise) against its prior year print of $38.7 billion.', 'Also, the company is on track against a trailing-12-month (TTM) basis to ring up sales of $45 billion. With Coca-Cola offering a forward yield of 3.21%, KO is one of the top high-yield dividend growth stocks to consider.', 'Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com', 'A hydrocarbon energy enterprise, Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) mainly specializes in the downstream component of the industry’s value chain; in other words, refining and marketing. As well, it features some business in the midstream (storage and transportation) realm. While the underlying sector had its ups and downs this year, PSX gained over 15% of equity value since the January opener.', 'Given how geopolitical tensions aren’t likely to improve anytime soon, PSX should be on your radar for high-yield dividend growth stocks. Yes, electric vehicles are the future. However, the economic print shows that middle-income folks just can’t make the transition right now. That should give many years of relevance for Phillips 66. Regarding the financials, the company sports a better-than-average three-year revenue growth rate of 14.9%.', 'Just as well, PSX offers a forward yield of 3.61%, simultaneously making it one of the high-yield dividend stocks. Even better, the payout ratio sits at 31.13%, which means investors shouldn’t fret about yield sustainability.', 'Source: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com', 'As I’ve mentioned many times before, I dig pharmaceutical giant AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) for its Allergan acquisition. Through the buyout, AbbVie now controls Botox, a highly potent neurotoxic protein used for smoothing wrinkles. I love the long-term narrative here because, unlike other generations, Millennials and Generation Z will have difficulty letting go.', 'While social critics often joke about young people’s need for safe spaces and whatnot, they do have a point. Part of the maturing process involves accepting life circumstances, both good and bad. Unfortunately, nobody can prevent pain in this world. However accommodating such an unrealistic proposition leads to unrealistic expectations, such as expecting to look young indefinitely.', 'That’s a huge fundamental catalyst that should augment AbbVie’s already-impressive three-year revenue growth rate of 13.4%. Just as well, the company represents one of the top high-yield dividend stocks thanks to its forward yield of 4.48%. Also, the payout ratio is reasonable at 55.7%.', 'Oh yeah, we’re talking 51 years of consecutive payout increases. So, I think it’s one of the high-yield dividend growth stocks available.', 'Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com', 'Now, before you lay into me, Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) as a utility giant wouldn’t automatically be considered one of the distinctive growth stocks. As you know, utility companies tend to be boring affairs. They’re not necessarily about growth but rather consistent profitability. So, most people can see DUK as a standalone example of high-yield dividend stocks.', 'Still, let’s look at this narrative from a relative perspective. Sure, Duke’s three-year revenue growth rate of 2.8% isn’t anywhere close to remarkable. Indeed, it’s not even good compared to the rest of the industry. However, in 2022, the company posted revenue of $28.8 billion, a decent jump from the prior year’s $24.6 billion. On a TTM basis, Duke’s looking at $29.2 billion in sales.', 'Also, cost-of-living expenses are pushing millennials to areas which Duke serves, such as the Carolinas. It’s positioned where the money will be, not necessarily where it is right now. And that just makes the company’s 4.56% forward yield all the more attractive. Definitely, it’s one of the high-yield dividend growth stocks to consider.', 'Source: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com', 'One of the riskier ideas among high-yield dividend growth stocks, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) requires faith. By that, I’m talking about the ability to anticipate revenue growth that just isn’t there yet. Sure, Pfizer may enjoy a three-year revenue growth rate of 34.4%, a massively impressive statistic. However, that stemmed from the Covid-19 period, when the company offered a return-to-normalcy pathway.', 'Unfortunately for PFE stakeholders, dramatically fading fears of the SARS-CoV-2 virus meant that Pfizer had nowhere to go but down. Nevertheless, Pfizer likely benefited from the acumen forged during its development of the underlying messenger-RNA vaccine. Armed with this tech, it can now address other diseases or medical needs. Plus, in Q3, Pfizer enjoyed sequential quarter-to-quarter growth.', 'Could that be a turning point? I don’t know. It’s a risk, like I said earlier. But what I do know is that the company offers a forward yield of 5.48%. That makes PFE one of the top high-yield dividend stocks with robust growth potential.', 'Source: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock', 'A controversial and seemingly irrelevant enterprise, Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) might seem like a joke idea for high-yield dividend growth stocks. To paraphrase the old school “Where’s the Beef” commercials, investors are right to ask, “where’s the growth?” Research shows that global smoking rates have declined for both men and women.', 'If you ask anyone on the street, that doesn’t sound like a promising thesis for growth stocks. However, as I have argued frequently over the past several months, Philip Morris should benefit from sales of tobacco alternatives: I’m referring to e-cigarettes or vaporizers (or whatever industry aficionados want to call them). And it turns out, this counterintuitive narrative was the correct one.', 'Per CNBC, while the tobacco giant’s revenue total missed analysts’ estimates, sales for its heated tobacco and oral nicotine products remained robust. Heated tobacco products are also know as heat-not-burn devices are electronic devices.', 'Lastly, Philip Morris commands a forward yield of 5.66%. If you can handle the risk, PM offers a balanced opportunity among high-yield dividend stocks.', 'Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock', 'Saving the riskiest idea for last, Vici Properties (NYSE:VICI) will require nerves of steel. And depending on how circumstances go regarding the potentially fading revenge travel phenomenon, I could talk about VICI in a not-so-pleasant context in the future. I’m just letting you know upfront. With that said, the company makes a historically strong case for growth stocks to consider.', 'Per Gurufocus, Vici’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 13.2%. That’s above 87.72% of industry players As well, VICI trades at forward earnings ratio of 11.96X, translating to an undervalued profile. It’s quite possible that shares are de-risked, which might appeal to contrarians. Further, with a TTM revenue of $3.45 billion, that’s well above the 2022 haul of $2.6 billion.', 'But can this mercurial growth trek continue? I believe it’s a pensive situation, considering the state of the consumer economy. However, for those that do want to take the risk, the company offers a forward yield of 5.81%. For such a high yield, the payout ratio is relatively reasonable at 62%.', 'As for analysts, it lands as a strong buy consensus. So, VICI could be one of the high-yield dividend growth stocks to buy.', 'On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

If you want to skip our introduction to the investment bank and the latest saga surrounding its business, then take a look at Goldman Sachs' Top 15 Stock Picks for 2024. "", ""The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is one of the biggest investment banks in the world. It is also one of the oldest banks around since the institution traces its roots back to the 19th century in 1839. While Goldman Sachs' operations have stood the test of time and the bank is still managing money for clients nearly two centuries after its founding, these days, the bank has landed itself into quite a bit of turmoil."", ""This is because the bank's plans to target consumer banking turned out to be rather disastrous, forcing Goldman to take multi-million dollar hits to its income statement. The bank's first quarter of 2023 earnings report revealed that it had taken a massive $470 million loss to its loan portfolio as part of an effort to reorganize the retail banking division. The first quarter was particularly hard for Goldman and the banking industry as a whole as several bank collapsed in the U.S. creating worries about the stability of the entire system."", ""Goldman's second quarter results weren't impressive either as it reported $10.9 billion in revenue and $3.08 in earnings per share, beating and missing analyst estimates for the two segments, respectively. While the first quarter earnings were marred by the consumer banking loan impairments, Q2 was marked by an equally stunning $504 million impairment for the bank's GreenSky buy now, pay later service and $485 million of write downs in real estate. This made it unsurprising that Goldman missed analyst EPS estimates. At the same time, its profit tanked by a painful 60% annually, to touch a three year low. Yet, during the earnings call, Goldman's embattled chief executive officer Mr. David Solomon was in fire control mode as he stressed that momentum in the investment banking business was picking up. During Q2, Goldman's investment banking fees fell to $1.43 billion to miss analyst estimates of $1.49 billion."", ""Unfortunately for Goldman Sachs, the double digit percentage drops during the second quarter wouldn't be its last. The bank's financials for the third quarter saw its profit drop by 33% annually to sit at $2.1 billion for earnings per share of $5.47. This allowed Goldman Sachs to beat analyst EPS estimates during Q3 by a hairline of five cents. The quarterly profit results showed the scale of its troubles since it completed two consecutive years of quarters of annual profit drops. For Goldman, the earnings troubles came at a particularly painful time for the U.S. banking industry which was (and still is) dealing with historically high interest rates and slowing economic output. The bank joined its peers to cut jobs in June 2023, when its chief operating officer shared that a fresh bout of layoffs would cut 250 jobs and build over the thousands more that it had laid off in January."", ""So, what are Goldman Sachs' views about the future? Well, here's what its management had to say during its third quarter of 2023 earnings call:"", 'Most recently, we announced the sale of GreenSky. We also announced the sale of Personal Financial Management this summer. We sold substantially all of our markets loan portfolio. We have reduced our historical principal investments by $9 billion this year. We are confident that the work we’re doing now provides us a stronger platform for 2024 and beyond. As we assess the operating backdrop, the US economy has proven to be more resilient than expected, though there are reasons to remain vigilant. Treasury rates have risen sharply over the past few months with 10-year yields up 75 basis points in the third quarter. On top of that, recent inflation and employment data has come in above estimates, driving market expectations of higher for longer interest rates.', 'And there still are a number of sectors in the economy that have yet to absorb the impact of higher rates, especially in light of the further tightening in financial conditions we’ve seen over the last quarter. At the same time, there has been an escalation of geopolitical stresses around the globe, the [indiscernible] war in Ukraine, tensions with China and now the conflict in the Middle East. Overall levels of risk are more elevated than we’ve seen in quite some time. While we don’t know where this will all lead, it could impact economic growth and stability in the U.S. and around the world, and we remain cautiously positioned.', ""So, with the future still uncertain, what are Goldman Sachs' top stock picks for 2024? We took a look at the bank's latest portfolio and found that its top three picks are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)."", 'Copyright: mikewaters / 123RF Stock Photo', 'Our Methodology ', ""To compile our list of Goldman Sachs' top stock picks for 2024, we scanned through the bank's filings with the SEC and picked out its 15 biggest investment positions."", ""Goldman Sachs' Q3 2023 Investment Value: $2.4 billion "", 'NRG Energy, Inc.

According to a report by Precedence Research, the global diabetes drug market size was valued at $61.9 billion in 2022 and is expected to hit $118 billion by 2032, growing at a CAGR of 6.67% during the forecast period 2022-2032. The market was predominantly controlled by the insulin segment of the diabetes industry, with the insulin segment to grow at a CAGR of more than 3% during the forecast period, owing to skyrocketing demand from people who suffer from Type-1 diabetes.', 'This rampant growth is catalyzed by certain drivers, one of them being an excessive sugar diet. Advancements in diabetes diagnosis devices like portable glucometers drive the diabetes market to post impressive growth figures. Furthermore, an increase in R&D for innovating diabetes treatments and market product approvals is a significant contributor to the market share growth for some of the best diabetes stocks to buy now like Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), Pfizer Inc.

Innovation in technology, such as the introduction of high-end insulin pumps and pens, cause demand to surge and encourages leading manufacturers to direct greater investments in developing advanced products to secure significant market shares. According to a report by Bloomberg, more than 1.3 billion people globally are projected to by inflicted with diabetes by 2050, which in turn, is likely to cause demand for diabetes drugs to surge. The vast majority of this population is expected to have type-2 diabetes, which is the variant of the disease intricately interlinked with obesity. A report by McKinsey also highlights that the rampant growth in the fast food industry and innovations and evolutions in food delivery are a primary cause of obesity in many countries and are directly linked to a rise in diabetes. With food delivery becoming a global market valued at more than $150 million as of 2022, the outlook for global diabetes seems to be incredibly bleak. However, it provides huge upside potential for some of the best diabetes stocks to buy now. You can read more on the diabetes industry in our article 10 Best Ways to Prevent Type-2 Diabetes.', 'As the burden of chronic diseases, like diabetes and obesity, exacerbate around the world and insert additional pressure on already dwindling economic and public health systems, these challenges have created a need for extensive and effective disease management solutions which are optimized and enabled via digital technologies. According to McKinsey, global health funding grew at an impressive rate of a little less than 80% over 2022 to reach more than $57.2 billion in 2023. Within this segment, funding for digital therapeutics has surged at a greater rate - up by more than 130% as compared to 2022 to reach a mammoth $8.9 billion in 2021. Hence, it becomes increasingly clearer that digital therapeutics can play an infinitely critical role in the management and even responsiveness to chronic diseases like diabetes. The article asserts that chronic diseases need to be dealt with not only by mere medication by also with regular monitoring and lifestyle changes, causing some of the best diabetes stocks to buy now like Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) to divert greater investments towards the production and development of digital therapeutic devices.

Technologies such as smart inhalers and continuous glucose monitors can alert patients and provide them with out-of-range readings. Secondly, the best diabetes stocks to buy now like Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) which have diverted significant focus on the development of their digital therapeutics portfolio must keep payers and providers within the information ecosystem, by opening the doors for payers to identify and reward good behavior on the part of the patient, and penalize poor adherence to health plans which are prescribed by providers. Furthermore, companies can also invest in the integration of gamified behavioral modification techniques by offering challenges and incentives to track compliance with health plans. Lastly a recent survey conducted by McKinsey discovered that more than 90 percent of healthcare leaders are of the view that patients prefer an integrated journey rather than point experiences. Companies can fulfill this desire by investing in digital health malls which include easy access to prescribed medications, health supplements, wellness products, and diagnostic kits.', 'To compile our list of the 12 best diabetes stocks to buy now, we first made a list of the 30 largest diabetes companies in the world in terms of their market capitalization.

In the past 30 days, the benchmark S&P 500 gained almost 6%. Since the start of the year, the index moved up 18%.', 'On the surface, that might seem like a no-lose proposition. After all, if you buy the snooze-inducing SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY), you’re beating the inflation rate and adding a decent return on top of that. Under this context, it’s easy to see why some would consider safe stocks to be an overly pensive strategy.', 'However, it’s important to point out that while we see some key improvements, inflation remains stubbornly high. As well, excessive borrowing costs have hurt spending for high-ticket items, likely contributing to an erosion of demand for electric vehicles, to mention just one example.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'With the real possibility of red ink in 2024, investors shouldn’t outright dismiss these reliable stocks for a volatile market.', 'Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com', 'As a popular manufacturer of household goods, you can’t get that much better of an idea for reliable stocks for a volatile market than Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG).

Of course, I don’t anticipate a repeat performance anytime soon.', 'However, it goes to show you that household goods manufacturers have their place when the smelly stuff hits the fan; in this case, quite literally.

So yeah, I do think it’s one of the reliable stocks for a volatile market.', 'To be blunt, Mondelez didn’t quite perform that well during the immediate aftermath of the Great Recession.

(NASDAQ:ADI) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 4 days. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Thus, you can purchase Analog Devices' shares before the 1st of December in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 14th of December."", ""The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.86 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$3.44 per share to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that Analog Devices has a trailing yield of 1.9% on the current share price of $183.05.

That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing."", ' View our latest analysis for Analog Devices ', 'Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Analog Devices paid out more than half (52%) of its earnings last year, which is a regular payout ratio for most companies.

Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 47% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio.', ""It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. Fortunately for readers, Analog Devices's earnings per share have been growing at 11% a year for the past five years. Analog Devices is paying out a bit over half its earnings, which suggests the company is striking a balance between reinvesting in growth, and paying dividends. This is a reasonable combination that could hint at some further dividend increases in the future."", ""Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, Analog Devices has lifted its dividend by approximately 11% a year on average. It's exciting to see that both earnings and dividends per share have grown rapidly over the past few years."", ""From a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Analog Devices? Analog Devices's growing earnings per share and conservative payout ratios make for a decent combination. We also like that it paid out a lower percentage of its cash flow.

Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Specifically, we decided to study Tapestry's  ROE in this article."", ""Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Tapestry ', 'The formula for return on equity is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Tapestry is:', '39% = US$936m ÷ US$2.4b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.39 in profit."", 'So far, we\'ve learned that ROE is a measure of a company\'s profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don\'t necessarily bear these characteristics.', ""To begin with, Tapestry has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 15% the company's ROE is quite impressive. Probably as a result of this, Tapestry was able to see a decent net income growth of 18% over the last five years."", ""As a next step, we compared Tapestry's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 14%."", 'Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is Tapestry fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.', 'Tapestry has a three-year median payout ratio of 30%, which implies that it retains the remaining 70% of its profits. This suggests that its dividend is well covered, and given the decent growth seen by the company, it looks like management is reinvesting its earnings efficiently.', ""Besides, Tapestry has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 31% of its profits over the next three years. As a result, Tapestry's ROE is not expected to change by much either, which we inferred from the analyst estimate of 33% for future ROE."", ""In total, we are pretty happy with Tapestry's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 65% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.', 'Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.', ""Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Walt Disney, beginning with the chart below."", ' View our latest analysis for Walt Disney ', ""Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing."", ""Walt Disney already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Walt Disney's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story."", ""Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Walt Disney is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.2% of shares outstanding. With 6.5% and 4.0% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders."", ""Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder."", ""While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future."", 'The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.', 'Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.', 'Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of The Walt Disney Company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$48m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. ', ""The general public-- including retail investors -- own 35% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders."", ""It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company.

(NYSE:UAA), might not be a large cap stock, but it saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. As a mid-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Under Armour’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists.', ' View our latest analysis for Under Armour ', 'According to my valuation model, Under Armour seems to be fairly priced at around 13% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Under Armour today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $8.82, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Under Armour’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.', ""Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Though in the case of Under Armour, it is expected to deliver a negative earnings growth of -12%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. It appears that risk of future uncertainty is high, at least in the near term."", 'Are you a shareholder? UAA seems fairly priced right now, but given the uncertainty from negative returns in the future, this could be the right time to de-risk your portfolio. Is your current exposure to the stock beneficial for your total portfolio? And is the opportunity cost of holding a negative-outlook stock too high? Before you make a decision on the stock, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.', 'Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on UAA for a while, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. The price seems to be trading at fair value, which means there’s less benefit from mispricing. Furthermore, the negative growth outlook increases the risk of holding the stock. However, there are also other important factors we haven’t considered today, which can help crystalize your views on UAA should the price fluctuate below its true value.', ""With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks.

If you want to skip our introduction to the investment bank and the latest saga surrounding its business, then take a look at Goldman Sachs' Top 15 Stock Picks for 2024. "", ""The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is one of the biggest investment banks in the world. It is also one of the oldest banks around since the institution traces its roots back to the 19th century in 1839. While Goldman Sachs' operations have stood the test of time and the bank is still managing money for clients nearly two centuries after its founding, these days, the bank has landed itself into quite a bit of turmoil."", ""This is because the bank's plans to target consumer banking turned out to be rather disastrous, forcing Goldman to take multi-million dollar hits to its income statement. The bank's first quarter of 2023 earnings report revealed that it had taken a massive $470 million loss to its loan portfolio as part of an effort to reorganize the retail banking division. The first quarter was particularly hard for Goldman and the banking industry as a whole as several bank collapsed in the U.S. creating worries about the stability of the entire system."", ""Goldman's second quarter results weren't impressive either as it reported $10.9 billion in revenue and $3.08 in earnings per share, beating and missing analyst estimates for the two segments, respectively. While the first quarter earnings were marred by the consumer banking loan impairments, Q2 was marked by an equally stunning $504 million impairment for the bank's GreenSky buy now, pay later service and $485 million of write downs in real estate. This made it unsurprising that Goldman missed analyst EPS estimates. At the same time, its profit tanked by a painful 60% annually, to touch a three year low. Yet, during the earnings call, Goldman's embattled chief executive officer Mr. David Solomon was in fire control mode as he stressed that momentum in the investment banking business was picking up. During Q2, Goldman's investment banking fees fell to $1.43 billion to miss analyst estimates of $1.49 billion."", ""Unfortunately for Goldman Sachs, the double digit percentage drops during the second quarter wouldn't be its last. The bank's financials for the third quarter saw its profit drop by 33% annually to sit at $2.1 billion for earnings per share of $5.47. This allowed Goldman Sachs to beat analyst EPS estimates during Q3 by a hairline of five cents. The quarterly profit results showed the scale of its troubles since it completed two consecutive years of quarters of annual profit drops. For Goldman, the earnings troubles came at a particularly painful time for the U.S. banking industry which was (and still is) dealing with historically high interest rates and slowing economic output. The bank joined its peers to cut jobs in June 2023, when its chief operating officer shared that a fresh bout of layoffs would cut 250 jobs and build over the thousands more that it had laid off in January."", ""So, what are Goldman Sachs' views about the future? Well, here's what its management had to say during its third quarter of 2023 earnings call:"", 'Most recently, we announced the sale of GreenSky. We also announced the sale of Personal Financial Management this summer. We sold substantially all of our markets loan portfolio. We have reduced our historical principal investments by $9 billion this year. We are confident that the work we’re doing now provides us a stronger platform for 2024 and beyond. As we assess the operating backdrop, the US economy has proven to be more resilient than expected, though there are reasons to remain vigilant. Treasury rates have risen sharply over the past few months with 10-year yields up 75 basis points in the third quarter. On top of that, recent inflation and employment data has come in above estimates, driving market expectations of higher for longer interest rates.', 'And there still are a number of sectors in the economy that have yet to absorb the impact of higher rates, especially in light of the further tightening in financial conditions we’ve seen over the last quarter. At the same time, there has been an escalation of geopolitical stresses around the globe, the [indiscernible] war in Ukraine, tensions with China and now the conflict in the Middle East. Overall levels of risk are more elevated than we’ve seen in quite some time. While we don’t know where this will all lead, it could impact economic growth and stability in the U.S. and around the world, and we remain cautiously positioned.', ""So, with the future still uncertain, what are Goldman Sachs' top stock picks for 2024? We took a look at the bank's latest portfolio and found that its top three picks are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)."", 'Copyright: mikewaters / 123RF Stock Photo', 'Our Methodology ', ""To compile our list of Goldman Sachs' top stock picks for 2024, we scanned through the bank's filings with the SEC and picked out its 15 biggest investment positions."", ""Goldman Sachs' Q3 2023 Investment Value: $2.4 billion "", 'NRG Energy, Inc.

To skip the detailed analysis of current economic conditions and forecasts, go directly to the 5 Best Very Cheap Stocks To Buy Now According To Hedge Funds.', 'We are at the end of 2023, and recession hasn’t hit the world’s biggest economies like the US and China, as predicted by several analysts earlier. In March, over 70% of the National Association of Business Economics’ (NABE) survey panelists believed that the growth in the consumer price index (CPI) would remain above 4% by the end of the year. Furthermore, 24% of the panelists believed a recession might start in the third quarter of 2023.', 'In the October 31-November 1 meeting, the Federal Reserve did not raise the interest rates for the third time in the last four sessions as the CPI dropped to 3.7% in September and was at 3.2% in October, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The employment rate has remained steady with slight fluctuations, and the stock market has shown resilience as the S&P 500 is up 19.23% and the NASDAQ-100 is up 47.13% year-to-date on November 24. Additionally, the US GDP grew 4.9% in the third quarter of 2023, up from 2.1% in the second quarter.', 'Nonetheless, experts still have different opinions about the economic outlook. While some experts believe that the US will be able to achieve a “soft landing,” others believe that risks of recession are still there.', ""While experts can sometimes correctly predict market conditions and provide close to accurate forecasts, the market remains unpredictable for several reasons. For example, no one could have predicted the COVID-19 pandemic or the Russian invasion of Ukraine, both of which sent the global economy into chaos. Furthermore, many financial news websites suggest investing in utilities, healthcare, and real estate segments during tough economic conditions. However, our previous report suggests that these three were this year's worst performing sectors of the stock market."", 'Despite the unpredictability of the market, there are still some steps that can be taken to avoid losing a lot of money during an economic turmoil. Value stocks are a good option during a recession as it is believed that even though value stocks are not an absolute protection against recession, they are likely to do less damage to your investment portfolio during one. Additionally, it is a good idea to avoid companies with unsustainable debt and high volatility.', 'Another option investors, especially beginners, can opt for is safe, well-established stocks that aren’t affected by short-term economic fluctuations and can safeguard investments for the long term till the economy shows clear signs of recovery.', 'Some examples of safe stocks can be The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM). Both of the companies are old, well-established in their sectors, and have a stable dividend and sustainable payout ratios.', 'Hedge funds are also a great option because leaving it to the experts might be the best option when there is high uncertainty and a lack of knowledge. Some of the most successful hedge fund managers include Warren Buffett, Ken Griffin, and Seth Klarman. Klarman’s Baupost Group has been able to post average annualized returns of 20% since its inception. On the other hand, Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investments posted $16 billion in profits in 2022.', ""While economists and experts are still debating the direction that the economy might take, stocks with low valuations, which are favored by hedge funds, can prove to be beneficial for investors.

The company has seen faster-than-expected price declines from the highs reached after the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war, as supplies from Belarus and Russia gradually found their way around the global sanctions. Also, higher cost inflation has delayed discretionary fertilizer purchases by farmers. However, we believe the global agricultural cycle remains broadly supportive. With fertilizer prices normalizing above the pre-pandemic levels, pent up demand from farmers’ need to replenish diminished soil land banks, and continued pressure on Belarussian and Russian supplies, we believe the company’s earnings power will remain at above-history levels.

If you want to skip our introduction to Warren Buffett, his latest portfolio changes, and his firm, then take a look at Warren Buffett and Corporate Insiders Love These Stocks: Top 5 Stocks. ', ""For anyone who even briefly follows the stock market, Warren Buffett is no stranger. His success in the stock market and the ability to pick out a handful of stocks among the thousands that change hands daily has made Mr. Buffett one of the richest people in the world. He makes his investments through the financial holding company Berkshire Hathaway. Berkshire's investments are not limited only to publicly traded companies. Instead, the firm also owns private businesses, and every quarter, it generates revenue from these investments."", ""The nature of Berkshire's income statements makes it necessary for the firm to take out sizeable stakes in at least some stocks that are part of its portfolio. This is because since Berkshire is not a hedge fund, it does not engage in traditional trading strategies such as leveraged puts or calls. Neither does it buy stocks simply to sell them later at a higher price. Instead, Berkshire's business model works by first investing in businesses that are revenue generators themselves, or sizeable and well established companies that can pay out dividends."", ""Berkshire Hathaway's investors have such a high amount of faith in Mr. Buffett and Charlie Munger that despite the fact that none of the dividends that are paid to Berkshire are paid to the shareholders, they continue to invest in the company. The dividends that Berkshire receives are sizeable too. Its financial statements show that during the first three quarters of 2023, Berkshire earned $4 billion through dividends, interest, and other income. In fact, two of Berkshire's biggest investments during the third quarter, namely the 915 million shares that it owns of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and the 1 billion shares of Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) led to nearly half a billion dollars of dividends being paid to Mr. Buffett's investment firm in a quarter."", ""Safe to say, trust is a central element in Warren Buffett's business model. Berkshire's investors believe that he and Mr. Munger can invest their money better than they would be able to do so. Therefore, they primarily derive value from their investment through the shares of Berkshire Hathaway relative to the U.S. dollar. A sound investment strategy contributes to share price appreciation at percentage levels that are greater than bonds, the broader market, or other financial instruments can offer. As an illustration, consider the share price returns of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A) and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B). Over the past five years, a turbulent time period that has seen significant volatility in the stock market through a pandemic and then global geopolitical conflict, the S&P 500 index has gained 72.74%. The classes of Berkshire's shares, namely Class A and Class B, have gained 76.53% and 74.50%, respectively. This makes it clear that Berkshire's investors can do well even during stock market black swan events, and that the businesses that Mr. Buffett and his peers invest in end up performing better than a broader collection of stocks."", ""Large investment conglomerates and hedge funds don't simply invest in companies through their gut feelings. A large portion of their investment decisions are based on meetings with company management to gain a deeper understanding of the business model while not violating any insider trading laws. This is partly why professional investors are trusted by their clients, as their business insights often constitute advanced market signals that can contribute to broader share price appreciation down the road."", ""Before we get to the stocks that both Warren Buffett and corporate insiders love, a brief look at the latest investment decisions by Berkshire is also important. During the third quarter, Berkshire increased its investments in The Liberty SiriusXM Group (NASDAQ:LSXMA) by buying roughly $2 billion worth of additional shares. Additionally, the firm also bought $7.9 million worth of shares of the holding company for the baseball company Atlanta Braves, Atlanta Braves Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:BATRA).

If you want to skip our introduction to Warren Buffett, his latest portfolio changes, and his firm, then take a look at Warren Buffett and Corporate Insiders Love These Stocks: Top 5 Stocks. ', ""For anyone who even briefly follows the stock market, Warren Buffett is no stranger. His success in the stock market and the ability to pick out a handful of stocks among the thousands that change hands daily has made Mr. Buffett one of the richest people in the world. He makes his investments through the financial holding company Berkshire Hathaway. Berkshire's investments are not limited only to publicly traded companies. Instead, the firm also owns private businesses, and every quarter, it generates revenue from these investments."", ""The nature of Berkshire's income statements makes it necessary for the firm to take out sizeable stakes in at least some stocks that are part of its portfolio. This is because since Berkshire is not a hedge fund, it does not engage in traditional trading strategies such as leveraged puts or calls. Neither does it buy stocks simply to sell them later at a higher price. Instead, Berkshire's business model works by first investing in businesses that are revenue generators themselves, or sizeable and well established companies that can pay out dividends."", ""Berkshire Hathaway's investors have such a high amount of faith in Mr. Buffett and Charlie Munger that despite the fact that none of the dividends that are paid to Berkshire are paid to the shareholders, they continue to invest in the company. The dividends that Berkshire receives are sizeable too. Its financial statements show that during the first three quarters of 2023, Berkshire earned $4 billion through dividends, interest, and other income. In fact, two of Berkshire's biggest investments during the third quarter, namely the 915 million shares that it owns of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and the 1 billion shares of Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) led to nearly half a billion dollars of dividends being paid to Mr. Buffett's investment firm in a quarter."", ""Safe to say, trust is a central element in Warren Buffett's business model. Berkshire's investors believe that he and Mr. Munger can invest their money better than they would be able to do so. Therefore, they primarily derive value from their investment through the shares of Berkshire Hathaway relative to the U.S. dollar. A sound investment strategy contributes to share price appreciation at percentage levels that are greater than bonds, the broader market, or other financial instruments can offer. As an illustration, consider the share price returns of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A) and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B). Over the past five years, a turbulent time period that has seen significant volatility in the stock market through a pandemic and then global geopolitical conflict, the S&P 500 index has gained 72.74%. The classes of Berkshire's shares, namely Class A and Class B, have gained 76.53% and 74.50%, respectively. This makes it clear that Berkshire's investors can do well even during stock market black swan events, and that the businesses that Mr. Buffett and his peers invest in end up performing better than a broader collection of stocks."", ""Large investment conglomerates and hedge funds don't simply invest in companies through their gut feelings. A large portion of their investment decisions are based on meetings with company management to gain a deeper understanding of the business model while not violating any insider trading laws. This is partly why professional investors are trusted by their clients, as their business insights often constitute advanced market signals that can contribute to broader share price appreciation down the road."", ""Before we get to the stocks that both Warren Buffett and corporate insiders love, a brief look at the latest investment decisions by Berkshire is also important. During the third quarter, Berkshire increased its investments in The Liberty SiriusXM Group (NASDAQ:LSXMA) by buying roughly $2 billion worth of additional shares. Additionally, the firm also bought $7.9 million worth of shares of the holding company for the baseball company Atlanta Braves, Atlanta Braves Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:BATRA).

In the past 30 days, the benchmark S&P 500 gained almost 6%. Since the start of the year, the index moved up 18%.', 'On the surface, that might seem like a no-lose proposition. After all, if you buy the snooze-inducing SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY), you’re beating the inflation rate and adding a decent return on top of that. Under this context, it’s easy to see why some would consider safe stocks to be an overly pensive strategy.', 'However, it’s important to point out that while we see some key improvements, inflation remains stubbornly high. As well, excessive borrowing costs have hurt spending for high-ticket items, likely contributing to an erosion of demand for electric vehicles, to mention just one example.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'With the real possibility of red ink in 2024, investors shouldn’t outright dismiss these reliable stocks for a volatile market.', 'Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com', 'As a popular manufacturer of household goods, you can’t get that much better of an idea for reliable stocks for a volatile market than Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG). To use an extreme example, the company’s products saw intense demand during the initial disruption of the Covid-19 pandemic. Of course, I don’t anticipate a repeat performance anytime soon.', 'However, it goes to show you that household goods manufacturers have their place when the smelly stuff hits the fan; in this case, quite literally. For those interested in the data, in the company’s fiscal year ended June 2009, it posted revenue of $76.7 billion. That was a 6.2% loss from the prior year. However, the company quickly marched higher, making it a top choice for safe stocks to buy.', 'To be sure, P&G is not an exciting enterprise and that’s by design. It exists to provide a stable, predictable business. In addition, it will offer a decent (but not great) forward yield of 2.49%. If we do face troubles, this is a name you’ll want in your portfolio.', 'Source: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.com', 'Speaking of boring enterprises, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) is incredibly relevant. However, it pays for this relevance through a business narrative that eschews heart-pounding antics for predictability. Still, that could be a wonderful attribute if we face economic uncertainty. Indeed, since the start of the year, COST gained over 27% of equity value. You got to admit, that’s quite impressive for what it is.', 'Fundamentally, Costco makes a strong case for reliable stocks for a volatile market because of its core consumer base. Listen, we’re all special in our own unique way. But Costco members are more special than shoppers of competing big-box retailers. Featuring a younger, wealthier and more upwardly mobile base than the competition, COST could be relatively insulated.', 'To be sure, the retailer took a beating in its fiscal 2009, posting revenue of only $71.42 billion. However, in the following year, it stormed to $4.95 billion. Then a year later, it’s up to $88.92 billion. Put another way, COST is one of the safe stocks to buy.', 'Source: Tama2u / Shutterstock', 'With fast-food icon McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD), investors may absorb an opportunity cost acquiring shares of the Golden Arches during bullish cycles. Yes, MCD is one of the reliable stocks to buy, no doubt about it. However, during decisive upswings, your money can go much further with spicier enterprises. However, if you anticipate storm clouds brewing, then Mickey D’s could be quite appropriate.', 'Fundamentally, I appreciate the cheap pick-me-up argument that the Golden Arches offers. With consumer phenomena such as revenge travel showing signs of fatigue, everyday folks just might not be in the mood to spend their hard-earned discretionary dollars. After all, with major layoffs planned or announced, those dollars could eventually become unearned, as in not real.', 'In that case, you want to go as cheap as possible with your discretionary funds. McDonald’s can help in that regard. Also, the fast-food giant didn’t really suffer tumultuously during the Great Recession. In 2009, it posted revenue of $22.75 billion, down only 3.3%. It quickly recovered after that and I expect more of the same.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'A multinational confectionary company, Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ) also specializes in food, beverages and snacks. As a powerhouse in the grocery aisles, Mondelez should theoretically benefit handsomely from the trade-down effect. That is, consumers facing financial pressure might not immediately go cold turkey on their spending. Rather, they’ll trade down until they find an acceptable balance between price and quality.', 'Now, as humans, we all love a little indulgence – dopamine and all that jazz. During decisively bullish cycles, consumers may go out to boutique eateries to satisfy their cravings. Well, when the economic fecal matter hits the proverbial fan, guess what? You’re eating Oreos – which of course happens to be a Mondelez brand. So yeah, I do think it’s one of the reliable stocks for a volatile market.', 'To be blunt, Mondelez didn’t quite perform that well during the immediate aftermath of the Great Recession. However, it seems the trade-down effect is in full swing currently. For example, in the third quarter of this year, the company posted $9.03 billion in sales, up 16.3% against the year-ago period.', 'Source: 360b / Shutterstock.com', 'A gas and electric utility holding company, Southern Company (NYSE:SO) benefits from a core catalyst: advantaging a natural monopoly. As you know, not just anyone can become a public utility. Setting aside the matter of entrenched competition, prospective utilities must comply with various rules and regulations. Nothing legally prevents competition from materializing; it’s just that it’s too difficult to stack up against a Southern Company and its ilk.', 'Along with that natural monopoly is the captive audience concept. No matter what happens with the economy, both households and businesses must pay their utility bills. Otherwise, in this modern paradigm, you’d be up a smelly creek without a paddle. It’s not a great place to be which is why entities do everything they can to pay their obligations. Cynically, that’s a key reason why SO represents one of the reliable stocks.', 'For full disclosure, Southern did take a hit during the Great Recession. In 2009, its revenue slipped to $15.74 billion, down 8% on the prior year. However, in the next year, the company bounced right back up so it could be one of the safe stocks.', 'Source: shutterstock.com/LCV', 'While the technology space has been on fire (in a good way), you can leave it to IBM (NYSE:IBM) to turn a riveting subject into a snoozefest. That’s not to disparage the myriad relevant businesses under the “Big Blue” umbrella. However, since the beginning of the year, IBM stock gained a mere 8%. That’s just not cutting it against the competition.', 'However, with so many companies trading at wildly intense multiples, IBM deserves a closer look for patient investors. For example, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares trade at a trailing-year earnings multiple of over 119x. In sharp contrast, IBM’s price-earnings (PE) ratio sits at 20.3X. Also, Big Blue’s forward PE is a mere 15.3x, lower than nearly 69% of its peers.', 'While Nvidia captured headlines for its undergirding of artificial intelligence protocols, let’s not forget that IBM helped pioneer research into this field. Ahead of possible grumblings in the market, IBM just might make more sense. Additionally, the company offers a forward dividend yield of 4.34%, well above the tech sector’s average yield of 1.37%.', 'Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com', 'I’m going to take a huge risk with so-called reliable stocks with Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY). Under a basic framework, BMY should indeed be in the running for safe stocks for a volatile market. As a pharmaceutical giant, its narrative enjoys insulation, all other things being equal. Good economy or not, people get diagnosed with all kinds of conditions and diseases. BMY is on the forefront of positive change.', 'Unfortunately, shares stumbled nearly 30% since the January opener. Circumstances continue to get worse, with the pharma posting key product sales that fell short of expectations in Q3. Per MarketWatch, among these disappointments was cancer drug Opdivo. While the end result was lackluster, a possibility exists of a bounce back.', 'As you might expect, the options market hasn’t been pretty for those long BMY. In particular, Fintel’s screener for options flow – which exclusively targets big block trades likely made by institutions – shows significant volume for sold calls.', 'However, because option sellers don’t have the right to force an exercise of the trade (that right belongs to option buyers), an open lability exists. Eventually, we could see a gamma squeeze, which would make things very interesting.', 'On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

To skip the detailed analysis of current economic conditions and forecasts, go directly to the 5 Best Very Cheap Stocks To Buy Now According To Hedge Funds.', 'We are at the end of 2023, and recession hasn’t hit the world’s biggest economies like the US and China, as predicted by several analysts earlier. In March, over 70% of the National Association of Business Economics’ (NABE) survey panelists believed that the growth in the consumer price index (CPI) would remain above 4% by the end of the year. Furthermore, 24% of the panelists believed a recession might start in the third quarter of 2023.', 'In the October 31-November 1 meeting, the Federal Reserve did not raise the interest rates for the third time in the last four sessions as the CPI dropped to 3.7% in September and was at 3.2% in October, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The employment rate has remained steady with slight fluctuations, and the stock market has shown resilience as the S&P 500 is up 19.23% and the NASDAQ-100 is up 47.13% year-to-date on November 24. Additionally, the US GDP grew 4.9% in the third quarter of 2023, up from 2.1% in the second quarter.', 'Nonetheless, experts still have different opinions about the economic outlook. While some experts believe that the US will be able to achieve a “soft landing,” others believe that risks of recession are still there.', ""While experts can sometimes correctly predict market conditions and provide close to accurate forecasts, the market remains unpredictable for several reasons. For example, no one could have predicted the COVID-19 pandemic or the Russian invasion of Ukraine, both of which sent the global economy into chaos. Furthermore, many financial news websites suggest investing in utilities, healthcare, and real estate segments during tough economic conditions. However, our previous report suggests that these three were this year's worst performing sectors of the stock market."", 'Despite the unpredictability of the market, there are still some steps that can be taken to avoid losing a lot of money during an economic turmoil. Value stocks are a good option during a recession as it is believed that even though value stocks are not an absolute protection against recession, they are likely to do less damage to your investment portfolio during one. Additionally, it is a good idea to avoid companies with unsustainable debt and high volatility.', 'Another option investors, especially beginners, can opt for is safe, well-established stocks that aren’t affected by short-term economic fluctuations and can safeguard investments for the long term till the economy shows clear signs of recovery.', 'Some examples of safe stocks can be The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM). Both of the companies are old, well-established in their sectors, and have a stable dividend and sustainable payout ratios.', 'Hedge funds are also a great option because leaving it to the experts might be the best option when there is high uncertainty and a lack of knowledge. Some of the most successful hedge fund managers include Warren Buffett, Ken Griffin, and Seth Klarman. Klarman’s Baupost Group has been able to post average annualized returns of 20% since its inception. On the other hand, Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investments posted $16 billion in profits in 2022.', ""While economists and experts are still debating the direction that the economy might take, stocks with low valuations, which are favored by hedge funds, can prove to be beneficial for investors. While the PE ratio is not the absolute metric for defining a cheap stock, it can definitely help an investor determine a stock's relative valuation.

"", 'Our Methodology', 'For this article, we first made a comprehensive list of large- and mega-cap stocks with a PE ratio below 10.

Here is what it said:', '“Conversely, stock selection in the materials sector was the primary detractor from relative performance partially due to a decline in The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS), a leading provider of potash and phosphate fertilizers. The company has seen faster-than-expected price declines from the highs reached after the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war, as supplies from Belarus and Russia gradually found their way around the global sanctions. Also, higher cost inflation has delayed discretionary fertilizer purchases by farmers. However, we believe the global agricultural cycle remains broadly supportive. With fertilizer prices normalizing above the pre-pandemic levels, pent up demand from farmers’ need to replenish diminished soil land banks, and continued pressure on Belarussian and Russian supplies, we believe the company’s earnings power will remain at above-history levels. Additionally, the company’s commitment to share repurchases and debt paydowns has accreted value to existing shareholders and signaled a commitment by management to continue to do so.”', 'Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43', 'PE Ratio: 1.69', 'Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) is a Michigan-based well-known automobile manufacturer.

If you want to skip our overview of the lumber industry and how recent developments are shaping it, then take a look at the 5 Best Lumber Stocks To Invest In 2023. ', ""Lumber has been one of the most important natural resources for humanity's progress. It has been used for building, construction, and transportation for centuries, and was the primary building material for vehicles and houses before the dawn of the industrial era that enabled mass production of aluminum, steel, and other metals."", ""At the same time, humanity's reliance on lumber has had its drawbacks as well. Trees are an integral part of the world's ecology, and they play a crucial role in moderating temperatures and ensuring high quality air by removing pollutants. And even though these days lumber is not relied on as extensively for industrial growth as it was in the past, its usage has still picked up due to a growth in the global population."", 'This continued reliance on lumber is evident in the size of the global sawn wood market. Sawn wood is the end product that is a result of felling and processing trees, and estimates suggest that this industry was worth $751 million this year and is slated to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 0.74%. We also took a look at the Top 20 Largest Timber Exporting Countries in the World and discovered that the top three nations were Canada, Germany, and the U.S. since they exported $75.6 billion worth of timber in 2021. However, the growing global demand for lumber and timber is also leading to higher deforestation, and countries such as Australia have introduced logging bans which have also created uncertainty for workers who are employed in the lumber industry.', ""Shifting to the corporate side of the lumber industry, lumber prices fluctuate with the broader economic environment. Specifically, it's the construction industry that is the primary driver of lumber prices. This led to prices dropping in 2022 end, as rapid interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve and high inflation made their mark on the construction industry. In fact, the drop in lumber prices last year was quite hefty as well. The price of 1,000 board feet, which stood at $1,465 in February 2022, tanked to $432 in November 2022 for a substantial drop that was greater than 70%. In 2023, the lumber prices were on an upward trajectory once again, as notable events such as widespread fires in Canada ended up disrupting the market."", ""In terms of market value, out of the 15 Biggest Lumber Companies in the World, the top three are West Fraser Timber Co. Ltd. (NYSE:WFG), Canfor Corporation (OTC:CFPZF), and Weyerhaeuser Company (NYSE:WY). Analyzing their latest financial performance, West Fraser's third quarter earnings saw its revenue grow by a small $97 million sequentially while the earnings grew by $159 million profit overturned a previous loss of $131 million. Management shared that a key reason behind the lackluster financial performance was a continuation of slow demand from previous quarters."", ""Weyerhaeuser Company's 33 cents EPS in Q3 missed analyst estimates by a cent. This came as the firm's wood products sales dropped by 13% to $1.54 billion during the third quarter, with the demand for wood from the residential construction sector taking a sizeable hit due to homebuyers struggling to make purchases in a high interest rate and mortgage rate era. Adding to the firm's woes, it also had to deal with harvesting restrictions during the quarter as authorities became cautious after the devastating wildfires."", ""Looking at the future, here's what Weyerhaeuser Company (NYSE:WY)'s outlined during its third quarter earnings conference:"", 'Our macro view on the housing market is largely unchanged. Although we have seen some recent headwinds in the multifamily segment in response to increasing interest rates. Importantly, however, the single-family segment has remained resilient year-to-date. In fact, despite the elevated mortgage rate environment, single-family starts increased 3% quarter-over-quarter, and new home sales were up in September. As a reminder, single-family construction is a much more important demand driver for our business relative to multifamily. In the near-term, we continue to believe that the underlying housing demand is solid.', 'Even at higher interest rates, we expect single-family demand to hold up reasonably well given the limited inventory of existing homes on the market, combined with the home builders ability to offer mortgage rate buy downs and other incentives. That said, buyer sentiment will continue to be influenced by affordability challenges brought about by increased mortgage rates and elevated home prices, as well as the state of the overall economy. As a result, we continue to anticipate a choppier housing market in the near-term relative to the last couple of years. I will note, however, our long-term view on housing fundamentals continues to be very favorable, supported by strong demographic trends and a vastly under built housing stock.', ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at the best lumber stocks to buy.

While that sort of growth rate isn't anything to write home about, it does show the business is growing."", ""One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. EBIT margins for Intuit remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 13% to US$14b.

DVA, Option Care Health, Inc. OPCH, Addus HomeCare Corp. ADUS and The Pennant Group, Inc. PNTG.', 'Industry: Outpatient & Home Healthcare', 'Link: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2188929/4-stocks-to-watch-in-an-evolving-outpatient-home-health-industry', 'The pandemic altered the nature and dynamics of the healthcare industry. The Zacks Medical - Outpatient and Home Healthcare industry has gradually digitalized a part of its healthcare solutions. In the past few years, there has been a significant rise in demand for telemedicine-focused online medical and artificial intelligence (AI)--powered technology services. Owing to the pandemic, many healthcare companies that were traditionally not technology-based transformed to survive in the market.', 'Per a report by Grand View Research, the global healthcare analytics market was valued at $35.3 billion in 2022 and is expected to expand at a CAGR of 21.4% between 2023 and 2030. Another factor prompting these MedTech players to embrace digital healthcare is skyrocketing healthcare costs.', 'On a positive note, rising dependence on telehealth and AI is likely to help the industry thrive in the near term. DaVita Inc., Option Care Health, Inc., Addus HomeCare Corp. and The Pennant Group, Inc. are likely to gain from the prospects.', 'The industry comprises companies that offer ambulatory care in an outpatient setting or at home. They use advanced medical technologies for diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation services. The players include operators of HMO medical centers, kidney dialysis centers and other outpatient care centers.', 'After navigating a tough pandemic era, the payers and providers have been seeing steady growth on the back of innovation in services. This buoys optimism about prospects over the next few years, although persistent inflation in consumer prices could dent the outlook. The potential for scaling up innovation is an added plus. Also, the acceleration of value-based care models and the increasing application of technology across the healthcare industry are likely to continue in the long run.', 'Cost Effectiveness: The primary advantage of outpatient clinics is cost-effectiveness. Outpatient medical care clinics do not retain patients for long hours (overnight) or charge exorbitantly. Modern-day outpatient clinics offer a broad spectrum of treatment and diagnostic options and even conduct minor surgical procedures. Financial incentives like health plans and government program payment policies supporting services in lower-cost care settings have also been driving outpatient care.', 'Additionally, with value-based models of care steadily emerging as the future of healthcare, the shift from fee-for-service (FFS) to alternative payment models (APM) is an ongoing parallel trend. FFS will be crucial to care organizations as a benchmark through which providers can assess APM.', 'AI’s Dominant Role: AI has been a roaring success in healthcare, taking the outpatient and home healthcare space by storm. Outpatient companies prefer bots and automated techniques for managing health information. With the help of AI, hospitals have been achieving better outcomes, with patients receiving more efficient and personalized care. The outpatient industry has been generating huge profits from Electronic Health Records and ePrescriptions.', 'The most visible area where AI can make a significant difference is in mental healthcare at home. Addressing the most prevalent mental health conditions among home care patients —depression, anxiety and dementia — is essential to improving overall patient well-being. In recent years, complex machine learning algorithms have become capable of analyzing large datasets of patient information, including clinical and social diagnoses. These systems can alert caregivers regarding potential triggers or warning signs of mental health deterioration.', 'Dependence on Telehealth: The pandemic caused a decline in outpatient clinic visits where home healthcare providers struggled to offer quality care due to the risk of exposure to the virus. Though the impact of the pandemic has been far-reaching, it has accelerated healthcare innovation. Home healthcare can gain from benefits provided by Medicare (and several other payers), comprising a broad range of services that can be delivered in a patient’s home, including post-operative and chronic wound care.', 'Home healthcare has seen a surge in the utilization of the telehealth platform in response to the pandemic. With a rise in the elderly population and increasing costs of in-person health care, the demand for home-based health care will rise. People with chronic illnesses and disabilities also require home-based care.', 'The rising demand for remote patient monitoring (RPM) has considerably driven the demand for wearable technology to monitor patient’s health. Although wearables have been popular for several years, their integration with AI has recently increased their popularity. Wearables have become a powerful home healthcare tool. AI technology-powered RPM enables healthcare firms to provide consistent patient care without occupying space in their hospitals and facilities, thus reducing overcrowding.', 'Staffing Shortages: The U.S. healthcare industry has been experiencing a severe shortage of workers at every level, worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic. Among support personnel, there is a laxity of home health aides. Increasing international migration of health workers may aggravate the health workforce shortfall, especially in low-income and lower-middle-income countries. Another reason for the acute staffing shortage is high burnout due to physical, emotional and mental exhaustion. Overworked employees are leaving the profession at an accelerating rate.', 'Healthcare staffing shortages lead to poor patient outcomes that can include hospital-acquired infections, patient falls and increased probabilities of death. With a lesser number of staff available in hospital settings for patient care, there has been a gradual shift toward home healthcare for non-critical patients who can be monitored remotely.', 'The Zacks Medical - Outpatient and Home Healthcare industry falls within the broader Zacks Medical sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #41, which places it in the top 16% of nearly 250 Zacks industries.', 'The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.', 'Before we present a few outpatient home health stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.', 'The industry has outperformed its sector but underperformed the Zacks S&P 500 composite in the past year.', 'The industry has risen 3.7% over this period compared with the S&P 500’s rise of 13.8%. The broader sector has declined 8.5% in the same time frame.', 'On the basis of the forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), commonly used for valuing medical stocks, the industry is currently trading at 19.8X compared with the S&P 500’s 19.3X and the sector’s 21.9X.', 'Over the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 25.2X and as low as 16.9X, with the median being at 19.8X.', 'DaVita: This renowned global comprehensive kidney care provider reported its third-quarter 2023 results earlier in November. The company registered an uptick in its overall top line and dialysis patient service and Other revenues during the period. A sequential improvement in DaVita’s bottom line was also recorded.

If you want to skip our introduction to the investment bank and the latest saga surrounding its business, then take a look at Goldman Sachs' Top 15 Stock Picks for 2024. "", ""The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is one of the biggest investment banks in the world. It is also one of the oldest banks around since the institution traces its roots back to the 19th century in 1839. While Goldman Sachs' operations have stood the test of time and the bank is still managing money for clients nearly two centuries after its founding, these days, the bank has landed itself into quite a bit of turmoil."", ""This is because the bank's plans to target consumer banking turned out to be rather disastrous, forcing Goldman to take multi-million dollar hits to its income statement. The bank's first quarter of 2023 earnings report revealed that it had taken a massive $470 million loss to its loan portfolio as part of an effort to reorganize the retail banking division. The first quarter was particularly hard for Goldman and the banking industry as a whole as several bank collapsed in the U.S. creating worries about the stability of the entire system."", ""Goldman's second quarter results weren't impressive either as it reported $10.9 billion in revenue and $3.08 in earnings per share, beating and missing analyst estimates for the two segments, respectively. While the first quarter earnings were marred by the consumer banking loan impairments, Q2 was marked by an equally stunning $504 million impairment for the bank's GreenSky buy now, pay later service and $485 million of write downs in real estate. This made it unsurprising that Goldman missed analyst EPS estimates. At the same time, its profit tanked by a painful 60% annually, to touch a three year low. Yet, during the earnings call, Goldman's embattled chief executive officer Mr. David Solomon was in fire control mode as he stressed that momentum in the investment banking business was picking up. During Q2, Goldman's investment banking fees fell to $1.43 billion to miss analyst estimates of $1.49 billion."", ""Unfortunately for Goldman Sachs, the double digit percentage drops during the second quarter wouldn't be its last. The bank's financials for the third quarter saw its profit drop by 33% annually to sit at $2.1 billion for earnings per share of $5.47. This allowed Goldman Sachs to beat analyst EPS estimates during Q3 by a hairline of five cents. The quarterly profit results showed the scale of its troubles since it completed two consecutive years of quarters of annual profit drops. For Goldman, the earnings troubles came at a particularly painful time for the U.S. banking industry which was (and still is) dealing with historically high interest rates and slowing economic output. The bank joined its peers to cut jobs in June 2023, when its chief operating officer shared that a fresh bout of layoffs would cut 250 jobs and build over the thousands more that it had laid off in January."", ""So, what are Goldman Sachs' views about the future? Well, here's what its management had to say during its third quarter of 2023 earnings call:"", 'Most recently, we announced the sale of GreenSky. We also announced the sale of Personal Financial Management this summer. We sold substantially all of our markets loan portfolio. We have reduced our historical principal investments by $9 billion this year. We are confident that the work we’re doing now provides us a stronger platform for 2024 and beyond. As we assess the operating backdrop, the US economy has proven to be more resilient than expected, though there are reasons to remain vigilant. Treasury rates have risen sharply over the past few months with 10-year yields up 75 basis points in the third quarter. On top of that, recent inflation and employment data has come in above estimates, driving market expectations of higher for longer interest rates.', 'And there still are a number of sectors in the economy that have yet to absorb the impact of higher rates, especially in light of the further tightening in financial conditions we’ve seen over the last quarter. At the same time, there has been an escalation of geopolitical stresses around the globe, the [indiscernible] war in Ukraine, tensions with China and now the conflict in the Middle East. Overall levels of risk are more elevated than we’ve seen in quite some time. While we don’t know where this will all lead, it could impact economic growth and stability in the U.S. and around the world, and we remain cautiously positioned.', ""So, with the future still uncertain, what are Goldman Sachs' top stock picks for 2024? We took a look at the bank's latest portfolio and found that its top three picks are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)."", 'Copyright: mikewaters / 123RF Stock Photo', 'Our Methodology ', ""To compile our list of Goldman Sachs' top stock picks for 2024, we scanned through the bank's filings with the SEC and picked out its 15 biggest investment positions."", ""Goldman Sachs' Q3 2023 Investment Value: $2.4 billion "", 'NRG Energy, Inc.

Symptoms include persistent cough, breathlessness and excessive mucus production that may not only impair the ability to perform routine daily activities, but can also lead to anxiety, depression and sleep disturbances. COPD is also associated with a significant health and economic burden due to recurrent acute exacerbations that require systemic corticosteroid treatment and/or lead to hospitalization. Smoking and exposure to noxious particles are key risk factors for COPD, but even individuals who quit smoking can still develop or continue having the disease. In the United States, approximately 300,000 people live with uncontrolled COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation.', 'About the Dupixent COPD Phase 3 Trial Program NOTUS and BOREAS are replicate, randomized, Phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in adults who were current or former smokers with moderate-to-severe COPD aged 40 to 85 years in NOTUS and 40 to 80 years in BOREAS.

Approximately 750,000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.', ""About Regeneron's VelocImmune® TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985, they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse, and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial portion of all original, FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab), Dupixent, Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc), Praluent® (alirocumab), Kevzara® (sarilumab), Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb® (atoltivimab, maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn)."", 'Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement.
