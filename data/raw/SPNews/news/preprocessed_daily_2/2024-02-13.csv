The industry players are well poised for growth owing to a rapid increase in data, the complexity of data formats and the need to scale resources at regular intervals. These companies rely on Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps) and machine learning (ML) to manage and optimize storage solutions. To streamline data storage, companies are relying on virtualization technologies. As more data is added from IoT, companies are turning to edge computing architecture to reduce latency and boost flexibility. Kubernetes storage is becoming increasingly popular as it facilitates greater agility and scalability. This has bolstered the deployment of high-capacity mass storage products, a positive for industry players.', 'Macro Headwinds May Prove a Drag on IT Spending in the Near Term: Weakening IT spending amid global macroeconomic weakness is likely to remain a headwind in the near term. Increased budget scrutiny, especially cloud-cost optimization by clients, and forex volatility are affecting the top-line performance of the industry participants. Consumer spending cuts on purchasing PCs, tablets and printers will likely hinder IT spending growth. In the long run, higher technology spending on transformation projects, including data security, application modernization, analytics and AI by enterprises, augurs well for industry participants. Per a report from Gartner, worldwide IT spending is now projected to reach $5 trillion in 2024, calling for an increase of 6.8% from 2023 levels. This is below the earlier projection of 8% growth by the research firm. The report also highlighted that although generative AI had enough hype, it will not have a material impact on IT spending in the near term.Slowing Momentum in PC Shipments Might Hinder Growth Prospects: Worldwide PC shipments declined 14.8% year over year to 241.8 million units in 2023, according to the data compiled by Gartner. PC shipments increased 0.3% in the fourth quarter.

You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at PVH as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.388. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business."", 'Strength', 'Earnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.', 'Debt is not viewed as a risk.', 'Weakness', 'Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Luxury market.', 'Opportunity', 'Annual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 4 years.', 'Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.', 'Threat', 'Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.', 'Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won\'t be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) has penalized five broker-dealers, seven dually registered broker-dealers and investment advisers, and four affiliated investment advisers for widespread and long-lasting failures to maintain and preserve electronic communications.The firms involved include Northwestern Mutual Investment Services, Guggenheim Securities, Oppenheimer & Co., Key Investment Services, and Cambridge Investment Research, along with units of Lincoln National Corporation LNC, U.S. Bancorp USB and Huntington Bancshares Incorporated HBAN.Per the SEC’s findings, all sixteen firms used unapproved communication methods, known as off-channel communications, for work purposes.The broker-dealer firms admitted that from 2019 or 2020, their employees communicated through personal text messages about the business of their employers. The investment adviser firms admitted that their employees sent and received off-channel communications related to recommendations and advice given or proposed to be given.These firms did not maintain the substantial majority of the off-channel communications, which is a violation of federal securities laws. The failures involved employees at multiple levels of authority, including supervisors and senior managers.Gurbir S.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) has penalized five broker-dealers, seven dually registered broker-dealers and investment advisers, and four affiliated investment advisers for widespread and long-lasting failures to maintain and preserve electronic communications.The firms involved include Northwestern Mutual Investment Services, Guggenheim Securities, Oppenheimer & Co., Key Investment Services, and Cambridge Investment Research, along with units of Lincoln National Corporation LNC, U.S. Bancorp USB and Huntington Bancshares Incorporated HBAN.Per the SEC’s findings, all sixteen firms used unapproved communication methods, known as off-channel communications, for work purposes.The broker-dealer firms admitted that from 2019 or 2020, their employees communicated through personal text messages about the business of their employers. The investment adviser firms admitted that their employees sent and received off-channel communications related to recommendations and advice given or proposed to be given.These firms did not maintain the substantial majority of the off-channel communications, which is a violation of federal securities laws. The failures involved employees at multiple levels of authority, including supervisors and senior managers.Gurbir S. Grewal, the director of the SEC’s division of enforcement, stated, “Today’s actions against these 16 firms result from our continuing efforts to ensure that all regulated entities comply with the recordkeeping requirements, which are essential to our ability to monitor and enforce compliance with the federal securities laws. Once again, one of these orders is not like the others: Huntington’s penalty reflects its voluntary self-report and cooperation.”Northwestern Mutual will pay the highest penalty of $16.5 million, followed by Guggenheim Securities paying $15 million, Oppenheimer paying $12 million and Cambridge Investment paying $10 million.Among others, Key Investment has agreed on a $10-million penalty, whereas LNC, USB and HBAN will pay $8.5 million, $8 million and $1.25 million, respectively.Apart from financial penalties, each firm has been ordered to cease and desist from future violations of the relevant recordkeeping provisions, and has been censured.The firms have agreed to retain independent compliance consultants to conduct comprehensive reviews of their policies and procedures relating to the retention of electronic communications found on personal devices and their respective frameworks for addressing non-compliance by their employees with those policies and procedures.Currently, LNC has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, MetLife's TSR for the last 5 years was 83%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier.

Markedly, more than 90% of quarterly revenues were recurring in nature, which surged 41% year over year to $201.5 million.Annual Recurring Revenues (“ARR”) increased 36% to $774 million. The subscription portion, which accounted for 75% of the total ARR, soared 60% year over year to $582 million. This upside was primarily driven by a record number of software-as-a-service solution bookings and the strong demand for on-premise subscription offerings.In my State of Threat: Cyber Crime 3.0 report, I wrote this...With more big hacks and data breaches in the past few months, including MGM, 23andMe, and Flagstar Bank of Michigan -- their third since 2021 -- it’s becoming clear that a permanent state of ever-sophisticated threats exist for companies of all sizes.We may have naively thought at some point in the past few years that cybersecurity companies, armed with big technology, bigger enterprise customer budgets, and highly-skilled people, would eventually close the gaps in corporate defenses.But that dream has faded into a much more sober realization. Cyber crime is now one of the most advanced organized criminal ventures on the planet.From state-sanctioned hacking, theft, and espionage to the incredible digital reach of skilled, armed bad actors across the globe, the lure of endless power and riches compares to any revolution in human history -- including the great Age of Exploration in the 16th to 18th centuries.Note: I just read SpaceX engineer Andrew Rader’s book Beyond the Known for the second time and he knows his seafaring history as well as anyone. Highly recommend it.But it gets worse. Just as we come to grips with the bad guys always being one step ahead of our latest data defenses, a new weapon has been presented to them that will intensify the war exponentially.That weapon, of course, is Artificial Intelligence (AI). As much as I praise the growth and advancement that AI is bringing to industry, science, and society, we can easily see it is a double-edged sword when hidden forces can manipulate and destroy from a safe distance in their cyber bunkers.(end of my Zacks Confidential special report excerpt from October)To see the full detailed report with expert analysis on cybercrime scope, projections, and costs, just go to State of Threat.If you don't have a subscription to Zacks Confidential -- where one of a dozen analysts writes a unique research report on a particular industry, sector, or economy-wide growth trend every Monday -- it is by far one of the best deals in investment analysis anywhere at under $100 per year.Last time I checked it was still only $59 a year for 52 fresh, proprietary reports.

David, it is great to have out of the show and you are just the man to talk to about this headline David."", ""So listen, first of all, just get your general take David. You've had time to look at this news. Does it make sense to you David financially and strategically. Certainly investors, they like it David. I look at Diamondback energy, it's here about 9% in today's trade."", ""DAVID DECKELBAUM: Yeah, now that's a great point and thanks for having me. Diamondback up 9% today. Obviously, investors like it. But if you were looking for a perfect deal, this is really it. Just at a very high level, you're checking all of the boxes.

I think once the music starts, you start worrying about the music stopping and not having a chair to sit down on. But I think this really gets back to. Beginning in 2018, all of this energy complex was pushed by investors to start returning capital to shareholders, which means no one's growing production anymore."", ""Everyone's just cutting costs, reducing capital spending and then giving that excess free cash back to shareholders. In the first several years, we saw massive out-performance in the energy index.

And the Permian Basin has traditionally been more fragmented."", ""But now, it's becoming this consolidated space as companies are securing sites for the future. They're securing-- they're drilling sites. And it's an area that has had a lot of technological advances. So it's much more efficient drilling, and it's much more cost effective. And these are big players now that are coming to the forefront as we have seen this string of consolidations."", ""- Yeah, Ines, and in all of these consolidations, they're talking about what the synergies are. Is it clear when some of those expectations, when they're talking about capital allocation, and land synergies, and operating cost synergies, when that's expected to come to fruition?"", ""INES FERRE: Yeah, look, I mean, this is going to be closing in the fourth quarter as far as this deal is concerned.

And what is happening is that with the Permian Basin as you drill more, you get into a higher gas to oil ratio. So it starts to become gassier."", ""So what that means is that they're producing a lot more gas than oil after a while.

Now the wealth management giant is betting that a 30-second Super Bowl ad will give it perhaps its best chance ever to pour in some new clients."", ""The contest on Sunday between the Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers is already expected to draw more eyeballs than last year's Super Bowl, which itself set a record with more than 115 million viewers. That makes the championship game a nearly ideal opportunity to pitch the online brokerage E-Trade to perhaps millions of people who aren't making the most of money they have to invest, said Andrea Zaretsky, the chief marketing officer for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management."", 'E-Trade\'s 30-second spot, featuring the brokerage\'s well-known talking babies in a round of pickleball, exhorts the audience to ""get in the game."" Zaretsky said the tagline is an obvious reference to the Super Bowl but is also meant to encourage viewers to think about how they could be doing more with their money.', '""We believe we\'ve never been in a better position to serve clients in every walk of life thanks to Morgan Stanley\'s category one position,"" Zaretsky said. ""And the big game really gives us an incredibly broad and diverse audience to tell that story to."" ', 'Executives at Morgan Stanley have often described their wealth management business as a ""funnel."" At its wide end sits E-Trade, the online brokerage the firm acquired in 2020 for roughly $13 billion.', ""The service's offers of commission-free trading and easy trading in stocks, bonds, mutual funds and other common investing vehicles are meant to appeal to people with moderate amounts of investable money who want to try their hand in the market. As their assets accrue over time, Morgan Stanley's hope is that these customers will move down the funnel into full relationships with advisors. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjLr4bdLPIsREAD MORE: No running!

Now these advisors want their deferred comp"", 'Morgan Stanley has set itself the ambitious goal of eventually having $10 trillion in assets under management, up from $6.6 trillion today. One big part of the plan is to use E-Trade as an entryway to the full scope of advisory services the firm has to offer.', 'At Morgan Stanley and many of its Wall Street rivals, the standard minimum for working with a financial planner is $250,000 in investable assets.', '""Our goal is, of course, to win prospects early so we can grow with them and provide relevant products and services as their needs evolve,"" Zaretksy said.', ""Putting a message before such a large audience of course isn't cheap. For a 30-second spot like Morgan Stanley's, the cost is running to $7 million on average this year."", ""Zaretsky didn't say how much Morgan Stanley paid for its ad. She noted many considerations can influence the price, including how far in advance a firm enters into a deal to run a commercial."", 'Whatever the cost, the expenditures-per-viewer equation is likely to be favorable to advertisers this year. Not only does the Super Bowl feature two popular teams; it\'s also expected to benefit from the so-called ""Taylor Swift effect,"" drawing in viewers primarily interested in the romance between the Grammy-winning singer and Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce.', ""Charles Taylor, a professor of marketing at the Villanova School of Business, has seen data from market research firm YouGov showing a 2% to 3% increase in E-Trade's favorability ratings for a month after it ran previous Super Bowl ads. That's a remarkable boost, he said, at a time when the fracturing of media has made it harder than ever to obtain a mass audience for any single ad."", '""It\'s the only venue left like this,"" Taylor said. ""The Super Bowl is completely a unique property. The Grammys, for instance, might reach 20 million or so viewers. But that is nowhere what the Super Bowl can do with almost everybody watching it all at once.""', 'It does help that E-Trade has found a popular marketing campaign and stuck with it over the years. The online brokerage introduced its talking babies in 2008, well before the acquisition by Morgan Stanley, and ran ads in the previous two Super Bowls.', 'Morgan Stanley\'s E-Trade spot, developed by the ad agency 72andSunny and directed by Randy Krallman of the production company SMUGGLER, eschews the reliance on celebrities whom many firms are turning to this year to garner attention. Instead, it takes a jab at the surging popularity of pickleball with the quip: ""It\'s basically tennis for babies, but for adults""', '""People really do like those talking babies,"" Taylor said. ""They do a good execution of it from year to year, and they are obviously getting good feedback.""', 'Financial service firms have had a somewhat mixed history with sports ads. There were the notorious spots in the 2022 championship game featuring celebrities like Larry David and Matt Damon hawking crypto-related products. But groups like the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, whose professional credentials are considered the gold standard in the industry, have used ads aired during the World Series to proselytize the need for sound financial advice.', ""Morgan Stanley's E-Trade spot is one of about 40 ads to have been released before the Super Bowl this year. Mary Scott, an associate professor of strategic communications at Montclair State University, said firms have found that early airings help to build anticipation for Super Bowl ads in general and can help fix a particular commercial in the public consciousness for longer periods of time."", '""There\'s always a lot of viewers who tune into the Super Bowl just for the ads,"" Scott said. ""So a lot of brands have gotten really smart and said, \'We need to do some smart marketing around our Super Bowl spots,"" because that presents an opportunity to create some early buzz.""', ""Scott said she had her students watch the ads that have been released so far on Thursday and jot down some initial thoughts. Eventually, she'll ask them to rank all the ads and then will submit the results to USA Today for its annual Ad Meter survey of Super Bowl commercials."", ""But the final tallying up can't be done until after the weekend, when all of the ads will have aired. So far, Scott said, the response to E*Trade's commercial has been favorable."", ""Scott noted the students in her class are largely used to being able to skip or fast forward through ads they don't find immediately appealing."", '""So it\'s significant that they were able to interest a group of people who aren\'t predisposed to watching 30- or 60-second ad spots,"" she said. ""Now I\'m curious what will happen next. Because I\'m betting most of my students aren\'t E-Trade customers."" ', 'Zaretsky said Morgan Stanley is hoping to take any heightened attention brought about by the Super Bowl spot and build on it with a special promotional offer for people who open new brokerage accounts. Investors can now receive as much as a $1,000 deposit if they open an E-Trade non-retirement account.', 'To qualify, customers must transfer money in from outside E-Trade and Morgan Stanley. They then must hold it in E-Trade for at least six months or they could have to forfeit the cash rewards.', ""The day following the Super Bowl, Morgan Stanley is also holding a new event it's calling Money Monday. Current and prospective clients can sign up to view a chat between Morgan Stanley Chief Global Economist Seth Carpenter and Nicole Lapin, a financial journalist and author."", 'Zaretsky said Morgan Stanley will be looking at a number of indicators to gauge the success of its Super Bowl ad and related promotions.', '""We\'re going to be looking at everything from new accounts to engagement and traffic to doing some social listening,"" she said. ""All that will help us understand how it\'s being received. And over time, we never wanted to be a one-and-done. We want to have a long-term strategy, which is why we\'re super excited with Money Monday.""']"

Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating.

Along with this multi-year project, Disney will also acquire an equity stake in Epic Games for $1.5 billion. With joined forces, Disney and Epic Games will offer gamers and fans to create their own stories and experiences. Disney CEO Bob Iger promised both Disney and Fortnite communities that they will get to experience the worlds they love in groundbreaking new ways. Earlier in December, Disney’s biggest streaming rival Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX) also exited 2023 by ramping up its video gaming presence. In December, Netflix launched a trilogy of Grand Theft Auto in its gaming library. Considering this is one of the best-selling video game franchises, no wonder Netflix reported its newest gaming offering was in the top of gaming downloads for several weeks.', 'Iger made it more than last week that live sports streaming is a big part of the world’s biggest entertainment company’s future.

It’s not just you.', 'For more than two decades, several revolutions in televised entertainment gave binge watchers yearly increases in the number of scripted TV shows. The saga is well known by now, from HBO’s invention of “prestige TV” in the early 2000s to the “golden age of TV” when prestige moved to other networks such as FX and AMC, to Netflix’s big bang with House of Cards that ushered in the “cord-cutting” era and the ensuing “streaming wars,” which just ended with Netflix standing tall. Along the way, one of the executives who played a key role in this corporate odyssey, FX’s John Landgraf, emerged as something like the mayor of television and famously predicted the industry was at “peak TV” in 2016.', 'It took nearly another decade, but Landgraf is now touting data showing his prediction was spot on. Last year, the number of scripted series fell by 14%. Landgraf, now the chairman of FX Networks, which became a Disney subsidiary at the height of the streaming wars in 2019, revealed the data on Friday during the Television Critics Association press tour.', 'Here’s what the peak of peak TV looked like: The number of adult scripted series fell to 516 in 2023 from an all-time high of 600 the year before. It was only the second time since Landgraf began his count in the early 2000s that the number of shows had declined year over year.', 'Contributing to the drop is Wall Street’s pressure on major studios to rein in their spending and the new realities of a maturing streaming industry. Landgraf told Variety that last year’s strikes by screenwriters and actors played some part in the delayed release of some programming, but he thinks it was already trending in that direction before the Hollywood work stoppage.', '“The drawdown of production was likely underway even before the strike shuttered all production,” Landgraf said. “The realignment of industry priorities from streaming scale at any cost to profitability continued after the strikes, leading to the cancellation of numerous projects.”', 'The Cambrian explosion of TV series began after Netflix fired the House of Cards starting gun and streaming took off in the early 2010s. While in 2009 there were 210 scripted shows, six years later that number had doubled to 422.', 'The era of “peak TV” brought about critically acclaimed shows such as Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, and Mad Men. But despite stellar reviews, Wall Street has now shifted its expectations from growth no matter the cost to profitability as the streaming sector matures.', 'The interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve following the pandemic marked an end to the “easy money” that helped fuel the growth-at-all-costs attitude across industries. Just as rising interest rates have hampered venture capital investments in tech, Wall Street began demanding that streamers tighten their belts, and the changes have been rippling across the sector, as Landgraf said. Other cuts and efforts to turn a profit have left streaming subscribers paying more for less, and slowly, cord-cutting TV fans are seeing streaming morph back into old TV—ads and all.', 'Streaming leader, Netflix, which helped contribute to the increase in scripted shows throughout the 2010s, released 130 fewer original programs in 2023 compared with the year before, a decline of 16%.', 'And last year, in a push to increase subscribers, Netflix also cracked down on password sharing. Although controversial, the effort added nearly 9 million subscribers in the quarter immediately following the change. In its most recent quarter it added another 13 million, and revenue jumped double digits.', 'Already other streamers are following Netflix’s footsteps. Last year, Disney+ hiked the price for its ad-supported tier by $3, and in January Amazon changed the default viewing experience on Prime Video to be ad-supported and began charging customers to opt out of commercials.', 'Although Landgraf has been predicting the end of TV’s glory days ever since he labeled “peak TV” in 2016, he was repeatedly proven wrong as the number of shows exploded and, barring a decline in 2020 owing to the pandemic, then resumed growing. Still, Landgraf revived his prediction, saying that 2022 would be the “high-water mark” of TV show output, marking “the peak of the peak TV era.”', 'This time, it’s looking like he was right.', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"
91,5f4eb3a4-ebaf-3442-abaf-bc2925ef48d2,NFLX,2024-02-13,Exclusive podcasts have lost their allure for Spotify chief Daniel Ek—and Joe Rogan’s new deal is just the latest example,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-podcasts-lost-allure-spotify-184142254.html,1707763302,STORY,"['SPOT', 'NFLX']","['In 2020, Spotify trumpeted its exclusive signing of star podcaster Joe Rogan to a three and half year deal for reportedly over $200 million, calling it a “major addition” to its podcast lineup. Excited by the news, investors sent the streaming company’s shares soaring 19% within just a few days.', 'But last week, when Spotify announced its re-signing of Rogan, the company sang an entirely different tune about exclusivity for what is one of its most listened-to podcasts. Under the new deal, The Joe Rogan Experience will now also appear on rival streaming services. The message from Spotify: Exclusivity is no longer the holy grail it once was.', 'The reason for the reversal? Spotify isn’t Netflix, according to Spotify CEO Daniel Ek.', 'When Spotify debuted its podcasting business in 2019, many people mistakenly thought it would be “an all-out exclusive effort similar to that of Netflix,” he said during the company’s earnings call last week. Netflix, of course, sank billions of dollars into creating exclusive movies and series for its streaming platform in an effort to attract new subscribers.', 'The perception about Spotify following a similar strategy was partly driven by its exclusive deals making the biggest headlines, Ek said. In fact, Spotify didn’t prioritize exclusive deals, he said, and it’s now moving away from them entirely.', 'At the same time it announced sharing Rogan’s podcasts with other services, Spotify said that it would do the same with Alex Cooper’s high-profile comedy and relationships show, Call Her Daddy.', 'Spotify tried various distribution strategies for its podcasts, including exclusives created by independent artists or its in-house studios, and licensed nonexclusive deals. And while exclusives were a “net positive,” according to Ek, they weren’t as big a boon to the business as expected.', 'The problem was limiting these hot commodity podcasts to only Spotify’s audience, according to Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management. In addition to selling subscriptions, Spotify makes money by selling ads during podcasts, with the audience size a factor in determining price. By forcing consumers to use its app to listen to exclusive podcasts, Spotify limited the potential audience, and therefore limited the ad revenue it could collect from the shows. Licensing shows to other services also may attract users to use Spotify’s own app for its bonus offerings, like video extras, polls, and Q&A features, Mulberry told Fortune.', 'The company wants to reduce the upfront minimum guarantees it pays to podcast hosts—often huge, as was the case with Rogan—and emphasize sharing revenue with them from any advertising. Such deals reduce the financial risk for Spotify if the show is a flop.', '“That is the path we see going forward on more and more of our deals,” Ek said. While details of the revenue splits with specific hosts aren’t public, Spotify has previously taken a 50% commission on revenue from ads that podcast hosts read to listeners during their shows.', 'Under a new agreement with Rogan, who airs conversations with friends and celebrities, some of which have gotten him in trouble, Spotify will sell and distribute ads for the podcast, according to the Wall Street Journal. The deal reportedly includes a revenue sharing agreement with Rogan based on ad sales. It’s unclear if Spotify has the same terms for Call Her Daddy, though the company will reportedly retain rights to the podcast’s video version, which is not the case for Rogan’s show.', 'Over the past year, Spotify has loosened its grip on other once exclusive podcasts that were among 2023’s top performing shows. They include comedy and lifestyle show Anything Goes With Emma Chamberlain, an interview podcast featuring celebrities titled Armchair Expert, and research-based myth-busting series Science Vs.', 'At the same time, Netflix is shifting away from its exclusive strategy, too. After a few years during which traditional studios refused to license their content to Netflix in order to build their own streaming properties, they are switching gears following massive losses—which has helped enlarge Netflix’s library.', 'Newcomers to Netflix include hits like Suits, which drove massive engagement for Netflix last year and inspired a spinoff show for NBCUniversal, the rights-holder. “Sometimes, we can uniquely add more value to the studio’s IP than they can,” co-CEO Ted Sarandos said during an earnings call last month. The company has also added a cheaper subscription option with ads as a revenue-driver, which is similar to what Spotify is doing. While Netflix isn’t abandoning its exclusive offerings, the shift signals a wider industry recognition that exclusive isn’t always king.', 'Over the past two years, Spotify has only turned a profit during one quarter, and it is facing pressure from shareholders to cut costs. Last year, ad sales contributed $1.68 billion, or 16% of Spotify’s total revenue, with podcast ad revenue growing “in the healthy double-digit range,” the company said in its earnings release without offering specifics.', 'Last year, Spotify lost $575.7 million overall. But the podcasting business is near break-even, according to Ek, and he expects the segment to earn a profit in 2024.', '“We have doubled down on the deals that worked, and we have gotten out of a lot of the deals that didn’t work,” he said during the call. Those that didn’t work appear to include podcast deals with the Obamas and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, with whom Spotify parted ways in 2022 and 2023, respectively.', 'While ad sales are a key factor in Spotify’s revised strategy, Ek emphasized the company’s relationship with creators as the driving force during the earnings call.', 'Exclusivity wasn’t what the podcast hosts wanted. “The creator obviously wants to be on many different platforms and wants to have as big of an audience as possible,” Ek said, adding that Spotify’s new strategy lets it both grow its ad revenue and keep its talent happy.', '“Spotify is, in many cases, the No. 1 podcasting player already,” he said. “Exclusivity makes sense when you’re the small player trying to scale. When you’re the bigger player, the additional value of exclusivity is far smaller than it is about being aligned” with talent.', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

The stock currently trades 22% below the all-time highs it reached in December."", ""You should consider picking up a few shares of Duolingo at this modest discount, because I'm not sure the stock will ever be this cheap again."", 'First and foremost, I see an unstoppable online education juggernaut going through the toddler stage right now. Everybody knows Duolingo as a pure-play expert in language training, but the grand vision is much larger. The company already offers courses in math and music, built with the same look, feel, and educational approach as the languages. Founder and CEO Luis von Ahn wants to apply the same method to many more subjects over time.', '""By adding new subjects into the main app, we believe we can more rapidly scale these new subjects with our gamification mechanics like streaks, leaderboards, and quests that have been so effective in the language learning app,"" von Ahn said in November\'s third-quarter earnings call. ""Over the long term, the hope is that Duolingo gets known, not just as a language learning app but also as an app where you can learn math and music, so it will start attracting users for that. And a lot of the monetization experiments that we run will apply to math and music.""', ""Furthermore, Duolingo already relies of artificial intelligence (AI) in many ways. The ultra-premium Duolingo Max subscription level provides lesson feedback and casual conversation features based on OpenAI's ChatGPT. It won't surprise me to see more generative AI features rolling out over the next few years, as Duolingo gets a sense of where this technology can boost the platform's educational chops and inspire more premium service subscriptions."", ""The company will continue to focus on language learning for the foreseeable future, treating math and music as add-on experiments and leaving other subjects untouched for a while. The two new courses were launched in the fourth quarter, are only available on Apple iOS systems so far, and won't be meaningful contributors to the top or bottom line in 2024. Adding more subjects before music and math move out of the experimental stage wouldn't make much sense."", ""But in the long haul, you should expect Duolingo to explore a lot of new subjects. This approach is key to the company's game-changing growth prospects."", '""Our belief is that there are things that make a lot of sense to learn with the Duolingo app. They are usually things that you can learn on your own that take a long time to learn where the thing that you\'re learning requires a lot of repetition,"" von Ahn said. ""Things that require a lot of repetition, that take a long time to learn and also that we think will have a very large audience. These are the types of things that we will be adding to the app.""', 'To be clear, languages provide a robust platform for von Ahn\'s larger ambition. Duolingo is an established leader in this category, but is still only ""scratching the surface"" of its target market, according to the CEO.', ""Language learning was a $40 billion market in 2022 with a projected compound average growth rate (CAGR) of 10.6% per year between 2023 and 2028, according to market research firm Reportlinker. Duolingo's annual revenues  stopped at $339 million in 2022 and $484 million today, showcasing how small the company's revenue share is so far -- and how fast it is growing."", ""And you don't have to settle for a traditional growth stock sacrificing short-term profitability to finance their top-line growth. Duolingo generated $106 million of free cash flow over the last four quarters, which works out to a cash-based profit margin of 22%."", ""Yes, Duolingo's stock is a bit pricey at 17 times sales and 71 times free cash flows, but Netflix and Amazon were also often seen as expensive and speculative early on. That didn't stop early investors from pocketing generous returns over the years, as each company's ambitious vision turned into real-world business results."", ""I'm comparing Duolingo to some of the market's biggest long-term winners. Feel free to do your own research before taking action on Duolingo, but don't be surprised to find yourself nodding along to my conclusion.

I like to see the dividend payments flowing into my portfolio. That gives me more cash to buy dividend stocks, which allows more income to flow into my portfolio.', ""However, I don't solely invest in dividend stocks. I also invest in high-quality growth stocks, particularly those I believe can grow their cash flows at above-average rates. That strategy has paid big dividends over the years in the form of strong capital gains. Meanwhile, as some of my growth stocks have matured, they've started paying dividends. Because I got in early and held on, I'm earning some monster yields on my initial investments in Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), American Tower (NYSE: AMT), and Phillips 66 (NYSE: PSX)."", 'I initially bought shares of Meta Platforms, then Facebook, not too long after its IPO in 2012. Shares had cratered nearly 50% from its IPO price to around $20 apiece when I bought them. I saw a lot of parallels between Facebook and Google (now Alphabet) and thought the social media company could cash in on the growing digital advertising market.', 'That investment has paid massive dividends over the years. Meta Platforms has grown into my third largest holding. In addition to the enormous capital gains, I will now start collecting dividends on my Meta stock investment.', ""While Meta's initial dividend is small compared to its current share price (the $0.50 per share quarterly payment puts its dividend yield at around 0.4%), it's much more meaningful for earlier investors. For example, at my initial cost basis of roughly $20 per share, the $2.00 annual payout works out to a massive 10% yield. "", 'I expect Meta to grow its dividend in the future. Given its strong and growing cash flow, low dividend payout ratio, and cash-rich balance sheet, Meta could easily increase its payment at a 10% annual clip. At that rate, Meta would double its dividend every seven years. That would continue pushing my initial yield higher. ', ""I started buying shares of cell tower operator American Tower shortly before it converted to a real estate investment trust (REIT) in 2012. My initial purchase price was a little less than $50 per share. At the time of my initial investment, the company didn't pay dividends. However, it has since initiated one (a requirement of being a REIT)."", ""Like Meta, that initial payment was rather small. The REIT's first quarterly dividend was $0.21 per share. That put its annualized dividend yield on my initial investment at around 1.8%. "", 'However, American Tower has grown its payout tremendously over the years:', 'AMT Dividend data by YCharts', 'Today, the data infrastructure REIT pays investors $1.70 per share each quarter, or $6.80 annually. I now earn more than a 14% dividend yield on my initial investment, compared with its current yield of 3.5%. I expect that yield to continue growing in the future as American Tower expands its global data infrastructure portfolio and cash flow. ', 'I received shares of Phillips 66 as part of a stock spinoff from oil giant ConocoPhillips in 2012. I initially bought shares of ConocoPhillips during the Financial Crisis, which gave me a very low-cost basis for both stocks, with my initial starting point for Phillips 66 at less than $30 per share.', 'The refining company has since initiated a dividend that has grown rapidly. Phillips 66 has increased its dividend a dozen times since its spinoff, growing it at a 17% compound annual rate. ', ""Thanks to my low initial cost basis and the rapid growth, I'm earning a monster yield from Phillips 66 of over 14% at the current payout rate. That's several times higher than its current yield of 2.9%."", 'That yield should also continue rising in the future. Phillips 66 is investing to grow its cash flow so that it can return more money to shareholders. The company has targeted to return $13 billion to $15 billion by the end of this year through dividends and share repurchases (it has distributed $8.3 billion since mid-2022). A falling share count should enable the company to grow its dividend per share faster in the future. ', ""My highest dividend yields aren't coming from the stocks I bought with a high initial payout. Instead, the secret to earning high yields has been to own companies for years. That has allowed me to benefit from their growing earnings, which has enabled them to pay high dividends compared to my cost basis. As these and other stocks grow their earnings and dividends, I'll earn even more income, which should eventually allow me to retire more comfortably."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

(NASDAQ:EXPE), who've watched their investment drop 13% to US$134 in the week since the company reported its annual result. Revenues of US$13b were in line with forecasts, although statutory earnings per share (EPS) came in below expectations at US$5.31, missing estimates by 3.9%. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their earnings models, following these results."", ' View our latest analysis for Expedia Group ', ""Taking into account the latest results, the current consensus from Expedia Group's 33 analysts is for revenues of US$14.0b in 2024. This would reflect a decent 9.2% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to jump 58% to US$9.26. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$14.0b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$9.30 in 2024. The consensus analysts don't seem to have seen anything in these results that would have changed their view on the business, given there's been no major change to their estimates."", ""It will come as no surprise then, to learn that the consensus price target is largely unchanged at US$161. Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though, since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result, some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation. The most optimistic Expedia Group analyst has a price target of US$200 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$129. This shows there is still a bit of diversity in estimates, but analysts don't appear to be totally split on the stock as though it might be a success or failure situation."", ""One way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. It's clear from the latest estimates that Expedia Group's rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully, with the forecast 9.2% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2024 noticeably faster than its historical growth of 2.8% p.a. over the past five years. Other similar companies in the industry (with analyst coverage) are also forecast to grow their revenue at 9.8% per year. Expedia Group is expected to grow at about the same rate as its industry, so it's not clear that we can draw any conclusions from its growth relative to competitors."", ""The most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. They also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, with the company predicted to grow at about the same rate as the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates."", ""Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings.

Companies like Visa that count on domestic and economic growth are perfectly positioned to benefit from this long-term expansion.', ""Another key to Visa's success, which I've touched on previously, is that its management team has avoided getting into the lending arena. Even though some of its competitors double dip and generate revenue from both sides of the transaction aisle (including Dow component American Express), Visa has strictly focused on payment facilitation.

The philosophy underlying this approach is simple: identify assets trading below their intrinsic worth and acquire them at a bargain. This philosophy rests on the belief that market valuations frequently deviate from fundamental realities, presenting opportunities for discerning investors to profit from these dislocations over time.', ""One essential tool in the value investor's toolbox is earnings yield. This metric acts as a compass, helping investors navigate the vast expanse of investment options by providing insights into the profitability of a stock relative to its market price. Earnings yield is calculated by dividing a company's earnings per share (EPS) by its current stock price. The formula can be expressed as Earnings Yield = Earnings Per Share (EPS)/Current Stock Price."", 'This formula illuminates the profitability of an investment, revealing the amount of profit generated per dollar invested in the stock. Essentially, earnings yield serves as the inverse of the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. A high earnings yield suggests that the stock may be undervalued, offering investors an opportunity for potential growth, while a low earnings yield may signal overvaluation, prompting caution among investors.', 'Moreover, earnings yield serves as a versatile tool for comparative analysis, allowing investors to juxtapose market index performance with the 10-year Treasury yield.

However, customer concentration and consolidation in the wireless industry are key concerns for the company. High interest rates add to its woes.', 'The exponential growth in mobile data usage, higher availability of spectrum and deployment of 5G networks at scale are driving significant network investments by carriers who aim to improve and densify their cell sites. With the advent of next-generation technologies, including edge computing functionality, autonomous vehicle networks and the Internet-of-Things and the rampant usage of network-intensive applications for video conferencing and cloud services and hybrid-working scenarios, wireless data consumption is expected to increase considerably over the next several years.', 'As of the fourth quarter of 2023, Crown Castle remains well-positioned to capitalize on its unmatched portfolio of more than 40,000 cell towers and approximately 90,000 route miles of fiber in the top 100 basic trading areas of the United States.', 'The company’s investments in fiber and small cell business on the back of acquisitions, constructions and new deployments complement its tower business and offer meaningful upside potential to its 5G growth strategy. Management is working on increasing the small cell deployments and expects to deliver 16,000 new nodes in 2024.', 'Crown Castle is focused on maintaining a decent balance sheet position with sufficient liquidity. The company exited the fourth quarter of 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $105 million. As of Dec 31, 2023, the net debt to last quarter’s annualized adjusted EBITDA was 5.3X.

Moreover, any pullback or rationalization in network spending by carriers might affect Crown Castle’s performance.', 'CCI has a substantially leveraged balance sheet and a significant amount of debt relative to its cash flows. As of Dec 31, 2023, its debt and other long-term obligations aggregated $22.09 billion. Moreover, in an elevated interest rate environment, additional borrowings to fund near-term capital expenditures will not only inflate the company’s debt but also raise the cost of borrowings.', 'Management expects to incur interest expenses and amortization of deferred financing costs between $933 million and $978 million in 2024.

This is indicative of the steadily growing air passenger traffic across the world, which, in turn, is likely to significantly boost the fourth-quarter results of aerospace and defense stocks, particularly those engaged in commercial aviation.Evidently, Boeing witnessed a solid year-over-year surge of 4.5% and 25% in commercial shipments of its 787 and 767 jets, respectively, during the quarter to be reported. Its 777-delivery figure also reflected a year-over-year improvement of 50%. With BA being the nation’s largest jet maker, we expect the October-December quarter results of the remaining aerospace majors to reflect a similar improvement in delivery trends. Revenues generated from such solid deliveries must have boosted the overall top as well as bottom-line growth of the Aerospace sector, which houses all aerospace and defense stocks.', 'Stocks that are more focused on combat are also expected to have gained as a result of consistent government support. Notably, a steady order flow observed in the past couple of quarters, along with an improving delivery trend in recent times, buoyed by recovering economic trends, is likely to have bolstered the aerospace and defense stocks’ fourth-quarter revenues.', 'However, persistent headwinds like supply-chain disruption, inflationary pressure, rising jet fuel prices, as well as increased interest expenses might have adversely impacted the industry’s bottom-line performance.', 'The Aerospace sector’s earnings are expected to have improved 10.1% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure, on a revenue surge of 7.3%.For more details on quarterly releases, you can go through the latest Earnings Preview.', ""Let's take a look at two defense companies that are scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2023 earnings on Feb 13, and find out how things might have shaped up prior to the announcements.Leidos’ fourth-quarter results are expected to reflect strong revenue performance across most of its business segments. Notably, increased sales volumes for defensive hypersonics and LDOS’ Australian Airborne Solutions business are likely to have bolstered the Defense Solution’s revenue performance. Higher volumes of Social Security Administration’s IT work and increased demand for medical examinations are likely to boost Health unit’s fourth-quarter results.However, an unfavorable business mix and higher interest expense might have negatively impacted LDOS’ overall earnings performance (read more: Will High Interest Expense Hurt Leidos' Q4 Earnings?).According to the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

While most economists are calling for an easing monetary policy environment, the path to lower rates remains uncertain. Accordingly, many investors may be considering a more defensive position, favoring defensive stocks in their portfolios.', 'I have no idea whether a recession will materialize, or if some negative catalysts will prompt interest rate declines. Maybe the so-called soft landing (or no landing) scenario that many are hoping for will play out. It’s possible, and in that case, lower rates would disproportionately benefit growth stocks, justifying the recent rally we’ve seen in the Nasdaq.', 'That said, I’ve chosen to take the more cautious view and point out three companies trading on the NYSE I think could be poised to perform well, regardless of where interest rates are headed. Let’s dive in!', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com', 'Global beverage giant Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) has breezed through challenges like inflation and the pandemic, thanks to its versatility and defensive business model. The company’s CEO, James Quincy, continues to emphasize the dynamic global operating environment, saying as much in the company’s recent Q3 results. The point remains worth considering, that the resilience of Coca-Cola’s robust distribution system in meeting changing global demand isn’t likely to be altered in future crises.', 'Consumers will continue to search for the cost-effective indulgences they have grown accustomed to, and Coca-Cola’s world-class brands will remain a staple in households, restaurants, and nearly every store where consumers find themselves. The company’s brand portfolio is strongly embedded in our society, to a degree many companies clearly envy. Shelf space penetration and brand loyalty are the kind of defensive, intangible assets that prove to be very valuable in times of disarray.', 'Notably, investors buying KO stock at current levels are also rewarded with a dividend that currently yields more than 3%. Notably, this dividend distribution has grown each year for 60 consecutive years, powered by solid cash flow growth. Analysts remain optimistic on the company, with 11% organic revenue growth priced in and stable margins moving forward, as the company continues its effective pricing strategies.', 'For those seeking long-term defensive stocks to buy and hold, KO stock is a no-brainer in my view.', 'Source: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.com', 'Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC), recognized for stealth aircraft and lunar modules, holds an impressive share of roughly 10% of the entire aerospace market.

The company’s recent Q3 results highlighted strong revenue growth, registering a 9% clip year-over-year, allowing the company to raise its full-year outlook. With an impressive backlog of $84 billion in orders and a more optimistic revenue forecast, sustained growth appears likely. Notably, each of the company’s core business segments experience year-over-year growth, with space systems leading at an 11% growth rate.', 'While NOC stock gained 7% last year, this stock is down materially from its peak. Of course, the kinds of catalysts driving this stock higher aren’t the ones everyday investors want to see. However, with global conflicts picking up, this is a company that provides stability across business cycles. Defense spending is unlikely to contract anytime soon, given what’s going on in the macro landscape, making this defensive stock a top pick for those concerned about interest rate volatility this year.', 'Source: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock', 'Cigarette smoking is out, and companies like Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM) have taken note of investors’ view on the subject.

This is about as stable a stock as they come, appealing to investors who likely hold onto this stock for the company’s 5.6% dividend yield. Little capital appreciation may be expected by the market, but for those anticipating declining interest rates, PM stock is an intriguing bond proxy to consider. And with the company still holding growth potential in other smokeless product markets, it’s a bet many long-term investors may still want to hold onto.', 'I’ll be the first to acknowledge my own personal reservations about the company and its core product offering. This stock isn’t for everyone, and investors have the right (and maybe the moral obligation, especially for certain institutional investors) to avoid a company like Philip Morris.

The stock's high in that period was $130 and its lowest point was $89."", ""Bulls believe it won't be long before the footwear giant returns to those highs with help from rebounding consumer spending and a continued shift toward direct-to-consumer sales. But Nike could also struggle to implement its turnaround plan, keeping pressure on the underperforming stock."", ""Let's look at why investors should give a bit more weight to the bearish outlook for Nike stock right now."", ""When it comes to sales trends, Nike didn't give shareholders much to celebrate this past quarter. Revenue fell 1% year over year in fiscal 2024's Q2 (ended Nov. 30, 2023), which captures the start of the all-important holiday shopping season. Most Wall Street pros are expecting sales to rise by just 1% in the full fiscal 2024 year. Compare that result with Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ: LULU) and its 15% projected sales spike through late 2023 and early 2024. It's clear which one of these retailers is the growth stock here."", ""Nike's expansion rate will likely get worse before it gets better. In late December, management warned investors to expect weaker sales over the next six months. That's because retailers are still slashing footwear inventory and cutting prices due to muted customer traffic."", 'Nike has been lowering its production levels for the better part of a year but has had to accelerate this process and shift into a more defensive mode. ""As we look ahead to a softer second-half revenue outlook, we remain focused on gross margin execution and disciplined cost management,"" CFO Matthew Friend said in a press release.', ""Nike doesn't have particularly strong earnings power, either. There are some positive factors that management is stressing on this point, including the cost cuts mentioned above. Nike is tilting more sales toward its direct-to-consumer business as well, and those sales are twice as profitable as the ones the company makes to its retailing partners."", 'Product innovation is another fundamental strength of this business, and new launches in premium brands like Jordan are helping boost average selling prices.', ""Yet investors have mostly seen these efforts negated by retailers' preference to cut inventory in recent quarters. This is reflected in Nike's gross profit trends. Despite several encouraging moves toward achieving a 50% margin on sales in the past several years (compared to Lululemon's 55%-plus rate), Nike's profitability keeps falling back toward a 40% gross margin. It's hard to see a path to market-thumping returns from this stock that doesn't include an end to this discouraging profit margin performance."", ""As you might expect, you'll get a good discount for Nike stock that reflects much of this bad news. Shares are priced at 30 times earnings and 3 times annual sales, or about half of Lululemon's valuation on these metrics."", ""But investors are better off simply watching Nike's stock for now rather than jumping on that discount. There's little reason to expect a meaningful growth rebound in the next few quarters, and the athletic wear specialist hasn't demonstrated that it can boost profit margin when its retailing partners are looking to cut costs. Until there's progress on these core points, Nike likely won't start delivering solid returns for patient shareholders."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nike right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nike, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nike wasn’t one of them.

However, one of his key points -- taking paths that most people don\'t can often be highly rewarding -- certainly applies to investing.', ""Contrarian investing is based on this principle. Buying shares of companies that many others don't view positively can pay off big-time in some cases. I think there are several contrarian plays that especially stand out right now. Here are three stocks going against the grain of conventional wisdom that could deliver huge gains for long-term investors."", ""You've no doubt heard the predictions that fossil fuels are going the way of the dinosaurs. Renewable energy will replace oil and gas over the coming years if this take is correct. That would seem to make stocks like Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) poor choices for long-term investors."", ""So why is Warren Buffett buying shares of Occidental hand over fist? Is he making an uncharacteristic blunder? I don't think so. Instead, I suspect that Buffett recognizes a reality that many investors don't: Global demand for oil and gas is likely to rise rather than decline over the next few decades."", ""Occidental's valuation doesn't reflect much optimism about the future. Its shares trade at under 11.6 times expected earnings. By comparison, the S&P 500's forward earnings multiple is nearly 20.7."", ""Vicki Hollub, Occidental's CEO, predicts that there will be a global shortage of oil by the end of 2025. Hollub is leading her company to invest in increasing its oil and gas production. For example, Occidental announced in December its plan to acquire CrownRock for $12 billion to boost its U.S. onshore portfolio."", 'The company is also making a big bet that just might be a game changer. Occidental continues to lead the charge in developing direct air capture technology that can suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. If this effort proves to be successful, Occidental should be a massive winner for investors over the long term.', ""PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) has been left in the dust in the fintech market, according to one school of thought. The advent of Apple Pay and similar products has largely made PayPal irrelevant based on this view. Proponents of the theory might point to the fact that PayPal's share price has plunged more than 80% from its 2021 peak as evidence that they're right."", ""For a supposed has-been, though, PayPal's business looks surprisingly strong. The company's revenue jumped 9% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2023 to $8 billion. Its adjusted earnings per share soared 19%. PayPal finished 2023 with a cash stockpile of $17.3 billion compared to debt of $11.3 billion."", ""The company is focusing on increasing the use of Venmo debit cards, which generate 6 times more revenue than peer-to-peer Venmo customers. It's promoting PayPal Rewards, a program that incentivizes higher engagement and drives greater average revenue per account. PayPal is also beefing up its products for small and medium-size businesses. These initiatives could pay off nicely over the next few years."", ""In the meantime, PayPal stock is dirt cheap, with shares trading for less than 11.5 times forward earnings. Wall Street projects that the company will be able to increase its earnings by nearly 20% annually on average over the next five years. This level of growth makes PayPal's valuation look even more attractive."", ""There are several seemingly rock-solid reasons for investors to avoid Pfizer (NYSE: PFE). The big drugmaker's revenue and profits are sinking (along with its share price). Fewer people are choosing to use Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine Comirnaty and oral antiviral pill Paxlovid. The company also faces the loss of exclusivity for multiple top-selling products over the next few years."", 'All of those are admittedly serious concerns for Pfizer. However, they should be taken in context with some other, much better news for the big pharma company.', ""For example, Pfizer's pipeline has been exceptionally productive. The company expects around $20 billion in additional annual revenue from new products and new indications for existing products by 2030. That's more than enough to offset the anticipated revenue impact from drugs losing exclusivity."", 'Pfizer projects another $25 billion in additional annual revenue by 2030 from new business development deals. The company has already completed several acquisitions recently, notably including the buyout of Seagen.', ""It's also possible that 2024 could be a trough year for Pfizer's COVID-19 revenue. Management expects a potential sales boost from the combination COVID-flu vaccine that it hopes to bring to market in the not-too-distant future."", ""Pfizer's dividend yield of 6% means that the stock doesn't have to do much to still deliver a decent total return.

This approach involves looking for stocks that seem to be trading below their intrinsic value, based on metrics such as their book-to-market or price-to-earnings ratio, and holding them for a long period until they appreciate to their fair value.', ""Value investing has historically outperformed in most periods, but it has strangely lagged behind growth investing since the global financial crisis in 2008. However, value investing could be ready for a revival in 2024. After all, many large-cap growth stocks are currently priced at exorbitant multiples, and a change in the Fed's stance on interest rates later this year could trigger a broad-based shift in investor sentiment."", ""Which value stocks should you consider buying now? Two dividend stocks that offer appealing yields and extremely low valuations are AT&T (NYSE: T) and Pfizer (NYSE: PFE). Here's why these two high-yield dividend stocks might be solid additions to your portfolio."", 'AT&T is a Tier 1 U.S. telecom company, with a large customer base and an entrenched competitive position. However, the stock has not performed well in the past 10 years, lagging behind the broader market by a wide margin. Even with the dividend reinvested, for instance, AT&T stock has only generated a 45.5% return on capital to investors who bought the stock at the beginning of 2014. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has delivered a total return of 235% in the same period.', 'Why is AT&T struggling? The company faces several challenges, such as its high debt load resulting from its expensive 5G and fiber investments, its potential exposure to legal claims from legacy infrastructure, and intense competition from other major telecom providers and emerging start-ups. Moreover, there is a looming threat of disruption from non-telecom players who may offer low-cost wireless services to their subscribers.', ""Why is AT&T stock attractive? The stock is trading at an exceptionally low valuation, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 7.5, compared to the S&P 500's ratio of nearly 23. The stock also offers a generous dividend yield of 6.6%, which is well above the average 1.47% yield of the benchmark S&P 500. What's more, the company expects free cash flows to jump by another $0.2 billion to $1.2 billion in 2024, thanks to lower capital expenditures and a renewed focus on cost-savings."", 'Based on these factors, AT&T stock may appeal to value-oriented and income-seeking investors who are looking for a bargain in the lucrative telecom sector. That said, this tier 1 U.S. telecom stock is cheap for a reason, implying that investors may want to keep any position on the small side for now.', ""Like AT&T, Pfizer stock is trading at a near-record low valuation and its yield is bumping up against an all-time high. The drugmaker's shares have suffered a 46.2% decline since the start of 2023 due to falling COVID-19 product sales and a lack of confidence in its multi-billion dollar spending spree designed to bring in new products and pipeline candidates. What's more, the market isn't happy about Pfizer's lack of a top-tier obesity candidate, which has been key to biopharma valuations over the past 24 months."", ""However, there are reasons to be optimistic about Pfizer's prospects. The company has been cutting costs and improving margins, and its pipeline has some hidden gems that could surprise the market. Additionally, Pfizer's recent string of acquisitions, such as the deal to acquire oncology specialist Seagen, should provide a nice boost to its earnings in the long run."", 'The one downside is the drugmaker tends to avoid developing landmark medications capable of generating tens of billions of dollars per year. The market, though, has shown a clear preference for biopharma companies that do go down this path.', ""Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, and Merck are some recent examples. This issue isn't exactly the end of the world and Pfizer's strength-by-numbers strategy has historically led to a more balanced approach to growth than many of its peers. But without a shining star, Pfizer stock is also unlikely to deliver excess gains for shareholders."", ""Summing up, Pfizer's top-shelf dividend program screens as a healthy source of passive income, and its stock may be too cheap based on its pipeline prospects and improving growth profile."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in AT&T right now?', 'Before you buy stock in AT&T, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and AT&T wasn’t one of them.

So, it makes you scratch your head to see that shares are down 11% the day following the news (as of Feb. 8).', ""Investors are forward-looking market participants, and they weren't happy with the company's guidance. PayPal's executives expect revenue to rise by just 6.5% to 7% in the current quarter, with adjusted EPS up mid-single digits."", 'This situation makes matters worse for the fintech stock, which is currently 82% below its all-time high. However, I view this as a phenomenal buying opportunity. Here are three reasons why.', 'Despite the pessimism surrounding this business, PayPal continues to grow. The company processed over $1.5 trillion of total payment volume (TPV) in 2023, up 13% year over year. This is a scaled payment platform that handled a whopping 25 billion transactions in the last 12 months.', ""I'd be very worried if PayPal wasn't growing its TPV, because it would be a clear indication that the company's services aren't being used as much. But this just isn't the case. On the contrary, it's encouraging to see TPV rise during an uncertain economic time. Even better, transactions per active account jumped 14%."", ""PayPal's branded checkout solution has broad acceptance in North America and Europe, and it represented about 29% of TPV. But Braintree, PayPal's unbranded payment processing service for merchants, registered much faster TPV growth of 30% in 2023. It now makes up the bulk of TPV, at 35% share."", ""Shareholders are probably also concerned that PayPal's user base isn't growing at all. Active accounts totaled 426 million as of Dec. 31, 2023, down 2% compared to the end of 2022. This flatlining trend has been the case for the past couple of years. And it's a far cry from the depths of the pandemic, when the business added a combined 121 million active accounts in 2020 and 2021."", ""Nonetheless, PayPal is still a platform with huge scale. It has millions of consumer accounts on one side, and millions of merchants on the other. This creates powerful network effects, which make up PayPal's economic moat."", 'The fact that so many people around the globe have PayPal accounts makes it almost a no-brainer for merchants to accept these payments. The opposite is also true. Because so many online retailers are plugged into the PayPal network, customers are incentivized to use it as a checkout solution. This advantage becomes stronger over time.', ""It's certainly true that the payments landscape is extremely competitive these days, with the likes of Block, Apple, Adyen, and Stripe, among many others, all vying for a piece of the growing pie. PayPal's network effects provide a level of protection against these threats."", 'Since the start of 2023, the Nasdaq Composite Index has returned 51% (including dividends), thanks to the resurgence of many growth tech stocks. Unfortunately, PayPal missed the wave.', ""In fact, PayPal's stock is dirt cheap right now. It trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of just 16.8. This looks like an absolute bargain. That depressed valuation might suggest that this is a terrible business, but that's just not true."", 'PayPal not only continues to grow TPV, but it has a clear competitive advantage. Maybe even more importantly, this is a financially sound enterprise. It generated $4.2 billion of free cash flow in 2023, a typical occurrence. PayPal also has a superb balance sheet, with a net cash position of $6 billion.', 'Investors should be taking a closer look at buying this digital payments giant today.', 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

However, one of his key points -- taking paths that most people don\'t can often be highly rewarding -- certainly applies to investing.', ""Contrarian investing is based on this principle. Buying shares of companies that many others don't view positively can pay off big-time in some cases. I think there are several contrarian plays that especially stand out right now. Here are three stocks going against the grain of conventional wisdom that could deliver huge gains for long-term investors."", ""You've no doubt heard the predictions that fossil fuels are going the way of the dinosaurs. Renewable energy will replace oil and gas over the coming years if this take is correct. That would seem to make stocks like Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) poor choices for long-term investors."", ""So why is Warren Buffett buying shares of Occidental hand over fist? Is he making an uncharacteristic blunder? I don't think so. Instead, I suspect that Buffett recognizes a reality that many investors don't: Global demand for oil and gas is likely to rise rather than decline over the next few decades."", ""Occidental's valuation doesn't reflect much optimism about the future. Its shares trade at under 11.6 times expected earnings. By comparison, the S&P 500's forward earnings multiple is nearly 20.7."", ""Vicki Hollub, Occidental's CEO, predicts that there will be a global shortage of oil by the end of 2025. Hollub is leading her company to invest in increasing its oil and gas production. For example, Occidental announced in December its plan to acquire CrownRock for $12 billion to boost its U.S. onshore portfolio."", 'The company is also making a big bet that just might be a game changer. Occidental continues to lead the charge in developing direct air capture technology that can suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. If this effort proves to be successful, Occidental should be a massive winner for investors over the long term.', ""PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) has been left in the dust in the fintech market, according to one school of thought. The advent of Apple Pay and similar products has largely made PayPal irrelevant based on this view. Proponents of the theory might point to the fact that PayPal's share price has plunged more than 80% from its 2021 peak as evidence that they're right."", ""For a supposed has-been, though, PayPal's business looks surprisingly strong. The company's revenue jumped 9% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2023 to $8 billion. Its adjusted earnings per share soared 19%. PayPal finished 2023 with a cash stockpile of $17.3 billion compared to debt of $11.3 billion."", ""The company is focusing on increasing the use of Venmo debit cards, which generate 6 times more revenue than peer-to-peer Venmo customers. It's promoting PayPal Rewards, a program that incentivizes higher engagement and drives greater average revenue per account. PayPal is also beefing up its products for small and medium-size businesses. These initiatives could pay off nicely over the next few years."", ""In the meantime, PayPal stock is dirt cheap, with shares trading for less than 11.5 times forward earnings. Wall Street projects that the company will be able to increase its earnings by nearly 20% annually on average over the next five years. This level of growth makes PayPal's valuation look even more attractive."", ""There are several seemingly rock-solid reasons for investors to avoid Pfizer (NYSE: PFE). The big drugmaker's revenue and profits are sinking (along with its share price). Fewer people are choosing to use Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine Comirnaty and oral antiviral pill Paxlovid. The company also faces the loss of exclusivity for multiple top-selling products over the next few years."", 'All of those are admittedly serious concerns for Pfizer. However, they should be taken in context with some other, much better news for the big pharma company.', ""For example, Pfizer's pipeline has been exceptionally productive. The company expects around $20 billion in additional annual revenue from new products and new indications for existing products by 2030. That's more than enough to offset the anticipated revenue impact from drugs losing exclusivity."", 'Pfizer projects another $25 billion in additional annual revenue by 2030 from new business development deals. The company has already completed several acquisitions recently, notably including the buyout of Seagen.', ""It's also possible that 2024 could be a trough year for Pfizer's COVID-19 revenue. Management expects a potential sales boost from the combination COVID-flu vaccine that it hopes to bring to market in the not-too-distant future."", ""Pfizer's dividend yield of 6% means that the stock doesn't have to do much to still deliver a decent total return. I think, though, that as the company's new products and the results from its acquisitions begin to bear fruit, more investors will recognize that Pfizer's story is better than they thought."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Pfizer right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Pfizer, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Pfizer wasn’t one of them.

Factors supporting this growth include advancements in virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), blockchain, and cloud computing. Additionally, increased user interest in immersive digital experiences, online gaming, social media platforms, enhanced internet connectivity, and a growing desire for personalized experiences contribute to the metaverse’s expansion.

The primary deficiency lies in hardware, as per Chebib, who emphasized the necessity for a streamlined solution that doesn't require users to wear bulky headsets for participation. The gaming sector is expected to be a significant beneficiary of the metaverse's growth, projected to represent around half of the market by 2024, totaling $400 billion. Major players in this domain include Epic Games, Roblox, and Microsoft, which strengthened its position with the acquisition of Activision Blizzard, creators of Call of Duty, for a historic $69 billion.

Despite the boom-and-bust cycle in demand seen for many semiconductors during Covid-19 and post-Covid-19, the Company should be able to post solid double-digit growth next year as inventories and end-market demand across most of its technology nodes get back to normal levels. The Company also maintains dominant market share in leading-edge nodes, which is in short supply, given the difficulties its competitors have had in scaling up EUV-based manufacturing. The Company has been able to secure higher prices because of this and can still generate excellent returns on elevated capital expenditures necessary for this scarce capacity. The Company is arguably one of a handful of the world’s most important and largest companies, but because the Company’s shares trade as an ADR (American Depositary Receipt) the shares are not part of the major stock market indices in the U.S. As a result, the shares are woefully under owned by U.S. investors (institutional and individual), particularly for a company that regularly generates cash flow return on invested capital in excess of +40%.

I believe three underappreciated blue chip stocks fit the bill: IBM (NYSE: IBM), AT&T (NYSE: T), and Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO)."", ""For years, IBM was considered dead money. From the first trading day of 2011 to 2021, the tech giant's stock declined 16% as the S&P 500 rallied 191%. It underperformed the market by such a wide margin because it struggled to grow its revenue and keep pace with the evolving cloud market. It divested some of its lower-margin businesses to generate fresh cash, but it repeatedly plowed most of that cash into wasteful buybacks instead of improving its core businesses."", ""But over the past three years, IBM's stock rallied 56% as its CEO Arvind Krishna -- who took the helm in 2020 -- executed an aggressive turnaround plan. It divested its slow-growth managed infrastructure services unit as Kyndryl, restructured its remaining businesses into three simpler units (software, consulting, and infrastructure), and expanded its higher-growth hybrid cloud and AI businesses with a goal of generating mid-single digit revenue growth again."", 'That strategy required IBM to expand Red Hat, which it acquired in 2019, with more open source software that could process the data between private and public clouds. That niche approach expanded its cloud ecosystem without going head-to-head against public cloud leaders like Amazon and Microsoft.', ""As a result, IBM's revenue grew 6% in 2022 and 2% in 2023, and analysts expect its revenue and adjusted EPS to rise 3% and 5%, respectively, in 2024. Those growth rates indicate that Big Blue's business is finally stabilizing -- but it still looks like a bargain at 18 times forward earnings, and it pays a high forward yield of 3.6%."", 'Like IBM, AT&T was once considered a dismal long-term investment. But in 2021 and 2022, it divested DirecTV and Time Warner and abandoned its ill-fated attempt to become a media superpower. After it streamlined its business, it focused on strengthening its core telecom business by upgrading its 5G and fiber networks.', 'That turnaround effort paid off. Its total number of wireless postpaid subscribers grew by 2.9 million in 2022 and 1.7 million in 2023, while the expansion of its fiber business offset the slower growth of its non-fiber broadband businesses. Its revenue rose 2% in 2022 (excluding the divestment of its U.S. video business) and grew 1% in 2023.', 'Analysts expect its revenue to rise 1% in 2024 and 2025. Those growth rates might seem anemic, but they indicate AT&T is becoming a stable blue chip investment again.', ""Meanwhile, AT&T's free cash flow (FCF) rose from $14.1 billion in 2022 to $16.8 billion in 2023, and it expects that figure to rise to $17-$18 billion in 2024. That healthy FCF growth should easily support its hefty forward dividend yield of 6.6%. Analysts expect its adjusted EPS to dip 8% in 2024 as it upgrades its networks, but they also anticipate 4% growth in 2025 as it laps those higher expenses. At seven times forward earnings, AT&T looks dirt cheap relative to those stable growth rates."", ""Cisco, the world's largest networking company, is often considered a safe blue-chip tech stock to hold through economic downturns. But over the past 12 months, its stock only rose 6% as investors fretted over its near-term slowdown."", ""Cisco's revenue only rose 3% in fiscal 2022 (which ended in July 2022) as its networking hardware business grappled with supply chain constraints. In fiscal 2023, its revenue jumped 11% as it overcame those constraints and finally satisfied the market's pent-up demand for new networking devices."", 'But for fiscal 2024, Cisco expects its revenue to dip 4%-6% with nearly flat EPS growth. That slowdown was caused by declining orders across the enterprise, service provider, and cloud markets. Many of those customers had overcompensated for the aforementioned supply chain constraints by ordering too much hardware in fiscal 2023, and they were now sitting on up to half a year of shipped orders that were still waiting to be deployed.', 'That situation might seem bleak, but Cisco has weathered plenty of cyclical downturns and supply gluts before.

Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?"", ""Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision."", 'Earnings Estimate Revisions', ""Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock."", ""Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements."", 'IBM is expected to post earnings of $1.59 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.9%.

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex."", 'Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model.', ' View our latest analysis for Marathon Petroleum ', ""We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", ""Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:"", '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$6.41b', 'US$6.00b', 'US$4.31b', 'US$4.51b', 'US$4.10b', 'US$3.87b', 'US$3.74b', 'US$3.68b', 'US$3.67b', 'US$3.68b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x3', 'Analyst x4', 'Analyst x1', 'Analyst x1', 'Est @ -9.07%', 'Est @ -5.67%', 'Est @ -3.28%', 'Est @ -1.61%', 'Est @ -0.44%', 'Est @ 0.38%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.6% ', 'US$5.9k', 'US$5.1k', 'US$3.4k', 'US$3.2k', 'US$2.7k', 'US$2.4k', 'US$2.1k', 'US$1.9k', 'US$1.8k', 'US$1.6k', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$30b', ""We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.3%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.6%."", 'Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.7b× (1 + 2.3%) ÷ (8.6%– 2.3%) = US$60b', 'Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$60b÷ ( 1 + 8.6%)10= US$26b', 'The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$57b.

The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.', ""The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Marathon Petroleum as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.362. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business."", 'Strength', 'Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.', 'Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.', 'Weakness', 'Earnings declined over the past year.', 'Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Oil and Gas market.', 'Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.', 'Opportunity', ""MPC's financial characteristics indicate limited near-term opportunities for shareholders."", 'Threat', 'Annual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.', ""Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company.

Contract brewing and wholesale/factored volume is included within financial volume, but is removed from worldwide brand volume, as this is non-owned volume for which we do not directly control performance. Factored volume in our EMEA&APAC segment is the distribution of beer, wine, spirits and other products owned and produced by other companies to the on-premise channel, which is a common arrangement in the U.K. Royalty volume consists of our brands produced and sold by third parties under various license and contract-brewing agreements and because this is owned volume, it is included in worldwide brand volume. Our worldwide brand volume definition also includes an adjustment from Sales-to-Wholesaler (""STW"") volume to Sales-to-Retailer (""STR"") volume.

We have provided reconciliations of all historical non-GAAP measures to their nearest U.S. GAAP measure and have consistently applied the adjustments within our reconciliations in arriving at each non-GAAP measure.', 'Our management uses these metrics to assist in comparing performance from period to period on a consistent basis; as a measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating actual results against such expectations; in communications with the Board of Directors, stockholders, analysts and investors concerning our financial performance; as useful comparisons to the performance of our competitors; and as metrics of certain management incentive compensation calculations.

Non-GAAP adjustment items include the impact of unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses on our commodity derivative instruments, which are economic hedges, and are recorded through COGS within Unallocated. As the exposure we are managing is realized, we reclassify the gain or loss to the segment in which the underlying exposure resides, allowing our segments to realize the economic effects of the derivatives without the resulting unrealized mark-to-market volatility.We also use underlying COGS per hectoliter, as well as the year over year change in such metric, as a key metric for analyzing our results.

Underlying EBITDA is calculated as Net Income (Loss) excluding Interest expense (income), income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, and the impact of non-GAAP adjustment items (as defined above). This measure is not the same as the Company’s maximum leverage ratio as defined under its revolving credit facility, which allows for other adjustments in the calculation of net debt to EBITDA.', 'Constant currency - Constant currency is a non-GAAP measure utilized to measure performance, excluding the impact of translational and certain transactional foreign currency movements, and is intended to be indicative of results in local currency. As we operate in various foreign countries where the local currency may strengthen or weaken significantly versus the U.S. dollar or other currencies used in operations, we utilize a constant currency measure as an additional metric to evaluate the underlying performance of each business without consideration of foreign currency movements. We present all percentage changes for net sales, underlying COGS, underlying MG&A and underlying income (loss) before income taxes in constant currency and calculate the impact of foreign exchange by translating our current period local currency results (that also include the impact of the comparable prior period currency hedging activities) at the average exchange rates during the respective period throughout the year used to translate the financial statements in the comparable prior year period. The result is the current period results in U.S. dollars, as if foreign exchange rates had not changed from the prior year period. Additionally, we exclude any transactional foreign currency impacts, reported within the other non-operating income (expense), net line item, from our current period results.', 'Our guidance for any of the measures noted above are also non-GAAP financial measures that exclude or otherwise have been adjusted for non-GAAP adjustment items from our U.S. GAAP financial statements. When we provide guidance for any of the various non-GAAP metrics described above, we do not provide reconciliations of the U.S. GAAP measures as we are unable to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the actual impact of the non-GAAP adjustment items.

After the sector declined 3% in 2023 is recovery on the horizon. Here to tell us more we've got Brian Spillane who is the Bank of America Managing Director of Equity Research. Great to have you here with us this morning. What is the common denominator that we should be expecting going into these reports and the reality of what you believe these companies might say?"", ""BRYAN SPILLANE: Hey, yeah. Thanks. Good morning? So I think this week, which is closer to the tail end of earnings season for the group, a couple of things we're watching for, one is volume growth, organic sales. It's been a real key theme across the whole space through this earnings season just the revenue deceleration and whether companies can grow volumes off of after several years of raising prices to keep up with inflation? We think that Coke sets up pretty well tomorrow."", ""We do expect to see a decent volume growth as they exit '23 and into '24. Molson Coors also which is reporting earnings tomorrow will also be interesting because they've gained market share. And they've really taken advantage of Bud Light over the last nine months. And we expect to see them have actually a pretty strong revenue print tomorrow as well."", ""- So Brian, of course, Coca-Cola, Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway favorite there, in terms of what you're expecting, especially impact of GLP-1, we know that keeps coming up in conversations. Still waiting to see that though coming up in the bottom lines here. What are your expectations there?"", ""BRYAN SPILLANE: So GLP-1, we look at it as almost like putting climate change in the 10-K. It is a horizon risk. How many people will actually be on these drugs? Will they stay on these drugs? What will their consumption patterns be? A lot of that is still unknown. So there's zero impact on current results. We don't have anything built in our models right now."", ""As we've taken a longer-term view and based on the projections that our healthcare analysts have in terms of potential user base over the next five years, it's like a 2% to 3% impact on calorie consumption. But again, it's a lot of headline, but not a lot of impact at least in terms of the way we see it right now."", ""- What is the read through that we could gather from the consumer from these reports as we're thinking about a consumer that has been more value conscious and as we were discussing earlier is looking for value hacks? What is that consumer resiliency story as it pertains to consumer staples that we hear from this week?"", ""BRYAN SPILLANE: Yeah. It's a great question. So a couple of things that you might want to look for. One is consumer spending more time away from home. Pepsi reported on Friday. And one of the things they talked about was they're seeing an even more normalization of consumer mobility, so people still traveling, eating out more often back to the office. And it's caused a real channel shift which looks more like 2019 in terms of the amount that's consumed away from home versus at home."", ""So especially as we look at Coke and Molson Coors, two companies that have pretty large away from home or on premise businesses to the extent that consumer is out and about, if you will, and spending. That'll be one indicator of health of the consumer. I think the other in terms of consumer health, and I guess choices they're making, a lot of this is acclimating to price points. And what we perceive as a value today versus maybe what we did a few years ago."", 'And for instance with Coke, is it a 12-pack at $7.99 today or maybe $5.99 was the value price point before. So really trying to hear not so much the demand but just our consumers beginning to find value at certain price points when products are promoted.']"

And so we'll be keeping a close eye on that one as well."", ""- What's the outlook for the sector overall, Brooke?"", ""- Yeah, Akiko, well, the sector continues to under perform-- the S&P 500 quite significantly. And there are four things that I'm really watching when it comes to consumer staples sector is volume growth here. Are consumers pulling back on just how much they're buying with those laps of both price hikes taken in 2022 and 2023? Particularly for Kraft Heinz, I'm taking a closer look at promotion levels seen last year and if those worked to get consumers enticed to buy more."", ""Food away from home continues to outpace the price of food at home. Of course, with the CPI out tomorrow, that will be something to watch when it comes to the sector. And also, Akiko, I'm watching the impact of those conflicts that we continue to see in the Middle East, particularly how it's weighing on Coca-Cola. So those are just some of the things that might impact the sector as a whole."", '- A busy week ahead for you, Brooke. Appreciate you breaking that down for us.']"

If you want to skip our discussion about the EV industry, head over to the 7 Best Electric Cars of 2024.', ""The global electric vehicle market is growing at an extraordinary rate. It was valued at $384.56 billion in 2022, but it is expected to reach a whopping $1.57 trillion by 2030. The compounding annual growth rate (CAGR) during this forecast period is estimated to be 22.1%. Consumers' preference for environmentally friendly fuel and rising gas prices are two of the key driving factors for this impressive growth rate. It is also worth noting that Asia Pacific is the highest growth region for electric vehicles, and China has the largest market.\xa0"", ""It is widely believed that EVs are more environmentally friendly compared to regular vehicles. They are more efficient at utilizing energy and have a significantly lesser carbon footprint. So, governments and organizations, around the world, are attempting to promote electric vehicles. For Instance, On April 12, 2023, the Environment Protection Agency announced a new set of federal vehicle emission standards aimed at speeding the sustainable transportation transition, which will reduce carbon dioxide by 10 billion tons. These standards will also enable the United States to eventually achieve independence from oil. However, despite this, exorbitant prices are discouraging customers from buying electric vehicles. It seems that EV companies are still charging customers the research and development costs that went into developing the technology. For perspective, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s Model X Plaid starts at $119,990.\xa0"", 'The good news for consumers is that prices of EVs might drop soon as competition and production process efficiency increase. Interestingly, some technological breakthroughs meant to improve the convenience of electric cars may also help bring the costs down. One such technological advancement is the introduction of solid-state batteries, which may prove to be game changers in the EV industry. These batteries have greater energy storage density, which means that a similar-sized solid-state battery will give more mileage than an ordinary battery. In addition, they also charge much faster, which is a blessing for EV users. Solid-state batteries also have a reduced environmental impact compared to traditional batteries. ', ""Finally, these batteries are also quite cost-effective. A significant portion of the money that users spend on buying an electric vehicle is spent on batteries, so solid-state batteries will help tame the prices in the future.\xa0 Government incentives for purchasing an electric car, such as the federal government's \xa0tax credit of up to $7,500 for new vehicles purchased after 2023, also reduce the cost of owning it. "", 'It is worth noting that solid-state batteries have only recently gone into mass production. Some renowned companies like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) have not yet moved to solid-state technologies. The company has invested heavily in its current battery technology in the form of Gigafactories. These factories are designed to produce lithium-ion batteries at an unprecedented scale. So, shifting to solid-state batteries would require substantial retooling and reengineering of these facilities, which would not only be costly but also time-consuming. ', ""Meanwhile, some companies are focused on producing affordable electric vehicles. One such company is General Motors Company (NYSE:GM). Its Chevrolet Bolt EV is one of the most affordable EVs in the market. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM)'s Chevrolet Bolt is also one of the most popular electric vehicles and has an impressive range considering its price. The retail price of this car starts at around $26,500. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM)'s Chevrolet Bolt has a 200 hp electric motor and a front-wheel drive."", ""One of the questions that people ask before buying electric vehicles is this: what is the charging infrastructure like? The answer to this question is that the United States has one of the most extensive charging infrastructures in the world, and it is improving at an unprecedented rate. According to IEA, the United States installed 6,300 fast chargers in 2022. Two-thirds of these were Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s Superchargers. The total stock of these fast chargers reached 28,000 by the year-end 2022. In addition, the Biden-Harris administration announced a plan last year to build a national network of 500,000 electric vehicle chargers.\xa0"", ""With that backdrop, let's look at some of the best electric cars of 2024.\xa0"", 'Image by Mikes-Photography from Pixabay', 'To curate our list of 20 best electric cars of 2024, we used three (1,2,3) sources. Each time a car appeared on one of these sources, we allotted it a point. Then we summed these points to arrive at the Insider Monkey Score.

Now you have confirmation that dealer ordering is expected soon, now with official pricing."", 'So that entry-level 1LT you mentioned, that will start at $34,995 with availability in the fall, GM targeting 319 miles of range for it, which is pretty impressive.

Or, new financing for an F150 through the end of April. You know, that sort of thing.', ""So right now, what they're saying is through the end of February, you get $1,000 off the Model Y, and then after that, the prices go back up.

Maybe there's some softness that Tesla is seeing in the Model Y sales right now or just sales in general. But at this point, a new Model Y RWD for around $43k before tax credits, which it is it does qualify for, is a pretty good deal for that."", ""We're not talking about the Chevy Equinox.

It is their belief that the market overreacts to good and bad news, which results in stock price movements that do not correspond with a company's long-term fundamentals. This, according to them, creates an opportunity to profit when the price of the stock goes down. Value investors turn to financial ratios to help analyze a company's fundamentals."", 'The price-to-book (P/B) ratio is widely favored by value investors for identifying low-priced stocks with exceptional returns. The ratio is used to compare a stock’s market value/price to its book value.', 'The P/B ratio is calculated as below:', 'P/B ratio = market price per share/book value of equity per share', 'The P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks with high growth prospects. General Motors Company GM, Cemex CX, Centene CNC, Enersys ENS and Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft DB are some such stocks.', 'Now, let us understand the concept of book value.', 'There are several ways by which book value can be defined.\xa0Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.', 'It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.', 'By comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.', 'A P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value or the stock is undervalued and, therefore, a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.', 'For example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.', 'But there is a warning. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.', 'Moreover, the P/B ratio is not without limitations. It is useful for businesses like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.', 'In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.', 'Price to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.', 'Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.', 'Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share — a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.', 'PEG less than 1: PEG links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospects.', 'Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.', 'Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.', 'Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.', 'Value Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.', 'Here are five of the 10 picks that qualified the screening:', 'Headquartered in Detroit,\xa0General Motors is one of the world’s largest automakers.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. Having said that, from a first glance at McCormick (NYSE:MKC) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look."", ""Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on McCormick is:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.11 = US$1.0b ÷ (US$13b - US$3.1b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to November 2023).', ""Thus, McCormick has an ROCE of 11%.  That's a relatively normal return on capital, and it's around the 10% generated by the Food industry."", ' See our latest analysis for McCormick ', ""Above you can see how the current ROCE for McCormick compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering McCormick here  for free."", ""There hasn't been much to report for McCormick's returns and its level of capital employed because both metrics have been steady for the past five years. It's not uncommon to see this when looking at a mature and stable business that isn't re-investing its earnings because it has likely passed that phase of the business cycle. With that in mind, unless investment picks up again in the future, we wouldn't expect McCormick to be a multi-bagger going forward. This probably explains why McCormick is paying out 58% of its income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Given the business isn't reinvesting in itself, it makes sense to distribute a portion of earnings among shareholders."", ""In a nutshell, McCormick has been trudging along with the same returns from the same amount of capital over the last five years. And with the stock having returned a mere 9.4% in the last five years to shareholders, you could argue that they're aware of these lackluster trends. As a result, if you're hunting for a multi-bagger, we think you'd have more luck elsewhere."", ""On a final note, we've found   1 warning sign for McCormick  that we think you should be aware of."", 'If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.', 'Have feedback on this article?

Starbucks has just under 40,000 stores in total, meaning that the majority are located outside the U.S.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'In any case, investors have focused too much on Starbucks’ near-term problems. Sure, it faces competition from the likes of Dutch Bros (NYSE:BROS) in the United States. Inflation has hurt consumer spending. And Starbucks’ China market is currently in the doldrums.', 'But, over the long term, Starbucks is one of the world’s most well-known and liked brands. Plus, it has plenty of room to grow in many countries across Asia, Europe, and Latin America. Among the top retirement stocks, SBUX is an opportunity near its 52-week low.', 'Source: FotograFFF / Shutterstock.com', 'Oil giant BP (NYSE:BP) has long been one of the top retirement stocks to own, especially for its 4.58% yield. Plus, BP has consistently generated truckloads of free cash flow.', 'Unfortunately, the company lost its way over the past 15 years. First, the Deepwater Horizon disaster was a huge reputational blow to the company. Then, the company invested heavily in renewable energy for uneven results. Throw in the late 2010s slump in oil prices, and BP experienced a lost decade.', 'However, BP has turned over a new leaf. It has finally put the Deepwater Horizon behind it. The company slashed its investments in renewable energy in 2023. Instead, BP has spent more of its capital on oil and gas, while rewarding shareholders. The shareholder-friendly approach adds further appeal at a time when BP stock is trading for just 7x forward earnings and offers a 4.58% dividend yield.', 'Source: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com', 'Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) is another one of the top retirement stocks to own today.', 'While its COVID-19 vaccines have largely run their course, revenues have dropped sharply from the 2021 and 2022 peak years. Investors have dumped PFE stock, assuming that the company’s fortunes will surely fade as the vaccine-related prosperity dries up.', 'But that seems like a mistake. Pfizer’s revenues jumped from $41 billion in 2019 to $58 billion in 2023, and analysts see that rising to $60 billion this year and $63 billion in 2025. That is to say that Pfizer was able to use its vaccine windfall to develop other profitable lines of business and the company should be worth more today than it was in 2019.', 'Instead, PFE stock is down from $37 to $27 since January 2020. In addition to the discounted share price, this pharma giant is now offering a greater than 6% dividend yield.', 'Source: viewimage / Shutterstock', 'Hormel Foods (NYSE:HRL) has dramatically overhauled its product portfolio to adapt to the times and preferences of younger consumers. For example, Hormel acquired Jennie-O and has now positioned that brand as a leading purveyor of low-fat turkey meat nationally. It has made numerous other acquisitions in organic and naturally-raised meat products in recent years as well.', 'In addition to that, Hormel is making waves in non-meat-based proteins. It has a line of plant-based protein alternatives. It bought the Planters snack nut business along with Justin’s line of natural nut butter products. As if that weren’t enough, Hormel has a partnership with Mexico’s Herdez to import that firm’s authentic salsas for the burgeoning American market.', 'Hormel shares have declined over the past two years as profit margins slumped. Commodity prices soared, and Hormel has had to pay a lot more for labor at its factories as well. But with inflation starting to moderate, Hormel should enjoy a solid comeback in 2024. The company is a Dividend King with a stunning track record of 57 consecutive annual dividend increases. Shares currently yield 3.7%.', 'Source: Misunseo / Shutterstock.com', 'Franco-Nevada Corp. (NYSE:FNV) is a dominant player within the precious metals royalty streaming space. These firms work, as specialty finance companies that provide capital to emerging gold, silver, and other metals miners.', 'Franco-Nevada has been one of the best performers within the mining space historically. Its stock is up more than 600% since the 2008 financial crisis. And it developed a powerful niche in securing and profiting from royalty streams across the industry. This is particularly valuable now as inflation has emerged as a real threat to investors and people are looking for protection in gold and other metals.', 'Despite the positives, FNV stock is currently near 52-week-lows. All thanks to a dispute over a contract with First Quantum (OTCMKTS:FQVLF), a Canadian company that operates a large copper mine in Panama. Unfortunately, with Panama ruling the mine’s permit is invalid, it’s been closed.', 'Source: Andrii Yalanskyi / Shutterstock', 'Pinnacle West Capital (NYSE:PNW) is a U.S. utility holding company that owns Arizona Public Service and Bright Canyon Energy.', 'While the long-term outlook is bright, PNW stock has entered a short-term slump. Utility stocks, in general, have underperformed due to high-interest rates. Pinnacle West also faces regulatory review from the state’s controversial utility commission. These factors have combined to push PNW stock to near 52-week lows; it yields more than 5% today.', 'Source: Bjoern Wylezich / Shutterstock', 'Another one of the top retirement stocks to consider is Air Products & Chemicals (NYSE:APD), a specialty chemical company that produces oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, helium, and other such gases for a wide variety of commercial and industrial uses.', 'APD stock plunged on Monday following a weaker-than-expected earnings report. However, there was a lot of volatility in those numbers tied to changes in energy and commodity prices. The bigger picture is that the company saw rising volumes of products sold, and it maintained guidance for significant earnings per share growth in 2024.

First, the 10-year Treasury rate is over 4%, which makes it difficult to get excited about a stalwart dividend stock yielding less than that. And second, the market has been going up -- a lot. Those capital gains are going to eclipse the dividend income from many companies. And that leaves high-yield dividend stocks on the sidelines of today's unstoppable market."", ""But long-term investors know that the secret to investing in quality dividend stocks isn't to beat the market in a particular year, but to collect passive income while also participating in the market. At its core, income investing is a hybrid strategy that should appeal to more risk-averse investors or those looking to collect income no matter what the market is doing."", ""Here's why United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS), Target (NYSE: TGT), and American Electric Power (NASDAQ: AEP) are excellent high-yield dividend stocks to consider now."", 'Lee Samaha (UPS): The package delivery giant\'s 2023 was, in the words of CEO Carol Tome on the earnings call, ""a difficult and disappointing year.""', ""The company got hit with a combination of deteriorating end markets due to a weakening economy and the costly impact of protracted labor contract negotiations. The latter had a double impact on the company. First, customers diverted delivery volumes to rival networks, fearing strike action impacting UPS' network. Second, resolving the dispute resulted in higher costs due to the new contract."", ""The result was profit declines across all three segments: U.S. domestic package, international package, and supply chain solutions. On a headline basis, this year doesn't look much better, with management forecasting revenue to grow by just 1% to 3.9% and adjusted operating margin to decline from 10.9% to something in the 10% to 10.6% range."", 'That said, there\'s still a strong case for buying the stock, at least if you take on management\'s guidance for the second half of 2024 to be much better than the first. There are a few reasons, not least lapping the increased costs associated with the new labor contract and UPS gradually winning back lost customers. In addition, management is cutting 12,000 jobs, which should result in $1 billion in cost savings this year with ""more cost-out to come as we have a full year benefit in 2025,"" according to Tome.', 'Meanwhile, UPS continues to gain ground within its targeted end markets, such as small and medium-sized businesses and healthcare. It also has efficiency-enhancing and ongoing investments in smart facilities and automation, which can improve profitability.', ""UPS' 4.4% dividend yield is an excellent reason to buy the stock, but it's not the only reason. If you can tolerate the potential for some near-term bad news in the first half, the company's earnings growth is set to pick up notably in the second half and beyond."", 'Daniel Foelber (Target): The old saying that the stock market is forward-looking is a bit misleading. During a bear market, or when sentiment is negative, investors can get caught up in the present challenges and ignore future growth. Just look at what happened to Meta Platforms, Amazon, Nvidia, and countless other companies that have more than doubled from their 2022 lows.', ""But when sentiment is positive, it's usually because investors are willing to pay a higher price for a company today for what it could do in the future. That's playing out with Target right now, which has quietly surged over 32% in the last three months."", 'The stock posted its largest one-day gain in four years after reporting its Q3 earnings in mid-November. But Target has continued to rally not because it is doing particularly well right now, but because investors believe the worst is over and 2024 will be a period to build upon.', ""Target has done an excellent job reducing its inventory, which has allowed it to limit sales and boost margins. Target is still doing its standard promotions, and we'll hear more about the holiday quarter when the company reports in early March. But there's a big difference between promoting a theme and fire-selling goods because a company over-ordered and over-estimated consumer demand for discretionary goods. That's exactly what Target did after getting head faked by seemingly insatiable demand during the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic."", ""The key for Target isn't what happens now, but how it continues to adapt to changing and shifting consumer preferences. The company has made strides with e-commerce, curbside pickup, and its Target Circle loyalty program. Target will need to continue building out these tools to differentiate itself from other retailers and stand a better chance at protecting its margins during the next economic downturn."", ""Even after the stock's run-up, Target still features a 3.1% dividend yield and a mere 18.7 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. At the worst of the sell-off, the dividend yield was around 4% and the P/E ratio was under 15. Target isn't as much of a no-brainer buy as it was a few months ago. But it's still a good choice for passive income-minded investors looking for a quality brand."", ""Scott Levine (American Electric Power): UPS stock is a great way to grow your passive income, but the company's business could suffer from a downturn in the economy, and that may have conservative investors looking for another option. In this case, American Electric Power is a great alternative. The company lauds itself as the largest electric transmission provider and one of the largest distribution providers in the U.S. With a commitment to rewarding shareholders, American Electric Power and its 4.6% forward-yielding dividend represent a great opportunity for income investors."", ""Because it operates as a regulated utility, American Electric Power is able to charge rates that ensure it generates a profit. And since it's highly unlikely that the company's 5.6 million customers located in 11 states will decide to curb electric use to such an extent that the company's financials suffer, management has good foresight into future cash flows, helping the company allocate dividends in a financially prudent manner. From 2024 through 2028, for example, management forecasts generating $38.3 billion in cash from operations -- a period during which it expects to return $11.1 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends."", ""Naturally, a company's past performance is no guarantee that it will perform similarly in the future. Nonetheless, the company's 113-year history of consecutive quarterly dividend payments is a reassuring sign that rewarding shareholders is deeply woven into the company's culture. Investors can, therefore, be a little more confident of management's dividend target: 6% to 7% annual raises -- in line with the company's earnings -- through 2028."", 'For income investors, American Electric Power is a great choice to supercharge their passive income streams.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in United Parcel Service right now?', 'Before you buy stock in United Parcel Service, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and United Parcel Service wasn’t one of them.

Based on currently approved uses for its systems, management has noted that there are more than 70 clinical uses for its various da Vinci surgical system models."", ""Even as hospital systems and other medical providers are spending more cautiously in the current macroeconomic environment, Intuitive Surgical's installed base of systems has been growing at a steady clip, driving revenue and profits skyward."", ""As of the end of 2023, Intuitive Surgical reported that it had 8,606 da Vinci surgical systems installed globally.

The travel platform continues to rake in revenue, profits, and cash flow at an enviable clip, and at a far higher rate than many other growth-oriented businesses. There are likely multiple reasons behind this overall resilience.', 'Airbnb serves both sides of the travel accommodation dynamic. On the one side, it provides a platform for hosts around the world to list their homes and properties, while on the other side, guests with just about any type of travel requirement can find accommodation to suit their needs. In the third quarter, active listings jumped 19% year over year, while guests booked 113 million nights and experiences, a 14% increase. Meanwhile, Airbnb hosts earned more than $19 billion.', ""Airbnb started releasing biannual platform upgrades two years ago, and has launched hundreds of additional features since that time.

Airbnb is benefiting from a strong recovery in cross-border travel, but it's also witnessing steady gains in markets that were previously underpenetrated by its platform. For example, gross nights booked in Korea in the third quarter were 54% higher than in the same quarter of 2019, before the pandemic."", ""In addition to the flexibility of Airbnb's platform as well as the benefits it offers to both hosts looking to make an income and guests searching for any variety of stays, the company facilitates these bookings at very little overhead cost. Airbnb doesn't own the properties listed on its platform.

The company has reported significant declines in revenue as well as a lack of profitability in recent quarters due to a steep downward trajectory in loan volume.\xa0 Elevated default rates, higher interest rates, and the overall heightened lending risks are making lenders more hesitant to fund loans than they were in the past, and consumers are more hesitant to apply for loans as well.', ""This has created a perfect storm for many companies with broad exposure to the lending space. Upstart is no exception. The company primarily makes money from fees attached to servicing loans, so of course when loan volume and funding are down, this is going to have a deleterious impact on its balance sheet. It's also important to note that the decrease in loan volume on Upstart's platform isn't just a function of the macro environment as a whole, although default trends are undeniably a key factor here."", ""Upstart isn't your average lending platform. It uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to evaluate would-be borrowers based on over 1,500 variables that its model uses to determine their creditworthiness. Because this model considers many factors beyond those that go into the traditional FICO score, Upstart has been able to approve more loans than the average bank at lower annual percentage rates, but without hurting its lenders' risk profiles. In turn, lenders have gained access to previously untapped pools of potential creditworthy borrowers."", ""Given the ongoing risk baked into the macro environment, Upstart's model is approving far fewer borrowers now. These elements will take time to adjust, but given how Upstart's model calibrates to the environment at hand, more favorable lending tailwinds should gradually right the ship. Loan volume was up 5% sequentially in the most recent quarter. Model accuracy is also key to Upstart's growth. Its personal lending platform recently experienced the most significant upgrade in five years, improving model accuracy by around 15%."", ""In the meantime, more lenders are joining Upstart's platform, and it is growing an active presence in various lucrative areas of the multi-trillion dollar addressable lending market, including auto loans, personal loans, and mortgages.

What had been an index of 12 predominantly industrial businesses in the late 1800s has, over more than a century, transformed into a 30-component index that's packed with diverse, industry-leading, multinational companies."", ""Even factoring in the Dow Jones's inherent flaws -- e.g., it's a point-weighted index -- this iconic index can still provide opportunistic long-term investors with a smart place to begin their research and locate amazing deals."", 'What follows are three Dow stocks you can confidently buy right now and hold forever.', 'The first Dow component that stands out as a no-brainer buy that long-term-minded investors can effectively set and forget is payment processor Visa (NYSE: V).', ""If you're looking for a potential concern with Visa, its biggest headwind tends to be the health of the U.S. and global economy. Recessions are a normal and inevitable part of the economic cycle. When they occur, it's not uncommon for consumers and businesses to spend less, which will adversely impact the fees Visa collects from merchants."", 'But just as recessions are inevitable, so are long-tailed periods of growth for the U.S. and global economy. While none of the dozen recessions in the U.S. since the end of World War II has surpassed 18 months, most expansions have lasted multiple years. Companies like Visa that count on domestic and economic growth are perfectly positioned to benefit from this long-term expansion.', ""Another key to Visa's success, which I've touched on previously, is that its management team has avoided getting into the lending arena. Even though some of its competitors double dip and generate revenue from both sides of the transaction aisle (including Dow component American Express), Visa has strictly focused on payment facilitation. Taking this approach ensures it isn't exposed to loan losses during economic downturns. In short, it helps Visa's profit margin stay above 50%."", 'Visa has an expansive growth runway\xa0as well. Whereas the best days are in the rearview mirror for most megacap companies, Visa has a multidecade growth opportunity lying ahead of it in underbanked emerging markets, such as the Middle East, Africa, and Southeastern Asia. It has more than enough capital to organically expand into these markets, or can opt to lean on acquisitions, as it did with Visa Europe in 2016, to reach markets with higher organic growth prospects.', ""There aren't too many companies that offer sustained double-digit earnings growth potential, but payment processor Visa certainly fits the bill."", 'A second Dow Jones Industrial Average stock that can be confidently purchased and held forever is healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), which is better known as J&J.', ""Perhaps the biggest worry for current and prospective J&J shareholders is what's going to happen with the roughly 100,000 outstanding lawsuits that allege the company's now-discontinued talcum-based baby powder causes cancer. Johnson & Johnson has unsuccessfully attempted to settle this litigation in court on two separate occasions. Generally speaking, Wall Street and investors dislike uncertainty."", ""The good news is that Johnson & Johnson has a history of bringing predictability and certainty to the table. For instance, even though J&J's prior two attempts to resolve these talc-based claims proved unsuccessful, it's one of only two publicly traded companies to have been bestowed with the highest possible credit rating (AAA) from ratings agency Standard & Poor's (S&P), which is a subsidiary of S&P Global. J&J's incredible operating cash flow and cash-rich balance sheet ensure that it'll be able to handle any future settlement."", ""This is also a good time to mention that healthcare stocks are highly defensive. Demand for prescription drugs, medical devices, and healthcare services doesn't change just because the U.S. economy or Wall Street hits a rough patch. Since we can't control when we become ill or what ailments we develop, J&J can count on predictable cash flow year in and year out."", ""More specific to Johnson & Johnson, it's benefiting from a continued shift to pharmaceuticals. Novel drugs offer strong pricing power and juicy margins. By aggressively investing in research and collaborations, J&J has helped fuel adjusted operating earnings growth nearly every year over the past four decades."", ""Continuity is key, too. Investors only need two hands to count how many CEOs J&J has had since its founding in 1886. Having essential executives stick around has ensured that Johnson & Johnson's growth initiatives are being properly implemented. Continuity at the top also explains why J&J has been able to raise its base annual dividend payout for 61 consecutive years."", 'The third Dow stock you can confidently buy now and hold forever is none other than media giant Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS).', 'Every publicly traded company contends with challenges, and Walt Disney is no exception. In addition to having most of its operating segments clobbered during the COVID-19 pandemic, Disney has been dealing with sizable losses from its streaming segment as it and other legacy media providers adjust to a cord-cutting environment. However, many of these challenges for the House of Mouse are receding in the rearview mirror.', ""A return to some semblance of normal following the pandemic is allowing Disney's operating segments to thrive once more. Theme parks have reopened worldwide, and movie theater attendance has rebounded well off of its 2020 lows."", 'What Walt Disney has working in its favor more than any other competitive advantage is its irreplaceability as an entertainment entity. There may be other theme parks to visit and movies/shows to watch, but no entertainment company has the depth of characters, storytelling capabilities, or ability to bridge cross-generational gaps quite like Walt Disney.', ""To build on this point, Walt Disney's uniqueness as a business affords it exceptional pricing power. The admission price for a ticket to Disneyland in Southern California has outpaced the prevailing inflation rate by a factor of 10 since the park opened in 1955."", ""Furthermore, it's been able to raise monthly subscription prices for its various streaming tiers without losing too many subscribers. Since people are loyal to the Disney brand, it can use price increases as a means to reach profitability for its streaming segment by the fourth quarter of the current fiscal year."", 'Though Walt Disney is susceptible to short-lived cyclical swoons, its multitude of competitive advantages sets the company up for long-term success.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Visa right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Visa, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Visa wasn’t one of them.

However, these tech titans have historically had very different approaches to rewarding their shareholders. For instance, Nvidia has been paying a quarterly dividend since its fiscal 2012 year, while Meta Platforms will pay its first dividend in March 2024.', ""Which one is the better dividend stock? Let's compare them based on some key metrics to find out."", ""Revenue growth: Both companies have been increasing their revenue at breakneck rates, but Nvidia has been faster in recent history. In the past five years, Nvidia's revenue has skyrocketed 147%, while Meta's revenue has jumped 90.8%. Nvidia's revenue growth has been driven by strong demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) in the gaming, data center, artificial intelligence, and automotive markets. Meta's revenue growth has been fueled by its dominant position in social media, online advertising, and virtual reality."", 'META Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts', ""EPS growth: Nvidia has also been more profitable than Meta over the past five years, as measured by diluted normalized earnings per share (EPS). Over this period, Nvidia's EPS has soared by 473%, while Meta's EPS has risen by 123%. Nvidia's EPS growth has benefited from its high-margin GPU business and efficient capital allocation. Meta's EPS expansion has been hampered by its high operating expenses stemming from its build-out of the metaverse. Still, the social media company's five-year EPS growth is impressive, even though it doesn't compare favorably to Nvidia's scorching bottom-line growth over this time frame."", ""EPS growth outlook: Looking ahead, both companies are expected to increase their EPS at robust rates, but Nvidia is the clear winner on this metric. According to analysts' estimates, Nvidia's EPS ought to rise by a whopping 71.6% in fiscal 2025. Meta, on the other hand, is expected to post EPS growth of 15.1% in calender year 2025. Nvidia's bottom line is booming due to the explosion in demand for chips capable of handling generative artificial intelligence (AI) workloads."", ""Revenue growth outlook: Similarly, both companies are projected to increase their revenue at healthy rates, but Nvidia wins again on this metric as well. Analysts forecast Nvidia's revenue will climb 59.5% in fiscal 2025. That easily trumps Meta's projected revenue boost of 12.4% in calendar year 2025. In absolute terms, though, Meta's double-digit revenue growth forecast is impressive in its own right."", ""Valuation: Thanks to their stellar growth profiles, both companies have earned a premium valuation. Nvidia's stock is presently trading at 35.5 times projected earnings, while while Meta's shares trade for 23.3 times forward earnings. For reference, the S&P 500 index sports a forward-looking price-to-earnings ratio of 22.9 at the time of this writing. As such, Nvidia and Meta are both expensive relative to the broader market, but Meta stock has the more compelling valuation."", ""Dividend yield: One of the main attractions of dividend stocks is their yield, which measures how much income they generate for investors relative to their share price. Currently, Nvidia has a tiny dividend yield of just 0.02%. Meta's annualized yield stands at 0.43%. Meta thus offers the richer dividend of the two."", ""Debt-to-equity ratio: This is a measure of financial leverage that compares how much debt a business uses to finance its assets relative to its equity. This metric is also a proxy for the health of a company's balance sheet. A lower ratio indicates less reliance on debt and more financial stability. Nvidia has a debt-to-equity ratio of 33.1%, indicating a robust balance sheet. Meta, for its part, sports a debt-to-equity ratio of 24.7%. Overall, both companies have strong balance sheets, which is a great sign in terms of the reliability of their cash distributions to shareholders."", ""Based on these metrics, Nvidia is a better dividend stock than Meta Platforms. While Meta has a higher dividend yield, Nvidia has a much faster EPS growth rate and it is a critical player in AI architecture. Nvidia's dividend may be small, but it is likely to rise steadily over time, along with its earnings. Meta's dividend may be larger, but the company is more vulnerable to regulatory and competitive headwinds. Hence, dividend investors may want to opt for Nvidia over Meta Platforms."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Known as Supermicro, this maker of high-performance computer servers has seen its shares rise 160% in just the opening weeks of 2024. While Nvidia has been heralded as one of the top artificial-intelligence stocks, Supermicro is outperforming it -- a fact that has caused many investors to take notice.', ""But with Supermicro already up so much in 2024, is it still worth considering? Or has the computer wunderkind simply run up too far, too fast? Let's find out."", 'Supermicro benefits from the trend that pushed Nvidia higher: artificial intelligence (AI). Super Micro Computer makes highly customizable servers tailored for engineering simulations, drug discovery, or AI model training.', ""These servers are filled with hundreds or thousands of GPUs (graphic processing units), often made by Nvidia. Supermicro works closely with Nvidia to ensure they're squeezing as much performance out of them as possible. GPUs are critical in this application, as they are well-suited to handle arduous computing tasks."", ""With many management teams across the globe asking their employees how their business will harness the power of AI, it all starts with getting enough computing power to make these models. Two ways to achieve this are buying an on-site server or renting cloud computing space. Supermicro benefits when companies buy their servers, and with its latest earnings, it's evident this has been a popular pick."", ""For its fiscal 2024's second quarter (ended Dec. 31), management guided for about $2.8 billion in revenue. However, they far exceeded that and delivered $3.67 billion. This growth did come at a price, as Supermicro's gross margin tumbled in the quarter."", 'This occurred because management is focusing on capturing a massive and expanding market. But because its revenue growth was so large (up 103% year over year), its profit growth was also impressive, with earnings per share (EPS) increasing from $2.33 to $5.59. The good times are expected to continue as management gave a third-quarter outlook of $3.9 billion, indicating 205% growth.', ""No one denies that Supermicro is having its moment in the spotlight with its strong Q2 and impressive full-year guidance, but many might wonder if it's time to take gains or at least reduce exposure.\xa0With its latest run-up, Supermicro's stock has gotten quite expensive."", ""At these levels, many may worry that Supermicro is becoming too expensive. However, it's all relative. If this strong demand persists for only a year and falls off a cliff, it's too expensive. But if this trend lasts for three years, the stock still has a lot of upside ahead."", ""For fiscal 2024 (ending June 30), management expects about $14.5 billion in revenue. However, the company's goal is to reach $25 billion in annual sales. In the first quarter of fiscal 2024, this goal was $20 billion in sales per year, so it's clear that Supermicro's management sees this demand increasing and sticking around."", ""Even though the stock may seem expensive now, it's probably worth holding on to right now. But if this impressive run-up now means that the stock comprises a significant amount of your portfolio, then there's no shame in selling a portion to redeploy elsewhere."", ""The AI arms race is starting to benefit more companies than just Nvidia, and anyone who's in on the trend will be able to profit from this rise."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with CMI.', ""On February 12, 2024, Cummins Inc (NYSE:CMI) filed its annual 10-K report, offering a comprehensive view of its financial health and strategic positioning. As a global power leader, Cummins Inc designs, manufactures, and services a broad portfolio of power solutions. The company's financial performance reflects its strong market presence, with a notable aggregate market value of approximately $34.7 billion as of June 30, 2023. The acquisition of Meritor and the realignment of business segments underscore Cummins Inc's strategic initiatives to bolster its market position and expand its product offerings. With a focus on innovation and sustainability, Cummins Inc is poised to navigate the dynamic industry landscape."", 'The main body of the article starts here...', ""Market Leadership and Diversified Portfolio: Cummins Inc's leadership in the diesel engine market is a testament to its strong brand and diversified product portfolio. The company's extensive range of power solutions, including diesel, natural gas, electric, and hybrid powertrains, positions it well to cater to various customer needs across multiple sectors. Cummins Inc's strategic acquisition of Meritor further enhances its capabilities in axles, brakes, and electric powertrain technologies, which are crucial for future growth. The integration of Meritor's offerings into Cummins' Components and Accelera segments has expanded the company's market reach and fortified its competitive edge."", ""Innovative Research and Development: Cummins Inc's commitment to innovation is evident in its investment in new technologies, such as hydrogen production and fuel cell products. The company's research and development efforts are geared towards meeting the evolving demands of the industry, particularly in the areas of emissions reduction and alternative energy. This focus on innovation not only strengthens Cummins Inc's product lineup but also aligns with global trends towards sustainability and cleaner energy solutions, positioning the company as a forward-thinking leader in the power solutions market."", ""Supply Chain Vulnerabilities: Despite its strong market position, Cummins Inc faces challenges related to supply chain disruptions, as highlighted in the 10-K filing. The company's reliance on single-sourced parts and raw materials exposes it to risks of supplier delays, which can affect manufacturing operations and product delivery. The current economic environment, characterized by price volatility and inflation, further exacerbates these vulnerabilities, potentially impacting Cummins Inc's profitability and operational efficiency."", ""Dependence on Joint Ventures: A significant portion of Cummins Inc's net income is derived from joint ventures, particularly in China. While these partnerships contribute to the company's global presence and earnings, they also pose risks due to the lack of unilateral control over management and operations. Any adverse changes in these joint ventures could materially affect Cummins Inc's financial performance, underscoring the need for strategic management of these alliances."", ""Electrification and Alternative Power Technologies: The global shift towards electrification and sustainable energy presents significant opportunities for Cummins Inc. The company's Accelera segment focuses on developing electrolyzers for hydrogen production and electrified power systems, positioning Cummins Inc to capitalize on the growing demand for clean energy solutions. By continuing to innovate and commercialize these technologies, Cummins Inc can expand its customer base and tap into new markets, driving long-term growth."", ""Strategic Acquisitions and Divestitures: Cummins Inc's strategic approach to acquisitions, such as the recent purchase of Jacobs Vehicle Systems, demonstrates its commitment to enhancing its product offerings and securing its supply base. These strategic moves not only provide access to new technologies and markets but also offer potential operational synergies that can improve the company's overall performance. Cummins Inc's willingness to explore divestitures further indicates its agility in optimizing its portfolio in response to market dynamics."", ""Regulatory Pressures and Environmental Concerns: Cummins Inc operates in an industry subject to stringent environmental regulations and evolving legislation. The company's 10-K filing acknowledges the challenges posed by emission standards and climate change initiatives. Compliance with these regulations requires significant investment and can impact product design and manufacturing processes. Additionally, the potential for future bans or limitations on diesel-powered products could necessitate a strategic pivot for Cummins Inc, emphasizing the importance of its investment in alternative power technologies."", ""Intense Competition and OEM Dynamics: The competitive landscape for Cummins Inc is intense, with the company facing robust competition from both independent engine manufacturers and OEMs that produce their own engines. The possibility of OEM customers discontinuing outsourcing their engine supply needs or experiencing financial distress poses a threat to Cummins Inc's sales and market share. Maintaining a competitive edge through product quality, innovation, and customer relationships is crucial for Cummins Inc to navigate these competitive pressures."", ""In conclusion, Cummins Inc (NYSE:CMI) exhibits a strong market presence and a commitment to innovation, which are key strengths in the power solutions industry. However, vulnerabilities in the supply chain and reliance on joint ventures present challenges that require strategic management. Opportunities in electrification and alternative power technologies align with global sustainability trends, offering avenues for growth. Nevertheless, regulatory pressures and intense competition pose threats that Cummins Inc must address to maintain its leadership position. The company's strategic initiatives and forward-looking approach position it well to leverage its strengths and capitalize on emerging opportunities while mitigating weaknesses and threats."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.', ' Check out our latest analysis for Walt Disney ', ""We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", ""Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:"", '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$8.42b', 'US$8.62b', 'US$9.83b', 'US$9.23b', 'US$10.3b', 'US$10.7b', 'US$11.1b', 'US$11.5b', 'US$11.8b', 'US$12.1b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x12', 'Analyst x15', 'Analyst x6', 'Analyst x2', 'Analyst x2', 'Est @ 4.02%', 'Est @ 3.50%', 'Est @ 3.14%', 'Est @ 2.88%', 'Est @ 2.71%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.7% ', 'US$7.8k', 'US$7.4k', 'US$7.9k', 'US$6.9k', 'US$7.1k', 'US$6.9k', 'US$6.6k', 'US$6.3k', 'US$6.0k', 'US$5.8k', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$69b', ""We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.3%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.7%."", 'Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$12b× (1 + 2.3%) ÷ (7.7%– 2.3%) = US$229b', 'Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$229b÷ ( 1 + 7.7%)10= US$109b', 'The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$178b.

Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.', ""The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Walt Disney as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.178. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business."", 'Strength', 'Debt is not viewed as a risk.', 'Weakness', 'Earnings declined over the past year.', 'Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Entertainment market.', 'Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.', 'Opportunity', 'Annual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.', 'Threat', 'Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.', ""Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company.

What had been an index of 12 predominantly industrial businesses in the late 1800s has, over more than a century, transformed into a 30-component index that's packed with diverse, industry-leading, multinational companies."", ""Even factoring in the Dow Jones's inherent flaws -- e.g., it's a point-weighted index -- this iconic index can still provide opportunistic long-term investors with a smart place to begin their research and locate amazing deals."", 'What follows are three Dow stocks you can confidently buy right now and hold forever.', 'The first Dow component that stands out as a no-brainer buy that long-term-minded investors can effectively set and forget is payment processor Visa (NYSE: V).', ""If you're looking for a potential concern with Visa, its biggest headwind tends to be the health of the U.S. and global economy. Recessions are a normal and inevitable part of the economic cycle. When they occur, it's not uncommon for consumers and businesses to spend less, which will adversely impact the fees Visa collects from merchants."", 'But just as recessions are inevitable, so are long-tailed periods of growth for the U.S. and global economy. While none of the dozen recessions in the U.S. since the end of World War II has surpassed 18 months, most expansions have lasted multiple years. Companies like Visa that count on domestic and economic growth are perfectly positioned to benefit from this long-term expansion.', ""Another key to Visa's success, which I've touched on previously, is that its management team has avoided getting into the lending arena. Even though some of its competitors double dip and generate revenue from both sides of the transaction aisle (including Dow component American Express), Visa has strictly focused on payment facilitation. Taking this approach ensures it isn't exposed to loan losses during economic downturns. In short, it helps Visa's profit margin stay above 50%."", 'Visa has an expansive growth runway\xa0as well. Whereas the best days are in the rearview mirror for most megacap companies, Visa has a multidecade growth opportunity lying ahead of it in underbanked emerging markets, such as the Middle East, Africa, and Southeastern Asia. It has more than enough capital to organically expand into these markets, or can opt to lean on acquisitions, as it did with Visa Europe in 2016, to reach markets with higher organic growth prospects.', ""There aren't too many companies that offer sustained double-digit earnings growth potential, but payment processor Visa certainly fits the bill."", 'A second Dow Jones Industrial Average stock that can be confidently purchased and held forever is healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), which is better known as J&J.', ""Perhaps the biggest worry for current and prospective J&J shareholders is what's going to happen with the roughly 100,000 outstanding lawsuits that allege the company's now-discontinued talcum-based baby powder causes cancer. Johnson & Johnson has unsuccessfully attempted to settle this litigation in court on two separate occasions. Generally speaking, Wall Street and investors dislike uncertainty."", ""The good news is that Johnson & Johnson has a history of bringing predictability and certainty to the table. For instance, even though J&J's prior two attempts to resolve these talc-based claims proved unsuccessful, it's one of only two publicly traded companies to have been bestowed with the highest possible credit rating (AAA) from ratings agency Standard & Poor's (S&P), which is a subsidiary of S&P Global. J&J's incredible operating cash flow and cash-rich balance sheet ensure that it'll be able to handle any future settlement."", ""This is also a good time to mention that healthcare stocks are highly defensive. Demand for prescription drugs, medical devices, and healthcare services doesn't change just because the U.S. economy or Wall Street hits a rough patch. Since we can't control when we become ill or what ailments we develop, J&J can count on predictable cash flow year in and year out."", ""More specific to Johnson & Johnson, it's benefiting from a continued shift to pharmaceuticals. Novel drugs offer strong pricing power and juicy margins. By aggressively investing in research and collaborations, J&J has helped fuel adjusted operating earnings growth nearly every year over the past four decades."", ""Continuity is key, too. Investors only need two hands to count how many CEOs J&J has had since its founding in 1886. Having essential executives stick around has ensured that Johnson & Johnson's growth initiatives are being properly implemented.

IMARC Group predicts a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 34.29% during the forecast period of 2024-2032. Factors supporting this growth include advancements in virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), blockchain, and cloud computing. Additionally, increased user interest in immersive digital experiences, online gaming, social media platforms, enhanced internet connectivity, and a growing desire for personalized experiences contribute to the metaverse’s expansion. Tarik Chebib, Capital.com’s chief revenue officer, told Reuters:\xa0', '“The internet will end as we know it and the metaverse will totally reshape the global economy.”', ""The gaming industry, with its widespread use of alternative realities in games like Fortnite and Roblox, is poised to play a pivotal role in the metaverse, according to Tarik Chebib. Given the global user base of 3.2 billion gamers, there is substantial potential demand for the metaverse revolution. Furthermore, the gaming sector contributes valuable software expertise to serve as the foundation for metaverse development. The primary deficiency lies in hardware, as per Chebib, who emphasized the necessity for a streamlined solution that doesn't require users to wear bulky headsets for participation. The gaming sector is expected to be a significant beneficiary of the metaverse's growth, projected to represent around half of the market by 2024, totaling $400 billion. Major players in this domain include Epic Games, Roblox, and Microsoft, which strengthened its position with the acquisition of Activision Blizzard, creators of Call of Duty, for a historic $69 billion. Microsoft's leadership in the industry, particularly with titles like Minecraft, suggests a trend where other companies may follow suit. Chebib further commented:\xa0"", '“Video games help us visualize what the metaverse could look like. Gaming companies are really interesting cases as they have already created worlds where people buy skins, avatars and collect different things.”', ""2022 was expected to be the year of the metaverse, marked by Facebook's transformation to Meta in October 2021, reflecting Mark Zuckerberg’s enthusiasm for the potential of virtual and augmented reality. However, this did not materialize, and in 2023, the metaverse took a backseat to artificial intelligence. However, in 2024, there is potential for a metaverse resurgence in public attention as Apple launched its $3,500 Vision Pro headset, announced midway through 2023.

Critically, the Company’s new management team has significant opportunity to drive more revenue and earnings growth across the massive, multi-trillion-dollar payments addressable market. PayPal’s rapidly growing payment processing brand, Braintree, represents one of those revenue growth opportunities, either by raising prices, as the Company had previously used a low-price strategy to establish a beachhead in this market, or by adding value-added services. PayPal’s branded checkout remains the largest volume and profit driver for the business, and we expect this to continue to track in-line with e-commerce growth in the near term, and eventually take share as the Company rolls out new features to its over +400 million users and +30 million merchants.

The Company also maintains dominant market share in leading-edge nodes, which is in short supply, given the difficulties its competitors have had in scaling up EUV-based manufacturing. The Company has been able to secure higher prices because of this and can still generate excellent returns on elevated capital expenditures necessary for this scarce capacity. The Company is arguably one of a handful of the world’s most important and largest companies, but because the Company’s shares trade as an ADR (American Depositary Receipt) the shares are not part of the major stock market indices in the U.S. As a result, the shares are woefully under owned by U.S. investors (institutional and individual), particularly for a company that regularly generates cash flow return on invested capital in excess of +40%.

The entertainment giant gave investors a positive earnings report last week, with a huge earnings beat, and Disney stock surged roughly 10% in two days.', ""But don't buy Disney stock because of one earnings report. There's a much better reason to buy it right now -- and that's CEO Bob Iger."", ""Disney isn't just a large company, with $89 billion in trailing 12-month revenue. It's a large company made up of various intersecting units, which can be complicated to manage. When done correctly, these parts work together to create a magnificent entertainment machine, and they work to hedge the entire business when some elements come under pressure. This was well illustrated when streaming took off as parks closed early in the pandemic, and more recently when parks rebounded as streaming started to stall. Disney is now trying to get itself to a point where all of its segments are growing profitably."", ""Its biggest pain point over the past few quarters has been a heavy streaming loss. Disney has maintained that the premium streaming network Disney+ would become profitable by the end of fiscal 2024, and that point is getting closer. There was a management shakeup last year when Bob Iger returned to straighten things out and longtime CFO Christine McCarthy left. Since then, streaming losses have been improving. In the 2024 fiscal first quarter (ended Dec. 31), revenue was flat year over year, but earnings per share (EPS) excluding certain items was $1.22, up from $0.99 last year and ahead of Wall Street's expected $0.99."", 'Streaming revenue increased 15% over last year, and operating loss contracted from $984 million to $138 million, an 86% improvement. Disney+ subscribers dropped 1% from last quarter, but revenue increased due to price hikes.', 'When Iger came on board, he made several commitments. One was to reorganize the company and give creatives more control of content decisions. Disney reported under the new structure last week, with three reporting segments: entertainment, sports, and experiences. Iger said the reorganization will lead to a ""more cost-effective, coordinated, and streamlined approach,"" and it seems to be bearing fruit. Iger originally targeted $5.5 billion in cost savings, and he said Disney is on track to reach or exceed $7.5 billion in cost savings by the end of the fiscal year. He reiterated that Disney+ should become profitable by the end of the fiscal year.', ""Iger was CEO of Disney from 2005 through 2020. During that time, he demonstrated a keen understanding of the company and the moves that would be necessary to succeed. He presided over Disney when it acquired Lucasfilm, maker of the Star Wars franchise; Marvel Studios, which has created the most successful film franchise in the past 100 years; 20th Century Fox; and animation studio Pixar. He expanded Disney's parks internationally and set the company up for the rise of streaming."", ""One of Disney's big announcements this year was a $60 billion park investment. The parks segment was Disney's largest segment for many years, and it's a major part of the Disney entertainment cycle, offering an unparalleled entertainment experience for fans. It typically generates high and growing revenue, and it's a crucial piece of how Disney monetizes its content and franchises."", ""Signaling his desire to placate shareholders, he reinstated the company's dividend, which was suspended at the beginning of the pandemic, as soon as he returned to the CEO role. Management just announced a 50% dividend raise."", ""Iger's contract has been renewed through 2026, which gives investors some breathing room. But he is going to leave again at some point, which could put Disney back in flux. Perhaps he will set things up differently this time to position whoever follows him for better success, and perhaps the market will look different. Previous CEO Bob Chapek came onto the scene with plenty of volatility. If the economy is stronger, Disney+ is sailing, and parks are growing, any CEO will have an easier time steering the Disney ship."", ""For the time being, investors can continue to feel confident in Iger's leadership and Disney's expanding opportunities. Management is targeting a 20% increase in EPS in 2024, higher than Wall Steet's consensus of $4.28, and if Disney+ turns to profitability, Disney stock should soar this year."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Walt Disney right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Walt Disney, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Walt Disney wasn’t one of them.

A blowout fiscal first quarter on Wednesday afternoon got the stock moving, but as with any entertainment production, there were a lot of helping hands to put on a great show.', ""Disney has been a tough stock to defend in recent years. The shares have lost to the market for three consecutive years. It would have to nearly double from here to take out its all-time high set in early 2021. Hitting a fresh 52-week high on Thursday is still important. Let's go over many of the reasons for its overdue breakout."", ""Let's start with the rearview mirror. It wasn't a perfect quarter for Disney, but a few things did go well for the media giant during the critical holiday quarter."", 'Revenue growth was flat from the prior-year quarter, and in line with expectations. The news was better on the other end of the include statement, as adjusted earnings per share rose 23% to $1.22. Analysts were holding out for flat results on both ends.', 'A big reason for the bottom-line beat was that the operating loss for its direct-to-consumer segment, helmed by Disney+, contracted from $984 million to $138 million. Disney is well on its way to seeing its streaming business turn profitable by the end of this fiscal year.', 'Price increases for the streaming services are working. Domestic Disney+ subscribers dipped 1% sequentially, but that was more than offset by a 9% increase in average monthly revenue per paid account.', 'Streaming bundles are also helping. Streaming revenue has risen 15% over the past year.', 'ESPN posted an operating profit, reversing a year-ago loss.', ""Disney's theme parks, experiences, and consumer products segment came through with a 7% increase in revenue despite another year-over-year decline at Disney World, given the rough comparisons with the resort's 50th-anniversary celebration last year. The segment's operating income rose even faster. Cruise ships and international theme parks saved the day."", 'The fiscal fourth quarter was decent. The real catalysts pushing the stock higher came largely from many of the announcements that Disney made during its earnings release and subsequent earnings call.', 'Disney announced 11 months ago that it was looking to realize $5.5 billion in annualized cost savings by the end of fiscal 2024. The goal was bumped to $7.5 billion in November. It\'s now on track to ""meet or exceed"" that $7.5 billion target.', ""A $1.5 billion investment in Fortnite developer Epic Games is promising. Fortnite is experiencing a resurgence in popularity, and Disney plans to build out a games and entertainment universe within the online video game. With an estimated 85% of its players younger than 35, this is a great way for Disney to reach young audiences who don't consume traditional marketing missives."", ""Disney's board hasn't authorized a buyback since 2018, even with the shares being cut nearly in half since its early 2021 peak. It finally announced plans for up to $3 billion in share repurchases."", ""Disney just resumed paying its semiannual dividend, and last week it boosted its next payment by 50%. The stock's still yielding less than 1%, but along with the buyback it's a way to return more money to its shareholdders."", ""After a rough year at the multiplex, Disney is tapping iconic franchises for better chances at box-office success. Fresh films for the Deadpool, Inside Out, Planet of the Apes, and Alien franchises have been slated by the end of fiscal 2024. Mufasa: The Lion King is coming in December, technically Disney's fiscal first quarter of 2025. Last week, Disney announced a Moana sequel for November."", ""Disney has rarely offered profit guidance, but last week it pulled back the curtain to say that adjusted earnings per share in fiscal 2024 should climb at least 20% to $4.60. Wall Street's consensus was at just $4.27 a share at the time."", ""It's huge that this media stock hit a new high on its own strengths. It will make it that much harder for activists to win board seats at Disney's annual shareholder meeting in early April. It also gives Disney investors a long overdue victory lap. This is starting to look like the end of a long losing streak."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Walt Disney right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Walt Disney, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Walt Disney wasn’t one of them.

The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?"", ""While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making."", 'Revisions to Earnings Estimates', ""Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements."", 'Disney is expected to post earnings of $1.04 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.8%.

This helped propel some of last year's most significant stock returns in companies like Nvidia,\xa0Microsoft,\xa0and Palantir."", 'But beyond these names, a few others are equally well positioned to reap enormous benefits from the rise of AI. Micron (NASDAQ: MU), a leading memory producer, is one of them.', 'AI has been used for years. Still, it has recently gained momentum as technology matures in areas like generative AI, leading to the proliferation of new AI-enabled services like ChatGPT. The recent development in AI has been so significant that Bill Gates declared it one of the most important technology revolutions in his lifetime.', 'While these new AI software and services gain most of the limelight, investors should not lose sight of the improvement in hardware that enabled these developments. Like its more prominent peer, Nvidia, Micron is an essential player in the hardware that spurred the development of AI.', ""Let's start with memory solutions (DRAM) in data centers that enable AI systems to perform complex computations. Since complex AI algorithms typically require a high level of computation to process massive amounts of data, data centers must have significant investment in high-quality memory solutions, an area in which Micron is an expert."", ""But that's just one part of the equation. Data centers must also store ever-increasing data sets for training these AI models. This means the demand for NAND flash memory and solid-state drives (SSDs) that provide high-speed storage for AI systems will grow, which is another tailwind for Micron."", 'Beyond data centers, there is an increase in the use of AI at the edge -- PCs, smartphones, embedded sensors in industries, etc. Even in areas like generative AI, which has historically been carried out at data centers, AI is set to grow at the edge due to benefits like real-time analysis, improved efficiency, and others.', 'For example, the gradual movement of vehicles toward autonomy will lead to an ever-growing demand for memory and storage as automakers expand features in an advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) in the short term and complete autonomy in the long run. These developments will increase the demand for more robust and specialized memory and storage solutions.', 'All these point to growth opportunities for Micron in the coming years.', 'Micron is riding on a massive AI tailwind. But to reap the benefits, the company must constantly invest in new technology and build new capacity to keep up with industry developments. And this is not cheap.', 'To put it into perspective, Micron invested $7 billion in capital expenditures in its fiscal-year 2023 (FY23) and is expected to invest slightly more than $7 billion in fiscal-year 2024. It also spent $3 billion in research and development costs in FY23.', ""Another example is to consider Micron's pledge to invest $100 billion in the next 20 years to build the largest semiconductor fabrication facility in the U.S. The first phase of this investment would cost $20 billion, expected by the end of this decade. And that's just one fabrication facility!"", 'Fortunately, Micron has the will and means to see these investments through. For example, it generated nearly $17 billion in operating cash flow in the last two fiscal years. It also has around $12 billion of liquidity -- cash, short-term and long-term marketable investments, restricted cash, and undrawn revolver capacity -- and its debt (net of cash and short-term investments) remains low at less than $5 billion.', 'In other words, Micron has the necessary firepower to invest for growth. It can fund its investment by reinvesting its profits, using its existing liquidity, or, if necessary, accessing the capital market for debt and equity thanks to its solid balance sheet.', 'The rise of AI is expected to be life-changing in both individual lives and business environments.', 'While most investors focus on apparent winners like Microsoft and Alphabet, intelligent investors will branch out beyond these popular names to search for potential investment candidates.', ""As one of the world's leading memory and storage suppliers, Micron stands to benefit from the growing demand for its products and solutions in the AI world."", 'Intelligent investors should keep it on their radar.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Micron Technology right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Micron Technology, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Micron Technology wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.', 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 8.01% compares favorably with the industry's 0.35% performance as well."", 'While any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market.

On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 16% and 24.81%, respectively.', ""Investors should also pay attention to STX's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. STX is currently averaging 2,719,365 shares for the last 20 days."", 'Earnings Outlook', ""The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising.

These revisions helped boost STX's consensus estimate, increasing from $0.23 to $0.45 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 3 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period."", 'Bottom Line', ""Taking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that STX is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B.

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.', 'Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.', 'Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.', ""One company to watch right now is PACCAR (PCAR). PCAR is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock holds a P/E ratio of 13.11, while its industry has an average P/E of 33.20. Over the last 12 months, PCAR's Forward P/E has been as high as 13.37 and as low as 9.44, with a median of 11.61."", ""We also note that PCAR holds a PEG ratio of 1.67. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. PCAR's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 2.65. Within the past year, PCAR's PEG has been as high as 1.67 and as low as 0.94, with a median of 1.16."", ""Another notable valuation metric for PCAR is its P/B ratio of 3.48. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. PCAR's current P/B looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/B of 3.84. PCAR's P/B has been as high as 3.48 and as low as 2.58, with a median of 2.93, over the past year."", ""Finally, investors should note that PCAR has a P/CF ratio of 10.05.

First, the 10-year Treasury rate is over 4%, which makes it difficult to get excited about a stalwart dividend stock yielding less than that. And second, the market has been going up -- a lot. Those capital gains are going to eclipse the dividend income from many companies. And that leaves high-yield dividend stocks on the sidelines of today's unstoppable market."", ""But long-term investors know that the secret to investing in quality dividend stocks isn't to beat the market in a particular year, but to collect passive income while also participating in the market. At its core, income investing is a hybrid strategy that should appeal to more risk-averse investors or those looking to collect income no matter what the market is doing."", ""Here's why United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS), Target (NYSE: TGT), and American Electric Power (NASDAQ: AEP) are excellent high-yield dividend stocks to consider now."", 'Lee Samaha (UPS): The package delivery giant\'s 2023 was, in the words of CEO Carol Tome on the earnings call, ""a difficult and disappointing year.""', ""The company got hit with a combination of deteriorating end markets due to a weakening economy and the costly impact of protracted labor contract negotiations. The latter had a double impact on the company. First, customers diverted delivery volumes to rival networks, fearing strike action impacting UPS' network. Second, resolving the dispute resulted in higher costs due to the new contract."", ""The result was profit declines across all three segments: U.S. domestic package, international package, and supply chain solutions. On a headline basis, this year doesn't look much better, with management forecasting revenue to grow by just 1% to 3.9% and adjusted operating margin to decline from 10.9% to something in the 10% to 10.6% range."", 'That said, there\'s still a strong case for buying the stock, at least if you take on management\'s guidance for the second half of 2024 to be much better than the first. There are a few reasons, not least lapping the increased costs associated with the new labor contract and UPS gradually winning back lost customers. In addition, management is cutting 12,000 jobs, which should result in $1 billion in cost savings this year with ""more cost-out to come as we have a full year benefit in 2025,"" according to Tome.', 'Meanwhile, UPS continues to gain ground within its targeted end markets, such as small and medium-sized businesses and healthcare. It also has efficiency-enhancing and ongoing investments in smart facilities and automation, which can improve profitability.', ""UPS' 4.4% dividend yield is an excellent reason to buy the stock, but it's not the only reason. If you can tolerate the potential for some near-term bad news in the first half, the company's earnings growth is set to pick up notably in the second half and beyond."", 'Daniel Foelber (Target): The old saying that the stock market is forward-looking is a bit misleading. During a bear market, or when sentiment is negative, investors can get caught up in the present challenges and ignore future growth. Just look at what happened to Meta Platforms, Amazon, Nvidia, and countless other companies that have more than doubled from their 2022 lows.', ""But when sentiment is positive, it's usually because investors are willing to pay a higher price for a company today for what it could do in the future. That's playing out with Target right now, which has quietly surged over 32% in the last three months."", 'The stock posted its largest one-day gain in four years after reporting its Q3 earnings in mid-November. But Target has continued to rally not because it is doing particularly well right now, but because investors believe the worst is over and 2024 will be a period to build upon.', ""Target has done an excellent job reducing its inventory, which has allowed it to limit sales and boost margins. Target is still doing its standard promotions, and we'll hear more about the holiday quarter when the company reports in early March. But there's a big difference between promoting a theme and fire-selling goods because a company over-ordered and over-estimated consumer demand for discretionary goods. That's exactly what Target did after getting head faked by seemingly insatiable demand during the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic."", ""The key for Target isn't what happens now, but how it continues to adapt to changing and shifting consumer preferences. The company has made strides with e-commerce, curbside pickup, and its Target Circle loyalty program. Target will need to continue building out these tools to differentiate itself from other retailers and stand a better chance at protecting its margins during the next economic downturn."", ""Even after the stock's run-up, Target still features a 3.1% dividend yield and a mere 18.7 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. At the worst of the sell-off, the dividend yield was around 4% and the P/E ratio was under 15. Target isn't as much of a no-brainer buy as it was a few months ago. But it's still a good choice for passive income-minded investors looking for a quality brand."", ""Scott Levine (American Electric Power): UPS stock is a great way to grow your passive income, but the company's business could suffer from a downturn in the economy, and that may have conservative investors looking for another option. In this case, American Electric Power is a great alternative. The company lauds itself as the largest electric transmission provider and one of the largest distribution providers in the U.S. With a commitment to rewarding shareholders, American Electric Power and its 4.6% forward-yielding dividend represent a great opportunity for income investors."", ""Because it operates as a regulated utility, American Electric Power is able to charge rates that ensure it generates a profit. And since it's highly unlikely that the company's 5.6 million customers located in 11 states will decide to curb electric use to such an extent that the company's financials suffer, management has good foresight into future cash flows, helping the company allocate dividends in a financially prudent manner. From 2024 through 2028, for example, management forecasts generating $38.3 billion in cash from operations -- a period during which it expects to return $11.1 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends."", ""Naturally, a company's past performance is no guarantee that it will perform similarly in the future. Nonetheless, the company's 113-year history of consecutive quarterly dividend payments is a reassuring sign that rewarding shareholders is deeply woven into the company's culture. Investors can, therefore, be a little more confident of management's dividend target: 6% to 7% annual raises -- in line with the company's earnings -- through 2028."", 'For income investors, American Electric Power is a great choice to supercharge their passive income streams.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in United Parcel Service right now?', 'Before you buy stock in United Parcel Service, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and United Parcel Service wasn’t one of them.

This makes the dividend yield 4.5%, which is above the industry average."", ' Check out our latest analysis for United Parcel Service ', ""If the payments aren't sustainable, a high yield for a few years won't matter that much. Prior to this announcement, United Parcel Service's dividend was making up a very large proportion of earnings and perhaps more concerning was that it was 109% of cash flows. Paying out such a high proportion of cash flows can expose the business to needing to cut the dividend if the business runs into some challenges."", 'Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 35.9%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 66%, which would make us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend, despite the levels currently being quite high.', ""The company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2014, the dividend has gone from $2.48 total annually to $6.52. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 10% a year over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time."", ""Investors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. United Parcel Service has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 7.3% per annum. Past earnings growth has been decent, but unless this is one of those rare businesses that can grow without additional capital investment or marketing spend, we'd generally expect the higher payout ratio to limit its future growth prospects."", ""Overall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think United Parcel Service will make a great income stock. Although they have been consistent in the past, we think the payments are a little high to be sustained. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks."", ""Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable.

These factors propel the demand for robust data storage solutions, bolstering computer storage product requirements. These factors are favorable for prominent industry players like Super Micro Computer SMCI, NetApp NTAP, Western Digital WDC and Pure Storage PSTG. The democratization of higher internal memory smartphones, faster Internet speed and 5G will likely act as a tailwind for industry participants. The rapid deployment of 5G networking is driving the proliferation of IoT, Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality (AR/VR) devices. However, cautious IT spending amid global macroeconomic turbulence is a significant headwind in the near term, along with volatile supply chain dynamics and inflation.', 'Industry Description', 'The Zacks Computer-Storage Devices industry houses companies that design, develop, manufacture and market various hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SSDs). These drives are utilized in PCs, laptops, mobiles, servers, network-attached storage (NAS) devices, video game consoles, digital video recorders and other consumer electronic devices. A few industry participants, including Pure Storage, provide software-defined all-flash solutions that are uniquely fast and cloud-capable for customers. Many industry players offer high-performance modular memory subsystems, mount and blade server systems, enterprise storage and data management software and hardware products and services. Some industry participants also provide purpose-built servers for storing and accessing data over a shared network or the Internet.', "" 4 Trends Shaping the Computer-Storage Industry's Future"", 'New Normal Trends & Rapid Implementation of 5G Opening New Business Avenues:. The accelerated deployment of 5G and rebound in the smartphone market will likely propel the industry to newer heights. Extensive implementation of cloud computing solutions, increased Internet usage and rapidly growing media and regulatory compliance have led to a data explosion for enterprises. Implementation of hybrid work models has triggered the demand for data-intensive applications like video conferencing and cloud services. Adequate storage is essential for harnessing data and is expected to raise demand for high-storage capable SSDs and internal memory in advanced smartphones.', 'Innovation in Cloud Storage Technologies to Drive Adoption: Broader storage options from collocated hardware (such as hard disks and tape drives) to many cloud storage solutions have put the industry on a growth trajectory. The industry players are well poised for growth owing to a rapid increase in data, the complexity of data formats and the need to scale resources at regular intervals. These companies rely on Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps) and machine learning (ML) to manage and optimize storage solutions. To streamline data storage, companies are relying on virtualization technologies. As more data is added from IoT, companies are turning to edge computing architecture to reduce latency and boost flexibility. Kubernetes storage is becoming increasingly popular as it facilitates greater agility and scalability. This has bolstered the deployment of high-capacity mass storage products, a positive for industry players.', 'Macro Headwinds May Prove a Drag on IT Spending in the Near Term: Weakening IT spending amid global macroeconomic weakness is likely to remain a headwind in the near term. Increased budget scrutiny, especially cloud-cost optimization by clients, and forex volatility are affecting the top-line performance of the industry participants. Consumer spending cuts on purchasing PCs, tablets and printers will likely hinder IT spending growth. In the long run, higher technology spending on transformation projects, including data security, application modernization, analytics and AI by enterprises, augurs well for industry participants. Per a report from Gartner, worldwide IT spending is now projected to reach $5 trillion in 2024, calling for an increase of 6.8% from 2023 levels. This is below the earlier projection of 8% growth by the research firm. The report also highlighted that although generative AI had enough hype, it will not have a material impact on IT spending in the near term.Slowing Momentum in PC Shipments Might Hinder Growth Prospects: Worldwide PC shipments declined 14.8% year over year to 241.8 million units in 2023, according to the data compiled by Gartner. PC shipments increased 0.3% in the fourth quarter. Gartner expects the PC market to return to growth in 2024, though component price hikes and geopolitical and economic uncertainties remain concerns.', 'Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright Prospects', 'The Zacks Computer Storage is housed within the broader Zacks Computer And Technology Sector.

Extensive cost discipline and new go-to-market measures, along with a focused approach to boosting storage and cloud business, are added positives.', 'Currently, NetApp’s performance is affected by a weak IT spending environment amid macroeconomic turbulence.

Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ: FANG) has struck a deal to acquire privately held rival Endeavor Energy Resources for $26 billion. The acquisition will create a premier producer focused on the resource-rich Permian Basin. ', 'The merger of Diamondback and Endeavor follows in the footsteps of recent deals by ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY), which are bulking up their positions in the Permian Basin. Like those deals, the Diamondback-Endeavor tie-up will likely spark additional consolidation among oil companies. ', ""Diamondback Energy is merging with Endeavor Energy Resources in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $26 billion, which includes the assumption of Endeavor's debt. The company will issue 117.3 million shares and pay $8 billion in cash. It plans to fund the cash portion of the deal with cash on hand, borrowings under its credit facility, and new debt. "", 'The deal combines two leading producers in the Permian Basin to create a premier pure play in the region. The combined company will have 838,000 net acres and produce 816,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d). It will also boast best-in-class inventory depth and quality with about 6,100 remaining drilling locations with break-even levels of less than $40 per barrel (well under the current price level of more than $70 per barrel). ""This is a combination of two strong, established companies merging to create a \'must own\' North American independent oil company,"" commented Diamondback Energy CEO Travis Stice in the press release unveiling the deal. ""With this combination, Diamondback not only gets bigger, it gets better,"" stated the CEO. ', 'Diamondback Energy expects to capture about $550 million in annual savings by combining with Endeavor. That drives its view that the company will generate substantial near- and long-term financial accretion, with at least 10% free-cash-flow-per-share accretion expected next year. ', ""The company initially anticipates using the incremental free cash flow to boost its base dividend (which it's increasing by 7%) and rapidly repay the debt it's taking on to close the deal. Diamondback plans on reducing its capital return target from 75% of its free cash flow to 50% in the near term, and redirect that cash (which would have gone toward repurchasing shares or paying dividends) toward paying down its debt. "", 'This merger is the third major deal involving a Permian-focused producer in the past year. ExxonMobil kicked off the current consolidation wave by agreeing to buy Pioneer Natural Resources in a more than $60 billion deal. Occidental Petroleum followed with its acquisition of privately held CrownRock for $12 billion. ', ""All three deals will enhance the acquirer's scale in the Midland Basin side of the Permian. Those larger-scale positions should increase their returns. For example, ExxonMobil expects to generate double-digit percentage returns from its Pioneer deal by recovering more resources more effectively than either company could have accomplished alone. Another scale advantage the buyers expect to capture is cost savings, which will increase the combined company's free cash flow. Occidental foresees its acquisition of CrownRock boosting its free cash flow by $1 billion in the first year. The mergers will also provide the buyers with a large inventory of future drilling locations to enhance and extend their growth profile. ExxonMobil expects to grow its combined output from 1.3 million BOE/d to 2 million BOE/d by 2027, while Occidental will add 1,700 low-cost future drilling locations to its inventory. "", ""With rivals getting bigger and better, others in the oil patch are searching for consolidation partners. Devon Energy, which was looking at bidding for CrownRock, has reportedly shifted its focus from trying to boost its scale in the Permian to bulking up its position in the Bakken. Meanwhile, oil giant ConocoPhillips was reportedly interested in CrownRock and Endeavor before they agreed to deals with its rivals. That oil giant, too, might now also need to look outside the Permian for an acquisition, potentially following Chevron's strategy of finding deals that enhance its cash-flow growth profile regardless of region. "", 'Diamondback Energy will become a much bigger and better oil company by acquiring Endeavor. The deal will significantly enhance its scale in the Permian Basin, reducing costs, improving returns, and boosting its free cash flow. That will ultimately enable the company to create more value for shareholders. Its needle-moving deal will also likely spur others in the oil patch because those that remain will want to capitalize on the same scale advantages their rivals will realize.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Diamondback Energy right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Diamondback Energy, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Diamondback Energy wasn’t one of them.

However, one of his key points -- taking paths that most people don\'t can often be highly rewarding -- certainly applies to investing.', ""Contrarian investing is based on this principle. Buying shares of companies that many others don't view positively can pay off big-time in some cases. I think there are several contrarian plays that especially stand out right now. Here are three stocks going against the grain of conventional wisdom that could deliver huge gains for long-term investors."", ""You've no doubt heard the predictions that fossil fuels are going the way of the dinosaurs. Renewable energy will replace oil and gas over the coming years if this take is correct. That would seem to make stocks like Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) poor choices for long-term investors."", ""So why is Warren Buffett buying shares of Occidental hand over fist? Is he making an uncharacteristic blunder? I don't think so. Instead, I suspect that Buffett recognizes a reality that many investors don't: Global demand for oil and gas is likely to rise rather than decline over the next few decades."", ""Occidental's valuation doesn't reflect much optimism about the future. Its shares trade at under 11.6 times expected earnings. By comparison, the S&P 500's forward earnings multiple is nearly 20.7."", ""Vicki Hollub, Occidental's CEO, predicts that there will be a global shortage of oil by the end of 2025. Hollub is leading her company to invest in increasing its oil and gas production. For example, Occidental announced in December its plan to acquire CrownRock for $12 billion to boost its U.S. onshore portfolio."", 'The company is also making a big bet that just might be a game changer. Occidental continues to lead the charge in developing direct air capture technology that can suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. If this effort proves to be successful, Occidental should be a massive winner for investors over the long term.', ""PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) has been left in the dust in the fintech market, according to one school of thought. The advent of Apple Pay and similar products has largely made PayPal irrelevant based on this view. Proponents of the theory might point to the fact that PayPal's share price has plunged more than 80% from its 2021 peak as evidence that they're right."", ""For a supposed has-been, though, PayPal's business looks surprisingly strong. The company's revenue jumped 9% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2023 to $8 billion. Its adjusted earnings per share soared 19%. PayPal finished 2023 with a cash stockpile of $17.3 billion compared to debt of $11.3 billion."", ""The company is focusing on increasing the use of Venmo debit cards, which generate 6 times more revenue than peer-to-peer Venmo customers. It's promoting PayPal Rewards, a program that incentivizes higher engagement and drives greater average revenue per account. PayPal is also beefing up its products for small and medium-size businesses. These initiatives could pay off nicely over the next few years."", ""In the meantime, PayPal stock is dirt cheap, with shares trading for less than 11.5 times forward earnings. Wall Street projects that the company will be able to increase its earnings by nearly 20% annually on average over the next five years. This level of growth makes PayPal's valuation look even more attractive."", ""There are several seemingly rock-solid reasons for investors to avoid Pfizer (NYSE: PFE). The big drugmaker's revenue and profits are sinking (along with its share price). Fewer people are choosing to use Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine Comirnaty and oral antiviral pill Paxlovid. The company also faces the loss of exclusivity for multiple top-selling products over the next few years."", 'All of those are admittedly serious concerns for Pfizer. However, they should be taken in context with some other, much better news for the big pharma company.', ""For example, Pfizer's pipeline has been exceptionally productive. The company expects around $20 billion in additional annual revenue from new products and new indications for existing products by 2030. That's more than enough to offset the anticipated revenue impact from drugs losing exclusivity."", 'Pfizer projects another $25 billion in additional annual revenue by 2030 from new business development deals. The company has already completed several acquisitions recently, notably including the buyout of Seagen.', ""It's also possible that 2024 could be a trough year for Pfizer's COVID-19 revenue. Management expects a potential sales boost from the combination COVID-flu vaccine that it hopes to bring to market in the not-too-distant future."", ""Pfizer's dividend yield of 6% means that the stock doesn't have to do much to still deliver a decent total return.

Although 13Fs have their flaws -- e.g., they provide a snapshot from 45 days prior, meaning positions could be outdated -- they can provide clues and insights as to what stocks, industries, and trends are piquing the interest of Wall Street's smartest and most successful investors."", ""Perhaps no investor garners more attention come 13F release time than Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett."", ""The Oracle of Omaha, as Buffett is now affably known by the investing community, took over as Berkshire's chief in the mid-1960s. Over that time, he's overseen an aggregate return of 4,841,199% in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A), as of the closing bell on Feb. 9. Over a nearly six-decade span, he's virtually doubled up the annualized total return, including dividends paid, of the benchmark S&P 500."", ""Though Buffett and his investment team aren't infallible, they do have a knack for spotting value. The Oracle of Omaha's strategy is typically to buy brand-name businesses with sustained competitive advantages and rock-solid management teams, and to hang on to these stakes for long periods. Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly 13Fs provide the necessary insight to professional and everyday investors as to what stocks are on this Wall Street icon's mind."", ""For instance, Buffett and his team have been aggressively purchasing shares of energy stock Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) since the start of 2022. Including the roughly 4.3 million shares purchased in early February -- since Berkshire has a greater than 10% stake in Occidental, it's required to file Form 4 with the SEC anytime it purchases or sells shares -- a more than 248 million-share position worth $14.3 billion has been built from scratch in about 25 months."", ""Warren Buffett and his top investing aides, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, have never been particularly big investors in the energy sector. However, this has changed in a big way over the past two years. A $14.3 billion stake in Occidental, coupled with a $16.7 billion position in Chevron, indicates that Berkshire's top minds expect the spot price for crude oil to remain elevated. Tight global oil supply, which is being fueled by years of capital underinvestment during the pandemic and Russia's ongoing war with Ukraine, does support the notion that the spot price of oil can remain above its historic norm."", 'In particular, Occidental Petroleum generates a higher percentage of its net sales from drilling than Chevron and most other integrated energy companies. If the spot price of crude oil moves up, few if any oil and gas stocks will directly benefit more than Occidental.', ""Investors have also utilized Berkshire's 13Fs to watch the Oracle of Omaha continue to pile into tech stock Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). Buffett and his aides strongly believe in putting an outsized percentage of their company's capital to work in their best investment ideas. As of last week, Apple comprised about 46% of Berkshire's nearly $374 billion investment portfolio."", 'Apple has long checked all the right boxes. It has an exceptionally loyal customer base, an incredibly well-known brand, and the company has thrived because of its innovative capacity. Though Buffett has previously suggested he may not how the iPhone works, he has a keen understanding of consumer behaviors.', ""Looking ahead, Apple's future is very much reliant on its ongoing evolution as a platforms company. CEO Tim Cook is spearheading a transition that's focused on subscription services. A subscription-driven model should keep customers loyal to the company's ecosystem of products and services, lift its operating margin, and smooth out the sales fluctuations that coincide with major iPhone upgrade cycles."", ""As is customary, Berkshire Hathaway's 13F filing won't be published until after the market closes on Wednesday, Feb. 14. But what you might be surprised to learn is that Warren Buffett's favorite stock -- I'm talking about the one he buys far more than any other holding -- won't be listed in the company's 13F for the fourth quarter."", ""To gain insight on Warren Buffett's favorite stock to buy, you'll have to wait until Berkshire Hathaway releases its fourth-quarter operating results, which is usually toward the end of February. Contained within this report is a section that's entirely devoted to share repurchases... because Buffett's favorite stock to buy is shares of his own company. This is why you won't find it in Berkshire's upcoming 13F."", ""Before mid-July 2018, the company's share buybacks program required that Berkshire stock trade at or below 120% of book value (i.e., no more than 20% above book value) before repurchases could be made. For quite some time leading up to mid-July 2018, Berkshire Hathaway stock never fell below this preset threshold. Therefore, no share buybacks were undertaken by Buffett or his team."", ""On July 17, 2018, everything changed for Berkshire Hathaway and its shareholders. The company's board amended the criteria governing buybacks to allow their phenomenal duo of Warren Buffett and the late Charlie Munger to work their magic. As long as the company has at least $30 billion in combined cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasuries on its balance sheet and both Buffett and Munger agreed that their company's stock was intrinsically cheap, buybacks could be made with no limit."", ""Since introducing this repurchase program, Berkshire Hathaway's Class A and B shares have more than doubled, and north of $72 billion worth of shares have been bought back. Warren Buffett has overseen the repurchase of his company's shares for 21 consecutive quarters."", ""Share repurchases are an easy way for Berkshire's board to reward long-term shareholders. Since the company doesn't pay a dividend, buybacks are incrementally increasing the ownership stakes of Berkshire's shareholders."", ""Furthermore, reducing the outstanding share count via buybacks for businesses with steadily growing net income (sans unrealized investment gains/losses) can increase earnings per share (EPS) over time. In other words, it's making Berkshire's stock more attractive to fundamentally focused investors."", ""Berkshire Hathaway's 13F filing on Wednesday, Feb. 14, will undoubtedly offer investors keen insights into the Oracle of Omaha's thinking.

In all, some 2.24% of auto loan balances transitioned into ""delinquent"" status, or at least 30 days late, during the fourth quarter.', 'That figure was the highest since at least 2017. Delinquency rates were much lower during the pandemic as stimulus funds and increased savings helped borrowers stay on track.', '""The increasing transition rates merit monitoring in the months ahead, particularly with the amplified distress shown by borrowers in lower-income areas,"" the New York Fed researchers wrote.', 'In recent interviews and public appearances, executives at some top U.S. auto lenders have said rising delinquencies are part of a ""normalization"" to pre-pandemic trends.

Before the pandemic, nearly all of the company's borrowers who were at least 90 days delinquent soon went into a charge-off. Today, it's closer to two-thirds."", '""People are finding ways to stay in their car, and we\'re working very hard with our customers to try to help keep them in their car,"" Wennes said. He added that Santander has become more proactive in reaching out to customers who may be struggling and offering flexibility to those who need it.', ""Net charge-offs on Santander's U.S. auto loans rose to 4.3% at the end of 2023, up from a low of 1.7% in 2021, but still significantly below its 2019 charge-off rate of 6.7%, according to a Santander earnings presentation."", 'Executives at Detroit-based Ally Financial, whose core business is auto lending, have also pointed to signs of a stabilizing credit environment.

""And we\'re getting better outcomes by doing that.""One factor that has been contributing to borrower difficulties is the sharp rise in auto prices — both for new cars, since supply-chain shortages during the pandemic disrupted auto production, and in the used-vehicle market, where demand increased as a result of the new-car shortage.', 'Monthly payments for lower-income borrowers jumped from $407 in 2018 to $564 at the end of last year, the New York Fed found.', 'Used-auto prices have fallen from their peak in 2022, and the amount that borrowers finance has also dropped somewhat, the New York Fed said.

""CASGEVY offers the potential of a functional cure, and it will be important to offer this therapeutic option to eligible patients as soon as possible.""', 'Vertex is already working closely with national health authorities to secure access for eligible patients as quickly as possible. Through this work, Vertex has secured early access for eligible TDT patients in France ahead of the national reimbursement process. Vertex continues to engage with hospitals experienced in stem cell transplantation to establish a network of independently operated authorized treatment centers (ATCs) for the administration of CASGEVY. There are currently three activated ATCs in the EU and Vertex plans to activate a total of approximately 25 centers across Europe.', 'About Sickle Cell Disease (SCD)', 'SCD is a debilitating, progressive, life shortening genetic disease. SCD patients report health-related quality of life scores well below the general population and significant health care resource utilization. SCD affects the red blood cells, which are essential for carrying oxygen to all organs and tissues of the body. SCD causes severe pain, organ damage and shortened life span due to misshapen or ""sickled"" red blood cells. The clinical hallmark of SCD is vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs), which are caused by blockages of blood vessels by sickled red blood cells and result in severe and debilitating pain that can happen anywhere in the body at any time. SCD requires lifelong treatment and significant use of health care resources, and ultimately results in reduced life expectancy, decreased quality of life and reduced lifetime earnings and productivity. In Europe, the mean age of death for patients living with SCD is around 40 years. Stem cell transplant from a matched donor is a curative option but is only available to a small fraction of people living with SCD because of the lack of available donors.', 'About Transfusion-Dependent Beta Thalassemia (TDT)', 'TDT is a serious, life-threatening genetic disease. TDT patients report health-related quality of life scores below the general population and significant health care resource utilization. TDT requires frequent blood transfusions and iron chelation therapy throughout a person’s life. Due to anemia, patients living with TDT may experience fatigue and shortness of breath, and infants may develop failure to thrive, jaundice and feeding problems. Complications of TDT can also include an enlarged spleen, liver and/or heart, misshapen bones and delayed puberty. TDT requires lifelong treatment and significant use of health care resources, and ultimately results in reduced life expectancy, decreased quality of life and reduced lifetime earnings and productivity. In Europe, the mean age of death for patients living with TDT is 50-55 years. Stem cell transplant from a matched donor is a curative option but is only available to a small fraction of people living with TDT because of the lack of available donors.', 'About CASGEVY™ (exagamglogene autotemcel [exa-cel])', 'CASGEVY™ is a non-viral, ex vivo CRISPR/Cas9 gene-edited cell therapy for eligible patients with SCD or TDT, in which a patient’s own hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells are edited at the erythroid specific enhancer region of the BCL11A gene through a precise double-strand break. This edit results in the production of high levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF; hemoglobin F) in red blood cells. HbF is the form of the oxygen-carrying hemoglobin that is naturally present during fetal development, which then switches to the adult form of hemoglobin after birth. CASGEVY has been shown to reduce or eliminate VOCs for patients with SCD and transfusion requirements for patients with TDT.', 'CASGEVY is approved for certain indications in multiple jurisdictions for eligible patients.', 'About Conditional Marketing Authorizations (CMAs)', 'CMAs are for medicines that fulfil a significant unmet medical need such as being for serious and life-threatening diseases, where no satisfactory treatment methods are available or where the medicine offers a major therapeutic advantage. A CMA is granted where comprehensive clinical data is not yet complete, but the benefit of the medicine to address a significant unmet need outweighs the need for data that will become available in the future. CMAs are valid for one year and renewable annually with ongoing regulatory review of data.', 'About Vertex', 'Vertex is a global biotechnology company that invests in scientific innovation to create transformative medicines for people with serious diseases.

Having said that, from a first glance at Textron (NYSE:TXT) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look."", ""For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for Textron, this is the formula:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.10 = US$1.3b ÷ (US$17b - US$4.4b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""Therefore, Textron has an ROCE of 10%. By itself that's a normal return on capital and it's in line with the industry's average returns of 9.7%."", ' View our latest analysis for Textron ', ""Above you can see how the current ROCE for Textron compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Textron."", ""Things have been pretty stable at Textron, with its capital employed and returns on that capital staying somewhat the same for the last five years. Businesses with these traits tend to be mature and steady operations because they're past the growth phase. So don't be surprised if Textron doesn't end up being a multi-bagger in a few years time."", ""In a nutshell, Textron has been trudging along with the same returns from the same amount of capital over the last five years. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 60% over the last five years. However, unless these underlying trends turn more positive, we wouldn't get our hopes up too high."", ""While Textron doesn't shine too bright in this respect, it's still worth seeing if the company is trading at attractive prices.

All of these items are non-GAAP financial measures, as defined in Regulation G of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company reports its financial results in compliance with GAAP but believes that also discussing non-GAAP measures provides investors with (i) financial measures the Company uses in the management of its business and (ii) additional, meaningful comparisons of current results to prior periods’ results by excluding items that the Company does not believe reflect its fundamental business performance and are not representative or indicative of its results of operations.', 'In addition, the Company’s projected future operating EBITDA is anticipated to exclude the effects of other events or circumstances that are not representative or indicative of the Company’s results of operations. Such excluded items are not currently determinable, but may be significant, such as asset impairments and one-time items, charges, gains or losses from divestitures or litigation, and other items. Due to the uncertainty of the likelihood, amount and timing of any such items, the Company does not have information available to provide a quantitative reconciliation of such projection to the comparable GAAP measure.', 'The Company discusses free cash flow and provides a projection of free cash flow because the Company believes that it is indicative of its ability to pay its quarterly dividends, repurchase common stock, fund acquisitions and other investments and, in the absence of refinancings, to repay its debt obligations. Free cash flow is not intended to replace ""Net cash provided by operating activities,"" which is the most comparable GAAP measure. The Company believes free cash flow gives investors useful insight into how the Company views its liquidity, but the use of free cash flow as a liquidity measure has material limitations because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that the Company has committed to, such as declared dividend payments and debt service requirements. The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures, plus proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets (net of cash divested); this definition may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies.', 'The quantitative reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in the accompanying schedules, with the exception of projected adjusted operating EBITDA.

However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period."", 'While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.', ' See our latest analysis for Waste Management ', ""In the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the President, James Fish, sold US$1.7m worth of shares at a price of US$182 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$189. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. This single sale was just 3.6% of James Fish's stake."", ""Insiders in Waste Management didn't buy any shares in the last year.

This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap."", ""Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Waste Management insiders own about US$141m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders."", ""Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. But it is good to see that Waste Management is growing earnings. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company.

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.', 'Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Sempra (NYSE:SRE). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business.', ' See our latest analysis for Sempra ', ""If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. We can see that in the last three years Sempra grew its EPS by 10% per year. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up."", ""Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. While we note Sempra achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 13% to US$17b. That's encouraging news for the company!"", 'In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image.', ""While we live in the present moment, there's little doubt that the future matters most in the investment decision process. So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for Sempra?"", ""We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$44b company like Sempra. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. As a matter of fact, their holding is valued at US$20m. That shows significant buy-in, and may indicate conviction in the business strategy. Even though that's only about 0.05% of the company, it's enough money to indicate alignment between the leaders of the business and ordinary shareholders."", ""One positive for Sempra is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. For those who are looking for a little more than this, the high level of insider ownership enhances our enthusiasm for this growth. These two factors are a huge highlight for the company which should be a strong contender your watchlists. It's still necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with Sempra (at least 1 which is a bit unpleasant)  , and understanding these should be part of your investment process."", 'Although Sempra certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

As most would know, long-term fundamentals have a strong correlation with market price movements, so we decided to look at the company's key financial indicators today to determine if they have any role to play in the recent price movement. In this article, we decided to focus on LyondellBasell Industries'  ROE."", ""Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity."", ' See our latest analysis for LyondellBasell Industries ', 'The formula for ROE is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for LyondellBasell Industries is:', '16% = US$2.1b ÷ US$13b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.16 in profit."", 'So far, we\'ve learned that ROE is a measure of a company\'s profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don\'t have the same features.', ""To begin with, LyondellBasell Industries seems to have a respectable ROE. Further, the company's ROE compares quite favorably to the industry average of 13%. However, we are curious as to how the high returns still resulted in flat growth for LyondellBasell Industries in the past five years. Based on this, we feel that there might be other reasons which haven't been discussed so far in this article that could be hampering the company's growth. Such as, the company pays out a huge portion of its earnings as dividends, or is faced with competitive pressures."", ""We then compared LyondellBasell Industries' net income growth with the industry and found that the average industry growth rate was 13% in the same 5-year period."", ""Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is LYB fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know."", 'Despite having a normal three-year median payout ratio of 40% (implying that the company keeps 60% of its income) over the last three years, LyondellBasell Industries has seen a negligible amount of growth in earnings as we saw above. Therefore, there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline.', ""Moreover, LyondellBasell Industries has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 53% over the next three years. However, LyondellBasell Industries' future ROE is expected to rise to 23% despite the expected increase in the company's payout ratio. We infer that there could be other factors that could be driving the anticipated growth in the company's ROE."", ""Overall, we feel that LyondellBasell Industries certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Yet, the low earnings growth is a bit concerning, especially given that the company has a high rate of return and is reinvesting ma huge portion of its profits. By the looks of it, there could be some other factors, not necessarily in control of the business, that's preventing growth. With that said, we studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that while the company has shrunk its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to grow in the future. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

Founded in 1965, Progressive is a leading independent agency writer of private passenger auto coverage, and the market share leader for the motorcycle products since 1998. Progressive operates through three business segments.', 'The Personal Lines (77% of 2022 Net Premium earned) segment writes insurance for private passenger automobiles, recreational and other vehicles. This business generally offers more than one program in a single state, with each program targeted toward a specific distribution channel, market, or customer group. Personal Lines products comprise insurance for personal autos and special lines products. The agency business includes business written by Progressive’s network of more than 35,000 independent insurance agencies located throughout the United States, as well as brokerages in New York and California and strategic alliance business relationships (other insurance companies, financial institutions, and national agencies). The direct business includes business written directly by the company online and over the phone.', 'The Commercial Lines (18%) segment writes primary liability and physical damage insurance for automobiles and trucks owned by small businesses. The majority of its Commercial Auto customers insure two or fewer vehicles. The Commercial Lines business, which is primarily distributed through the independent agency channel, operates in the business auto and specialty truck markets. The business auto market accounts for one third of its total Commercial Auto premiums and approximately 60% of the vehicles Progressive insures in this business. The remainder is in the specialty truck commercial auto market, which includes dump trucks, logging trucks, tow trucks, local cartage and other short-haul commercial vehicles.', 'The Property (5%) segment writes personal property insurance, for homeowners, other property owners, and renters, in the Agency channel in over 31 states and the District of Columbia for personal property insurance and in over four states for commercial property insurance.', 'Bottom Line', ""While anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in Progressive ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today."", 'According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in February 2014 would be worth $7,899.70, or a gain of 689.97%, as of February 12, 2024, and this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.', 'The S&P 500 rose 179.72% and the price of gold increased 50.77% over the same time frame in comparison.', 'Analysts are anticipating more upside for PGR.', ""Shares of Progressive have outperformed the industry over the past year. It continues to gain on higher premiums, given its compelling product portfolio, leadership position and strength in both Vehicle and Property businesses. Focus on becoming a one-stop insurance destination, catering to customers opting for a combination of home and auto insurance, augurs well for the company's growth. Policies in force and retention ratio should remain healthy. Competitive pricing to retain current customers and address customer needs with new offerings should continue to drive policy life expectancy. However, exposure to catastrophe losses induces underwriting volatility. Escalating expenses due to higher losses and settlement expenses remain an overhang on the margin. High debt level along with low times earned interest pose financial risk."", 'Shares have gained 8.18% over the past four weeks and there have been 11 higher earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2024 compared to none lower.

As a result, many investors might be reviewing their long-term financial goals as well as their plans for stock purchases. As always, it's best to invest consistently in stocks so you can benefit from all types of market environments."", 'If you have capital to deploy right now, there are plenty of stocks begging to be bought, some of which are trading at discounts despite their steadily growing businesses. Here are two such names to consider now for a long-term investment.', 'UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) is the largest healthcare company in the world by revenue. This is thanks to its flagship insurance business UnitedHealthcare and its Optum business, the latter including a variety of services ranging from specialty pharmacy solutions for patients, to analytics and research solutions for medical providers as well as other members of the healthcare industry.', ""UnitedHealth Group is currently trading down by single digits from its 52-week high. It's been a rough period for health insurance stocks recently, particularly as the rising costs of claims cuts into the top and bottom lines of companies across the industry."", 'These rising costs are attributable to a range of factors, including the fact that consumers are filing more claims as they play catch-up for procedures and other forms of medical care that were postponed during the pandemic. With the advent of an aging population, a rising number of outpatient and inpatient claims are to be expected as well.', 'Even as claims are elevated compared to the full pandemic period (when many procedures like surgeries were postponed), regulatory changes are also a notable factor in the cost of doing business. For example, Medicare coverage expansions that have provided meaningful changes for affected consumers are also increasing costs for companies like UnitedHealth Group.', ""Amid this landscape, UnitedHealth is demonstrating marked resilience as it harvests revenue and profits. Its Optum business is growing at roughly twice the rate of the UnitedHealthcare segment, which is also enabling this overall resilience in the face of operating conditions that are largely beyond the company's control."", 'In 2023, UnitedHealth Group revenue totaled $372 billion, up 15% from 2022. Earnings from operations for the 12-month period rose 14% year over year to $32 billion. Broken down by segment, UnitedHealthcare saw revenue rise 13% from 2022, while revenue from the Optum business surged 24%. Over the trailing 12 months, UnitedHealth Group brought in $29 billion in cash from operations. Over the past decade, this business has grown its annual revenue and profits by 185% and 298%, respectively.', ""Of note for income investors, UnitedHealth has also paid a dividend in some form since 1990. The company switched to a quarterly dividend from an annual one in 2010 and has consistently raised its payout ever since. UnitedHealth Group's current yield is 1.5%, in line with the S&P 500 average. The last five years alone have seen its payout hiked by about 109%."", 'This is a solid healthcare business to add to a well-diversified basket of stocks, and one that can provide some long-term passive income to boot.', ""Teladoc Health (NYSE: TDOC) hasn't garnered top marks from investors for some time now, with a wave of pessimism following pandemic heights driving shares down. The stock is down about 36% from where it was a year ago."", ""Investors haven't been happy with the company's continued losses, along with its decelerating growth from the worst of the pandemic when telehealth adoption rose at an unprecedented clip."", ""But Teladoc has been steadily slashing its net losses in recent quarters. And most of its net losses in the last few years have been non-cash in nature, such as the multibillion-dollar impairment charges to write down the acquisitions it made during the pandemic. Also, Teladoc's growth has slowed from the height of the pandemic."", ""This was inevitable at some point as those growth rates were not sustainable nor realistic for a company as established in its growth story as Teladoc is. It's one of the largest telehealth entities in the world, with a significant footprint in a multibillion-dollar addressable market."", ""The global telehealth market is still growing at a strong pace. It's valued at approximately $123 billion, and is expected to achieve a compound annual growth rate of 24% over the coming years, and a valuation of $455 billion by 2030."", 'Those are durable market trends, and Teladoc is in good position to benefit from them. Its integrated-care segment, which includes services like chronic care and primary care, is driving steady revenue growth, as is its teletherapy segment BetterHelp. In the third quarter of 2023, integrated care revenue totaled $374 million, a 9% increase from one year ago and 4% higher than the prior quarter.', ""The integrated care segment ended the quarter with more than 90 million members worldwide, over 4 million of which were added within the three-month period alone. Teladoc's chronic care program was the leading driver of this segment's growth. The program recorded 49,000 new enrollments in the quarter, for a total of 1.1 million individuals at the end of the period, up 13% year over year."", 'In the third quarter of 2023, Teladoc brought in total revenue of $660 million and adjusted earnings of $89 million. Those two figures were up 8% and 73%, respectively, from one year ago. This healthcare stock has a growth story still to tell, and investors who stay along for the ride might find the wait was worth the bumps along the way.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in UnitedHealth Group right now?', 'Before you buy stock in UnitedHealth Group, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and UnitedHealth Group wasn’t one of them.

Please note that we have also posted a presentation on our website with additional information including disclosures related to forward earnings guidance. Our caution on forward-looking statements also applies to these presentation materials. Lisa?"", ""Lisa Palmer: Thank you, Christy, and good morning, everyone. We had another strong quarter in Q4, finishing off an exceptional year for Regency. I'm so proud of the success and what we were able to accomplish, a direct result of the hard work of our dedicated and talented team. Tenant demand across our shopping centers remains robust and this is most evident in our record shop occupancy and in the strength of our leasing pipeline. As we look ahead, we believe the current macroeconomic backdrop supports the continuation of positive trends for neighborhood and community shopping centers. This favorable retail demand environment has also served as a great foundation for driving success in creating value through our sector leading development program."", 'In 2023, we started more than $250 million of new projects with a healthy pipeline of future projects that the team continues to build. We are on track to start $1 billion or more of projects over the next five years. My hat is off to all involved on our team. You have heard me say it before, I believe we have the best development platform in the sector. Our experienced team and ability to create value through this platform and the ability to self-fund with levered free cash flow are unique competitive advantages for Regency. It was also a big year on the transactional side, highlighted by the closing of the Urstadt Biddle acquisition in August. The integration into Regency is now essentially complete. Kudos to all involved for effecting such a smooth and seamless transition.', ""Our ability to grow through developments and transactions is also a testament to the strength and stability of our balance sheet, which in turn enabled us to successfully execute on our $400 million bond issuance and revolving credit line recast in January. Our ability to access low-cost capital is reflective of the quality of our portfolio, our track record and the strength of our lending relationships. Most of you on this call also know that I'm very proud of Regency's best-in-class corporate responsibility, reputation and practices. I'm also grateful when the efforts of our team are recognized, such as in Newsweek's most recent Americas Most Responsible Companies List, where Regency ranked 6th overall in the United States and first in the real estate and housing category."", 'Our company has been included in this list for all five years of its existence and this is the highest ranking any real estate company has ever achieved. For the benefit of our shareholders and all stakeholders, we are committed to adhering to our corporate responsibility principles in all areas of our business. Before turning it over to Alan, I do want to reiterate that we believe the strength in leasing demand over the past 24 months or so is showing no signs of abating. Consistent job growth and moderating inflation are driving consumer resiliency in our trade areas. We also continue to experience tailwinds favoring brick and mortar retail in strong suburban markets, supporting a positive retail environment ahead. Alan?', 'Alan Roth: Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. We had another quarter with great operating results and leasing momentum capping off a very active 2023. Our teams are taking full advantage of the healthy retail environment that has continued into 2024. Our success was evident in same-property NOI growth of 3.6% in 2023, excluding COVID period reserve collections and termination fees, with base rent growth being the most significant driver, a function primarily of driving rents higher, commencing shop occupancy and bringing redevelopment projects online. In the fourth quarter, we executed nearly 2.5 million square feet of leases with activity from categories including grocers, restaurants, health and wellness, off-price and personal services.', 'Our leasing pipelines continued to be robust, representing another 1 million square feet of potential new leases in LOI and lease negotiation. We achieved cash rent spreads of 12% on a blended basis in Q4, including 35% spreads on new leasing. Full year 2023 cash rent spreads of 10% was our highest annual level since 2016. GAAP and net effective rent spreads were above 20% in the quarter, demonstrating our ability to obtain contractual rent steps in our leases while also being judicious on CapEx spend. Our same-property percent lease rate was up another 30 basis points in Q4, ending the year at 95.7%, and our prelease spread widened further to 280 basis points as a result of our leasing success in the quarter. This pipeline of executed deals now reflects more than $40 million of base rent for leases yet to commence.', ""I've said in the past that records are made to be broken and the team drove our shop leased rate to yet another new record high of 93.4% in the fourth quarter. That represents an impressive 150 basis point increase in shop leasing year-over-year, reflective of nearly 1.4 million square feet of shop space leased, our highest shop volume in more than a decade. Our anchor lease rate also ticked higher in the quarter and ended the year up 10 basis points over 2022 despite the impact from bankruptcy related closures. Our teams have made great progress remerchandising this space with exceptional retailers and at higher rents. And in some cases, our ability to recapture this space has acted as a catalyst for long awaited redevelopment projects. As I look towards 2024, it will take some time to see the benefit of this re-tenanting activity given the 12 to 24 month average downtime associated with anchor re-leasing and lead times on redevelopment projects."", ""For example, some of the Bed Bath spaces that we've released will not rent commence until the fourth quarter of this year. So even with our substantial leasing progress, our anchor commenced occupancy rate ended 2023 lower by 60 basis points, and as a result, we will feel the impact of these vacancies in 2024. That said, the work we've done to date means that we have meaningful visibility into our anchor commencement trajectory. We expect to move our portfolio lease rate even higher in 2024 as demand for space in our high quality centers continues unabated. This will ultimately drive an elevated level of anchor commencement in late 2024 and into 2025. In closing, I am really proud of the tremendous work and success of our team over the last year and I am excited for another great year of leasing activity as the current retail environment is enabling us to create meaningful long-term value at our shopping centers."", 'Nick?', 'Nick Wibbenmeyer: Thank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone. We continue to experience strong momentum in our development and redevelopment program as our investment teams were active in the fourth quarter. With additional projects breaking ground in Q4, we ended 2023 with just over $250 million in starts. This is the highest level of starts in a single year for Regency in nearly two decades and demonstrates the incredible work and progress our team has made in sourcing new projects and ramping up our pipeline to achieve our goals. Among our fourth quarter starts is the $23 million redevelopment of Avenida Biscayne. With this project, we are excited to bring additional shop space to one of the best pieces of commercial real estate in South Florida, adjacent to our existing Aventura Square shopping center.', ""In the quarter, we also began the redevelopment of Cambridge Square Atlanta. This $15 million project will bring in new Publix as well as extensive improvements to the center. As of year-end, our in-process pipeline has grown to $468 million and overall our execution remains on time and on budget with expected blended returns of more than 8%. Our in-process projects are 89% preleased on average, reflecting the tremendous work of our team and continued strong demand from high quality retailers. I'll reiterate Alan's comments about anchor recapture, as it can often be a catalyst to unlock creative redevelopment opportunities and bring exciting new merchandising to reinvigorate a center. We have several examples of those within our in-process redevelopment pipeline today, including Baptist Health at Mandarin Landing, Sprouts at Circle Marina Center, REI at Walker Center and Publix at Buckhead Landing."", 'Moving to acquisitions, private transaction activity remains light, but our teams were still able to close two compelling transactions in the fourth quarter. As disclosed previously, we closed on the acquisition of Nohl Plaza in Orange County, California in October, and as a reminder, we bought this center as a future redevelopment pipeline project. And in December, we acquired The Longmeadow Shops in Massachusetts. This 100,000 square foot neighborhood center is fully leased to a strong national merchandising mix of tenants and serves as the premier shopping and dining destination within its trade area. Looking ahead to 2024 and beyond, our team is focused on further building our value creation pipelines and achieving our goal of starting more than $1 billion of development and redevelopment projects over the next five years.', 'While it is difficult to get developments to pencil, we continue to be uniquely suited and remain optimistic about finding and executing attractive opportunities. Demand continues to be strong among best-in-class grocers, as well as other retailers and service providers looking to grow their footprints in our high quality centers and within our trade areas. As Lisa just said, Regency has the best development team in the business and our free cash flow and balance sheet give us the capability to fund projects and continue the success we enjoyed in 2023. Mike?', ""Mike Mas: Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with some highlights from our full year results, walk through details related to our initial 2024 guidance range and finish by discussing recent balance sheet activity. We reported Nareit FFO of $4.15 per share and core operating earnings of $3.95 per share in 2023. Year-over-year growth in core operating earnings per share was nearly 6%, excluding the timing impact of COVID period reserve collections, driven in large part by same-property NOI growth of 3.6%. Base rent, following significant gains in rent paying occupancy remained the largest contributor to our NOI growth rate at 360 basis points. Turning to our initial guidance for 2024, I'll first refer you to the helpful detail on Slides 5 through 7 in our earnings presentation."", 'Excluding the timing impact of COVID period reserve collections last year, the midpoint of our 2024 range reflects core operating earnings growth of more than 3%. The largest contributor to growth continues to be same-property NOI, for which our guidance assumes a range of 2% to 2.5%. Base rent growth this year will continue to be driven by embedded rent steps, positive re-leasing spreads, additional rent commencement of shop leases and deliveries of redevelopment projects. However, anchor space recapture is expected to impact our commenced occupancy rate in the near term, primarily a result of bankruptcy related moveouts and some junior anchor moveouts following lease expiration. Given the longer lead time to open new anchor tenants, we expect our average commenced occupancy rate to be down by about 50 basis points year-over-year in 2024, impacting same-property NOI growth in the short-term.', 'But more importantly, due to robust tenant demand, we have been re-leasing this anchor space just about as quickly as we are recapturing it and we expect our overall portfolio lease rate will trend higher throughout the year. We will begin to benefit from this outsized anchor rent commencement activity beginning in late 2024. In addition to same-property NOI growth, our earnings range also reflects previously discussed accretion from the UBP merger as well as positive contributions from recently completed ground-up developments. As we discussed last quarter, the impact of higher rates and debt refinancing activity remains a headwind to core operating earnings growth this year. That said, we are very pleased to gain greater visibility on this impact as we took advantage of an attractive debt capital markets window in early January to prefund our 2024 maturities with a new $400 million bond priced at 5.25%.', ""Notably, as you consider our guidance range for interest expense and preferred dividends, please know that it is showing net of expected interest income. January proved to be a busy month as we also closed on the recast of our revolving credit facility, which was upsized by $250 million to a $1.5 billion total commitment, which included a tightening of our borrowing spread by 15 basis points. In an environment where access to capital is even more precious and banks are being incrementally more discriminating, we are proud of this result, a reflection of Regency's performance track record, portfolio quality and balance sheet position, as well as the strength of our long-standing banking partnerships. Our recent activity has further fortified our sector-leading balance sheet and liquidity position."", ""We remain at the low end of our targeted leverage range of 5 times to 5.5 times net debt to EBITDA. And following the prefunding of our '24 maturities, our next unsecured bond maturity is not until November of 2025. We have ample capacity on our newly upsized revolver and expect to generate free cash flow north of $160 million this year. This liquidity, balance sheet capacity and differentiated access to capital allows us to further grow our development and redevelopment pipelines as both Lisa and Nick discussed, and remain opportunistic as we look for incremental avenues to drive growth and value. With that, we are happy to take your questions.

Meanwhile, lower-quality firms like struggling EV maker Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) and crypto exchange Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) ended up at the bottom.', 'So far, the results have been excellent.', 'Since January, the average 1.8% rise in A+ stocks has almost quadrupled the average 0.46% return. Returns among the top 10 picks exceeded 5%.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'The system has also been exceptional at picking stocks to avoid. Since MarketMasterAI made its predictions, the 10 worst F-rated stocks have dropped an average of 13%.', 'Of course, the system occasionally misses moonshot stocks. Shares of F-rated Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), a firm favored by Louis Navellier (subscription required), have more than doubled so far this year. But MarketMasterAI seeks to do better on average, downgrading firms like SMCI in favor of more consistent picks. In fact, nine out of 10 top MarketMasterAI picks have gone up this year, compared to just 52% of the top 500 stocks!', 'The best part is that MarketMasterAI keeps adjusting as new data becomes available. More than half of S&P 500 companies have now reported fourth-quarter earnings, and the unusual number of earnings beats is pushing the system into riskier growth stocks.', 'On average, the latest group of top stocks are faster-growing than before. Analysts expect these top picks to grow revenues by 8.3% this year (compared to the market average of 5.7%) and earnings by 14.6% (vs. the market average of 6.9%). That’s a significant acceleration from December’s picks, which saw revenue and EPS growth of 6.9% and 9.6%, respectively.', 'However, three major changes stand out.', 'Firstly, energy stocks are now replaced by insurance firms. Oilfield service companies Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and Hess (NYSE:HES) drop out of the top 25 on downward revisions to global oil output estimates. High-quality Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) barely hangs on at number 23.', 'Second, many healthcare stocks also leave the top 25 this month after enormous January run-ups. Formerly top-ranked Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) has returned 12% since January on optimism over its weight-loss and diabetes drugs. Its expected upside consequently drops to 6.5%, earning the firm an average C grade. Firms like Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN) and Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) have seen similar moves, and thus drop out of the top rankings.', 'Finally, several large industrial and consumer-facing firms move up the ranks to replace healthcare picks. These companies tend to rise steadily during mid-stage economic recoveries as demand improves.', 'Together, that means the average beta of the top-25 portfolio actually drops from 0.81 to 0.77, a remarkable reduction in volatility given a pivot into growth stocks.', 'These findings are summarized in the table below. Of particular note is No. 1 ranked Marsh & McLennan Companies (NYSE:MMC) and No. 2 Arthur J. Gallagher (NYSE:AJG). Both of these firms rose 33% or more in 2021, a period of strong economic recovery, and analysts expect 2024 to bring similar conditions.', 'The inclusions of single-family REITs Equity LifeStyle Properties (NYSE:ELS) and American Homes 4 Rent (NYSE:AMH) are also notable.

Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude net gains from sales of certain real estate assets, impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity, depreciation and amortization expense from real estate assets and other specified items, including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries. FFO and FFO per diluted share are non-GAAP financial measures used by management, investors and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions. The Company also uses FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions, as adjusted for certain items that impact the comparability of period to period FFO, as one of several criteria to determine performance-based compensation for senior management. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a performance measure or cash flow as a liquidity measure. FFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition to FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions, we also disclose FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions, as adjusted. Although this non-GAAP measure clearly differs from NAREIT’s definition of FFO, we believe it provides a meaningful presentation of operating performance. Reconciliations of net (loss) income attributable to common shareholders to FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions are provided on the following page.

And with that, I will turn the call over to Don Wood to begin our discussion of our fourth quarter results. Don?"", 'Donald C. Wood', ""Thanks, Leah, and good afternoon, everybody. Well, 2023 is in the books with a strong dollar -- before recorded in the fourth quarter, finish off with what is an all-time record earnings year at $6.55 of FFO per share. That's happening despite over $600 million of construction progress not yet contributing. And higher interest expense that cost to trust an additional $0.27 per share when compared with the average rate in 2022. With comparable money cost between '22 and '23, FFO growth per share would have been 8%, right up there with our best pre-COVID years. It says a lot in terms of the power of the portfolio that has grown bottom line FFO per share at a compound annual growth of 4.5% over the last 20 years in addition to an average uninterrupted dividend yield of roughly 3% or better. That includes the great financial crisis, it includes the global pandemic, it includes everything, a better portfolio to own for long-term investors in our opinion. It also feels like we're getting closer to a time where accelerated acquisition activity, coupled with our redevelopment and remerchandising expertise on new acquisitions could boost that growth rate over the next few years. As far as today's environment, demand continues to exceed supply for highest quality assets in the close-in suburbs, and with the impacts of the pandemic in the rearview mirror and lack of new supply coming on, I don't see this positive supply-demand dynamic change anytime soon. Our average in-place rents portfolio-wide are $31.60 per foot and the comparable retail deals we did in the fourth quarter were at $44.57 a foot and were $36.75 for the entire year. I've been hearing that rents can't be pushed further for the better part of the last 20 years. And I guess, on a relative basis, they are. Better properties have higher rents, better properties have higher tenant sales and profitability, too. Frankly, it's obvious. Percentage rents are an interesting barometer on this topic. While we push for a strong fixed rent in nearly every lease, tenant sales above a threshold level points to additional rent. Percentage rent and overage rent totaled $6 million in the fourth quarter and $19.3 million for the year, an all-time record, which broke the $18.8 million record from the year earlier. Fourth quarter retail leasing continued to rank with another 100 comparable retail deals done at 12% rollover on a cash basis, 23% on a straight-line basis. These comparable retail deals account for virtually all 98% of the total retail deals done in the quarter, making them representative of the entire portfolio, not just a fraction. It was a great leasing year, the third in a row where we exceeded 2 million square feet, roughly 25% more than the 5-year average between 2015 and 2019. It's just a pound a point home. Those cash basis rollover increases come on top of leases that have had what I believe to be the highest contractual rent bumps throughout their term in the sector, making their rollover all the more impressive. Contractual rent bumps for the deals done in the fourth quarter were roughly 2.5% blended (inaudible) small shop with new and renewal small shops at approximately 3%. The weighted average contractual rent bumps for the entire retail portfolio (inaudible) small shop not just 1 quarter tour, but the whole thing approximates 2.25% best in the business as far as we can tell. The sustained leasing volume and related economics bode well in future, especially the contractual windfalls. We ended the year with overall portfolio leased at 94.2%, pretty strong, but with room to grow. That breaks down between anchors at 96% leased and shop space at 9.7%. When you look at occupancy possibilities going forward by looking at our past, it's reasonable to expect another 100 basis points of small shelf occupancy and another 200 basis points of anchor occupancy improvement in the coming 12 to 18 months depending, of course, on the extent of future bankruptcies that we are not seeing today. They're not at all obvious. The residential and office product and our mixed-use properties continues to outperform competing supply in non-mixed use environments and stood at 96% leased for both our comparable resi and comparable mixed-use office product at year-end while commanding premium rents. Progress leasing up our mixed-use office under development, 915 Meeting Street at Pike & Rose and Santana West has been measurably stronger with 215,000 square feet newly leased or in the final stages of the LOI to sign the lease process. That includes the first signed deal at Santana West with Acrisure, the global fintech leader to the insurance sector. With those deals complete, 915 Meeting Street at Pike & Rose will be 80% leased and Santana West will be nearly half leased up. I go through all this to really try to hammer on the obvious health of a business, centered around leasing high-quality retail-centric properties in the close-end suburbs of America's greatest cities. While bottom line results are and will continue to be muted by the higher but certainly reasonable cost of capital, that is stabilizing, rents will likely continue to adjust upward over time to that reality. This is especially true for tenants and locations in affluent areas where customers can absorb higher costs. I hope that higher interest rates don't cloud investors' appreciation, the strong underlying business fundamentals that exist today and likely tomorrow. With that backdrop, we're also really excited to add a substantial expansion to the 87-unit first phase of residential product that we built at Bala Cynwyd Shopping Center in suburban Philadelphia a few years back. The first base open strong and remains fully leased with growing rents, strong supply and demand dynamics in this close-in part of Philadelphia's mainline along with construction costs moderating means that we're able to build an additional 217 residential units, 16,000 feet of additional retail and the covered partner spaces service at all on the former Lord + Taylor site at Bala Cynwyd. The shopping center features an expansive tenant roster, including an LA Fitness Gym, a full-service grocery, restaurants and necessary services, which are often cited as the reason residents are choosing it. Projects should get underway later this year, begin with the demo of the old Lord + Taylor building, it should yield a 7% cash on cost return when stabilized, drive a double-digit unlevered IRR and based on the rent growth we've seen and expect and be funded from free cash flow. Okay. On to 2024, where we certainly expect another record this year with an energized team and a strong set of optimism. Dan will go into a bunch more detail, and I'll turn it over to him and then open it up to your questions. Dan?"", 'Daniel Guglielmone', ""Thank you, Don. Hello, everyone. Our reported FFO per share of $1.64 for the fourth quarter and $6.55 for the year were up 3.8% and 3.6%, respectively, versus 2022. POI was up 6.5% in fourth quarter and a more impressive 7.2% for the year. Primary driver to the strong performance in 2023, first, POI growth our comparable portfolio, up almost 5% on a cash basis, excluding prior period rents and terms and fees, driven by both higher rents and higher average occupancy over the course of the year. Driven by continued strength in consumer traffic and tenant sales, particularly at our mixed-use assets, driving parking revenues and average percentage rent higher. Effectively controlling property level expenses and having a lower credit reserve than we originally forecast. Second, contributions from our redevelopment and expansion pipeline, which came in at the upper end of our forecast. And lastly, continued focus on overall expense controls, the G&A came in below expectations. This was offset primarily by higher interest rate headwinds totaling $0.27. To reiterate Don's point earlier, with a consistent cost of debt versus 2022, FFO per share growth year-over-year would have been 8% in 2023. Reflecting an exceptionally strong year of growth at the property levels. GAAP-based comparable POI growth came in at 4% for the fourth quarter and 3.2% for the year and a comparable cash basis, excluding the impact of prior period rent and term fees, growth was 5.2% in the fourth quarter and 4.7% for the year. As a reminder, this information, including the components of prior period rent term fees and GAAP to cash adjustments can be found on Page 12, our quarterly 8-K supplement. Our residential portfolio continues to be a source of strength despite headwinds in the broader residential sector. Same-store residential POI growth was 5.8% in 4Q along with revenue growth for the quarter at 6%, and we expect this strength to continue into 2024. The value proposition of providing a premium residential offering on top of an attractive retail amenity base is driving outperformance across our targeted residential portfolio. Also a big driver of our growth in 2023 and was continued stabilization of a large portion of our redevelopment and expansion pipeline as $18 million of incremental POI came online from our $750 million in-process pipeline. And we expect that to be the case moving forward as well as we add new projects to the lineup and maintain that part of our business is a continued driver of growth. The scale and skill set of our redevelopment program is a key differentiator for Federal. Notable updates to our in-process pipeline, which will contribute an additional $9 million to $12 million of POI in 2024 include $115 million debt income projects in Connecticut, where the residential is fully stabilized 98.4%; occupancy with rents above $4 per foot per month, well above underwriting. And our retention rates remain above 90%, and the retail component approaches 90% leased. A testament to what a strong retail amenity base can bring to a residential project. At the $190 million, 915 Meeting Street at Pike & Rose, Choice hotels fully moved in as they open in 4Q, plus they've taken additional space. Sodexo's U.S. headquarters is next on deck to open with multiple other tenants actively negotiating leases. At Huntington Shopping Center on Long Island, this $85 million Whole Foods anchored redevelopment is over 90% leased with new anchor REI opening during the fourth quarter in addition to a number of small shops. We feel very good about the yield on this project approaching the top end of our 7% to 8% return range. For those of you in the New York area, it's worth a trip out to Central Long Island later this year after (inaudible) opens to check it out as well as the Melville asset, a mile further south. Both are exceptional retail redevelopments, which truly highlight Federal's skill set. Additionally, in 2023, we incrementally invested over $120 million in properties we only partially owned previously at an effective 8.1% cap rate. No better risk-adjusted investment in deploying capital, accretively into assets we know extremely well. Own levered IRRs on these investments in the double digits. Now to the balance sheet and an update on our liquidity position. As you all saw, we refinanced our $600 million bond maturity, which came due on January 15, for a combination of a $200 million secured loan on our Bethesda Row property and an effective 5% fixed rate for the first 2 years of the loan, plus 2 1-year extensions at our (inaudible) effectively a 4-year long and a $485 million, 3.25% exchangeable notes offering due 2029, raised in early January at an effective 3.9% interest rate all-in. Part of that transaction, we purchased a (inaudible) spread to increase the effective strike price on the convert of 40%, up above $143 per share. So no incremental economic dilution unless the common stock freeze above that level as adjustment. Pro forma for the most recent financing and dividend based, our liquidity stands above $1.3 billion with an undrawn $1.25 billion credit facility and available cash on hand. Plus we have no maturities remaining in 2024 and no material maturities until 2026. Our leverage metrics continue to be strong as fourth quarter annualized net debt-to-EBITDA stands at 5.9x and that metric should improve over the course of 2024 and hit our target of 5.5x in 2025. Fixed charge coverage was 3.6x at year-end and that metric should continue to improve as incremental EBITDA on online and interest rates fall over the second half of 2024. Now on to guidance. For 2024, we are introducing an FFO per share forecast $6.65 to $6.87 per share. This represents over 3% growth at the midpoint of $6.76 or roughly 5% at the high end of the range. This is driven by comparable growth of 2.5% to 4% when excluding prior period rents and term fees, 3.25% at the midpoint. This assumes occupancy levels will increase from 92.2% at 12/31, up to roughly 93% by year-end 2024. Although expect a step back in the first quarter due to expected seasonality (inaudible), I'm going to add in additional contributions from our redevelopment and expansion pipeline of $9 million to $12 million. For those modeling, let me direct you to our 8-K on Page 16, where we provide our forecast of stabilized POI and timing by project. Now this will be offset by modestly lower prior period collections expected to be roughly $3 million in 2024 versus $5 million in '23, modestly lower net term fees forecasted in the $4 million to $7 million range in '24 versus $7 million in '23 and a continued drag from higher money costs. The recent $600 million of notes that we repaid last month at an effective rate of 3.7% versus the new blended cost on our 2 most recent refinancing of 4.3%. Other assumptions include $100 million to $150 million of spend this year on redevelopment and expansions on our existing properties. G&A is forecast in the $48 million to $52 million range for the year and capitalized interest for 2024 is estimated at $18 million to $21 million. We've assumed a total credit reserve consisting of bad debt expense, unexpected vacancy incentive rent relief of 70 to 90 basis points for 2024, more in line with pre-pandemic historical averages. And as is our custom, this guidance does not reflect any acquisitions or dispositions in 2024. We will adjust likely upwards as we go, given our opportunistic approach to build. Quarterly FFO cadence for 2024 is forecast to have the first quarter being roughly in line with the fourth quarter of 2023 at a range of $1.60 to $1.65 and with sequential growth each quarter thereafter. We see the detailed summary of this guidance in our 8-K on Page 28 and in our presses. And with that, operator, please open the line for questions."", 'Operator', ""(Operator Instructions). And today's first question comes from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets."", 'Juan Carlos Sanabria', ""I was just hoping you, guys, could talk a little bit more about the office routine. It sounded like there was the fintech lease at Santana. Was there anything else in curious as to the momentum or prospects for signing other tenants there and how you think that evolves in '24."", 'Donald C. Wood', ""Yes. No, Juan. I tried to -- without mentioning a name, or getting myself in trouble, I try to indicate that there is a large tenant there that we are very close to lease signing on. The LOI is done. We're in the last stages of lease signing. I'm not going to name the tenant today, because you certainly will know them. And we would expect that lease, something dramatic goes on done very, very shortly from here on. That, along with that, for sure, and a couple of other smaller things, what gets us to that half done. On that building in Santana West. And similarly, very close to signing on a couple of deals here at Pike & Rose 950 Meeting, which would get that building to 80% leased. So it's been a very different last few months in terms of not just tours, but productivity in terms of turning LOIs into leases."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question today has from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.', 'Alexander David Goldfarb', ""Don, just going through the -- your tenancy, overall, it's a pretty good list in the top tenants, but obviously, there's some not rated, some not investment grade. But holistically, as you push the portfolio occupancy and really upgrade tenancy, are there types of tenants that you're seeing no to like, for example, the classic private equity, highly levered tenants, even if they're a great performer, you're saying, look, historically, these type of levered tenants are the ones that cause issues in the next downturn and therefore, even though they may be promising, let's try to limit exposure. Just trying to think what ways that as the portfolio becomes increasingly in demand that you may be gaining leverage to sort of push back on the types of tenants even if they're a great performer but just going, you know what, great performer, but not great balance sheet, we're going to pass."", 'Donald C. Wood', ""Yes, Alex, it's really a good question. I mean the bottom line is when you're trying to improve your portfolio, what you're effectively doing is taking all of that into consideration for not just next year or the year after that, but the term of the lease. So it includes the capital decisions that have to be made in terms of what's going in. I will tell you that to the extent a tenant, and this just I think, makes sense to you, the tenant that we like a lot but that has a riskier profile. To the extent we're limiting significantly the capital will give them a bit of a shock. To the extent we're investing in that piece of real estate in that particular space in there, then the better be credit, they're better be comfort, if you will, that we're going to get paid. We're very likely to pay to the entire term of the lease. So as I started out, I mean, this is a very good time for supply and demand dynamics. And what that means in the better properties is choice. And to the extent you have that choice, you absolutely consider things like leverage level, like what the owners are planning to do with the asset or with the retailers, et cetera. So it's a good time to be able to continue to upgrade the portfolio."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next in comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore. Please go ahead.', 'Stephen Thomas Sakwa', ""Don, I guess, just maybe following up on Alex's line of questioning. Just wanted to talk a little bit about pricing power. And given where the portfolio is and the potential uptick in occupancy, I guess how are you and Wendy and the team thinking about being able to push rents. And do you expect that to materially change in '24? Or is that a little bit longer term kind of runway just given that there's been no supply in the space and demand seems to be very tight at good centers."", 'Donald C. Wood', ""It does. It does, Steve. And look, at the end of the day, it's still a very local business, and you're having this conversation based on what the potential choice are for that particular piece of real estate, where I think the -- and I just believe this is the most important thing. It is in the contract itself. And so the leverage generally whether it comes out in better bumps. I mean you know how I feel about the bumps. That's a contractual increase in cash flow for a long period of time. Nothing beats that to me. That's the first thing. And the second thing is making sure that we have control of the space because the tenant wants control of the rest of that shopping center, not just the space but the shopping center. And so I do think we're making, and I've always kind of focused on this as a big thing for us to make sure that contract is as landlord-friendly as it could be. But those are places where we have made pretty strong strides in the last 18 months in particular for strong leases with big bumps. So that's where I look for it most. And that's an insurance policy to know that the foundation of this company the basic shopping centers throughout this company are really strong with rents that whether you believe it or not, are under market as proven by each quarter that we go through. Now you take that and you supplement that with things like the redevelopments that we're doing in places like Huntington, with a new residential project that we're doing at Bala Cynwyd, with potential stronger acquisition market as we move forward. That's where I get very excited and very positive about the future (inaudible)."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question today comes from Jeff Spector with Bank of America.', 'Jeffrey Alan Spector', ""Don, can you elaborate on your opening remarks comment on accretive acquisitions and opportunities? It seems like you're a bit more optimistic or maybe excited at some of the opportunities you're seeing. Is that correct? And if yes, is it certain regions, again, type of centers? I know we talk about this all the time, but I think it seemed like you specifically highlighted that in the opening remarks."", 'Donald C. Wood', ""Hi, Jeff, first of all, thanks for listening to the opening remarks. I appreciate that a ton. And yes, you are dead right in terms of where I see it. But let's -- let me turn it over to Jeff Berkes or Juan. Give us guys, give us your thoughts on that question?"", 'Jeffrey S. Berkes', ""Yes. Sure, Don. Hi, Jeff, it's Jeff Berkes. I'm here with Juan. He'll jump in a minute on what he's seeing kind of day-to-day in the market. But yes, you're right. We are looking forward to a good year in '24 for acquisitions. We didn't really see anything in '23 that excited us that much other than the opportunities we had to invest within our own portfolio at very accretive rates. But we think the market is starting to heal, and we expect '24 to be a better year or certainly a good year for us for acquisitions. And I know you know as well, and you probably know what I'm going to say, but keep in mind that, look, we've got a very compelling cost of capital. We are not constrained by any one sub product type within retail. We're format agnostic. We're more focused on location and opportunity with the piece of dirt than exactly the improvements that sit on it today. We have a really well-developed team here that looks at highest and best use and ways to add value through re-leasing, remerchandising and improving the existing improvements as well as knocking parts of the property down and going vertical and doing things like we're doing at Bala and other shopping centers in our portfolio where we add residential. We've got great relationships in the market. We're known as a closer, both with the sellers and the brokers. So I think we've got a lot of advantages and a really sort of a clear eye towards growing the company through accretive acquisitions that are going to deliver long-term growth. to the company, and we hope the markets respond, and I think they will. But let me turn it over to Jan and kind of let him give you his thoughts on what we're seeing in the market today."", 'Jan W. Sweetnam', ""Hi, Jeff, it's Jan. So a lot of sellers have really been sitting on the sideline, waiting for the cost of capital and cost of debt in their situation to kind of settle itself out and I think '23 was a record year for sellers asking brokers for their broker opinion of values. I mean it's just a massive BOB year and a supermajority of those sellers chose not to put their properties on the marketplace. And so now that cost of capital and cost of debt has started to settle on a lot. We're hearing a lot of rumbling about sellers now putting their properties on the market. And in areas and sometimes in some new markets that are of interest to us, that we think we're going to see. And so far, as we're looking through here in early February, it seems like there's going to be a lot more interesting product for us to look at and try to acquire. So to me, I think '24 is going to be a big year for us."", 'Jeffrey S. Berkes', ""Yes. Jeff, you've heard us talk about this in the past. We are very creative in how we structure deals. We have been for a very long time and good at figuring out ways to solve sellers' issues, particularly private sellers and older sellers that have owned the properties for a long time. So a lot of tools in the toolbox here at Federal, and we expect to be putting them to good use this year."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question today comes from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank.', 'Greg Michael McGinniss', ""So it was a great year overall for retail leasing. But Q4 leasing volumes fell about 25% compared to the first 3 quarters in 2023 and resi occupancy fell 190 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Could you just provide some details on the trends you're seeing in retail tenant demand, as well as what happened on the resi side and expectations built into 2024 guidance for resi occupancy and rent growth?"", 'Donald C. Wood', ""I have to ask you Daniel or somebody on occupancy for a second. Before you do, though, on the retail occupancy in the fourth quarter, Greg, that's just timing. There's nothing in there from a trend perspective that we feel any different about when, I know with a couple of particular anchors that are re-leased, that went out in the fourth quarter and again, re-leased good spreads going forward. But just timing in the quarter there. I don't know, Wendy, if there's more to say about that for Greg."", 'Wendy A. Seher', ""No. I think if you look at -- it's just timing is number one. And number two is our pipeline still remains strong. And when I look at where we are, specifically in small shop leasing, I do feel like there we have a runway there, probably another 100 basis points to grow off of. And also some of the timing is also attributed to several of the deals that we're doing on spaces that are already occupied. So there's some (inaudible) lot there."", 'Jeffrey S. Berkes', ""Yes. Let me -- Dan, go ahead on resi, if you want, but my comment, Greg, would be we have a couple of markets that are very seasonal, primarily out here in California and New England. So we do try and ramp up occupancy going into the slower winter season. So we can ride through first quarter of a little bit slower leasing in those seasonal markets and be in a position where we're not giving up a lot when the leasing season heats up again. So some of that's strategic in the way we build occupancy up in the prior quarter. But Dan, if you got more to add, please do so."", 'Daniel Guglielmone', ""Yes, that's exactly right. On the residential portfolio, seasonality is really what's driving that move. I mean, we're up year-over-year from an occupancy perspective, and we fully expect occupancy to pull back in the fourth quarter relative to -- due to that exact reason. And we have a small portfolio. I think that it only takes a handful of units to kind of move things a little bit. So I would not read anything into that at all."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question today comes from Craig Mailman with Citi.', 'Craig Allen Mailman', 'Maybe I just want to go back to the question about acquisitions. And it sounded like maybe there could be some [OP] unit deals in there. But could you just give us a sense of magnitude at this point, is it at the level where you would need to cap some of the equity in some of your trophy mixed-use projects? Or can you, guys, fund this with kind of current liquidity?', 'Donald C. Wood', ""That's a good question, Craig. The funding with the trophy assets at someone is something for the future. It's not something for today, given where the market stands and the appetite and kind of still the uncertainty on that stuff overseas in particular. With respect to boosting the acquisition portfolio now, that's what that line's for. So there's short-term financing, and then there will be long-term financing. But there's a reason that powder is dry. And we'd like to use it."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with Truist.', 'Ki Bin Kim', ""Don, can you just go back to some of the comments you made about the office leasing demand you're seeing at Santana West and 915 Meeting. Just curious if there's been any commonalities for why some of you see, I'm guessing as relocations moving to these centers. And for 915 Meeting, the NOI contributions, is it reasonable to expect that 50% contribution to be back-end weighted or more pro-rata?"", 'Daniel Guglielmone', 'Yes. Well, pro rata, I would say, effectively in terms of the contribution over the course of the year.', 'Donald C. Wood', ""And I got to tell you, Kim, the common thread through all of this is either it's funny, either relocations from downtowns to these mixed-use properties and both of them basically in the first ranked suburb or out further and coming in looking for the full amenities that these properties provide. And that's been so darn consistent over the past 3, 3.5, 4 years with respect to what's happening there, I don't see that stopping. It's -- the demands of these tenants who are generally taking less space than they had wherever they were West Coast, some kind of campus, the East Coast, these same type of things potentially. But they are taking less space, but they demand more in terms of the amenity base. And that is so consistent in basically the 3 places, the 3 big projects, whether it's same in Boston with respect to assembly. So that's the common threat."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question today comes from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan.', 'Michael William Mueller', ""I just have 2 quick development questions. I guess first for Bala Cynwyd. Is there any meaningful NOI that's coming out of the run rate, your 4Q NOI run rate? And then do you have a ballpark estimate of timing for the Santana office rent commencements?"", 'Daniel Guglielmone', ""Yes. On Bala, I don't think there's any material."", 'Donald C.

Obviously, congrats on, obviously, you haven't gotten over the line yet, but certainly got the first leases going there, both Santana West as well as in Pike & Rose. Are those leases in your guidance. And maybe you can talk about what is happening to the negotiations in terms of the rents there? And Jeff, maybe I'd look to -- because you're on the ground at Santana West, are you getting pushback from office tenants on rents or other things? Or is it just -- talk a little bit about the competitive situation and the balance between landlord and tenant because clearly, it's different in office than it is in retail."", 'Donald C. Wood', 'Go ahead, Jeff.', 'Jeffrey S. Berkes', ""Yes. I mean, I'm actually going to pass it to Jan. Floris Jan, handles all of our large office leasing. So let me turn it over to him."", 'Jan W. Sweetnam', ""Hi, Floris, I think just in terms of the rents, I would say 2 things, one of which is both at Pike & Rose and at Santana West here and also at assembly, really the tenants are looking for something, as Don said, they're looking for the amenities. They're looking for a better building. They're looking to upgrade their location. And so they have tended to be less price sensitive on rents. So rents feel like they're holding pretty well, but the tenant improvement packages have, in fact, gone up. So that's really the change that we've seen, and that's where the competitive piece comes in, but the rents have been really rock solid."", 'Jeffrey S. Berkes', ""And just, Floris, to remind you, and I think we've talked about this before and Don alluded to it in his earlier comments. Most of the tenants that are moving into our state-of-the-art buildings in those 3 locations are coming from inferior buildings where they take more space and they're downsizing. So while they may be paying a higher rent per foot in our buildings than they were paying, because they're taking less square footage, their overall occupancy costs are less, which again, goes to them not being as sensitive about rent. I think that's important to understand."", 'Operator', 'And our next question today comes from Dori Kesten with Wells Fargo.', 'Dori Lynn Kesten', 'Can you walk through your thought process behind the mortgage Bethesda Row and just addressing the size, maybe loan to value, why Bethesda specifically?', 'Daniel Guglielmone', ""Look, I think the debt markets have been extremely and interest rates have lacked direction to say the least. I think back in October when we committed to doing that transaction. The 10-year was at 5%. And the -- our stock was at $85, and we saw this as a unique opportunity for us to lock in a spread on a secured loan on one of our best properties and get attractive financing. The leverage is lower than we typically would. It's a little bit structured. But today, mortgage rates on retail product today at a normalized leverage level are probably 200 basis points over the treasury, probably 175 to 200 basis points on a floating rate basis above SOFR. We were able to get 95 basis points through the structuring that we did with our lender. We felt like that was a really, really attractive credit spread that was certainly more attractive than the 150 to 160 basis points we're looking at back in October to do a 5-year loan. And so it was just a, I think, a unique opportunistic financing. That really demonstrates Federal's historic ability to access different parts of the capital markets at more difficult times in the cycle. And I think that our access to the convertible market is another example of that. Don, did you want to add anything?"", 'Donald C. Wood', 'No, I wanted to ask you, Dan, too. I mean from a tax perspective, a tax basis perspective, putting $200 million on Bethesda Row, frees up some flexibility with respect to the tax planning. And so I think having the leverage on there, having dead on Bethesda, aware we created significant value over our ownership created a ton of value above where if we do want to bring a joint venture partner, this brings and gives us that optionality and that flexibility to do a tax efficient', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question today comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies.', 'Linda Tsai', ""I think you said earnings growth in '23 would have been 8%, absent higher money cost for level of earnings growth, does this mean for '24, if you look at it the same way."", 'Daniel Guglielmone', ""Well, 8%, we had significant headwinds, '27. We have less headwinds heading into 2024, although they're still there. I haven't done the calculation, but it's probably a couple of hundred basis points of incremental -- if you back out the cost of that. So the 3% probably goes up to something north of 5%, the less money cost, at least from my perspective. I haven't done the exact calculation, Linda, but that's roughly where I would see it."", 'Operator', 'And our next question today comes from Anthony Powell with Barclays.', 'Anthony Franklin Powell', ""I think in the prepared remarks, you talked about how construction costs were going lower, which helps with your decision to duty of Philadelphia residential. Can you maybe expand more on what's going on with construction costs and do more of your products and your future redevelopment pipeline look attractive given lower construction costs."", 'Donald C. Wood', ""That's a good question. When -- it's not dramatic in terms of a reduction in construction costs. I mean when you think about the components of it, particularly the labor component of it. When business slows down, as it obviously has in the past couple of years, you've got better leverage to get labor rates that makes some more sense. And when you compare that to really, gosh, the last 5 or 6 years, in particular, before that, it's a dramatic difference in terms of being able to forecast. And that's really the most important thing here is anytime you want to do redevelopment or development itself, it's about productivity of costs in addition to growth in the rent. So what's happening now is we're finding much better predictability in construction costs, primarily on the labor side. We're going to tie these (inaudible) things down to GMPs, maxim price contracts. And so when you're able to do that, then you can focus more on what the rent growth is, the timing does it make sense to do. In the case of Bala, it was really a case where supply and demand finally made some sense without new product being added in that particular section of the main line, which is very attractive. So we really liked that. Now we couldn't make sense of that a year ago or 2 years ago or 3 years ago. But we can make sense of it now. I would hope to see more of those possibilities going forward. And remember, this is land that Federal's owned for a very long time. And that gives a huge advantage because the land costs there aren't incremental land costs associated with it. So that's why that makes sense. So when you look at construction, I wouldn't look at it as you know, costs are going to be dramatically lower than they were, but they've certainly stabilized and coming down a few percentage points because of the labor side -- it's an important consideration when you're deciding where to go or not."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question today comes from Paulina Rojas-Schmidt with Green Street.', 'Paulina Alejandra Rojas-Schmidt', ""Dan, my question is related to the prior one. And you reported for the Bala project and ROIC [indiscernble]. And I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks the unlevered IRR as well. But more broadly speaking, what kind of profit margins you need to be in when thinking about this project to come to a new pool for the risk, whether it's cost or leasing?"", 'Daniel Guglielmone', 'Not quite following your question, Paulina. Are you asking kind of what kind of premium we need to get to kind of have those -- to have the IRRs get up until the double digits?', 'Paulina Alejandra Rojas-Schmidt', 'Yes. When you think about comparing your cap rate (inaudible).', 'Daniel Guglielmone', ""I think that developing this to developing this to a 7 is clearly higher than it would be in today's market. And as interest rates come down and stabilize, obviously, what we -- what the spread is well north of 100 basis points, 150, 200 basis points. And look, we are going to expect to be able to grow rents residentially in line with kind of what we've done in our residential portfolio, is amenitized. It's adjacent to great retail, and we've been able to grow rents very attractively over time. So as we grow rents, obviously, the POI is going to be a big driver of those unlevered returns as well. So those are the inputs that go in there. They get us very comfortable at a double-digit IRR unlevered is something that's achievable developing this to a 7 initially and having it grow from there."", 'Jeffrey S. Berkes', ""Dan, if I can just add on Paulina, it's Jeff. One thing to think about, too, as it relates to federal and the residential that we develop and we've got about a $900 million pipeline of projects in the design and entitlement phase right now is almost all of those are at places where we already operate residential property. That's the case at Bala, the case if we do anything of (inaudible) & Rose, Santana Row, Pike & Rose Assembly Row, other places in Montgomery County, Maryland, where we own real estate. So the risk adjusted return for us is really, really strong. We understand the rental market very well. We operate units where we're adding units. So we understand the operating costs very well. And as Don mentioned in the prior question when we contract for the construction, we're doing that with full construction drawings, great bid coverage and a guaranteed maximum price contract. So the risk-adjusted returns for us are exceptionally strong when we add residential to our portfolio."", 'Operator', 'And our next question today is from Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler.', 'Alexander David Goldfarb', ""Just -- going back to the Bethesda Row, I think you, guys, had spoken previously about possibly joint venturing that asset or maybe there was institutional interest. But I guess, bigger picture, historically, federal hasn't been a JV platform, but you talked about it with the potential on Bethesda. So in your view, Don, as you guys talk to joint venture capital, what's your appetite for shopping centers? And do they believe that truly this burgeoning growth that we all talk about will actually come to fruition? Or is there a view that the leases are so locked and in favor of the tenant that, yes, at some point, they can get good economics, but it may be a longer time line than they actually are willing to underwrite and invest. Just sort of curious what's going on in the private time as you talk to possible partners."", 'Donald C. Wood', ""Well, a couple of things, Alex. And Jeff, I'd love you to add after this if you need to. But first of all, don't use me as a proxy for what's happening among the private side in terms of their appetite because we have not seriously gone down the road with any of them in terms of serious negotiations because we don't believe this is the right time to effectively do a deal like that on the mixed-use assets. When we look at ourself and where we see the growth in the portfolio, I think I've said this for the last 4 or 5 quarters, our mixed-use stuff is outperforming the other stuff. And it's growing, and it's growing fast. So we'd like to get this stuff to have that trajectory continue. We'd like to see over the next year or 2 or 3, the capital markets solidify themselves. Obviously, we're just in the very early stages of figuring out what that means in terms of capital markets in the country. And so I don't have much more to add with respect to any specific. I don't know, Jeff, anything?"", 'Jeffrey S. Berkes', ""Yes. Don, I don't really have anything meaningful to add to that. Sorry."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question today comes from Steve Sakwa of Evercore.', 'Stephen Thomas Sakwa', 'Just wanted a quick follow-up maybe with Dan Guglielmone on the guidance. When you kind of look through the building blocks, just maybe help us think through which ones have kind of the most leverage maybe to the upside and the downside and maybe just a little bit more color on the POI growth ex prior period rents and term fees, is about 100 basis points slower around 3.25% versus the 4.3%. Maybe just kind of walk us through there. Is that really all kind of bad driven? Or is there something else kind of pulling that growth rate down?', 'Daniel Guglielmone', ""Yes. Look, it is guidance. And I think there are a lot of things that go into, in particular, that go into the FFO guidance. I mean, as it relates to specifically the comparable POI growth was 2.5% - 4%. We have occupancy levels and how aggressively and how quickly we can push levels up towards 93%. I think how much percentage rent can we continue to collect parking revenues and we control property level expenses the way we have, which has been a big help. Term fees, I guess, don't apply to that metric. But look, that's going to drive FFO although it won't necessarily drive the POI metric, excluding that. How quickly and how we can get development POI up. And I think one of the things that's going to be a big driver is look, we purposefully have $600 million of floating rate debt. How quickly SOFR comes down. I think we've been pretty conservative in terms of our assumptions for where interest rates will go. And so that's -- that will have an impact. And then I think what we've done an exceptional job at, which probably drives some of the POI growth is just getting tenants open sooner, keeping tenants in possession longer, keeping tenants in that we expected to leave. I think that's another driver. I think they all contribute throughout the range."", 'Operator', ""Thank you. And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Leah Brady for closing remarks."", 'Leah Andress Brady', 'We look forward to seeing many of you in the next few weeks.

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.', 'Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.', 'Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system\'s ""Value"" category. Stocks with both ""A"" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.', 'One stock to keep an eye on is The Gap (GPS). GPS is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), as well as a Value grade of A.', ""Investors should also recognize that GPS has a P/B ratio of 3.02. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks attractive against its industry's average P/B of 4.14. GPS's P/B has been as high as 3.31 and as low as 1.25, with a median of 1.73, over the past year."", ""Finally, our model also underscores that GPS has a P/CF ratio of 12.96. This figure highlights a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find firms that are undervalued when considering their impressive cash outlook. GPS's P/CF compares to its industry's average P/CF of 13.95. Over the past 52 weeks, GPS's P/CF has been as high as 15.37 and as low as 5.38, with a median of 8.28."", 'Investors could also keep in mind Tapestry (TPR), an Retail - Apparel and Shoes stock with a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and Value grade of A.', ""Tapestry is trading at a forward earnings multiple of 9.92 at the moment, with a PEG ratio of 0.86.

409,efc51671-a0a8-349b-88f5-0f7df14cb091,CSCO,2024-02-13,3 Cheap Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now,Motley Fool,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/efc51671-a0a8-349b-88f5-0f7df14cb091/3-cheap-tech-stocks-to-buy.html,1707758100,STORY,"['CSCO', 'IBM', 'T']","[""Many tech stocks soared over the past year as interest rates stabilized and investors eagerly rushed toward AI-related stocks in anticipation of a major AI boom. However, that buying frenzy also inflated some tech stocks' valuations to historical highs."", ""So for investors who are wary of buying the market's priciest tech stocks, it might be a good idea to look for the cheaper value plays that pay steady dividends instead. I believe three underappreciated blue chip stocks fit the bill: IBM (NYSE: IBM), AT&T (NYSE: T), and Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO)."", ""For years, IBM was considered dead money. From the first trading day of 2011 to 2021, the tech giant's stock declined 16% as the S&P 500 rallied 191%. It underperformed the market by such a wide margin because it struggled to grow its revenue and keep pace with the evolving cloud market. It divested some of its lower-margin businesses to generate fresh cash, but it repeatedly plowed most of that cash into wasteful buybacks instead of improving its core businesses."", ""But over the past three years, IBM's stock rallied 56% as its CEO Arvind Krishna -- who took the helm in 2020 -- executed an aggressive turnaround plan. It divested its slow-growth managed infrastructure services unit as Kyndryl, restructured its remaining businesses into three simpler units (software, consulting, and infrastructure), and expanded its higher-growth hybrid cloud and AI businesses with a goal of generating mid-single digit revenue growth again."", 'That strategy required IBM to expand Red Hat, which it acquired in 2019, with more open source software that could process the data between private and public clouds. That niche approach expanded its cloud ecosystem without going head-to-head against public cloud leaders like Amazon and Microsoft.', ""As a result, IBM's revenue grew 6% in 2022 and 2% in 2023, and analysts expect its revenue and adjusted EPS to rise 3% and 5%, respectively, in 2024. Those growth rates indicate that Big Blue's business is finally stabilizing -- but it still looks like a bargain at 18 times forward earnings, and it pays a high forward yield of 3.6%."", 'Like IBM, AT&T was once considered a dismal long-term investment. But in 2021 and 2022, it divested DirecTV and Time Warner and abandoned its ill-fated attempt to become a media superpower. After it streamlined its business, it focused on strengthening its core telecom business by upgrading its 5G and fiber networks.', 'That turnaround effort paid off. Its total number of wireless postpaid subscribers grew by 2.9 million in 2022 and 1.7 million in 2023, while the expansion of its fiber business offset the slower growth of its non-fiber broadband businesses. Its revenue rose 2% in 2022 (excluding the divestment of its U.S. video business) and grew 1% in 2023.', 'Analysts expect its revenue to rise 1% in 2024 and 2025. Those growth rates might seem anemic, but they indicate AT&T is becoming a stable blue chip investment again.', ""Meanwhile, AT&T's free cash flow (FCF) rose from $14.1 billion in 2022 to $16.8 billion in 2023, and it expects that figure to rise to $17-$18 billion in 2024. That healthy FCF growth should easily support its hefty forward dividend yield of 6.6%. Analysts expect its adjusted EPS to dip 8% in 2024 as it upgrades its networks, but they also anticipate 4% growth in 2025 as it laps those higher expenses. At seven times forward earnings, AT&T looks dirt cheap relative to those stable growth rates."", ""Cisco, the world's largest networking company, is often considered a safe blue-chip tech stock to hold through economic downturns. But over the past 12 months, its stock only rose 6% as investors fretted over its near-term slowdown."", ""Cisco's revenue only rose 3% in fiscal 2022 (which ended in July 2022) as its networking hardware business grappled with supply chain constraints. In fiscal 2023, its revenue jumped 11% as it overcame those constraints and finally satisfied the market's pent-up demand for new networking devices."", 'But for fiscal 2024, Cisco expects its revenue to dip 4%-6% with nearly flat EPS growth. That slowdown was caused by declining orders across the enterprise, service provider, and cloud markets. Many of those customers had overcompensated for the aforementioned supply chain constraints by ordering too much hardware in fiscal 2023, and they were now sitting on up to half a year of shipped orders that were still waiting to be deployed.', 'That situation might seem bleak, but Cisco has weathered plenty of cyclical downturns and supply gluts before. Analysts expect its revenue and adjusted EPS to rise again in fiscal 2025, and its stock still looks cheap at 13 times forward earnings with a forward yield of 3.1%. That low valuation and high yield could make it a good safe haven play in a choppy market.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?', 'Before you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and International Business Machines wasn’t one of them.

To that point, H&R Block is well positioned upon implementing artificial intelligence into its offerings and launching its AI Tax Assist at the beginning of the year to streamline the tax preparation process.', 'Overall, H&R Block’s annual earnings are now projected to rise 10% in fiscal 2024 and climb another 11% in FY25 to $4.69 per share. Plus, total sales are forecasted to be up 2% this year and rise another 2% in FY25 to $3.64 billion.', 'H&R Block’s price performance has roughly matched the S&P 500 over the last year rising +20% to easily top its Zacks Consumer Services-Miscellaneous Market’s +2%. More impressive, over the last three years, HRB shares have soared +139% to largely outperform the benchmark and its Zack Subindustry.', 'Furthermore, HRB shares still trade at 10.8X forward earnings which is a considerable discount to the S&P 500’s 21X and nicely beneath its Zacks Consumer Services-Miscellaneous industry average of 12X.', 'Adding more value to H&R Block’s stock is its 2.8% annual dividend yield in an industry where most companies don’t offer a payout to shareholders. It’s also noteworthy that this tops the S&P 500’s 1.32% average and H&R Block’s dividend has increased four times in the last five years. Better still, H&R Block’s payout ratio is only at 33% and suggests there is plenty of room for more dividend increases in the future.', 'H&R Block’s stock is starting to check the boxes heading into the busy tax season and in addition to its strong buy rating has an overall “A” VGM Zacks Style Scores grade for the combination of Value, Growth, and Momentum.', 'Providing snow and ice control equipment for work trucks, another milder-than-expected winter throughout the U.S. could lead to more downside for Douglas Dynamics stock with the spring approaching.', 'Landing a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and the Bear of the Day here is an overview of why investors may want to be cautious of Douglas Dynamics stock at the moment.', 'Douglas Dynamics is expected to post weaker Q4 results later in the month on Monday, February 26.

Overall, Douglas Dynamics is expected to round out fiscal 2023 with total sales falling -8% and EPS down -45% to $1.00 a share versus $1.84 per share in 2022."", ""Declining earnings estimates have correlated with Douglas Dynamics' stock plummeting -36% in the last year and now down -46% over the last three years."", ""Unfortunately, the trend of earnings estimate revisions has remained bleak.
