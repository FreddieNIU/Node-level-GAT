The Federal Reserve in the United States has signaled that it will start cutting interest rates in 2024 as inflation cools. This means that borrowing costs will decrease. This, in turn, will drive investments in growth stocks with explosive potential as investors start taking risks after nearly two years of practicing caution because of recession fears. The NASDAQ Composite, one of the benchmark growth indexes at the market, is already up more than 45% so far this year.\xa0', 'For those just getting started at the stock market, like 18 year olds with an eye for trading, it is important not just to identify good growth stocks but also potential opportunities in the value sector that balance the portfolio against risk. One of the easiest ways of doing this is to measure the moat of a publicly-traded firm. The wider the moat, the better financial standing of the firm. Moat is generally defined as a sustainable competitive advantage of a company that makes it hard for rivals to compete against it.\xa0', 'Some of the companies with the widest moat include Alphabet Inc.

Among the myriad investment options available, the allure of steady dividend payments stands out as a beacon of reliability and security. These payments represent a portion of a company's profits shared with its shareholders, presenting a consistent income stream. Research indicates that a significant trend among Americans is retiring earlier than they had initially intended, often driven by factors that lie beyond their control. Among the primary reasons cited for this early retirement are issues like deteriorating health conditions or unexpected job loss. In 2022, a Gallup survey highlighted that while the anticipated retirement age averaged around 66 years old, the reality showed a different trend, with individuals retiring at an average age of 62. This discrepancy between anticipated and actual retirement ages has persisted over the years, maintaining a consistent gap of approximately five years since 2002, as reported by Gallup."", 'According to a recent Goldman Sachs Retirement survey, respondents pointed out that certain things like having credit card debt, setting aside money for college, and taking care of or financially assisting family members had an impact on their capacity to save for retirement. This influence persisted despite better conditions in the economy and financial markets. Here are some comments from Chris Ceder, Senior Retirement Strategist at Goldman Sachs Asset Management:', '“The financial vortex threatens all Americans because, despite their best efforts to consistently save when employed, life’s unexpected bumps can meaningfully derail the best retirement savings plans. Only 36% of US workers have three months of income or more saved for emergencies. Unplanned and often unpredictable financial challenges push too many of us off track, and catching up may be difficult. Saving for retirement must remain a top priority.”', 'Amidst this landscape of uncertainty, income generated from dividend stocks serves as a valuable lifeline for retirees. Dividend-paying stocks have demonstrated their resilience and potential as a source of stability in investment portfolios. Over time, these stocks have proven to be reliable performers, often surpassing the broader market in terms of generating consistent returns. Since 1900, dividends have made up roughly 45% of all the gains seen in the S&P 500 Index.', 'In one of its reports, Thornburg Investment Management illustrated the contrast in income growth between bonds and dividend-paying stocks. The firm took a hypothetical $1 million investment from 1990 and calculated the annual income generated. Over the years, the income from bonds gradually decreased, while the dividend income from the equity investment consistently increased. Initially lower than the bond income, the dividend earnings exceeded bond income in about a decade and eventually reached 912% of the bond income by 2020.', 'Dividend growers are popular for an early retirement portfolio. These are companies known for consistently increasing their dividend payouts over time. Their attractiveness lies in their ability to potentially offer a reliable and growing stream of income, a crucial factor for individuals aiming to retire early. Earlier this year, I wrote an article on Early Retirement Portfolio: 15 Stocks to Live Off Dividends Revisited sourced from diverse user platforms.

Although social distancing has ended, work from home has managed to linger. Thus offices have been under pressure because they just aren't being used as much, meaning employers need less space."", ""That's a very real problem for traditional office landlords, but Alexandria owns medical research facilities.

The annualized rate of growth over those 10 years was roughly 7%, and the funds from operations (FFO) payout ratio was a very reasonable 55% in the third quarter. FFO is seen as a better reflection of a REIT's ability to generate cash than net income. Meanwhile, despite recent improvements in the share price, the 3.9% yield is toward the high end of the range over the past decade, suggesting the shares are still on sale."", ""Shares of industrial REIT Innovative Industrial are down more than 60% from their 2021 highs. A big part of that drop has come from the shift in investor perception about the marijuana sector, which was once favored but now is not. There's a good reason for that, since the pot market attracted a lot of early players and the weakest companies are now being wrung out of the system. That has forced Innovative Industrial to deal with some lessees that are in financial trouble. It has been selling assets, renting properties to new tenants, and renegotiating leases. These are all the things you would expect management to do. In the third quarter of 2023, the company collected 97% of the rent it was owed. That's not such a bad number."", ""What's notable is that marijuana grow houses, which is largely what Innovative Industrial owns, are not your typical industrial asset. Like medical research facilities, they are highly specialized. So there is material value in a property based on its zoning and grow-house specific features."", ""Despite the headwinds, the REIT's adjusted FFO payout ratio was 79% in the third quarter. That isn't exactly low, but it does offer a decent cushion against adversity. And, notably, Innovative Industrial has low leverage relative to the largest industrial and net-lease REITs. (Net leases, which are what the REIT favors, require tenants to pay for most property-level operating costs.)"", ""However, the really notable issue is the growth that's still expected in the pot sector as more states legalize the drug. Innovative expects legal marijuana sales to grow from $26 billion in 2022 to $43 billion in 2027, which is roughly an 11% compound annual growth rate. It is a key provider to the companies that will benefit, and thus seems highly likely to benefit along with them. There is risk here, of course, but the 7.2% dividend yield will likely attract a lot of investors. The dividend was increased again this month, marking the 15th increase since the company started paying a dividend in 2017."", ""At the end of the day, both Alexandria and Innovative Industrial are fairly unique REITs that have been caught up in sector sell-offs that aren't perhaps as meaningful to their businesses as investors seem to believe. Are there risks to monitor? Sure. But so far both are handling any adversity they have faced in relative stride, while still managing to reward investors with reliable dividends. As the REIT sector rebounds from a broad sell off, it would be a brilliant move to step back and reexamine these two laggards again."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Alexandria Real Estate Equities right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Alexandria Real Estate Equities, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alexandria Real Estate Equities wasn't one of them.

The most common one would be a basic 60/40 portfolio. A basic 60/40 portfolio would give 60% weightage to the S&P 500 and 40% weightage to US treasuries. Due to the low volatility of bonds, people with little financial knowledge could also go for a bond-heavy portfolio. Ray Dalio’s All Weather Portfolio follows a similar theme. 40% of the portfolio is represented by long-term US bonds, 30% by US stocks, 15% by intermediate US bonds, and 15% by commodities. According to Dalio, this portfolio performs well in all kinds of economic conditions. Over the last 30 years, it has grown at a compound annual rate of 7.19%.', 'During our research for set-it-and-forget-it stocks according to financial media, we also took a peek at public forums such as Reddit and Quora, where people had revealed their long-term portfolios.

Specifically, I am going to focus on the purest cases of financial intermediation in which we are invested: AerCap Holdings N.V. (NYSE:AER), ALD Automotive, Sun Hung Kai & Co and S&U.', 'Let us start with maturity mismatch, which is the first of the structural problems in banking. We own a stake in AerCap and ALD Automotive, two companies with very similar businesses in their essence. In short, these entities borrow money to acquire assets (aircraft and automobiles, respectively), lease them for a period of time (on average, seven and four years) and sell them at the end of their contract (in the case of AerCap, the longer useful life of its aircraft means that the contracts are usually renewed at maturity). If these companies were to operate like a bank, they would borrow at very short maturities and would have to continually roll over that financing to avoid falling into an unsustainable liquidity risk, should they have to repay their debt (their assets are leased). However, as we have already seen, operating with such a maturity mismatch would be a recipe for failure. In fact, Guinness Peat Aviation, the company that pioneered the aircraft leasing business in the 1970s and 1980s, ended up going bankrupt (among others), for over-reliance on short-term financing.32 A lesson never to be forgotten by Aengus Kelly, CEO of AerCap and the person who inherited the unloved assets of Guinness Peat Aviation after its sale to GECAS in 1996 (by a twist of fate, Kelly eventually acquired GECAS two years ago)…” (Click here to read the full text)', 'Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75', 'The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is an Ohio-based company that manufactures and markets fast-moving consumer goods.', 'According to Insider Monkey’s database that tracks 910 elite hedge funds, 75 funds had investments in The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)’s stock in the third quarter, compared to 74 in the previous quarter.

Proctor & Gamble is facing disruption from direct-to-consumer brands that offer their products for a fraction of the price.', 'But these companies are ~35% more expensive than US Treasuries, despite the heightened risk. On a risk-adjusted basis, one could argue the implied premium is even higher.', 'Perhaps the explanation is simply the price volatility difference between these stocks and treasuries over the last two years.

Around 2 million homeowners could not make their mortgage payments during the COVID-related lockdown. The challenges persist, particularly for low-income borrowers, as they struggle with the accumulated burden of mortgage payments. The impact of inflationary pressures on the US economy prompted the Federal Reserve to implement interest rate hikes, which also led to a rise in mortgage rates. While an official recession has not been declared, multiple factors indicate that the US economy is under strain. Persistent inflation, low employment rates, and an increase in household debt contribute to the economic stress. In addition to the rise in foreclosures, credit card delinquencies have also reached their highest levels since 2011.', 'The US foreclosure rate chart, released by property data provider ATTOM, indicated an overall increase in foreclosure filings during Q2 and Q3 as compared to 2022. In October 2023, one in every 4,051 housing units experienced a foreclosure filing. Among the states with the highest foreclosure rates, Delaware had one foreclosure filing in every 2,432 housing units, followed by Ohio with one in every 2,492 housing units, and New Jersey with one in every 2,550 housing units. With the average US home price ranging around $391,800, home ownership is becoming progressively difficult for both prospective and existing owners.', 'In October 2023, the number of housing units filing for foreclosure reached 34,472. This represented a 6.03% drop from the last month and a 6.47% rise from October 2022. Despite the slight economic upturn, many homeowners are still struggling to meet their mortgage obligations. Prospective homeowners are concerned with the question of whether foreclosures will increase in 2024. The outlook for 2024 suggests that it might be a better year for home purchases, particularly in certain regions. While overall home prices are expected to remain high, industry experts anticipate a decline in prices in specific areas of the country.

It comes in response to the age of the units, which went into service in 1959 and 1961, as well as changing energy economics that have made coal more expensive than other power sources.', 'Units 7 and 8, built in the mid-1960s, are set for retirement in late 2025, after which the plant will be demolished and the land turned to new uses.', ""Paul Spicer, senior vice president for energy generation at We Energies' parent company, WEC Energy Group, described Oak Creek as 1960s construction using 1950s technology. At over 60 years old, he said, the generating units are nearing the end of their useful life, and the cost of maintenance and complying with new air pollution rules make continuing to operate them cost prohibitive."", 'The shutdowns, originally scheduled to begin this year, were postponed for about a year due to concerns that regional electric generating capacity was inadequate to meet demand as utilities across the Midwest built new renewable energy resources to replace the coal plants that for generations had been the backbone of electricity production.', 'When the word came to the plant that We Energies would stick to its revised shutdown timeline, the initial reaction was, ""Oh, wow, here we go...,"" said Pat Lawlor, who, as Oak Creek\'s asset manager oversees the plant\'s operation. Lawlor previously was at We Energies\' Pleasant Prairie Power Plant when it was closed in 2018.', ""Inside the power plant, there's a steady hum of coal grinders, boilers, turbines and other massive equipment, all of which shows its age. Other than a modern control room, the plant has a decidedly analog feel - it's all needle gauges and hand cranked valves, and equipment designs that are very much of the time between the post-World War II era and the early Space Age."", '""All of these plants have a finite life,"" Lawlor said. ""And, and one of the lessons we learned at Pleasant Prairie was, the sooner we could start working on this, get everybody engaged, figure out all the different things that have to happen, the better for employees, the better for the company, the better for everybody.""', 'More: WEC moves up date to stop burning coal, reaffirms 2024 shutdown for first Oak Creek units', 'Inside the plant, everything looks static, belying the fact that the guts of the plant are in constant motion: conveyors bring coal inside, grinders pulverize it and send it to boiler furnaces where constantly circulating water becomes steam that spins turbines that, in turn, crank the generators that produce the electricity.', 'In the past, all that movement meant constant maintenance and a regular schedule of shutdowns of each unit for inspections, parts replacement and other upkeep.', 'Now, employees focus on the more immediate tasks of keeping each unit running productively and safely, Lawlor said.', '""This place is old, but it is safe,"" he said. ""Every machine out there is well understood and has intervals for maintenance, how many hours or calendar periods it might run between inspections, and so we had to figure out which ones are going to come due and is it necessary that we spend $2 million to open up a generator we\'re going to retire in six months,"" Lawlor said.', 'The actual shutdown, as Lawlor described it, is deceptively simple: shut down the conveyor that brings coal into the plant and, when the last of it has burned, shut off the power supply and the systems that support the units. Of course, it is more complicated than that. Water intakes from Lake Michigan, wastewater treatment and the conveyor system need to remain operational - they also serve Units 7 and 8 as well as the newer Elm Road Generating Station to the north.', ""And, even as they're planning for a future that will eliminate their jobs, Oak Creek's employees need to remain as focused on their work as they were before the shutdown was announced, Lawlor said."", '""Everybody that worked here was used to running this place full tilt and thought they were going to run it forever, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and then all of a sudden, it\'s, whoa, we\'re going to retire it,"" he said.', '""And we have to turn on a dime and respond to what\'s happening now and keep everybody engaged and keep everybody informed, letting everybody know why it\'s important what\'s going on. They have to be thoughtful about how they work here, and they have to really pay attention – it\'s critical safety work for themselves and for everyone else.""', ""Spicer said postponing the shutdown allowed the company and the employees' unions to fine-tune a plan it developed to move employees who want to stay with the company into new jobs at Elm Road Generating Station, the newer coal plant just north of Oak Creek, or in other We Energies operations. Severance and retirement packages are available for workers who are ready to move on."", 'About 150 people work at Oak Creek. They are represented by two unions: the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 2150 and International Union of Operating Engineers 420.', ""Local 2150 Business Manager James Meyer said there's still some nervousness, but the plan developed with the company ensures Oak Creek's shutdown won't result in layoffs."", '""We think in this particular case, everything is going to work out where nobody will be negatively impacted,"" he said. ""But looking to the future, as we close more and more of these plants down and transition to green energy that runs more efficiently and with less workers. It\'s obviously a concern that we want to make sure everybody has a place to go to.""', ""The company appears committed to that. In fact, We Energies is hiring new workers at Oak Creek even as the shutdown looms. The new hires will, at least initially work at the Elm Grove Generating Station, but they're part of a broader strategy to bring in new workers and train them in anticipation of retirements and future needs throughout the business, Lawlor said."", ""However, recruiting against the backdrop of a soon-to-close power plant and a renewable energy transition has been a challenge, said Mike Bruening, Local 2150's assistant business manager. In response, he said, recruiting pitches have focused on the wide and growing array of jobs for electricians, including construction, gas-powered plants, renewable energy sites and other work."", '""There\'s unending opportunities for these folks f they\'re willing to join us and come into work for We Energies,"" he said.', ""Closing Oak Creek won't spell the end of electric power generation - or a quick end to burning coal - on the 1,000-acre lakefront site."", 'The Elm Road Generating Station, which opened in 2010, will be converted from coal to natural gas over the next eight years.', 'We Energies says it expects to be using coal as a backup fuel only at the site by 2031 and to be coal-free by 2032.', 'Much of the post shutdown work that will need to be done before the Oak Creek Power Plant can be demolished will involve modifying shared systems like water intakes from Lake Michigan and the wastewater treatment and discharge system that Elm Road will continue to rely on.', 'One of the challenges will be transferring control of those systems from Oak Creek to Elm Road, Lawlor said.', '""We don\'t want to maintain these buildings and equipment forever once it\'s closed, so that\'s a big job because it\'s all kind of site integrated,"" he said.', 'Demolition of the power plant will open about 400 acres to redevelopment with new power sources that would use the existing substations and transmission lines, Spicer said.', ""He said it's too early to say what that future use of the land might entail."", ""WEC began moving away from coal with the conversion of We Energies' Port Washington Generating station to natural gas in 2008."", 'Subsequent reductions of coal use have included:', ""We Energies' Valley Power Plant in Milwaukee was converted to natural gas in 2015."", 'Pulliam Power Plant in Green Bay, operated by WEC subsidiary Wisconsin Public Service Corp., was shut down in 2018 and demolished.', ""Unit 4 at Edgewater Generating Station in Sheboygan was retired in 2018. The Edgewater station is owned by Alliant Energy, WPS owned about one-third of Unit 4's capacity."", 'We Energies closed the Pleasant Prairie Power Plant in 2018.', 'We Energies closed its Presque Isle Power Plant in Marquette, Michigan in 2019, and construction of new gas-fired units.', 'To become coal-free by 2032, WEC also will shut down Columbia Energy Center near Portage, jointly owned by WPS, Alliant and Madison Gas and Electric Co., in 2026, and a coal-burning unit at the Weston Power Plant in 2031. Like the Elm Road Generating Station in Oak Creek another coal-fired generating unit at Weston will be converted to natural gas.', 'In all, the planned retirements will eliminate about 1,700 megawatts of coal-powered generating capacity - an amount that can power about 1.5 million homes. Oak Creek represents about two-thirds of that total.', 'That capacity will be replaced by solar, wind, battery and natural gas power sources, including about 600 megawatts of solar power that will come online in 2024 from Paris Solar-Battery Park in Kenosha County, Badger Hollow Solar Park in Iowa County and Darien Solar Energy Center in Walworth and Rock Counties.', ""The transition is expected to accelerate under WEC Energy Group's recently updated five-year plan. It includes $6.8 billion in spending starting in 2024 to expand its renewable energy generating capacity and battery storage, and another $1.5 billion in spending on natural gas-powered generation."", ""The company has said its investment in smaller, on-demand natural gas sites is needed to create a reliable backup system that will allow We Energies and WPS to meet customers' power needs at times when wind and solar resources are not operating at capacity or when demand for electricity spikes."", 'Those gas-powered generators in the future would be switched to hydrogen or biofuels, assuring they will continue to be useful for decades, Spicer said.', 'WEC estimates its transition to renewables will, over time, produce $2 billion in customer saving compared to sticking with the status quo.', 'While Oak Creek is at or near the end of its useful life, its retirement is still coming sooner than anyone would have expected a decade ago.', 'Dramatic decreases in the cost of wind, solar and battery power, as well as reduced natural gas prices, have made coal more expensive than the alternatives.', 'The switch will yield long-term customer savings in the billions of dollars, but in the short term it means a ""double whammy"" for rate payers who must cover the cost of building new power sources as well as that of shutting down the coal plants, said Tom Content, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board of Wisconsin.', 'Those shutdown costs include hundreds of millions of dollars of investments in pollution controls in the past decade or so that have not been fully paid for.', ""We Energies' next rate case, to be filed with the PSC in spring, is expected to be a test of how well utility customers can be protected from some of those costs. The company still owes $656 million on the Oak Creek power plant, including $407 million related to pollution-control equipment."", 'Consumer advocates and industry groups are eyeing a debt refinancing tool known as securitization as a way to take some of those costs, specifically the nearly 10% profit that the utilities are allowed to earn on their investments, out of the rate equation.', 'Securitization involves converting the existing debt to state-backed environmental trust bonds. It was previously used to refinance $100 million of pollution-control debt at Pleasant Prairie, resulting in an estimated $40 million in customer savings over 15 years.', 'More: Consumer groups, lawmakers seek to reduce impact of $2 billion cost of closing Wisconsin coal plants', 'How much of the Oak Creek might be eligible for refinancing is a moving target.', ""In 2022 the PSC rejected a proposed rate settlement that would have refinanced $100 million, with a majority of commissioners questioning why the number wasn't larger. During utility rate hearings this year, the commissioners sent a clear signal to the companies that they will be looking for proposals to reduce customer costs related to coal plant retirements."", ""However, it's up to the utilities, under state law, to decide whether to pursue securitization and, if so, how much would be refinanced. As PSC Chairwoman Rebecca Cameron Valcq pointed out during Alliant Energy's recent rate case, the law does not empower the commission to require refinancing."", '""All of the noise about requiring them to securitize, requiring them to use environmental trust financing, all that time and energy, in my opinion, would be better utilized, lobbying for changes to the statute, because we\'re not within our authority to order securitization,"" she said at the time.', 'That lobbying effort is now taking place in Madison on a bill co-sponsored by state Sens. Robert Cowles, R-Green Bay, and Duey Stroebel, R-Saukville. The bill would give the PSC authority to order securitization, while also expand its use to all costs associated with retiring a coal plant - not just the pollution controls.', 'Supporters of the bill include CUB, Clean Wisconsin, the Wisconsin Industrial Energy Group and Americans for Prosperity.', ""The state's investor-owned utilities have lined up in opposition to the bill through their lobbying entity, the Wisconsin Utilities Association."", 'Bill Skewes, executive director of WUA, said the bill is at odds with the initial intent of using securitization ""to give utilities another tool to use, not as a way for regulators to control them.""', '""When you take the planning and financing out of the hands of the utilities, it ties their hands from making the best decisions in real time for their customers,"" he said.', ""Spicer, of WEC, said it would be premature for the company to discuss whether securitization would be part of We Energies' 2024 rate proposal."", ""This article originally appeared on Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: We Energies will start to close Oak Creek Coal Plant in May. Here's what's involved.""]"

It comes in response to the age of the units, which went into service in 1959 and 1961, as well as changing energy economics that have made coal more expensive than other power sources.', 'Units 7 and 8, built in the mid-1960s, are set for retirement in late 2025, after which the plant will be demolished and the land turned to new uses.', ""Paul Spicer, senior vice president for energy generation at We Energies' parent company, WEC Energy Group, described Oak Creek as 1960s construction using 1950s technology. At over 60 years old, he said, the generating units are nearing the end of their useful life, and the cost of maintenance and complying with new air pollution rules make continuing to operate them cost prohibitive."", 'The shutdowns, originally scheduled to begin this year, were postponed for about a year due to concerns that regional electric generating capacity was inadequate to meet demand as utilities across the Midwest built new renewable energy resources to replace the coal plants that for generations had been the backbone of electricity production.', 'When the word came to the plant that We Energies would stick to its revised shutdown timeline, the initial reaction was, ""Oh, wow, here we go...,"" said Pat Lawlor, who, as Oak Creek\'s asset manager oversees the plant\'s operation. Lawlor previously was at We Energies\' Pleasant Prairie Power Plant when it was closed in 2018.', ""Inside the power plant, there's a steady hum of coal grinders, boilers, turbines and other massive equipment, all of which shows its age. Other than a modern control room, the plant has a decidedly analog feel - it's all needle gauges and hand cranked valves, and equipment designs that are very much of the time between the post-World War II era and the early Space Age."", '""All of these plants have a finite life,"" Lawlor said. ""And, and one of the lessons we learned at Pleasant Prairie was, the sooner we could start working on this, get everybody engaged, figure out all the different things that have to happen, the better for employees, the better for the company, the better for everybody.""', 'More: WEC moves up date to stop burning coal, reaffirms 2024 shutdown for first Oak Creek units', 'Inside the plant, everything looks static, belying the fact that the guts of the plant are in constant motion: conveyors bring coal inside, grinders pulverize it and send it to boiler furnaces where constantly circulating water becomes steam that spins turbines that, in turn, crank the generators that produce the electricity.', 'In the past, all that movement meant constant maintenance and a regular schedule of shutdowns of each unit for inspections, parts replacement and other upkeep.', 'Now, employees focus on the more immediate tasks of keeping each unit running productively and safely, Lawlor said.', '""This place is old, but it is safe,"" he said. ""Every machine out there is well understood and has intervals for maintenance, how many hours or calendar periods it might run between inspections, and so we had to figure out which ones are going to come due and is it necessary that we spend $2 million to open up a generator we\'re going to retire in six months,"" Lawlor said.', 'The actual shutdown, as Lawlor described it, is deceptively simple: shut down the conveyor that brings coal into the plant and, when the last of it has burned, shut off the power supply and the systems that support the units. Of course, it is more complicated than that. Water intakes from Lake Michigan, wastewater treatment and the conveyor system need to remain operational - they also serve Units 7 and 8 as well as the newer Elm Road Generating Station to the north.', ""And, even as they're planning for a future that will eliminate their jobs, Oak Creek's employees need to remain as focused on their work as they were before the shutdown was announced, Lawlor said."", '""Everybody that worked here was used to running this place full tilt and thought they were going to run it forever, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and then all of a sudden, it\'s, whoa, we\'re going to retire it,"" he said.', '""And we have to turn on a dime and respond to what\'s happening now and keep everybody engaged and keep everybody informed, letting everybody know why it\'s important what\'s going on. They have to be thoughtful about how they work here, and they have to really pay attention – it\'s critical safety work for themselves and for everyone else.""', ""Spicer said postponing the shutdown allowed the company and the employees' unions to fine-tune a plan it developed to move employees who want to stay with the company into new jobs at Elm Road Generating Station, the newer coal plant just north of Oak Creek, or in other We Energies operations. Severance and retirement packages are available for workers who are ready to move on."", 'About 150 people work at Oak Creek. They are represented by two unions: the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 2150 and International Union of Operating Engineers 420.', ""Local 2150 Business Manager James Meyer said there's still some nervousness, but the plan developed with the company ensures Oak Creek's shutdown won't result in layoffs."", '""We think in this particular case, everything is going to work out where nobody will be negatively impacted,"" he said. ""But looking to the future, as we close more and more of these plants down and transition to green energy that runs more efficiently and with less workers. It\'s obviously a concern that we want to make sure everybody has a place to go to.""', ""The company appears committed to that. In fact, We Energies is hiring new workers at Oak Creek even as the shutdown looms. The new hires will, at least initially work at the Elm Grove Generating Station, but they're part of a broader strategy to bring in new workers and train them in anticipation of retirements and future needs throughout the business, Lawlor said."", ""However, recruiting against the backdrop of a soon-to-close power plant and a renewable energy transition has been a challenge, said Mike Bruening, Local 2150's assistant business manager. In response, he said, recruiting pitches have focused on the wide and growing array of jobs for electricians, including construction, gas-powered plants, renewable energy sites and other work."", '""There\'s unending opportunities for these folks f they\'re willing to join us and come into work for We Energies,"" he said.', ""Closing Oak Creek won't spell the end of electric power generation - or a quick end to burning coal - on the 1,000-acre lakefront site."", 'The Elm Road Generating Station, which opened in 2010, will be converted from coal to natural gas over the next eight years.', 'We Energies says it expects to be using coal as a backup fuel only at the site by 2031 and to be coal-free by 2032.', 'Much of the post shutdown work that will need to be done before the Oak Creek Power Plant can be demolished will involve modifying shared systems like water intakes from Lake Michigan and the wastewater treatment and discharge system that Elm Road will continue to rely on.', 'One of the challenges will be transferring control of those systems from Oak Creek to Elm Road, Lawlor said.', '""We don\'t want to maintain these buildings and equipment forever once it\'s closed, so that\'s a big job because it\'s all kind of site integrated,"" he said.', 'Demolition of the power plant will open about 400 acres to redevelopment with new power sources that would use the existing substations and transmission lines, Spicer said.', ""He said it's too early to say what that future use of the land might entail."", ""WEC began moving away from coal with the conversion of We Energies' Port Washington Generating station to natural gas in 2008."", 'Subsequent reductions of coal use have included:', ""We Energies' Valley Power Plant in Milwaukee was converted to natural gas in 2015."", 'Pulliam Power Plant in Green Bay, operated by WEC subsidiary Wisconsin Public Service Corp., was shut down in 2018 and demolished.', ""Unit 4 at Edgewater Generating Station in Sheboygan was retired in 2018. The Edgewater station is owned by Alliant Energy, WPS owned about one-third of Unit 4's capacity."", 'We Energies closed the Pleasant Prairie Power Plant in 2018.', 'We Energies closed its Presque Isle Power Plant in Marquette, Michigan in 2019, and construction of new gas-fired units.', 'To become coal-free by 2032, WEC also will shut down Columbia Energy Center near Portage, jointly owned by WPS, Alliant and Madison Gas and Electric Co., in 2026, and a coal-burning unit at the Weston Power Plant in 2031. Like the Elm Road Generating Station in Oak Creek another coal-fired generating unit at Weston will be converted to natural gas.', 'In all, the planned retirements will eliminate about 1,700 megawatts of coal-powered generating capacity - an amount that can power about 1.5 million homes. Oak Creek represents about two-thirds of that total.', 'That capacity will be replaced by solar, wind, battery and natural gas power sources, including about 600 megawatts of solar power that will come online in 2024 from Paris Solar-Battery Park in Kenosha County, Badger Hollow Solar Park in Iowa County and Darien Solar Energy Center in Walworth and Rock Counties.', ""The transition is expected to accelerate under WEC Energy Group's recently updated five-year plan. It includes $6.8 billion in spending starting in 2024 to expand its renewable energy generating capacity and battery storage, and another $1.5 billion in spending on natural gas-powered generation."", ""The company has said its investment in smaller, on-demand natural gas sites is needed to create a reliable backup system that will allow We Energies and WPS to meet customers' power needs at times when wind and solar resources are not operating at capacity or when demand for electricity spikes."", 'Those gas-powered generators in the future would be switched to hydrogen or biofuels, assuring they will continue to be useful for decades, Spicer said.', 'WEC estimates its transition to renewables will, over time, produce $2 billion in customer saving compared to sticking with the status quo.', 'While Oak Creek is at or near the end of its useful life, its retirement is still coming sooner than anyone would have expected a decade ago.', 'Dramatic decreases in the cost of wind, solar and battery power, as well as reduced natural gas prices, have made coal more expensive than the alternatives.', 'The switch will yield long-term customer savings in the billions of dollars, but in the short term it means a ""double whammy"" for rate payers who must cover the cost of building new power sources as well as that of shutting down the coal plants, said Tom Content, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board of Wisconsin.', 'Those shutdown costs include hundreds of millions of dollars of investments in pollution controls in the past decade or so that have not been fully paid for.', ""We Energies' next rate case, to be filed with the PSC in spring, is expected to be a test of how well utility customers can be protected from some of those costs. The company still owes $656 million on the Oak Creek power plant, including $407 million related to pollution-control equipment."", 'Consumer advocates and industry groups are eyeing a debt refinancing tool known as securitization as a way to take some of those costs, specifically the nearly 10% profit that the utilities are allowed to earn on their investments, out of the rate equation.', 'Securitization involves converting the existing debt to state-backed environmental trust bonds. It was previously used to refinance $100 million of pollution-control debt at Pleasant Prairie, resulting in an estimated $40 million in customer savings over 15 years.', 'More: Consumer groups, lawmakers seek to reduce impact of $2 billion cost of closing Wisconsin coal plants', 'How much of the Oak Creek might be eligible for refinancing is a moving target.', ""In 2022 the PSC rejected a proposed rate settlement that would have refinanced $100 million, with a majority of commissioners questioning why the number wasn't larger. During utility rate hearings this year, the commissioners sent a clear signal to the companies that they will be looking for proposals to reduce customer costs related to coal plant retirements."", ""However, it's up to the utilities, under state law, to decide whether to pursue securitization and, if so, how much would be refinanced. As PSC Chairwoman Rebecca Cameron Valcq pointed out during Alliant Energy's recent rate case, the law does not empower the commission to require refinancing."", '""All of the noise about requiring them to securitize, requiring them to use environmental trust financing, all that time and energy, in my opinion, would be better utilized, lobbying for changes to the statute, because we\'re not within our authority to order securitization,"" she said at the time.', 'That lobbying effort is now taking place in Madison on a bill co-sponsored by state Sens. Robert Cowles, R-Green Bay, and Duey Stroebel, R-Saukville. The bill would give the PSC authority to order securitization, while also expand its use to all costs associated with retiring a coal plant - not just the pollution controls.', 'Supporters of the bill include CUB, Clean Wisconsin, the Wisconsin Industrial Energy Group and Americans for Prosperity.', ""The state's investor-owned utilities have lined up in opposition to the bill through their lobbying entity, the Wisconsin Utilities Association."", 'Bill Skewes, executive director of WUA, said the bill is at odds with the initial intent of using securitization ""to give utilities another tool to use, not as a way for regulators to control them.""', '""When you take the planning and financing out of the hands of the utilities, it ties their hands from making the best decisions in real time for their customers,"" he said.', ""Spicer, of WEC, said it would be premature for the company to discuss whether securitization would be part of We Energies' 2024 rate proposal."", ""This article originally appeared on Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: We Energies will start to close Oak Creek Coal Plant in May. Here's what's involved.""]"

Also, shipment delays and lagging orders have been worrisome for the segment.\xa0 Higher-than-expected transformation costs, a slowdown in the U.S. economy, geopolitical instability and labor-productivity challenges are likely to impact Barnes’ performance in the near term.In the third quarter of 2023, the Aerospace segment’s adjusted operating margin declined 380 basis points year over year due to long-term intangible amortization from the MB Aerospace acquisition and lower productivity.Increasing Costs: The escalating cost of sales poses a threat to B’s bottom line. Barnes’ cost of sales in the first nine months of 2023 increased 12.1% year over year. High raw material costs are pushing up the cost of sales. Selling and administrative expenses also rose 24.3% in the same period. Escalating costs, if unchecked, can be detrimental to Barnes’ margins and profitability.Steep Interest Expenses: Increasing interest expenses are worrisome for the company. In the third quarter, Barnes’ interest expense was $22.8 million compared with $3.4 million in the year-ago period. The increase was due to the MB Aerospace acquisition.

Increased consumption of media, music and news over the web, triggered by the work-and-learn-at-home wave, has been a key catalyst for industry participants like Warner Music Group WMG, News Corporation NWSA, Lions Gate Entertainment (LGF.A) and IMAX Corporation IMAX. Companies have been focusing on a superior product strategy and prudent capital investments. Steady recovery in the advertising spending environment and resumption of production pipelines bode well for film and television production companies.', 'Industry Description', 'The Zacks Film and Television Production and Distribution industry comprises companies involved in film and TV production, distribution and exhibition. The main activities of the industry participants include the production and distribution of entertainment content to theaters, TV networks, video-on-demand platforms, streaming services and other exhibitors.

However, streaming companies are increasingly producing original and award-winning feeds to reduce licensing costs and excessive dependence on third-party content providers. This is likely to hurt industry participants’ content distribution strategy.', 'Binge-Watching Drives Consumption: Factors such as binge-watching, deepening Internet penetration, and advancement in mobile, video and wireless technologies have got viewers glued to small screens. In order to keep pace with new consumption patterns, industry participants are turning to digital content distribution. The emergence of digital capabilities is making consumer data easily available to companies. With the use of AI tools, production houses are gaining a better understanding of user preferences. This helps them produce content that strikes a chord with viewers. However, increasing spending on content and sales & marketing is hurting profitability due to stiff competition from streaming players.', 'Technological Advancement Aids Prospects: Exhibitors are turning to highly efficient and cost-effective technologies like laser-based projection systems to enhance image quality and the entire movie experience. Additionally, the use of technologies like motion seating, immersive audio systems and interactive movies, among others, is expected to enhance the viewing experience. The increasing adoption of AR and VR technologies bodes well for industry participants. However, the evolution of alternative motion picture distribution channels, such as home video, pay-per-view, streaming services, video-on-demand, Internet and syndicated and broadcast television, is hurting exhibitors.', 'Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright Prospects', 'The Zacks Film and Television Production and Distribution industry is housed within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector.

We own a stake in AerCap and ALD Automotive, two companies with very similar businesses in their essence. In short, these entities borrow money to acquire assets (aircraft and automobiles, respectively), lease them for a period of time (on average, seven and four years) and sell them at the end of their contract (in the case of AerCap, the longer useful life of its aircraft means that the contracts are usually renewed at maturity). If these companies were to operate like a bank, they would borrow at very short maturities and would have to continually roll over that financing to avoid falling into an unsustainable liquidity risk, should they have to repay their debt (their assets are leased). However, as we have already seen, operating with such a maturity mismatch would be a recipe for failure. In fact, Guinness Peat Aviation, the company that pioneered the aircraft leasing business in the 1970s and 1980s, ended up going bankrupt (among others), for over-reliance on short-term financing.32 A lesson never to be forgotten by Aengus Kelly, CEO of AerCap and the person who inherited the unloved assets of Guinness Peat Aviation after its sale to GECAS in 1996 (by a twist of fate, Kelly eventually acquired GECAS two years ago)…” (Click here to read the full text)', 'Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75', 'The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is an Ohio-based company that manufactures and markets fast-moving consumer goods.', 'According to Insider Monkey’s database that tracks 910 elite hedge funds, 75 funds had investments in The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)’s stock in the third quarter, compared to 74 in the previous quarter.

To skip our detailed analysis of the healthcare sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Hot Healthcare Stocks To Buy Now.', ""Healthcare is a vital part of daily living for everyone, whether it be to cure an illness or to ensure that you stay healthy through prompt checkups and consistent care for yourself. As a result, healthcare companies are among those that remain ever popular among investors and consumers alike because they are the type to never go out of fashion since we will always need medical care. However, in today's tech-dominated market, many investors may be concerned about the prospects for other sectors, including healthcare, and their performance through the end of the year and into 2024."", ""On November 30, CNBC's Jim Cramer discussed his opinions on the healthcare sector on 'Mad Money,' most notably about what is holding the healthcare sector back and how one can navigate a tech-dominated market. Here are some of his comments:"", '""First, we are talking about a whole sector that\'s in the crosshairs of the US government because we\'re headed into an election year. The entire election may actually hinge on the cost of things going too high, even as it is going lower according to all indicators. Of course, if you\'re going lower from a much higher base than pre-pandemic, and lower inflation simply means that price are rising more slowly, they\'re not falling, it won\'t cut it. And that make\'s healthcare a natural whipping boy for the government.""', ""So, according to Cramer, one factor holding back the healthcare sector today is the involvement of the government in the sector in preparation for the upcoming elections in the US. A CNBC article from December 7 highlighted how President Biden's administration had seized the patents of several costly medications to ramp up its efforts to slash drug prices and promote competition in the pharmaceutical industry as well. Biden has also been working on making lower drug prices a pillar of his healthcare agenda and reelection strategy. Such a move thus serves as a good example of the government involvement in the healthcare sector noted by Cramer. An implication of such a move by the Biden administration can be the slowdown in the healthcare sector."", ""Another trend Cramer noted that somewhat explains the healthcare sector slowdown is the fact that many people today are continuing to hold back when it comes to going for non-urgent surgeries. Here's what Cramer had to say on this and how that impacts medical device companies in the healthcare sector:"", '""Finally, the medical device business... crushed during COVID when people decided to hold of on all sorts of non-urgent surgeries. The strangest thing is, they\'re still holding off. The numbers never come back. Very hard to figure. Whatever the case, the healthcare group seems a pretty unlikely candidate to help the bullish cause.""', ""Despite the above, the fact that technology today is continuing to evolve and expand its horizons means that other sectors, like healthcare, will also benefit instead of just being overshadowed by a massive tech rally in the market. On November 30, Robert Garrett, the CEO of Hackensack Meridian Health, joined CNBC to discuss the impact of artificial intelligence (AI), in particular, on the healthcare sector. Here's what he had to say:"", '""I see AI as the most profound technology in the world today. If you think about it from a healthcare perspective, whether it\'s helping doctors diagnose disease earlier, helping more people enroll in clinical trials, there\'s no question that AI can improve healthcare in remarkable ways.""', 'In light of the above, despite the current slowdown in the healthcare sector, investors can treat this as a moment to consider some hot healthcare stocks to buy now as plausible additions to their portfolios since tech like AI is bound to rapidly improve healthcare companies and their products. The present slowdown can be seen as an opportunity to buy stocks like Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) before they blow up after incorporating advanced technology in their operations and products.

This describes the way companies use data tracking by targeting ads, products, sales, and services for each customer.', 'As a broad example, when you see an ad on your social media feed for a product you’ve been thinking about buying, it isn’t listening in on your microphone. Instead, it’s using your search trends and digital footprint to develop a virtual “you” avatar that accurately predicts the products you like.', 'Since we increasingly opt-in to data collection, usually sold via rewards programs and similar incentives, we fork over our personal data and information in exchange for customized benefits.

This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward.

It went public five years later in 2002 with a market valuation of $309 million. The company is now worth $215 billion on the back of its world-leading streaming platform.', 'Investors who bought Netflix stock at its initial public offering (IPO) and held until now would be sitting on a gain of 45,332%. In other words, a mere $2,210 invested in 2002 would be worth more than $1 million today!', 'In fact, Netflix has created so much value that management has opted for two stock splits -- one in 2004, and another in 2015 -- to ensure the stock remained accessible to smaller investors.', 'The Netflix story is legendary. In 1997, its founders wanted to disrupt the video rental industry by mailing movies to customers in DVD format. The widespread adoption of the internet enabled customers to order online, so they no longer had to visit brick-and-mortar stores like Blockbuster.', 'But disaster struck in 2000 when the dot-com bubble burst, sending the technology sector plunging. It sank hundreds of early stage start-ups, and Netflix was still a private company, so it was incredibly hard for it to access funding.', 'Its founders approached Blockbuster and offered to sell Netflix for $50 million -- a deal which Blockbuster famously rejected.', 'Netflix pulled through the crisis, and its service continued to gather momentum. By 2007, it was leaning on the internet even further by offering customers a streaming service, which eliminated the need for DVD discs entirely.', ""It was a game changer, and it laid the groundwork for what Netflix is today: The world's largest streaming platform, with 247 million subscribers. Blockbuster, on the other hand, declared bankruptcy in 2010."", 'Netflix has faced slowing subscriber growth over the last couple of years. Most people who are likely to use Netflix have already joined, so the company has to work a little harder to grow its addressable market.', ""It has cracked down on password sharing to monetize the estimated 100 million households around the world that are using Netflix for free through a friend or family member's account. Now, paying account holders can add additional members for just $7.99 per month -- while it's much less than the $22.99 per month for the Premium tier, it's better than making no money at all."", ""Netflix also launched a new $6.99-per-month tier supported by advertising, which is designed to capture lower-income households. Management says the ad tier already generates the same amount of revenue per subscriber as the Standard tier, which is $15.49 per month -- so while it's cheaper at face value, advertising is contributing a significant amount of revenue."", 'The combination of the ad tier and the crackdown on password sharing has driven an acceleration in subscriber growth. In the 2023 third quarter (ended Sept. 30), subscribers grew by 10.8% year over year, which was the first double-digit percentage increase since early 2021.', 'With 2023 almost in the books, Netflix is on track to deliver $33.5 billion in revenue for the year. That will mark a 220-fold increase from its IPO year in 2002, when it generated $152 million.', ""But Netflix's bottom line is the real story. In 2022, Netflix delivered $4.5 billion in net income, which translated to $9.95 in earnings per share. That's on track to grow by 10.8% in 2023 to $11.03 per share. But Wall Street forecasts $14.41 in earnings in 2024, which means growth could accelerate to 30.6%."", ""Netflix faces growing competition with at least 61 other streaming platforms boasting 1 million subscribers or more, but it remains the only major stand-alone provider generating a consistent profit.

While it will move Disney+ closer to profitability, the platform might become less appealing to members for a lack of new shows and movies.', ""To be frank, the best gains in Netflix stock are in the rear-view mirror. It's unlikely $2,210 invested today will grow into $1 million over the next 21 years, the same way it did over the last 21 years."", ""The larger Netflix gets, the harder it is to maintain the same levels of growth. That doesn't mean the company can't mint new millionaires over the long term, but investors will likely have to outlay a larger sum of money to start with."", ""For example, a $200,000 investment could become $1 million over the next 20 years if Netflix grows its annual revenue by 8.4% per year and maintains its current price-to-sales valuation. It's certainly possible, given that Netflix has grown its revenue at a compounded annual rate of 29.3% since 2002 -- although it is currently growing well below that long-term trend."", ""With that said, there is potential for a growth acceleration in the future. Streaming only represents 37.5% of television time in the U.S., so the industry still has plenty of room to expand. Plus, as I mentioned earlier, some of Netflix's key competitors are pulling away, which could leave the company with a larger market share in the coming years."", ""Netflix's penetration also remains incredibly low in parts of Europe, and in populous developing markets like South America and India.

It has guided for $18 million in revenue in the current quarter at the midpoint of its guidance range, which would put its annual revenue at $47 million.', ""While that's a small number in the context of Wall Street, it is worth noting that SoundHound's guidance points toward a 51% year-over-year increase in revenue. That's higher than the 47% revenue growth the company clocked in 2022. Even better, analysts are expecting SoundHound AI to sustain its healthy revenue growth over the next two years."", ""However, don't be surprised to see SoundHound outperform analysts' expectations. That's because the company has a cumulative bookings backlog worth $342 million. This points toward a healthy revenue pipeline, as bookings ideally refer to the value of contracts signed with customers."", ""As the chart above indicates, SoundHound AI is estimated to generate a combined revenue of $165 million in 2024 and 2025. As the company is sitting on a much bigger backlog, it can cruise past those expectations and deliver solid gains to investors. But can SoundHound AI stock rise enough in the long run to turn a $100,000 investment into a million? Let's find out."", 'We have seen that SoundHound generated annual revenue of $31 million in 2022, and its top line is expected to hit almost $96 million in 2025, according to the chart in the previous section. That would translate into a three-year revenue compound annual growth rate of 45%.', 'The fast-growing nature of the market SoundHound operates in and the massive addressable opportunity the company is sitting on suggests that it could maintain a healthy pace of growth over the long run. We saw earlier in the article that the conversational intelligence market is predicted to clock 24% annual growth through 2030.', ""Assuming SoundHound can match the market's growth from 2026 to 2030, its top line could jump to $280 million at the end of the decade (using 2025's projected revenue of $95.7 million as the base). SoundHound AI currently has a price-to-sales ratio of almost 12, which seems justified considering its impressive growth."", ""Assuming that its sales multiple comes down to 10 at the end of 2030, SoundHound's market cap could jump to $2.8 billion by the end of the decade. That would be a jump of 430% from current levels, which means that a $100,000 investment in the stock right now could be worth $530,000 after seven years. Of course, that's quite some way off the million-dollar mark, but what's worth noting here is the impressive upside the stock could deliver in the long run."", ""So, even though SoundHound may not turn a $100,000 investment into a million over the next seven years, it won't be surprising to see it do the same over a longer period considering the terrific business growth it is likely to deliver through the end of the decade. That's why investors looking to buy an AI stock can consider buying and holding SoundHound AI as its robust long-term growth could lead to healthy stock market gains."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?', 'Before you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and SoundHound AI wasn't one of them.

Also, focus on concession-related capital endeavors bodes well. However, a volatile macroeconomic environment is a concern.Let us discuss the factors that highlight why investors should retain the stock.', ""Wynn Resorts focuses on non-gaming avenues to drive growth. In third-quarter 2023, the company’s non-gaming business witnessed robust growth owing to strength across tenant retail sales (up 24% from 2019 levels) and hotel revenues (20%). During the quarter, non-gaming revenues amounted to $54.4 million. Attributes like quality product and service offerings, the relaunch of the loyalty program and the robust non-gaming events calendar added to the positives. The company continues to introduce innovative non-gaming investments that boost tourism and strong shareholder returns. This includes investments in a new theater, events center, entertainment center, incremental parking, food and beverage and entertainment amenities.Wynn Resorts derives a solid share of revenues from Macau — the most prominent gaming destination in the world. The worst seems to be over for Macau's gaming industry as China's economy is slowly gaining momentum. During the third quarter, Wynn Resorts witnessed growth in Macau's mass gaming, luxury retail and hotel businesses, portraying exceptional post-Covid recovery. Higher business volumes backed by the discontinuation of pandemic-related travel restrictions were tailwinds.In Macau's development realm, the company anticipates unveiling its initial concession-related capital endeavor by 2023 end. To this end, the company collaborated with Illuminarium's team (from Las Vegas) to introduce a captivating multimedia exhibit space. Alongside the project, the company is actively engaged in planning and designing additional concession-related capital commitments. These include the creation of a destination food hall, the establishment of a new event and entertainment center and the development of an exclusive spectacle show. For the period 2023 (through 2024), the company expects capex related to concession commitments to be in the range of $300-$400 million. The company anticipates that the proposed capex and programming will drive growth in the upcoming periods.The emphasis on the expansion of new markets bodes well. Wynn Resorts and Marjan, RAK Hospitality Holding recently inked an agreement to develop a multibillion-dollar integrated resort on the artificial Al Marjan Island in Ras Al Khaimah, United Arab Emirates. This move marks Wynn Resorts’ foray into a new market. The resort is scheduled to open in 2026. This will mark the company’s first resort in the MENA region. During the third quarter of 2023, the company progressed with respect to the project design. Also, optimism can be noted due to opportunities arising from the backdrop of beachside setting development."", 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'In the past year, shares of Wynn Resorts have gained 7.9% compared with the industry’s 28.6% growth. A challenging macro environment mainly caused the downside.Increased operating expenses are a concern for the company. During the third quarter of 2023, the company’s total operating expenses came in at $1.6 billion compared with $0.9 billion reported in the prior-year quarter. The upside was primarily due to a rise in casino, room, food and beverage, entertainment, retail and other and general and administrative expenses. The company remains cautious of interest rate increases.', 'Wynn Resorts currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector are:Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.

That's perhaps not all that shocking given that it is a utility, a type of company known for paying reliable dividends."", ""But there's more to the story when you start to look at the growth rate of the dividend, which could make this stock a great pick for investors who not only care about dividends, but dividend growth as well. Here's a quick look at why NextEra Energy is a no-brainer for dividend growth investors."", ""It would be silly to talk about a dividend growth stock without a discussion of the payout right up front. NextEra Energy has increased its dividend annually for 29 consecutive years. That's impressive and includes hikes through the Great Recession and the pandemic, among many other difficult social and economic times."", 'But the growth angle is apparent when you see that, over the past decade, the payout has a compound annual growth rate in excess of 10% -- incredibly fast for a utility.', 'The chart above shows exactly how exceptional that dividend growth really is by comparing it to some of its largest peers. None of them come close to matching the rate achieved by NextEra Energy.', ""The takeaway from the above chart is that NextEra has an impressive dividend history. But there's a trade-off: The dividend yield tends to be below that of its peers. If you are looking to maximize the income your portfolio generates today to pay for living expenses, you probably won't want to own it."", ""However, if you are looking to turn on that income stream in the future, the story could be very different. NextEra Energy's yield is lower today, for sure. But over a decade or more of rapid dividend growth, it could end up generating a larger income stream, especially if you reinvest dividends\xa0along the way. That's the power of a rapid dividend growth rate, assuming dividend growth is what you are after."", ""There's a bit of a wrinkle here, however, since the current dividend yield of around 3.1% is toward the high end of NextEra Energy's range over the past decade. Sure, that's lower than the company's peers, but the historically high yield suggests it is the best time to buy this growth-oriented utility stock in a very long time."", ""With a market cap of $120 billion, NextEra is one of the largest utilities in the United States. But it isn't your typical utility."", 'The foundation of NextEra Energy is its Florida Power & Light business, which is a typical regulated utility (it has a monopoly in the areas it serves, but must get rates and investment plans approved by the government). This division has benefited from people moving to the Sunshine State for years, and that is likely to continue, so the business fundamentals are strong.', ""But on top of that business, NextEra has built one of the world's largest contracted clean-energy businesses, which is the real growth engine for the company. The mix between the two is roughly 70% regulated business, 30% clean-energy operations. And, notably, that breakdown is built on an investment-grade balance sheet.

But the clean energy business has massive growth plans.', 'As the table above shows, the clean energy business, known as NextEra Energy Resources, currently has 34 gigawatts of capacity today. But it hopes to more than double that by 2026.', ""And a huge percentage of the growth it expects is already in the backlog (21 gigawatts worth) because the company already has contracts to build it. Even if NextEra Energy doesn't get to the high end of its target, it already has a substantial amount of growth, more or less, baked in."", 'If you are a dividend investor looking for high yields, it would be understandable if you passed on NextEra Energy. But if you are focused on dividend growth, this utility stock is one that should be high up on your buy list.', 'It is odd for a utility to offer such high dividend growth rates, which means it could be a good way to add diversification to a portfolio that might be concentrated in a small number of industries known more for dividend growth.', ""Don't underestimate the value of that, though. Given its impressive dividend bona fides, NextEra Energy is still worth considering even if diversification isn't important to you."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in NextEra Energy right now?', 'Before you buy stock in NextEra Energy, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and NextEra Energy wasn't one of them.

That's only 0.1% of Amazon's market cap and less than 1% of the combined value of stocks held by Berkshire Hathaway; Berkshire has even been trimming its stake in the e-commerce giant this year."", 'The fact that Buffett is allowing any position in Amazon at all, however, is telling.', ""You already know that Mastercard (NYSE: MA) is a credit card middleman. It's the world's biggest, in fact, facilitating the purchase of $8.8 trillion worth of goods and services over the course of the past four reported quarters. That's more than 165 billion transactions."", 'Mastercard collects a few cents for each of these purchases, translating into what should be in the ballpark of $25 billion in revenue this year. Of that, roughly one-third is typically turned into net income. This is a high-margin business, to be sure.', ""That's not apt to be the top reason Berkshire Hathaway has been sitting on roughly 4 million shares of Mastercard since 2011, however. It's not the dividend, either, as Mastercard's current dividend yield is a paltry 0.6%."", ""Rather, the biggest reason Buffett is such a fan of this company is more likely to be its reliable top and bottom-line growth. With the exception of 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic largely kept the world stuck at home, revenue hasn't failed to grow on a year-over-year basis in any quarter in more than a decade. Net income growth has been almost as consistent."", ""This company's consistent results reflect the world's ongoing shift away from using cash and toward easier, more convenient ways of doing business. Meanwhile, its more recent and projected growth reflects Mastercard's foray into cross-border payments, making it easier for consumers and companies alike to buy and sell overseas goods."", 'Mastercard shares won\'t come cheap. The stock\'s trading at 37 times more than trailing-12-month per-share profits and nearly 30 times its expected earnings for the next four quarterly reports. It\'s still arguably worth this steep price, though. As Buffett explains, ""It\'s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.""', 'Finally, add megabank Citigroup (NYSE: C) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to scoop up.', ""It's not the biggest banking position Berkshire Hathaway is currently holding. That honor belongs to Bank of America -- a $28 billion stake that dwarfs Berkshire's 50 million-share trade in Citi that's worth a little over $2 billion. BofA is also bigger than Citigroup as measured by assets, and Bank of America is topped by JPMorgan Chase by the same measure. That's a key reason JPMorgan and BofA are also more often recommended as prospective stock picks."", ""Citigroup shares have an edge on these other two banks right now, though, and an edge on most other banking stocks, for that matter. That's its valuation. Thanks to the stock's relatively poor performance since 2020, despite the company's revenue and earnings growth revival since then, Citi shares are much cheaper than its peers. You can step into a stake while shares are trading at just a little over their trailing and projected price-to-earnings ratios. Better yet, you'll be plugging into a stock with a dividend yield of 4.1%."", ""That's based on a dividend, by the way, that had been regularly rising until the COVID-19 pandemic took hold in 2020 and is finally climbing again despite Citigroup's so-so stress-test results."", ""Doubters and critics could argue that the corporate shakeup underway by Citi CEO Jane Fraser makes it the wrong time to buy a piece of the company. We don't know what Citigroup might look like when all is said and done. It may also take some time for the bank's employees to get fully up to speed with its new structure. In fact, fears of this shakeup are a big reason Citi's stock has underperformed this year."", 'This is a case, however, where would-be investors must be forward-minded rather than backward-looking, having faith that a streamlined Citigroup will be better off once these difficult changes are put in place.', ""Bolstering its bullish case is the prospect of rate cuts in 2024, which will do the entire banking industry more good than the harm that rising interest rates have inflicted of late; lower borrowing costs could rekindle interest in borrowing money again. Beyond that nudge, Citigroup's long-term track record speaks for itself."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Indeed, on a year-to-date basis, the index shot up about 52%. That’s almost double the performance of the benchmark S&P 500. And that’s not a bad run for the S&P given the circumstances. Typically, though, higher performance comes with an overvalued profile.', 'Still, with so many securities available, a few tend to be overlooked, segueing into bargain Nasdaq-100 stocks. To be sure, these ideas represent the best of the best in the technology ecosystem. So, we’re not talking about ridiculously low valuations. However, if you’re the type that doesn’t like to pay full retail, these ideas should be attractive.', 'Plus, even the Federal Reserve is laying the possible groundwork for a tech rally. Policymakers hinted at interest rate cuts next year. If that happens, you may want to consider risk-on assets. And these undervalued Nasdaq-100 stocks may reach a greater distance.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: Based in San Diego, California, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) creates semiconductors, software, and services related to wireless technology. It owns a myriad of patents that are critical to the 5G rollout.', 'Relevance: While QCOM has been one of the more frustrating tech juggernauts, it has recently come alive. Nevertheless, a case can be made that it’s still one of the Nasdaq-100 stocks because of its broad reach. For instance, the 5G chipset market reached a valuation of $13.26 billion in 2020. Further, experts project that by 2030, the segment could be worth over $92 billion. That would come out to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21.85%.', 'Pros: Even with the reliable financial performance of QCOM, it’s undervalued. Specifically, shares trade at only 15.62x forward earnings. In contrast, the sector median comes in at 23.34x. Also, analysts rate QCOM a moderate buy with a high-side target of $160.', 'Cons: Because shares have jumped so quickly in recent sessions, analysts on average see muted upside potential.', 'Source: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: Headquartered in Milpitas, California, KLA Corp (NASDAQ:KLAC) is a capital equipment company. Per its public profile, it supplies process control and yield management systems for the semiconductor industry and other related nanoelectronics industries.', 'Relevance: Fundamentally, KLA Corp benefits from a relevant and burgeoning niche in the broader semiconductor ecosystem. According to Business Research Insights, the semiconductor process control equipment market reached a valuation of $8.29 billion last year. Further, experts project that the segment could hit a value of just over $13 billion by 2028. If so, that would come out to a CAGR of 7.9% during the forecast period.', 'Pros: KLA makes a compelling case for bargain Nasdaq-100 stocks thanks to its overall financial print. Right now, it posts a three-year revenue growth rate of 26.8% and an impressive net margin of 30.51%. Both stats run well above the underlying sector averages. Nevertheless, KLAC also trades at a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 0.85x. In contrast, the sector median comes in at 1.46x.', 'Cons: While analysts peg shares a moderate buy, the average price target lands at only $585.42.', 'Source: michelmond / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: Hailing from Santa Clara, California, Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) bills itself as the leader in materials engineering solutions. The company’s products and services integrate into virtually every new chip and advanced display in the world.', 'Relevance: Fundamentally, what makes AMAT a compelling idea for undervalued Nasdaq-100 stocks is relevance to the core industry. According to Market Research Future, the global semiconductor materials market size reached a valuation of just over $59 billion in 2022. Further, experts project that the sector will expand at a CAGR of 4.6% from 2023 through 2030. At the culmination point, the industry should be worth $60.34 billion.', 'Pros: On paper, it’s difficult to argue that AMAT isn’t one of the bargain Nasdaq-100 stocks. Again, you have the relevance. Second, the financials are solid: 19% three-year revenue growth rate and robust margins across the board. On top of that, you get the bonus of a trailing-year earnings multiple of 19.35X. That’s below the sector median of 26.63X.', 'Cons: It’s a strong consensus buy but as one of the top-tier Nasdaq-100 stocks, the average price target of $165.72 implies limited upside.', 'Source: PopTika / Shutterstock', 'What it is: Based in Baltimore, Maryland, Constellation Energy (NASDAQ:CEG) is the nation’s largest producer of carbon-free energy and provides sustainable solutions to homes, businesses, and public-sector customers across the continental U.S. Per its website, its energy resources stem include wind, solar, hydroelectric and nuclear.', 'Relevance: Obviously, the key for CEG as one of the undervalued Nasdaq-100 stocks centers on the relevance of the business. To put it into numbers, the global renewable energy market size will come out to $1.21 trillion at year’s end. Plus, the sector will expand at a CAGR of 17.2% from 2024 to 2030. Again, that’s the global figure, whereas Constellation focuses on the continental U.S. Still, it gives you an idea of the opportunity.', 'Pros: As a diversified energy producer, Constellation fundamentally benefits from effectively permanent relevance. Thus, it enjoys consistency in its business. Still, CEG trades at only 1.46x trailing-year revenue. In contrast, the sector median comes in at 2.47x.', 'Cons: To be fair, the rest of Constellation’s financials aren’t exactly sterling. Also, CEG has already moved up so strongly this year.', 'Source: madamF / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: Headquartered in Tarrytown, New York, Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN) is one of the top-tier biotechnology firms. Originally, the company focused on neurotrophic factors and their regenerative capabilities, thus explaining its corporate name.', 'Relevance: Currently, one of Regeneron’s main focus is leveraging antibodies as therapeutics. And it doesn’t get much bigger of an arena when it comes to biotech firms. According to MarketsandMarkets, the global antibody therapeutics market will print sales of $247.3 billion at year’s end. Further, experts project that the segment will expand at a CAGR of 14.1% by 2028. At the forecast culmination, the industry could be worth $479 billion.', 'Pros: Financially, the company prints a three-year EBITDA growth rate of 25.8%, beating out nearly 74% of its peers. It also enjoys consistent profitability, helped by excellent operating and net margins. Even with these attributes, REGN trades for only 24x trailing-year earnings. That compares favorably to the sector median of 32.44x, making it one of the bargain Nasdaq-100 stocks.', 'Cons: REGN is a slow-and-steady mover so if you’re looking for blistering returns, this isn’t it.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'What it is: Calling Philadelphia, Pennsylvania home, Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is the largest American multinational telecommunications and media conglomerate per its public profile. It features a massive profile of broadcasting and cable television along with an internet service provider business.', 'Relevance: One could make jokes about the cord-cutting situation and you wouldn’t be wrong. However, unless you envision a future where there’s no television being watched and no Internet being used, Comcast commands permanent relevance. Plus, under the company umbrella, Comcast owns a rich entertainment portfolio. These factors should help keep the money flowing, even if it’s not the most exciting idea among undervalued Nasdaq-100 stocks.', 'Pros: For those willing to be a bit adventurous, CMCSA brings a solid financial profile to the table. Its three-year revenue growth rate of 5.1% isn’t spectacular but it’s definitely above average for the sector. Also, it’s consistently profitable thanks to strong margins across the board. And finally, it only trades for a forward multiple of 10.33x, lower than 67% of its rivals.', 'Cons: CMCSA is going through a frustrating sideways consolidation since late July.', 'Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: Based in Stamford, Connecticut, Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) is a telecommunications and mass media. It offers services under the brand Spectrum. Per its public profile, it features over 32 million customers in 41 states, making it the second-largest cable operator in the U.S., just behind Comcast.', 'Relevance: At first glance, CHTR might not seem like a particularly relevant example of bargain Nasdaq-100 stocks. However, it’s important to note that the TV and video market in the U.S. will print revenue of $275.7 billion by year’s end. Further, according to Statista, experts project that the sector will expand at a CAGR of 3.01%. By 2028, market volume should hit $319.8 billion.', 'Pros: Over the past three years, Charter’s revenue clocked in at 17.1%, beating out nearly 84% of its peers. Also, it enjoys a very strong operating margin of 22.8%. Enticingly, CHTR trades at only 9.92x forward earnings. In contrast, the sector median stands at 13.18x. Finally, analysts rate shares a moderate buy with a $456.18 average price target.', 'Cons: Growth has been slowing in recent quarters so it’s something to watch carefully.', 'On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'The #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of', 'Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

Indeed, this time could be an ideal opportunity for election year stocks to buy.', 'Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: A popular multinational food company, Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) is the third-largest food and beverage company in North America, per its public profile. Also, it happens to be the fifth-largest in the world. As I pointed out before, KHC represents one of Warren Buffett’s favorite holdings. You really can’t go wrong with the Oracle of Omaha’s endorsement.', 'Relevance: Admittedly, KHC ranks among the stocks to buy in an election year not necessarily because it’s poised to do well in 2024. I mean, KHC offers great value for investors, trading at a discounted forward earnings multiple of 12.34x. Rather, I’m just pointing out that nothing specific about next year suggests Kraft Heinz will enjoy the upside. So, why go for it? Simply, people need to eat no matter who becomes president.', 'Pros: The company offers an attractive forward dividend yield of 4.36%, well above the consumer staple sector’s average yield of 1.89%.', 'Cons: Based on analysts’ average price target of $37.31, we’re talking limited upside.', 'Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: For better or for worse, millions of residents in Southern California are familiar with Sempra (NYSE:SRE). A utility giant, Sempra enjoys a natural monopoly. Even if competitors appear on the horizon, it’s incredibly difficult to break into the utility industry. Indeed, the high barriers to entry include regulatory hurdles. That means Sempra is entrenched.', 'Relevance: Now, for the reasons that many residents under the Sempra umbrella don’t like the company, it’s also an ideal enterprise for election year stocks. Listening to the political campaign trails, it’s hard to decipher who will win. You have one candidate saying some – let’s face it – outrageous things. On the other hand, the incumbent candidate isn’t exactly inspiring the base. But no matter, we must pay our utility bills.', 'Pros: Sempra offers a forward dividend yield of 3.18%. While it’s a bit low compared to the industry average, the payout ratio is reasonable at just under 50%.', 'Cons: Although SRE effectively offers permanent relevance, it printed a disappointing performance this year.', 'Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: A massive healthcare giant, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) recently spun off its consumer care products division. That makes J&J a more streamlined enterprise, focusing on pharmaceuticals and medical technologies. It’s not the sexiest enterprise for stocks to buy in an election year. However, it might actually benefit from the rancor in Washington.', 'Relevance: Primarily, healthcare represents a hot-button issue for practically all voters. And that’s especially the case for the older demographics. No party can afford to be portrayed as giving up on the most vulnerable citizens of America. That would be political self-harm. Secondly, the aging of this nation means that J&J should offer relevance no matter who’s elected.', 'Pros: J&J offers a decent forward dividend yield of 3.06%. That’s noticeably higher than the healthcare sector’s average yield of 1.58%. Also, with 61 years of consecutive payouts, that’s a status management will want to keep going.', 'Cons: Unfortunately, JNJ has not yet resonated with investors, with shares suffering relatively deep losses this year.', 'Source: madamF / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: With so many venomous talking points going back and forth between the two major parties, it’s a wonder that anything gets done in Washington. Fortunately, on Wall Street, Republicans and Democrats can get together in support of Vulcan Materials (NYSE:VMC). My friends, Vulcan Materials is America because it builds the future or whatever. It’s easily one of the election-year stocks to buy.', 'Relevance: I don’t mean to be flippant but you’ve got to see the relevance here. Let’s consider the slogans of the last few years. At one point, we heard the rallying cry of build the wall. Later, the White House promised to build back better. What’s the common theme here? Building. Building what? I don’t know. Just something to keep the circus going.', 'Pros: Another reason why VMC ranks among the election year stocks is unanimous endorsement among analysts. Among 10 experts, they all stated VMC is a strong buy.', 'Cons: Vulcan has performed quite well this year so upside in 2024 could be limited.', 'Source: ranchorunner / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: Ordinarily, I would assign Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) as a beneficiary of Republican politics. However, a “flippening” happened in the political ecosystem where conservatives no longer eagerly support projection of military power, whereas Democrats seemingly want to bolster the military industrial complex. Strange stuff but that makes LMT one of the stocks to buy in an election year.', 'Relevance: I don’t want to go down too deep a rabbit hole regarding the geopolitical environment. However, you’d have to be comatose to not recognize the severe power plays at hand. Also, I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to say that America’s credibility is on the line here. Cynically, then, enterprises like Lockheed Martin should benefit because of the Teddy Roosevelt principle. If a fight goes down, it’s best to have the biggest stick.', 'Pros: If you’re looking for a discount among election-year stocks, LMT trades at a trailing-year earnings multiple of 16.33x. That’s lower than 79% of companies in the aerospace and defense industry.', 'Cons: Lockheed isn’t really convincing analysts who only rate it a consensus hold.', 'Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: An integrated oil and gas stalwart, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) could be one of the stocks to buy in an election year if you anticipate that the Republican candidate has a great chance of taking the White House. With conservatives often championing the hydrocarbon sector, CVX may be a solid buy, especially with the relative discount.', 'Relevance: When it comes to relevance of CVX and its ilk, it comes down to the science. Like it or not, fossil fuels command high energy density. Outside of nuclear fuel, many other energy sources simply lack such magnitude of density. Therefore, even with the political and ideological push for clean and renewable energy infrastructure, the hydrocarbon sector should be relevant for many years to come.', 'Pros: Right now, the company prints a solid three-year revenue growth rate of 18.1%. Outside of a few blips, it’s consistently profitable. Also, it features a dividend yield of 4.04%, making it an enticing example of election year stocks.', 'Cons: Due to a combo of economic and geopolitical headwinds, CVX has been volatile lately.', 'Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: Finally, if you anticipate that the Democrats will perform well in 2024 and you want to speculate on high-risk, high-reward enterprises, then solar-panel manufacturer First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) may be of significant interest. It goes without saying that liberals and progressives champion sustainability. And not that Republicans don’t but the left tends to be more vocal about it. That’s a plus for FSLR.', 'Relevance: Again, First Solar aligns with the left-leaning talking points about sustainability. Further, Generation Z advocates such practices, both at a broader level and also personally. You know what’s really enticing if you’re anticipating a blue wave? According to The New York Times, Gen Z is even more liberal than millennials. Plus, this cohort is less likely to become conservative as it ages.', 'Pros: Recently, several solar power enterprises have experienced a significant rise due to speculation about interest rate cuts.', 'Cons: I suppose that if those interest rate cuts don’t materialize, then FSLR may suffer a cruel reality check.', 'On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Several factors are contributing to the recent strength, including pent-up demand to buy homes and fears that mortgage rates could move higher. • The sticker shock of rapidly rising mortgage rates appears to have cooled down. Homebuilders have made homes more affordable to prospective home purchasers by offering mortgage rate buydowns to the mid-5% mortgage rate range while maintaining strong profitability margins. • A dearth of inventory in the existing home market and an overall housing supply shortage is driving home buyers to “stretch their wallet” due to fears that they could miss the opportunity to buy a home.', 'We remain optimistic about the long-term potential for the Fund’s investments in Toll Brothers, Lennar, and D.R.

The speculative home strategy for each community is based on local market factors.In the first nine months of 2023, home sales revenues grew 8%, backed by a 4% increase in both closings and the average selling price.

Additionally, selecting individual stocks can become overwhelming. The perfect set-it-and-forget-it portfolio should make these investment decisions easy and generate long-term returns.', 'The set-it-and-forget-it portfolio investments can be of several types. The most common one would be a basic 60/40 portfolio. A basic 60/40 portfolio would give 60% weightage to the S&P 500 and 40% weightage to US treasuries. Due to the low volatility of bonds, people with little financial knowledge could also go for a bond-heavy portfolio. Ray Dalio’s All Weather Portfolio follows a similar theme. 40% of the portfolio is represented by long-term US bonds, 30% by US stocks, 15% by intermediate US bonds, and 15% by commodities. According to Dalio, this portfolio performs well in all kinds of economic conditions. Over the last 30 years, it has grown at a compound annual rate of 7.19%.', 'During our research for set-it-and-forget-it stocks according to financial media, we also took a peek at public forums such as Reddit and Quora, where people had revealed their long-term portfolios. Index funds were the most common long-term investment people had mentioned. Vanguard 500 Index Fund ETF (VOO), Schwab US Large-Cap Growth ETF (SCHG), and Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) are some of the most commonly preferred funds for people who want a retirement portfolio. Over the last 5 years, Vanguard 500 Index Fund ETF (VOO) has gained 91.12%, Schwab US Large-Cap Growth ETF (SCHG) is up 143.16%, and Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD)’s stock price returns are 62.84% higher.', 'Quality dividend stocks like Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) were also among Reddit favorites but failed to make our list.

The company covers around 80% of the supply of the GPUs used for training and developing AI applications. Although there are competitors like Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Specifically, I am going to focus on the purest cases of financial intermediation in which we are invested: AerCap Holdings N.V. (NYSE:AER), ALD Automotive, Sun Hung Kai & Co and S&U.', 'Let us start with maturity mismatch, which is the first of the structural problems in banking. We own a stake in AerCap and ALD Automotive, two companies with very similar businesses in their essence. In short, these entities borrow money to acquire assets (aircraft and automobiles, respectively), lease them for a period of time (on average, seven and four years) and sell them at the end of their contract (in the case of AerCap, the longer useful life of its aircraft means that the contracts are usually renewed at maturity). If these companies were to operate like a bank, they would borrow at very short maturities and would have to continually roll over that financing to avoid falling into an unsustainable liquidity risk, should they have to repay their debt (their assets are leased). However, as we have already seen, operating with such a maturity mismatch would be a recipe for failure. In fact, Guinness Peat Aviation, the company that pioneered the aircraft leasing business in the 1970s and 1980s, ended up going bankrupt (among others), for over-reliance on short-term financing.32 A lesson never to be forgotten by Aengus Kelly, CEO of AerCap and the person who inherited the unloved assets of Guinness Peat Aviation after its sale to GECAS in 1996 (by a twist of fate, Kelly eventually acquired GECAS two years ago)…” (Click here to read the full text)', 'Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75', 'The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is an Ohio-based company that manufactures and markets fast-moving consumer goods.', 'According to Insider Monkey’s database that tracks 910 elite hedge funds, 75 funds had investments in The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)’s stock in the third quarter, compared to 74 in the previous quarter.

This can only last for so long before there’s no more excess expenses left to cut.', 'I find it ironic that all these companies trade as “bond-equivalents” in the minds of investors – even commanding lower yields than US treasuries, the safest security in the world. But it’s clear that their businesses are not nearly as safe. Proctor & Gamble is facing disruption from direct-to-consumer brands that offer their products for a fraction of the price.', 'But these companies are ~35% more expensive than US Treasuries, despite the heightened risk. On a risk-adjusted basis, one could argue the implied premium is even higher.', 'Perhaps the explanation is simply the price volatility difference between these stocks and treasuries over the last two years. For example, 10-year Treasury bonds are down ~-20% since the beginning of 2022.

With a successful track record that spans nearly six decades, it's hard to find a better role model to emulate than Warren Buffett."", 'Buffett acquired Berkshire Hathaway for $14.86 per share in 1965, and since then shares of the holding company have increased by an average rate of 19.8% annually. Some money managers have outperformed Buffett over shorter time frames but nobody has been able to put up these kinds of numbers decade after decade.', ""Noticing his decades of success, many everyday investors are eager to know what he's buying and selling. According to disclosures that all large money managers must make to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, we can see that Buffett completely closed out positions in Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) and Proctor & Gamble (NYSE: PG) during the third quarter."", ""Both companies attract income-seeking investors with their legendary dividend programs. Let's look at the road ahead to see if dropping these stocks from your portfolio the way Buffett did makes sense right now."", ""Buffett closed out seven positions in the third quarter, and one of the most surprising was Johnson & Johnson. The healthcare conglomerate's dividend program is legendary with 61 consecutive years of annual dividend raises. At recent prices, it offers a 3% yield."", ""Despite a record of consistent dividend raises, Berkshire closed its J&J position in the third quarter by selling 327,100 shares. Buffett hasn't explained why, but I'd wager the recent spinoff of Kenvue was the deal breaker."", ""Kenvue was formed from J&J's old consumer goods segment. This August, J&J finalized Kenvue's separation and I wouldn't be surprised if Berkshire dropped its shares shortly after. Now that it no longer sells well-recognized brands like Listerine, Tylenol, and Band-Aid, an investment in this stock relies more heavily on its pharmaceutical and medical technology segments."", ""Buffett and Berkshire famously avoid investing in companies they don't understand well. There are a lot of ins and outs when it comes to medical technology, and the biopharmaceutical industry can be even more complicated. With this in mind, I wouldn't consider Berkshire's exit as a sign of a deeper problem at J&J."", 'If we ignore the effects of currency exchange, medtech sales jumped 10.4% year over year. Pharmaceuticals, which make up 65% of total revenue, had a rough quarter due to rapidly declining COVID-19 sales. Despite the challenge, J&J reported pharma sales that grew 4.4% year over year.', 'J&J recently submitted applications seeking approval for an experimental lung cancer therapy called lazertinib that could push pharma sales much higher in 2024. In a pivotal trial, patients treated with lazertinib in combination with Rybrevant, another J&J drug, were significantly less likely to experience disease progression compared to treatment with Tagrisso.', ""With $5.9 billion in annualized sales, Tagrisso is AstraZeneca's top-selling drug at the moment. Investors holding shares of J&J probably want to hold on at least long enough to see if lazertinib plus Rybrevant can take Tagrisso's place."", ""In the third quarter, Berkshire sold 315,400 Proctor & Gamble shares to close its position in the legendary consumer goods company. The sale was surprising because this company's dividend track record is even longer than J&J's."", ""Proctor & Gamble has paid a dividend every year since 1890, and this April it announced its 67th consecutive annual payout increase. At recent prices, it offers a 2.6% yield. This might not inspire anyone to buy the stock now but I wouldn't be in a hurry to let go either."", ""Proctor & Gamble recorded a very healthy $14.6 billion in free cash flow over the past year. It needed 62% of this sum to meet its dividend commitment. In other words, profits are more than sufficient to service its debt load and support future dividend raises in line with the company's overall growth rate."", ""Proctor & Gamble probably isn't going to be your portfolio's top performer, but steady gains seem likely. With a lineup of well-established brands that include Crest, Tide, and Pampers, the company was able to raise prices by 7% during its fiscal first quarter ended on Sept. 30. Sales volume over the same time frame came in just 1% lower."", ""Proctor & Gamble's brands gave the company enough pricing power to raise its dividend payout by 31% over the past five years. That isn't too bad, but rising interest expenses could make the next five years of dividend growth even less exciting."", ""Older investors who can't afford losses or declining dividends will want to hold on to this stock.

To skip our detailed analysis of the healthcare sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Hot Healthcare Stocks To Buy Now.', ""Healthcare is a vital part of daily living for everyone, whether it be to cure an illness or to ensure that you stay healthy through prompt checkups and consistent care for yourself. As a result, healthcare companies are among those that remain ever popular among investors and consumers alike because they are the type to never go out of fashion since we will always need medical care. However, in today's tech-dominated market, many investors may be concerned about the prospects for other sectors, including healthcare, and their performance through the end of the year and into 2024."", ""On November 30, CNBC's Jim Cramer discussed his opinions on the healthcare sector on 'Mad Money,' most notably about what is holding the healthcare sector back and how one can navigate a tech-dominated market. Here are some of his comments:"", '""First, we are talking about a whole sector that\'s in the crosshairs of the US government because we\'re headed into an election year. The entire election may actually hinge on the cost of things going too high, even as it is going lower according to all indicators. Of course, if you\'re going lower from a much higher base than pre-pandemic, and lower inflation simply means that price are rising more slowly, they\'re not falling, it won\'t cut it. And that make\'s healthcare a natural whipping boy for the government.""', ""So, according to Cramer, one factor holding back the healthcare sector today is the involvement of the government in the sector in preparation for the upcoming elections in the US. A CNBC article from December 7 highlighted how President Biden's administration had seized the patents of several costly medications to ramp up its efforts to slash drug prices and promote competition in the pharmaceutical industry as well. Biden has also been working on making lower drug prices a pillar of his healthcare agenda and reelection strategy. Such a move thus serves as a good example of the government involvement in the healthcare sector noted by Cramer. An implication of such a move by the Biden administration can be the slowdown in the healthcare sector."", ""Another trend Cramer noted that somewhat explains the healthcare sector slowdown is the fact that many people today are continuing to hold back when it comes to going for non-urgent surgeries. Here's what Cramer had to say on this and how that impacts medical device companies in the healthcare sector:"", '""Finally, the medical device business... crushed during COVID when people decided to hold of on all sorts of non-urgent surgeries. The strangest thing is, they\'re still holding off. The numbers never come back. Very hard to figure. Whatever the case, the healthcare group seems a pretty unlikely candidate to help the bullish cause.""', ""Despite the above, the fact that technology today is continuing to evolve and expand its horizons means that other sectors, like healthcare, will also benefit instead of just being overshadowed by a massive tech rally in the market. On November 30, Robert Garrett, the CEO of Hackensack Meridian Health, joined CNBC to discuss the impact of artificial intelligence (AI), in particular, on the healthcare sector. Here's what he had to say:"", '""I see AI as the most profound technology in the world today. If you think about it from a healthcare perspective, whether it\'s helping doctors diagnose disease earlier, helping more people enroll in clinical trials, there\'s no question that AI can improve healthcare in remarkable ways.""', 'In light of the above, despite the current slowdown in the healthcare sector, investors can treat this as a moment to consider some hot healthcare stocks to buy now as plausible additions to their portfolios since tech like AI is bound to rapidly improve healthcare companies and their products. The present slowdown can be seen as an opportunity to buy stocks like Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), UnitedHealth Group Inc.

If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Medtronic here  for free."", ""Over the past five years, Medtronic's ROCE and capital employed have both remained mostly flat. Businesses with these traits tend to be mature and steady operations because they're past the growth phase. With that in mind, unless investment picks up again in the future, we wouldn't expect Medtronic to be a multi-bagger going forward. This probably explains why Medtronic is paying out 52% of its income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Given the business isn't reinvesting in itself, it makes sense to distribute a portion of earnings among shareholders."", ""We can conclude that in regards to Medtronic's returns on capital employed and the trends, there isn't much change to report on. And investors may be recognizing these trends since the stock has only returned a total of 9.7% to shareholders over the last five years. So if you're looking for a multi-bagger, the underlying trends indicate you may have better chances elsewhere."", ""If you'd like to know about the risks facing Medtronic, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should be aware of."", ""While Medtronic isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets."", 'Have feedback on this article?

In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth.

The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance.

Contributing factors include demanding working hours, a lack of physical activity, and an unhealthy diet, all of which contribute to the prevalence of diseases like diabetes. In 2020, the World Health Organization highlighted a significant 57% increase in chronic diseases worldwide. Furthermore, China and India collectively accounted for 193.4 million diabetic patients in 2019, with projections indicating that India alone is expected to witness an increase to 101 million diabetic patients by 2030. This suggests a growing demand for drugs for numerous treatments, resulting in the expansion of the pharmaceutical drug market in the future. The size of the global drug market reached $1136.2 billion in 2022. Forecasts suggest that the market is expected to reach $1848.5 billion in 2027, exhibiting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.4%.

The pharmaceutical unit of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), which generated $52.56 billion in revenue in 2022, experienced nearly a 2% growth from the previous year. The company’s growth can be attributed to key medications such as Darzalex for cancer, Stelara for immunology, and Erleada for prostate cancer, among other drugs.', ""Another industry key player is Roche Holding AG (ROG.SW), which employs over 100,000 people in more than 100 countries as of 2020.

While facing a 15% decline in diabetes treatment sales to $4.5 billion, Merck & Co. Inc. (NYSE:MRK) saw a 22% increase in Gardasil sales, reaching $6.9 billion. This was mainly due to the high demand for the HPV vaccine in China.

Don’t get me wrong – you generally can’t go wrong with targeting individual securities under the venerable index. Still, if you’re looking for growth opportunities, the Dow is a bit tame to put it diplomatically.', 'Nevertheless, you’ve got to ask yourself a question: how sure are you that the Fed will actually lower borrowing costs? After all, the November jobs report came in hotter than expected. Right now, that means more dollars are chasing after fewer goods, which is inflationary. Cutting rates would add to that inflation, which is odd. Therefore, the best Dow Jones stocks for conservative investors are very much relevant.', 'Second, the Dow represents an elite basket of the best that America has to offer. No, these names aren’t exactly sexy. But they should keep the ship steady in choppy waters. And you know what’s really awesome? Even when companies get kicked out of the index, the booted enterprises tend to perform better than their index-promoted counterparts.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'That’s some serious clout. With that, below are the best Dow Jones stocks for conservative investors.', 'Source: ST House Studio / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: Based in Midland, Michigan, Dow (NYSE:DOW) is a materials sciences specialist with products covering a wide range of industries.', 'Relevance: Unless you envision a future where agriculture, consumer goods, electronics, personal care and food and beverage products no longer carry any relevance, you should at the very least consider some exposure to DOW stock. While the underlying enterprise is boring as all heck, it commands a vast influence across countless industries. It may very well be the shotgun approach among the best Dow Jones stocks for conservative investors.', 'Pros: Basically, if you bet on everything, it’s tough to lose. On the financial front, Dow posts a very strong three-year EBITDA growth rate of 54.8%, beating out 92% of its peers. Also, the company trades at a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 1.24x, below the sector median of 1.73x. Finally, it gets the analysts’ nod with a consensus moderate buy rating.', 'Cons: When you do bet on everything, your net rewards could be limited. That seems to be the case with the extremely modest analysts’ price target of $55.64.', 'Source: Daryl L / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: Headquartered in New York City, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) is a global financial powerhouse.', 'Relevance: Currently listed as the world’s biggest bank based on market capitalization, JPMorgan Chase commands extraordinary relevance as is. Now, it must be said that the regional banking crisis earlier this year sent jitters across the financial space. However, the consolidation effect that may materialize in the years ahead won’t be of much concern to JPMorgan. It’s one of the top-tier bellwethers, thus ranking it among the best Dow Jones stocks for conservative investors.', 'Pros: Financially, JPMorgan benefits from slightly better-than-average long-term revenue growth. As well, it’s consistently profitable, providing reassurances for nervous investors. Naturally, the financial stalwart saw an increase in net interest income. However, it significantly improved its non-interest income on a trailing-12-month (TTM) basis relative to 2022 levels.', 'Cons: JPM incurred a conspicuous loss of market value in 2022 due to spiked borrowing costs. The same situation could materialize if the Fed doesn’t go through with rate cuts.', 'Source: monticello / Shutterstock', 'What it is: Based in Atlanta, Georgia, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is a stalwart in the soft-drink industry. Also, it’s an icon of American capitalism.', 'Relevance: As a globally recognized consumer brand, it’s difficult to see Coca-Cola ever losing its relevance. Further, if the economy doesn’t chug along as projected, the company could benefit from the trade-down effect; that is, consumers will eschew caffeinated beverages at pricey retail establishments and head to the grocery store. Further, while the soft drink sector is boring, experts project that it will expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4% from this year to 2032.', 'Pros: I think it’s reasonable to assume that Coca-Cola will capture a big chunk of the projected soft-drink market valuation of $654.37 billion by 2032. Financially, there’s nothing truly remarkable about the company in terms of revenue growth or valuation. However, it’s consistently profitable, rewarding shareholders with a 3.14% dividend yield.', 'Cons: Since the start of the year, KO dipped about 7%, which is something to consider. Also, the upside potential may be somewhat limited with analysts forecasting a per-share price of $63.88.', 'Source: rblfmr/ShutterStock.com', 'What it is: A mainstay in the consumer goods industry, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) has long been a favorite brand in the U.S. and throughout the world.', 'Relevance: Obviously, no one – unless they’re speculative on derivative contracts – wagers on P&G to get rich quick. However, if you’re looking for ideas for the best Dow Jones stocks for conservative investors, it doesn’t get more conservative than PG. Fundamentally, the company keeps marching by providing consumers with everyday needs. Unless you envision a future where humans won’t wipe themselves, P&G offers a reasonably safe investment.', 'Pros: When it comes to PG and its ilk, the core strength centers on business predictability. I don’t know what’s going to happen in the market tomorrow but I can guarantee you that someone will be brushing their teeth. With that, P&G prints a three-year revenue growth rate of 6.9%, just a hair above average. But it’s consistently profitable, allowing shareholders to enjoy an okay (not great) dividend yield of 2.59%.', 'Cons: By being such a stable example of the best Dow Jones stocks for conservative investors, it lacks flexibility. In football terms, PG is the equivalent of the prevent defense.', 'Source: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: Hailing from Redmond, Washington, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a technology giant offering both hardware and software solutions.', 'Relevance: As one of the world’s top consumer tech giants, Microsoft is heavily tied to the PC market. For quite some time, industry pundits have called for the death of the format. However, such a draconian forecast may be off. Indeed, Statista shows that while we’re not talking about a growth monster here, the segment should expand at a CAGR of 2.3% between 2023 and 2028. At the forecast culmination, PC market volume could hit $247.1 billion.', 'Pros: As with some of the top industry leaders, I believe it’s reasonable that Microsoft will dominate the PC market. Further, the business (and academic) world largely runs on Microsoft Windows, leading to software revenue expansion opportunities. Financially, the company enjoys a solid three-year revenue growth rate of 15.1%. It also posted at least 10 years of net income over the past decade.', 'Cons: While analysts anticipate double-digit growth over the next 12 months, MSFT already jumped 56% year-to-date. Therefore, actual upside could be limited.', 'Source: Tupungato / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: A behemoth in the big-box retailing sector, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) represents a bellwether for consumer sentiment.', 'Relevance: While Walmart is perhaps best known for catering to consumer discretionary demand, the reality is that the company represents a one-stop shop. From clothing to electronics to groceries and everything in between, Walmart has it all. In addition, the retailing giant has its pulse on consumer trends. Recently, it expanded its partnership with Affirm (NASDAQ:AFRM) to facilitate buy now, pay later (BNPL) transactions at self-checkout kiosks.', 'Pros: As a leader in everyday low pricing, Walmart offers relevance no matter what the economic cycle. Regarding its financials, the company posts a three-year revenue growth rate of 7%. That’s noticeably above the 5.1% sector median. Further, it’s been profitable 10 years in the past decade, supporting a modest dividend yield of 1.49%. Analysts also see shares hitting $180.79, projecting over 16% upside potential.', 'Cons: If the consumer economy weakens, WMT could suffer some volatility. So, while it may be one of the best Dow Jones stocks for conservative investors, you can’t be completely oblivious.', 'Source: Atmosphere1 / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: Headquartered in Rahway, New Jersey, Merck (NYSE:MRK) is a powerhouse in the pharmaceuticals industry.', 'Relevance: As a pharmaceutical giant, Merck benefits from some degree of economic insulation. When people fall ill with a serious disease or condition, they need to do what it takes to get better. In terms of hard data, the global pharmaceutical manufacturing market reached a valuation of $516.48 billion last year. By 2030, the segment could hit $929.9 billion, representing a CAGR of 7.63%.', 'Pros: In some ways, Merck benefits from the best of both worlds. While it’s a massive blue chip, the company also sports a three-year revenue growth rate of 15.4%. That’s above 78% of its peers in the drug manufacturing space. Even with its consistently profitable profile, MRK trades at a forward earnings multiple of 12.48x, below the sector median of 14.46x. Thus, it makes a great case for the best Dow Jones stocks for conservative investors.', 'Cons: The world of pharmaceuticals can be volatile, depending on clinical progress.', 'On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Since inflation, which was the biggest threat to the economy, has shown signs of cooling off in the past couple of months, the Federal Reserve, in response, will most likely ease its monetary policy outlook in the near future. Investors’ confidence has recovered in anticipation that the worst phase has passed.', 'The Consumer Price Index for the month of November was 3.1%.

The economy added 199,000 jobs in November versus the monthly average of 240,000 over the past year, suggesting a fairly healthy labor market. Although inflation is expected to cool off further, it is still significantly higher than the Fed’s ambitious target of 2%. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell could still keep the interest rate high for longer to win the inflation battle, which in turn would affect corporate profitability.', 'On the international front, the persistent war in the Middle East between Israel and Hamas amid ceasefires has disrupted the global supply chain. Such events also hurt corporate performance.', 'Amid such uncertainties, prudent investors who seek regular income along with capital preservation can invest in dividend stocks. These companies, with proven business models, pay out regular dividends and remain profitable due to their well-established businesses.

The Swiss footwear and sportswear maker went public at $24 in September 2021, and its shares soared to an all-time high of $51.45 just two months later.', ""But over the following two years, On's stock lost nearly 50% of its value as rising rates and other macro headwinds crushed the market's pricier growth stocks."", ""Let's see why that sell-off might represent a buying opportunity for patient investors."", 'On was founded by Olivier Bernhard, a former Swiss Ironman champion and Nike\xa0athlete, in 2010. After studying the flexibility of garden hoses, Bernhard developed a proprietary cushioning technology called CloudTec, which creates moving ""cloud"" cushions under a runner\'s feet. These cushions expand when a foot is in the air, but lock together when a foot hits the ground to create a firmer foundation for the next step.', 'Bernhard initially presented a CloudTec prototype to Nike, but the footwear giant rejected the design. But instead of abandoning the idea, Bernhard partnered with David Allemann and Caspar Coppetti to start On. The company patented its CloudTec technology and launched its high-performance Cloudracer shoe in 2012.', 'On subsequently gained a lot of attention after Nicola Spirig, one of Switzerland\'s most famous triathletes, started wearing and promoting its Cloudracer shoes. On gained more traction after Swiss tennis legend Roger Federer became a major shareholder in the company and backed the launch of ""The Roger"" shoe in 2020. Today On is the largest footwear brand in Switzerland, and holds a mid-single digit share of the crowded U.S. footwear market. It also expanded into China in 2018.', 'In 2022, On generated 60% of its revenue in North America, 29% in Europe, and 7% in the Asia Pacific.

By comparison, analysts expect Nike's revenue to rise 2% in fiscal 2024 (which ends in May 2024)."", ""On's superior growth can be attributed to three main tailwinds. First, it's still a small brand with plenty of room to grow. A recent UBS sportswear survey found that the public's awareness of On was rising as it expanded into more markets. UBS believes the company can maintain an astounding compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 45% over the next five years."", 'Second, On is expanding its direct-to-consumer (DTC) channel to boost margins and reduce dependence on wholesale retailers, which are more exposed to macro headwinds and supply chain disruptions. Its DTC sales rose at a CAGR of 66% from 2020 to 2022. Its DTC sales grew another 57% year over year in the first nine months of 2023 and accounted for 35% of its top line.', ""Lastly, On targets high-end consumers, who are more resistant to economic downturns. The company justifies its premium price tag (about $130 for its Cloudracer) with its CloudTec cushions, which set it apart from its competitors. It also doesn't dilute that brand appeal with big promotions and discounts."", 'On was unprofitable at the time of its IPO, but it finally generated a full-year net profit of 57.7 million Swiss francs ($67.6 million) in 2022. In the first nine months of 2023 the company generated a net profit of 106.3 million Swiss francs ($124.5 million). Analysts expect On to post a net profit of 132 million Swiss francs ($154.6 million) for the full year.', 'On attributes the soaring profits to the growth of its DTC business, its ""premium positioning,"" and its focus on full-price sales instead of margin-crushing markdowns. The company expects to achieve a gross margin of ""at least"" 59% for the full year, up from 56% in 2022. That puts it far ahead of Nike, which ended the latest quarter with a gross margin of less than 45% as it struggled with soft sales, larger markdowns, and supply chain disruptions.', ""Analysts expect On's net income to rise at a CAGR of 99% from 2023 to 2025. That's a stunning growth rate for a stock that trades at 40 times next year's earnings."", ""All of these strengths make On look like a great investment at $28 per share. The company has carved a defensible niche among higher-end shoppers, it's growing like a weed, and it's undervalued relative to its growth."", ""On's stock might remain under pressure as Nike, Adidas, and other industry bellwethers struggle in this choppy market, but the bulls should rush back once it proves that it doesn't belong in the same basket as those aging leaders."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in On Holding right now?', 'Before you buy stock in On Holding, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and On Holding wasn't one of them.

The Federal Reserve in the United States has signaled that it will start cutting interest rates in 2024 as inflation cools. This means that borrowing costs will decrease.

Moat is generally defined as a sustainable competitive advantage of a company that makes it hard for rivals to compete against it.\xa0', 'Some of the companies with the widest moat include Alphabet Inc.

The company had pulled off a near miracle with its rapid development of a COVID-19 vaccine.', 'It followed that success with the launch of an effective oral COVID pill. Both became megablockbusters, with the vaccine (Comirnaty) generating global sales of $37.8 billion and the antiviral therapy (Paxlovid) raking in an additional $18.9 billion in 2022.', ""It's a much different story today. Pfizer has lost more than half of its market cap since hitting that record high. Sales of Comirnaty and Paxlovid are tanking."", 'Many investors seem to have thrown in the towel on the once high-flying pharma stock. But could Pfizer be a no-brainer stock to buy right now, even if its COVID sales continue to plunge?', ""There's perhaps no sadder picture for Pfizer (other than its stock chart) than the sales trajectory for Comirnaty and Paxlovid. It wasn't long ago that the two products generated combined sales of more than $56.7 billion. Pfizer expects its total COVID sales to be only around $12.5 billion in 2023."", ""But the picture seems likely to get even worse in 2024. Pfizer projects combined sales of Comirnaty and Paxlovid will be only around $8 billion. The good news for the company is that's still a sizable amount of money. The bad news is that it's a far cry from the ginormous sales made in 2022."", ""Just how low can Pfizer's COVID sales go? It wouldn't be shocking for the sales of Comirnaty and Paxlovid to slip below $8 billion after 2024.

How would this worst-case scenario impact the stock's valuation?"", ""It's hard to use earnings-based valuation metrics in our analysis because Pfizer doesn't release profitability data at a product level. However, we can easily use sales-based valuation metrics."", ""Pfizer's shares currently trade at a trailing-12-month price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 2.37. Based on the company's guidance for 2024, the stock's forward P/S multiple is roughly 2.67 (using the midpoint of the guidance range)."", ""If we backed out all of Pfizer's projected COVID sales, its revenue would be in the ballpark of $52 billion next year. That would give the stock a forward P/S ratio of around 3.08, excluding COVID altogether. Even if Pfizer doesn't generate one penny in COVID sales in 2024, its stock appears to be dirt cheap, compared to other big biopharma stocks."", ""Eli Lilly\xa0and Novo Nordisk are outliers on the above chart for a good reason: The robust sales growth for the companies' weight loss drugs should continue for years to come.

However, the company expects to launch a combo COVID-flu vaccine in 2025 that could revive the franchise somewhat."", 'More importantly, Pfizer has plenty of other growth drivers. Its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine Abrysvo is off to a great start. Sales for migraine drugs Nurtec and Vydura continue to soar.', ""Pfizer expects to add $20 billion in new revenue by 2030 from new drugs and new indications for existing drugs. It hopes to supplement that amount with another $25 billion in revenue by 2030 from business development deals. Notably, these numbers don't include any sales from Pfizer's experimental oral weight loss drug danuglipron, which flopped in a late-stage study."", ""Still, growth investors will probably find other stocks more attractive than Pfizer. Even factoring out the drag from its COVID products, the company won't generate jaw-dropping growth."", ""On the other hand, I think that Pfizer is a no-brainer stock to buy right now for two types of investors. Income investors should love the company's dividend yield of over 5.9%. Value investors should salivate at Pfizer's bargain-basement price."", 'Pfizer stock has admittedly ""Pfizzled"" quite a bit lately, but it could be a ""Pfabulous"" pick for some investors.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Pfizer right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Pfizer, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Pfizer wasn't one of them.

Cathie Wood of Ark Investment Management is much more bullish, estimating that AI software will generate $14 trillion in spending by the end of the decade.', 'With an opportunity of that magnitude, Palantir could parlay the demand for generative AI into significant new revenue streams.', ""Palantir's recent results highlight its progress. For the third quarter, revenue grew 17% year over year to $558 million, fueled by commercial revenue growth of 23%, which outpaced government revenue's 12% increase. That performance resulted in earnings per share (EPS) of $0.03, up from a loss of $0.06 per share in the prior-year quarter."", 'Most importantly, Palantir generated its fourth consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability, which management called ""the most significant profit in the company\'s 20-year history."" Management also pointed out that Palantir is now ""eligible for inclusion in the S&P 500,"" a development that could drive the stock even higher in 2024.', 'Helping fuel the results is the accelerating demand for Palantir\'s Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which it released in the second quarter.

So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. We can see that International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) does use debt in its business. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?"", ""Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together."", ' See our latest analysis for International Business Machines ', 'You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that as of September 2023 International Business Machines had US$54.9b of debt, an increase on US$50.7b, over one year. On the flip side, it has US$11.0b in cash leading to net debt of about US$44.0b.', 'Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that International Business Machines had liabilities of US$30.6b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$75.6b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$11.0b in cash and US$6.51b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$88.7b.', ""This deficit isn't so bad because International Business Machines is worth a massive US$149.3b, and thus could probably raise enough capital to shore up its balance sheet, if the need arose. But we definitely want to keep our eyes open to indications that its debt is bringing too much risk."", ""In order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses."", 'International Business Machines has a debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.2, which signals significant debt, but is still pretty reasonable for most types of business. However, its interest coverage of 10.0 is very high, suggesting that the interest expense on the debt is currently quite low. Importantly, International Business Machines grew its EBIT by 33% over the last twelve months, and that growth will make it easier to handle its debt. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if International Business Machines can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.', 'Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. Happily for any shareholders, International Business Machines actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT over the last three years. That sort of strong cash generation warms our hearts like a puppy in a bumblebee suit.', ""Happily, International Business Machines's impressive conversion of EBIT to free cash flow implies it has the upper hand on its debt. But, on a more sombre note, we are a little concerned by its net debt to EBITDA. When we consider the range of factors above, it looks like International Business Machines is pretty sensible with its use of debt. That means they are taking on a bit more risk, in the hope of boosting shareholder returns. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. Case in point: We've spotted   1 warning sign for International Business Machines  you should be aware of."", ""Of course, if you're the type of investor who prefers buying stocks without the burden of debt, then don't hesitate to discover our exclusive list of net cash growth stocks, today."", 'Have feedback on this article?

Value investing is one of the popular strategies that professional investors have leveraged with great success to squeeze optimum returns in the investment world. It is a strategy that entails focusing on the most undervalued stocks and opening positions when they are about to rally.', 'In value investing, the focus is always on stocks of companies trading below their intrinsic value. This means concentrating on stocks whose share price is much lower than their worth. Such stocks often become winners whenever the overall market realizes their value and starts piling in.', 'Joel Greenblatt is one of the most revered value investors who has perfected the art of analysing the market and coming up with stocks trading below their intrinsic value.

If you want to skip our discussion on the airline industry, you can go directly to the 5 Most Dangerous Airlines In The World.', 'Air transport is essential for the development of the global economy as it facilitates connectivity. It enables the free flow of goods, technology, capital, people, and ideas across the globe to support the economic cycle. However, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic brought an abrupt halt to air transport. This disruption significantly impacted airline operations globally, resulting in the industry experiencing an unprecedented loss of $140 billion in 2020.', ""In 2023, the airline industry witnessed a substantial recovery post-COVID-19. The industry-wide revenue for 2023 is projected to reach $896 billion, surpassing the International Air Transport Association's (IATA) June outlook by $93 billion. The expected profit is also $9.8 billion higher than the previously predicted value. This jump in revenue is due to a significant increase in passenger business throughout the year. Passenger traffic recorded a 40% YoY increase in September and achieved 92.9% of the pre-pandemic levels. Moreover, with the exception of Asia Pacific, all regions worldwide are expected to either reach or exceed the 2019 levels of passenger traffic in 2023. Conversely, the cargo segment of the airline industry faced a slowdown this year, with cargo tons per kilometer being lower than the levels in 2022. The primary reason for this is the deceleration in global trade. However, IATA predicts a 4.54% growth in this segment next year."", ""Even with such a significant and fast turnaround, the airline industry faces its own set of challenges. The most significant of these challenges is the vulnerability of this industry to external factors. These factors include economic slowdown, geo-political challenges, rising oil prices, supply chain issues, and regulatory pressures. \xa0Furthermore, air safety is one of the major concerns affecting airlines' operations. A high-profile air crash can easily tarnish the reputation of an airline, leading to a decline in revenues as passengers switch to competing airlines. Hence, notable companies such as American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL), United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL), and Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) spend millions to ensure compliance with all safety standards and aim to be one of safest airlines in the world. You can also check out the 20 Best Airlines in the World in 2023 here."", ""Here's what Patient Capital Management said about Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:"", '“Airlines returned to trough multiples as higher oil prices pressured costs. Historically, airlines have passed these costs on to customers. We think\xa0Delta Air Lines, Inc.\xa0(NYSE:DAL) is a premium brand valued like its economics aren’t sustainable. With mid-teens returns on capital, significant free cash flow generation, excellent capital allocation and long-term earnings per share growth in the high-single to low-double-digits, we think the company is significantly mispriced.', 'Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL) reversed course in the third quarter, falling 24% from its highs in July. The airlines in general were hurt from rising commodity prices that are leading to increased cost per available seat mile (CASM). Historically, airlines have passed on higher fuel prices to customers with a lag. We see Delta as a premium global consumer brand that is materially misunderstood by the market. The market still sees airlines as a cyclical, bankruptcy prone industry. An improved supply-demand picture, management discipline and a better business mix make Delta a more resilient business. Their loyalty program with American Express is a source of stable and growing revenues with $6.5B in remunerations this year with a goal of reaching $10B by the end of the contract in 2028. Premium and ancillary service revenue should generate 65-70% of the total in the next year or two. The company should continue to generate consistent mid-teens returns on capital. As the market begins to understand, we believe the company will continue to be rewarded. On top of this, free cash flow is expected to expand generating a cumulative ~$11B from ’23-’25, or one-half of its current market cap. As the company pays down debt while growing the dividend and eventually resuming share repurchases, we think the stock will continue to trend higher.”', ""The last few decades have seen significant advances in aircraft engineering, which have rendered aviation the safest mode of travel. In 2022, IATA reported 1.21 accidents per million sectors. This is an improvement of 48% as compared to 2013, when 2.31 accidents per million sectors were reported. While most of the airlines remain safe, there are some which have terrible safety records.

As a result, many dividend-paying stocks have seen their dividend yields -- the ratio of a company's annual dividend to its share price -- fall to less attractive levels for income-seeking investors."", 'But not every stock has participated in the rally, so here are three dividend stocks that look incredibly cheap at current valuations heading into the new year.', 'Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) is a longtime favorite stock of prolific investor Warren Buffett, who first purchased shares through Berkshire Hathaway in 1988. Berkshire Hathaway still owns stock of the beverage giant today, receiving $704 million in dividends in 2022 despite never buying another share after it completed its $1.3 billion investment in 1994.', ""Coca-Cola's stock struggled in 2023, with a total return of roughly -5%.

Again, that might be underselling it, given management's likelihood to raise it in the near future."", ""The company does have a relatively high net debt (total debt minus cash and cash equivalents) of roughly $25 billion, which will become more expensive to service as interest rates remain elevated. That scenario is already starting to play out, with Coca-Cola paying $1.1 billion in interest expense through the third quarter of 2023, a year-over-year increase of 93%. Smartly, Coca-Cola's management has been paying down its net debt, which has declined 22% over the past three years."", ""The good news is that Coca-Cola's revenue and earnings per share (EPS) are on the rise after recent lows.

Welcome to ""Good Buy or Goodbye"" brought to you by E*TRADE from Morgan Stanley. Our goal? To help cut through that noise to navigate the best moves for your portfolio. And today, we\'re scooping out the real estate space, a sector that has gained renewed attention as interest rates have come down.', ""I'm here with Jay Hatfield. He's infrastructure Capital Advisors' CEO. Jay, thanks so much for being here. Appreciate it. So let's get straight to your buy stock, your good buy today which is Boston Properties. And as we kind of talk through this, one of the things that you're looking at is that interest rates will come down."", ""But you kind of have a little bit of a different flavor when we're looking at that, because you're looking at what the Fed is doing versus what the ECB is doing. Why is that important for where rates are going and then the feed through to REITs?"", ""JAY HATFIELD: Well, Julie, what a lot of US investors don't realize is it's really a global bond market. It's fine to just focus on US stocks, because we really dominate the whole world. But bonds are fungible. They have low default rates. And so it's a global market."", ""So we actually started focusing on the fact that rates are running up. And we said, why. Well, it's because the ECB is so tight. Well if they're so tight, their economy can't be doing well. And then when you really look, it's terrible. It's 3% below what the US is running at. So they have a negative growth last quarter. It's tracking at negative 1.2."", ""So we're bullish unlike a lot of strategists that the ECB will cut. We're worried the Fed will be slow. But if the ECB cuts, global rates will drop and that will benefit our markets. We're not dependent, like most people are, on the Fed because we look at all the global bond markets--"", 'JULIE HYMAN: Yeah.', 'JAY HATFIELD: --which really drive interest rates.', ""JULIE HYMAN: Well, real estate investment trusts tend to be interest rate sensitive and benefit when rates come down. So that's one of the things you're looking at--"", 'JAY HATFIELD: Correct.', 'JULIE HYMAN: --when it comes to Boston Properties. But I want to talk specifically about office REITs and why a company like Boston Properties because offices have not been in favor.', 'JAY HATFIELD: Right.', 'JULIE HYMAN: So why is that going to change?', 'JAY HATFIELD: Yeah, so offices in general are really well hated as some of them should be.', 'JULIE HYMAN: Yeah.', 'JAY HATFIELD: But the distinction that has to be drawn is between really a-plus offices like we have here in Manhattan, for instance. Boston Properties owns what used to be called the General Motors building. So like a real trophy asset. And for the sectors that they cater to like financial services, they do work from office.', ""When I started on Wall Street, we did LFO which is live from office. And so unless you want to be fired in financial services, you do go in. And AI, when you talk to brokers, is a very in-office. That's all-hands-on-deck. Also LFO. So we think the fundamentals are improving but only for a-plus buildings. We're not saying run out and buy every office [? three. ?] This is the best largest premier developer in the United States."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Gotcha. And then you're also looking at the valuation here. Your price target, if you look at the funds from operations which is a measure of cash flow that folks look at when they're measuring REITs, your price target on that base is $94."", ""JAY HATFIELD: Correct, yes. So we think that another way to look at valuation is just it's a simple number. It's the cap rate. So that's just the cash return on investment. So normally-- so normally, these trophy office buildings used to be at 4% to 5% cap rates. Now they're at 7% And so we think there's a 20% to 30% as they start to catch up to where they were before. And in fact, BXP is down 50% since the pandemic on a price basis."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. And one of the things we like to ask first is what could go wrong with this bullish case here. And maybe we don't see rates go down at the--"", ""JAY HATFIELD: Right. Yeah, so we probably have the highest target on Wall Street for the S&P. So we're at 5500, which is a Goldilocks scenario, 2% growth, falling interest rates. So particularly, if rates did not fall like say-- let's say the ECB doesn't cut, which is, I guess, possible, not prudent, but possible, I could definitely see the Fed not cutting and maybe rates go higher."", ""And BXP and most REITs are more than 50% correlated with interest rates. So you're absolutely not going to make money, unless rates keep dropping."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Gotcha. OK, so let's get to the stock that you want to avoid and that's Prologis which has done very well, right? And that's part of your case. But what we're seeing now-- and Prologis is an owner of warehouse space. And so you say now as we're seeing the pandemic boom sort of slow down, online retailers are not expanding as much in the warehouse."", ""JAY HATFIELD: Correct. And then the other thing that if you really think about warehouse space, it's easy to replicate. So if you drive on I-95, you'll see a lot of Prologis but very difficult to replicate office. So there's very few, if any, offices being built, but a lot of new space coming on."", ""And as you mentioned, Amazon is trying to optimize their distribution. So it's not like it's terrible. But this is a premium valuation, which is another point, I guess, but--"", ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, let's-- let's talk about that real quick, because I did look at a chart here of these price to FFO that--"", 'JAY HATFIELD: Right--', ""JULIE HYMAN: [INAUDIBLE] that we earlier talked about. Here's Prologis. And this is a five-year chart. It's a longer term chart. And here's BXP which--"", 'JAY HATFIELD: Right.', 'JULIE HYMAN: --looks at that valuation gap.', ""JAY HATFIELD: Yeah, so they're trading at 24 times. BXP is at 10. And again, if you think the other way to look at it is cap rates that they're going to compress. Because these are both trophy properties. If you've got these CBD and the gateway cities, they're going to be worth a lot at some point, if the fundamentals improve just as they are for PLD."", ""So we think that the gap will close. But we're not really saying short PLD because we think that BXP will come up and get closer--"", 'JULIE HYMAN: Gotcha.', 'JAY HATFIELD: --to PLD.', 'JULIE HYMAN: And then your final point on this one too is that you think small caps are going to do a bit better and Prologis is now the largest REIT by--', 'JAY HATFIELD: Correct.', 'JULIE HYMAN: --market cap.', ""JAY HATFIELD: Yeah, that's 11 times bigger than BXP. So it's defensive just like large cap tech is. So it's what people buy Or hedge funds will go long, PLD in short if the market's bad."", ""JULIE HYMAN: So what's the risk to this bearish call here? It's kind of the-- the flip--"", 'JAY HATFIELD: I would--', 'JULIE HYMAN: --of the--', 'JAY HATFIELD: --say--', 'JULIE HYMAN: --other.', ""JAY HATFIELD: Well, the interest rates are tough. But also if there's a recession in the US, you'd really want to be in PLD. It's more defensive. Office space is very variable. We already saw-- we think the cycle is over. But financial services, companies lay off. We saw tech layoffs a couple of years ago."", 'So if we have a major recession, office employment will get much harder, get hit harder than just warehouse space. And also the occupancy rate now is higher on warehouse. So it will act defensively. And you really should have flipped the good buy and goodbye.', ""JULIE HYMAN: And just quickly, what's your positions in the two stocks?"", ""JAY HATFIELD: Yeah, so BXP, we hold in our large cap dividend fund, ICAP, and also in our hedge fund. And then, thankfully, we have no position in PLD. So sometimes, we actually will have small positions in companies we think will underperform. But we don't have any position in PLD."", ""JULIE HYMAN: All right, Jay, I'm going to sum up what we have talked about here. We're going to recap. You're telling investors to buy Boston Properties based on attractive valuations, expectations for strong leasing demand for office buildings, and REITs, overall, continue to rally offices, in particular."", ""On the other side, you're saying avoid Prologis, the warehouse boom slowing down. Online retailers aren't spending as much. And the stock's valuation. Looks full. Jay Hatfield, thank you so much for being here. Really appreciate it."", 'JAY HATFIELD: Great. Thanks, Julie.']"

WRB, and Eldorado Gold EGO that could be compelling picks to tap the trend.', 'Let’s discuss these events in detail below with the stocks:', 'Technology has turned out to be the most profitable sector in 2023, driven by the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, easing inflation and a surge in “Magnificent Seven” stocks. Additionally, bets that the Fed’s aggressive interest rate hiking campaign might be nearing an end powered the rally in the sector in recent months. As the tech sector relies on borrowing for superior growth, it is cheaper to borrow more money for initiatives when interest rates are low.Investors should bet on the stocks that are yet to catch up with the broader sector rally.

The rally came on the back of broad enthusiasm about U.S. interest rate cuts and the imminent regulatory approval for Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin halving, scheduled for April 2024, added to the strength.

Block has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of A."", 'Inflation in the United States has been cooling, with the Consumer Price Index edging down for the second consecutive month in November. Inflation has now fallen significantly to 3.1% from a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022. Lower inflation often leads to decreased interest rates and heightened consumer spending, which, in turn, boost the demand for stocks. This heightened demand is further fueled by robust company revenues, ultimately culminating in an appreciation of share prices. Thus, growth stocks tend to perform better when inflation is low.Although most companies will benefit from this trend, Royal Caribbean looks more appropriate. This cruise company owns and operates three global brands — Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Azamara Club Cruises. With a market cap of $32.8 billion, the stock has surged 22.7% over the past month. Royal Caribbean has an estimated growth rate of 38.1% for 2024. It has a Zacks ETF Rank #1 and a VGM Score of B.', 'In the latest meeting, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted at a major policy shift as inflation is easing and the economy is holding up better. He signaled three rate cuts for the next year, compared with the previous forecast of two rate cuts in 2024. The federal funds rate is expected to be in the range of 4.4-4.9%, down from the current 5.25% to 5.50%. This indicates that the Fed will cut rates by a total of 0.75% next year, indicating that the historic rate-hiking campaign might be ending.Lower interest rates generally lead to reduced borrowing costs, which can stimulate economic growth. This can positively impact sectors like real estate, consumer discretionary and financial services, which are typically sensitive to interest rate changes. In real estate, for instance, lower rates can boost housing market activity by making mortgages more affordable. For consumer discretionary sectors, reduced borrowing costs can lead to increased consumer spending. In the financial sector, while lower rates can compress net interest margins for banks, they can also encourage lending and potentially lead to increased consumer and business loan activity.As a result, investors could bet on any of these sectors to magnify gains in 2024. In particular, the most beaten-down stocks of 2023 could outperform in 2024. One exciting option could be W.R. Berkley, which is one of the nation’s largest commercial lines property casualty insurance providers.The stock is down about 3% this year but has the potential to move higher in 2024, given its Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of B. Additionally, W.R. Berkley saw a positive earnings estimate revision of 3 cents over the past 30 days for 2024, with an estimated growth rate of 20.2%.', 'The allure of gold has returned in recent months on a decline in bond yields and a weaker U.S. dollar. A potential shift in monetary policy coupled with geopolitical tension presents an intriguing scenario for investors looking into 2024. Lower interest rates are usually good for gold, as it weakens the U.S. dollar. A weak dollar makes bullion cheaper for overseas buyers, thereby driving gold prices higher.Additionally, geopolitical tensions like the Israel-Hamas conflict will continue to raise safe-haven buying, making gold attractive. Gold is often used as a means of preserving wealth during times of financial and political uncertainty. It usually does well when other asset classes struggle.Given the optimism, investors have a long list of options to tap into the metal’s rally. Eldorado Gold, having a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of A, seems attractive. It is a gold-producing and exploration company with assets in Greece, Türkiye and Canada. It has a market cap of $2.7 billion.

VRSN, Block SQ, Royal Caribbean Cruises RCL, W.R. Berkley Corp. WRB and Eldorado Gold EGO.', 'Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:', 'With just a few trading days left, 2023 is turning out to be a banner year for Wall Street after several twists and turns. The three major indices have been on a blistering rally to end the year and have hit new highs on several occasions, buoyed by the tech surge, cooling inflation and the optimism that the Fed is done with interest rate hikes.', 'The Nasdaq Composite emerged as the outperformer, gaining 43.2%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial have risen 23.8% and 12.8%, respectively. The strong trend is likely to continue in the New Year as well.', 'Investors should consider stocks such as VeriSign Inc., Block, Royal Caribbean Cruises, W.R. Berkley Corp. and Eldorado Gold that could be compelling picks to tap the trend.', ""Let's discuss these events in detail below with the stocks:"", 'Technology has turned out to be the most profitable sector in 2023, driven by the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, easing inflation and a surge in ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks. Additionally, bets that the Fed\'s aggressive interest rate hiking campaign might be nearing an end powered the rally in the sector in recent months. As the tech sector relies on borrowing for superior growth, it is cheaper to borrow more money for initiatives when interest rates are low.', ""Investors should bet on the stocks that are yet to catch up with the broader sector rally. These stocks have a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), a strong VGM Score of B or better, and a positive earnings growth rate for 2024. While there are many in the sector, VeriSign, with a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of B, seems an intriguing option. The stock has gained just 0.5% in 2023, suggesting room for upside potential. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here."", 'VeriSign provides Internet infrastructure services that include domain name registry services and infrastructure assurance services. It has an estimated earnings growth rate of 9.4% for the next year.', ""The world's largest cryptocurrency started 2023 just above $16,000 and climbed to a 12-month high of $45,000 in early December. The rally came on the back of broad enthusiasm about U.S. interest rate cuts and the imminent regulatory approval for Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin halving, scheduled for April 2024, added to the strength. Bitcoin's performance in 2023 has outpaced other assets like global stocks and gold. Bitcoin mining companies have outperformed Bitcoin by a wide margin amid the recent bullish price action in the largest cryptocurrency. This trend is likely to continue."", 'Block, formerly known as Square, offers financial and marketing services through its comprehensive commerce ecosystem that helps sellers start, run and grow their businesses. It saw a solid earnings estimate revision of 75 cents over the past 90 days for 2024 and has an estimated growth rate of 53.2%. Block has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of A.', 'Inflation in the United States has been cooling, with the Consumer Price Index edging down for the second consecutive month in November. Inflation has now fallen significantly to 3.1% from a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022. Lower inflation often leads to decreased interest rates and heightened consumer spending, which, in turn, boost the demand for stocks. This heightened demand is further fueled by robust company revenues, ultimately culminating in an appreciation of share prices. Thus, growth stocks tend to perform better when inflation is low.', 'Although most companies will benefit from this trend,Royal Caribbean looks more appropriate. This cruise company owns and operates three global brands — Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Azamara Club Cruises. With a market cap of $32.8 billion, the stock has surged 22.7% over the past month. Royal Caribbean has an estimated growth rate of 38.1% for 2024. It has a Zacks ETF Rank #1 and a VGM Score of B.', 'In the latest meeting, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted at a major policy shift as inflation is easing and the economy is holding up better. He signaled three rate cuts for the next year, compared with the previous forecast of two rate cuts in 2024. The federal funds rate is expected to be in the range of 4.4-4.9%, down from the current 5.25% to 5.50%. This indicates that the Fed will cut rates by a total of 0.75% next year, indicating that the historic rate-hiking campaign might be ending.', 'Lower interest rates generally lead to reduced borrowing costs, which can stimulate economic growth. This can positively impact sectors like real estate, consumer discretionary and financial services, which are typically sensitive to interest rate changes. In real estate, for instance, lower rates can boost housing market activity by making mortgages more affordable. For consumer discretionary sectors, reduced borrowing costs can lead to increased consumer spending. In the financial sector, while lower rates can compress net interest margins for banks, they can also encourage lending and potentially lead to increased consumer and business loan activity.', ""As a result, investors could bet on any of these sectors to magnify gains in 2024. In particular, the most beaten-down stocks of 2023 could outperform in 2024. One exciting option could be W.R. Berkley, which is one of the nation's largest commercial lines property casualty insurance providers."", 'The stock is down about 3% this year but has the potential to move higher in 2024, given its Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of B. Additionally, W.R. Berkley saw a positive earnings estimate revision of 3 cents over the past 30 days for 2024, with an estimated growth rate of 20.2%.', 'The allure of gold has returned in recent months on a decline in bond yields and a weaker U.S. dollar. A potential shift in monetary policy coupled with geopolitical tension presents an intriguing scenario for investors looking into 2024. Lower interest rates are usually good for gold, as it weakens the U.S. dollar. A weak dollar makes bullion cheaper for overseas buyers, thereby driving gold prices higher.', 'Additionally, geopolitical tensions like the Israel-Hamas conflict will continue to raise safe-haven buying, making gold attractive. Gold is often used as a means of preserving wealth during times of financial and political uncertainty. It usually does well when other asset classes struggle.', ""Given the optimism, investors have a long list of options to tap into the metal's rally. Eldorado Gold, having a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of A, seems attractive. It is a gold-producing and exploration company with assets in Brazil and Turkey. It has a market cap of $2.7 billion. Eldorado Gold has an estimated earnings growth rate of 24% for 2024 and saw a positive earnings estimate of 15 cents over the past three months."", ""Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

Additionally, selecting individual stocks can become overwhelming.

The most common one would be a basic 60/40 portfolio. A basic 60/40 portfolio would give 60% weightage to the S&P 500 and 40% weightage to US treasuries. Due to the low volatility of bonds, people with little financial knowledge could also go for a bond-heavy portfolio.

We own a stake in AerCap and ALD Automotive, two companies with very similar businesses in their essence. In short, these entities borrow money to acquire assets (aircraft and automobiles, respectively), lease them for a period of time (on average, seven and four years) and sell them at the end of their contract (in the case of AerCap, the longer useful life of its aircraft means that the contracts are usually renewed at maturity). If these companies were to operate like a bank, they would borrow at very short maturities and would have to continually roll over that financing to avoid falling into an unsustainable liquidity risk, should they have to repay their debt (their assets are leased). However, as we have already seen, operating with such a maturity mismatch would be a recipe for failure. In fact, Guinness Peat Aviation, the company that pioneered the aircraft leasing business in the 1970s and 1980s, ended up going bankrupt (among others), for over-reliance on short-term financing.32 A lesson never to be forgotten by Aengus Kelly, CEO of AerCap and the person who inherited the unloved assets of Guinness Peat Aviation after its sale to GECAS in 1996 (by a twist of fate, Kelly eventually acquired GECAS two years ago)…” (Click here to read the full text)', 'Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75', 'The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is an Ohio-based company that manufactures and markets fast-moving consumer goods.', 'According to Insider Monkey’s database that tracks 910 elite hedge funds, 75 funds had investments in The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)’s stock in the third quarter, compared to 74 in the previous quarter.

The acquisition, which is expected to close in early 2024, brings together Tapestry’s Coach, Kate Spade and\xa0Stuart Weitzman labels\xa0with Capri’s Michael Kors,\xa0Versace\xa0and Jimmy Choo brands to create a $12 billion giant. As FN sister publication WWD noted, it is the closest America has yet come to building a luxury branded portfolio powerhouse in the image of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton or Kering, which posted 79.2 billion euros in sales, and 20.35 billion euros in sales, respectively, for 2022.', 'Authentic Brands Group is arguably the most acquisitive fashion company in the U.S., and the New York-based firm added several new properties in 2023, including Hunter Boots, Vince and Rockport. Its most significant purchase, though, was for Boardriders (the parent of Quiksilver, Billabong, Roxy, RVCA,\xa0DC Shoes, Element, VonZipper, Honolua and Boardriders) for a reported $1.25 billion. When that deal closed in September, Authentic’s annual retail sales jumped to over $29 billion. And in the following months, it has signed numerous footwear licensing deals for its new brands, with companies including Aldo Group, Marc Fisher Footwear and Warson Brands.', 'Amid reports that Farfetch was headed for administration, the retail conglomerate — whose assets include Browns, New Guards Group, Stadium Goods, a stake in Neiman Marcus and its Platform Solutions IP — announced on Dec. 18 that it had found a lifeline. Asian firm Coupang agreed to pump $500 million in emergency funding into the company as part of a “pre-pack” administration process. The company will now be fully controlled by Coupang, though founder, CEO and chairman Jose Neves will remain on board. As part of the deal, Farfetch will be pulled off the New York Stock Exchange, and its agreement to purchase Yoox Net-a-porter from Richemont has been terminated.', 'On Dec. 20, Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group revealed it had purchased 100 percent of Matches in a deal valued at 52 million pounds, a fraction of the $1 billion price that private equity firm Apax was reported to have paid for it in 2017. According to FN sister publication WWD, the sale came after six years of poor management by Apax, which plowed millions into the store but fundamentally misunderstood what was required to run a luxury retailer. Matches CEO Nick Beighton is expected to continue running the company and “unlocking synergies” with Frasers, a premium fashion chain built on the ashes of the mid-market House of Fraser department stores.', 'Steven Madden Inc. signaled a bigger move into the apparel space in October, when the footwear company announced it bought Almost Famous in a $52 million cash deal. Almost Famous has been the exclusive licensee of the Madden NYC apparel line since its launch in 2022 and also makes private label goods for mass merchants, department stores and off-pricers. Chairman and CEO Ed Rosenfeld said at the time that Almost Famous was a “strong complement” to Madden’s existing apparel business, thanks to its expertise in junior apparel and strength in value-priced channels.', 'Amid several quarters of revenue declines, Wolverine Worldwide took aggressive steps this year to off-load underperforming assets. It kicked off the year by selling the Keds brand to Designer Brands Inc. in February for an undisclosed amount. DBI, which is the parent company of DSW, was previously Keds’ largest wholesale customer. As part of the deal, it acquired all Keds products, including the Pro-Keds sneaker line, and the brand’s e-commerce business. Wolverine and DBI also expanded their licensing agreement for Hush Puppies, making DBI the exclusive licensee for Hush Puppies across all channels in the U.S. and Canada, and giving it management of the brand’s DTC e-commerce and possible wholesale business.

Philippe Fortunato, CEO of fashion and accessories maisons at Richemont, said at the time of the announcement that Richemont’s main goal would be to maintain the designer’s commitment to quality and creativity, while helping to fuel its long-term development. Rossi is to be grouped in the company’s “other” category, which includes handbag purveyor Delvaux, Montblanc, Chloé, Alaïa and Dunhill, among others.', 'Titan Industries founder and CEO Joe Ouaknine secured two important deals in 2023. The first came in June, when it acquired the French footwear brand Clergerie — saving it from liquidation. Titan paid 700,000 euros to buy the Clergerie name, with a commitment of 6 million euros of investment, and at the time of the buyout told FN it was committed to maintaining 45 percent of the workforce. Then in July, Titan announced a partnership with veteran footwear executive Tamara Mellon, giving both parties an equal stake in the Tamara Mellon shoe business. As part of the deal, Titan took over production of the collections and now manages its direct-to-consumer channels. Mellon continues to lead all aspects of creative and design.', 'In May, Qurate Retail Inc. sold the money-losing Zulily business to Los Angeles-based private equity firm Regent LP for an undisclosed amount. At the time, Qurate CEO David Rawlinson said, “We are confident Regent is the right partner for Zulily to continue serving its customers.” However, any turnaround efforts appear to have come to an end. In early December, the Zulily website formally announced a company shutdown and layoffs that will total about 800 when all offices and warehouses close. The site also began liquidating inventory, with markdowns of 70 to 85 percent off many fashion and home categories.', 'Arezzo & Co., the Brazilian conglomerate behind brands such as Arezzo, Schutz and\xa0Alexandre Birman, acquired a majority stake in hip Italian footwear label\xa0Paris Texas in March. Arezzo & Co. invested 25 million euros to take over 65 percent of the brand that Annamaria Brivio launched in 2015, which generated sales of around 15 million euros last year. This marked the first international acquisition for Arezzo, which is led by CEO Alexandre Birman, who said that having relevance in Italy is crucial for his company’s expansion in the luxury women’s footwear space.', 'After acquiring the Moosejaw outdoor retail business from Walmart in February for an undisclosed amount, Dick’s Sporting Goods wasted little time with consolidations. In September, it announced that 11 Moosejaw\xa0retail\xa0stores would close as part of an internal realignment, leaving just three brick-and-mortar locations in Birmingham, Mich.; Salt Lake City, Utah; and Bentonville, Ark.

Its ultra-powerful chips have become the gold standard for training and running the most advanced AI models. The company reportedly sold half a million AI GPUs in the third quarter, mostly to hyperscale cloud companies racing to boost their AI capacity.', ""Nvidia isn't the only AI stock that has rewarded investors this year. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), known best for its PC and server CPUs, is tapping into the booming AI market in numerous ways. The company hasn't yet recorded blockbuster growth from the AI market like Nvidia has, but it's in a great position to be a major player in all things AI in the years ahead."", ""Investors are starting to see that potential -- they've sent Intel stock up more than 80% so far in 2023. That's the best performance since 2003 for the iconic chip stock."", 'Intel is betting that enabling AI workloads to run anywhere, from powerful cloud servers to laptops, will be its path to victory in the AI market.', ""The company already competes in the AI accelerator market. While Nvidia's A100 and H100 GPUs are by far the most widely used accelerators, Intel has drummed up plenty of interest in its Gaudi2 AI chip. Intel acquired Habana Labs, the company behind Gaudi, in 2019, and it has had the good sense to keep the product line around as it killed off non-core businesses left and right. Intel's AI accelerator pipeline, which should eventually translate into revenue, was nearly $2 billion at the end of the third quarter."", ""Gaudi2 can't match Nvidia's chips in performance, but it does offer a solid mix of performance and efficiency. Gaudi3, the follow-up to Gaudi2, is officially due sometime in 2024 and should deliver market share gains for Intel. Following Gaudi3, Intel plans to merge its Gaudi and AI GPU lineups."", 'Intel\'s powerful AI accelerators are a promising line of business, but the company is betting that AI inference (the act of running an already-trained AI model) will be the biggest opportunity. ""Fundamentally, the inference market is where the game will be at,"" CEO Pat Gelsinger said at a recent event.', ""Intel is now baking AI hardware into its CPUs. In the server market, its Sapphire Rapids chips and now its Emerald Rapids chips include built-in AI accelerators. While the largest AI models still require powerful GPUs or other stand-alone accelerators, smaller models can be capably run on Intel's CPUs alone."", ""Its PC chips are also getting in on the action. Meteor Lake, the latest generation of Intel's PC CPUs, which launched this month, includes a new AI processor that can take on inference workloads like blurring the background in a video call or powering advanced features in creative software. By removing the load from the CPU and GPU, Meteor Lake can run AI workloads without tying up the system or destroying the battery life."", ""Outside of making its own AI chips, Intel's foundry business is positioned to manufacture AI chips for third parties. The company remains on track to bring its advanced Intel 18A manufacturing process online by the end of 2024. If Intel can pull it off and surpass foundry leader TSMC in terms of process technology, AI chips ranging from powerful accelerators to smartphone SoCs with built-in AI smarts could be rolling off Intel's production lines in 2025 and beyond."", ""For investors looking to profit from the AI revolution, Intel has more ways to win than Nvidia, AMD, or any other AI chip company. Nvidia will be tough to beat in the AI accelerator market, and AMD is making plenty of noise with its newest AI chips. But a few years from now, both companies could be seriously considering using Intel's foundries to manufacture their chips if it takes the technological lead over TSMC."", 'Built-in AI hardware could also trigger a PC refresh cycle or shift some data center spending back to CPUs capable of running AI workloads. Regardless of how the AI market evolves, Intel will enjoy an AI tailwind for years to come.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Intel, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Intel wasn't one of them.

Economic headwinds like high inflation and rising interest rates forced consumers to spend less money in segments like personal computing and gaming, which sent demand for traditional chips plummeting."", ""Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) was a poster child for that weakness earlier this year, but its recent financial results for the fiscal 2024 first quarter (ended Nov. 30) suggest a comeback is underway. Here's why it's time to buy the stock."", ""Micron is a leading producer of memory (DRAM) and storage (NAND) chips. That hardware isn't quite as exciting as the glamorous GPUs produced by Nvidia that have become the beating heart of the data center, but they are equally important, especially under the demand of AI workloads."", ""Micron's new high-bandwidth memory chip (HBM3E) has been designed specifically for generative AI applications, with 10% more output and 30% less power consumption than competing hardware. HBM3E was selected by Nvidia to power its new flagship H200 data center chip, which is expected to extend the company's advantage over its competitors in the GPU space."", ""Micron is now gearing up for a monumental shift toward AI at the edge. While most of the AI action is happening in the data center right now, it's about to move to every new computer, device, and car in the world. Micron says AI-enabled industrial computers, for example, require three to five times more memory than standard computers. That calls for more advanced chips that sell at a higher price, and that's great news for Micron."", 'Leading CPU and GPU maker Advanced Micro Devices is already bringing AI chips to over 50 notebook computer designs in partnership with tech giants like Microsoft. Each of those devices will require increased DRAM and NAND capacity compared to traditional models, which spells profits for suppliers like Micron.', ""Micron's consumer segments struggled lately due to slowing sales of computers, devices, and gaming products. That led to an oversupply of chips and a huge inventory glut, which sent prices plunging. The company's revenue for fiscal 2023 (ended Aug. 31) sank by a whopping 50% year over year."", 'While those segments remain soft, they are improving, and Micron expects them to return to growth in calendar year 2024.', ""But the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was all about the data center. Micron's compute and networking segment generated $1.7 billion in revenue, and while that figure was flat year over year, it was up 45% compared to just three months ago. It was led by an increase in AI-related shipments, as well as normalized inventory conditions, which could drive prices higher in the coming quarters."", ""With relatively modest results in Micron's two other segments, compute and networking helped drive the company's total revenue to $4.7 billion, a 16% year-over-year jump. It was a welcome beginning to the new fiscal year following the dismal fiscal 2023."", ""Micron still has some work to do to bring its bottom line back to profitability. The company lost $1.2 billion in Q1, which translated into negative earnings per share of $1.12. It marked a continuation of the company's trend of losses from fiscal 2023."", ""But better times are coming, according to management. The high end of Micron's guidance for the upcoming fiscal 2024 second quarter points to a possible $0.07 in earnings per share (profit). The company also expects to bring in $5.3 billion in revenue, which would mark an accelerated growth rate of almost 30% year over year."", ""Micron stock trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 6.1, which is the most expensive level in at least a decade. But there are two reasons that shouldn't deter investors from buying shares:"", 'AI is driving valuations higher across the semiconductor industry. Advanced Micro Devices trades at a P/S ratio of 10.4, and Nvidia has a P/S ratio of 27.4. Both are also near their highs of the last decade.', ""The P/S ratio is calculated based on trailing revenue, and we know Micron's sales collapsed in fiscal 2023. Looking ahead, Wall Street expects the company's revenue to increase 30% to $20.3 billion in fiscal 2024, which would reduce its P/S ratio to 4.7 on a forward basis."", ""Plus, analysts think Micron's revenue growth could accelerate again to 41% in fiscal 2025. Micron believes it's at the start of a multiyear growth phase driven by generative AI, and now could be investors' chance to buy the stock ahead of a continued upswing in its business."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Micron Technology right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Micron Technology, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Micron Technology wasn't one of them.

The ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed to all-time highs, while the benchmark S&P 500 and growth-fueled Nasdaq Composite find themselves within striking distance of respective record closes."", ""Though there are a number of factors responsible for pushing the broader market higher in 2023, including an expected easing of Federal Reserve monetary policy in the new year, it's artificial intelligence (AI) that stands head and shoulders above seemingly every other catalyst."", 'When I say ""AI,"" I\'m talking about the use of software and systems in combination with machine learning (ML) to handle tasks that would normally be undertaken or overseen by humans. The use of ML allows AI-driven software and systems to grow smarter and become more efficient at their tasks over time. Because AI has theoretical utility in all sectors and industries, analysts at PwC see it adding $15.7 trillion to global gross domestic product by 2030.', ""This massive opportunity isn't lost on Wall Street. Based on the high-water price targets set by a select group of Wall Street analysts, three AI stocks are expected to surge by 48% to 123% in 2024."", ""If there's a stock that's become the face of the AI revolution, its semiconductor giant Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Shares of the company are higher by 237% this year, as of the closing bell on Dec. 26, with a market cap gain of nearly $859 billion."", ""However, this outperformance could be just the tip of the iceberg, according to analyst Hans Mosesmann of Rosenblatt Securities. Mosesmann has placed a lofty $1,100 price target on Nvidia, which implies additional upside of 123%. If Mosesmann's forecast is correct, he expects Nvidia's market cap to grow by $1.5 trillion in the new year."", 'Nvidia has established itself as the infrastructure backbone of the AI movement. The company\'s A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) are the effective ""brains"" powering split-second decision-making in AI-accelerated data centers. Analysts at Citigroup estimate that Nvidia\'s AI-inspired GPUs could control a greater than 90% share of AI GPUs utilized in high-compute data centers in 2024.', ""But the kingpin of AI also has the potential to be done in by its own success. With chip fabrication company Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing increasing its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity, Nvidia will be able to meet more enterprise demand in the coming year. On the flipside, a lack of AI-GPU scarcity could quickly erode the phenomenal pricing power on its A100 and H100 GPUs that have fueled its sales growth. This means Nvidia's gross margin could sink as sales of A100 and H100 chips ramp up."", ""Furthermore, U.S. regulators have been limiting exports of Nvidia's top AI-powered chips to the world's No. 2 economy, China. Nvidia has even had export restrictions placed on toned-down versions of its AI-driven chips developed specifically for the Chinese market. China typically accounts for 20% (or more) of Nvidia's annual sales."", ""Although it's been a truly banner year for Nvidia, reaching Mosesmann's price target in 2024, or anytime soon, looks like a pipe dream."", 'A second artificial intelligence stock with mammoth upside potential is China-based Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU). Despite it being up just fractionally (0.2%) on a year-to-date basis, one analyst sees this search engine juggernaut nearly doubling in 2024.', ""According to Bank of America Securities analyst Eddie Leung, Baidu shares can ascend to $222 in the new year. If Leung's prognostication proves accurate, it would value Baidu at 20 times forecast earnings per share in 2024, which is still a reasonable valuation for a company with an extensive history of double-digit sales and earnings growth."", ""Baidu is best-known for its leading internet search engine. In November, the company achieved a nearly 69% search share in the world's No. 2 economy by gross domestic product. Looking back nine years, Baidu has fairly consistently sustained a 60% to 85% share of China's internet search market. This makes it the obvious go-to for businesses wanting to target consumers, and affords Baidu excellent ad pricing power."", ""But what makes the Baidu growth story so exciting is the company's AI ties. Baidu is one of the country's leading AI-driven cloud service providers. It also operates Apollo Go, which is the world's most successful autonomous ride-hailing service, based on the 4.1 million rides it's provided since inception. Leaning on artificial intelligence has helped drive Baidu's non-online marketing sales higher by double digits (in most quarters) on a year-over-year basis."", 'The other potential catalyst for Baidu is the rebound of the Chinese economy following the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic. China\'s regulators abandoned the controversial ""zero-COVID"" mitigation strategy in December 2022. Though it\'s taking time to work out persistent supply chain kinks, the economy is well positioned for expansion, which should favor a recurringly profitable juggernaut like Baidu.', ""While a 94% gain in 2024 would be a tall task, it's not out of the question."", ""The third artificial intelligence stock with meaningful upside in 2024, at least according to one Wall Street analyst, is electric vehicle (EV) maker Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). Tesla's EVs incorporate AI technology into its advanced driver assistance systems, which includes its full self-driving subscription."", ""Even though shares of North America's leading EV producer have increased by 108% this year, through Dec. 26, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas believes they'll march higher by another 48% in the new year to $380. Jonas's price target values Tesla at roughly $1.2 trillion."", 'One of the reasons Jonas is depressing the accelerator on Tesla is the rollout of its newest vehicle, the Cybertruck. Tesla began deliveries for its Cybertruck on Nov. 30. CEO Elon Musk has previously noted that his company had over 1 million reservations for Cybertruck; but keep in mind that only a $100 fully refundable deposit was required to get in line.', ""Jonas is also intrigued by Tesla's push to become more than just a car company. Its energy generation, storage, and services segments are, collectively, generating a gross profit. Moving beyond selling and leasing EVs has the potential to minimize Tesla's sensitivity to cyclical swings in the U.S. and global economy."", ""However, I'd add to the above that Tesla's ancillary segments generate low margins. The company's profitability is almost entirely dependent on selling and leasing EVs, along with selling renewable energy credits and generating interest income on its cash."", ""What's incredibly worrisome for North America's leading EV company is that its operating margin has been more than halved over the trailing year (ended Sept. 30). Musk stated during the company's annual shareholder meeting in May that Tesla's pricing strategy is dictated by demand. With Model's 3, S, X, and Y all enduring more than a half-dozen price cuts in 2023, it pretty clearly signals that inventory levels are rising and demand isn't what it once was."", 'Further, Musk brings added risk to the table. Musk has frequently failed to deliver on touted innovations and has, on a couple of occasions, found himself in the crosshairs of securities regulators.', ""Between these factors and Tesla's egregiously high valuation for an auto stock (68 times forward earnings), it's unlikely that Jonas' lofty price target will be met in 2024."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

The common link between these two companies is that they have been disruptive leaders in their markets. Netflix disrupted the movie rental industry and eventually pioneered the content streaming market. Nvidia brought its expertise in gaming graphics cards to the data center market and is now playing a central role in the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI).', ""This article, however, isn't about Nvidia or Netflix. Instead, I'll focus on the prospects of SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) -- a company that's very small right now but is sitting on a massive addressable market. Let's see if SoundHound AI could replicate Nvidia and Netflix's stock market performance and convert $100,000 into a million dollars."", 'SoundHound AI serves the nascent conversational intelligence market, an industry that is gaining prominence thanks to the growing adoption of voice-enabled AI solutions. Grand View Research estimates that the global conversational intelligence market could clock annual growth of almost 24% through the end of the decade. The firm points out that this market was worth $7.6 billion last year, and the projected growth suggests that it could generate almost $42 billion in revenue in 2030.', 'SoundHound AI is looking to capitalize on this market with its Voice AI platform, which allows companies to develop and deploy multiple AI-enabled voice features such as automatic speech recognition, natural language understanding, text-to-speech, and custom wake commands. The company provides custom AI-powered voice solutions to multiple industries such as automotive, restaurants, contact centers, banking, retail, and others.', ""The good part is that SoundHound AI has built an impressive customer base, which includes the likes of Stellantis, Hyundai, Qualcomm, Honda, Square, Snap, and others. What's more, SoundHound estimates that its total addressable market could be as big as $160 billion by 2026 thanks to the multiple industries that it serves."", 'The good part is that SoundHound is already benefiting from this massive market opportunity, as its recent results indicate.', 'SoundHound AI has generated almost $29 million in revenue in the first nine months of 2023. It has guided for $18 million in revenue in the current quarter at the midpoint of its guidance range, which would put its annual revenue at $47 million.', ""While that's a small number in the context of Wall Street, it is worth noting that SoundHound's guidance points toward a 51% year-over-year increase in revenue. That's higher than the 47% revenue growth the company clocked in 2022. Even better, analysts are expecting SoundHound AI to sustain its healthy revenue growth over the next two years."", ""However, don't be surprised to see SoundHound outperform analysts' expectations. That's because the company has a cumulative bookings backlog worth $342 million. This points toward a healthy revenue pipeline, as bookings ideally refer to the value of contracts signed with customers."", ""As the chart above indicates, SoundHound AI is estimated to generate a combined revenue of $165 million in 2024 and 2025. As the company is sitting on a much bigger backlog, it can cruise past those expectations and deliver solid gains to investors. But can SoundHound AI stock rise enough in the long run to turn a $100,000 investment into a million? Let's find out."", 'We have seen that SoundHound generated annual revenue of $31 million in 2022, and its top line is expected to hit almost $96 million in 2025, according to the chart in the previous section. That would translate into a three-year revenue compound annual growth rate of 45%.', 'The fast-growing nature of the market SoundHound operates in and the massive addressable opportunity the company is sitting on suggests that it could maintain a healthy pace of growth over the long run. We saw earlier in the article that the conversational intelligence market is predicted to clock 24% annual growth through 2030.', ""Assuming SoundHound can match the market's growth from 2026 to 2030, its top line could jump to $280 million at the end of the decade (using 2025's projected revenue of $95.7 million as the base). SoundHound AI currently has a price-to-sales ratio of almost 12, which seems justified considering its impressive growth."", ""Assuming that its sales multiple comes down to 10 at the end of 2030, SoundHound's market cap could jump to $2.8 billion by the end of the decade. That would be a jump of 430% from current levels, which means that a $100,000 investment in the stock right now could be worth $530,000 after seven years. Of course, that's quite some way off the million-dollar mark, but what's worth noting here is the impressive upside the stock could deliver in the long run."", ""So, even though SoundHound may not turn a $100,000 investment into a million over the next seven years, it won't be surprising to see it do the same over a longer period considering the terrific business growth it is likely to deliver through the end of the decade. That's why investors looking to buy an AI stock can consider buying and holding SoundHound AI as its robust long-term growth could lead to healthy stock market gains."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?', 'Before you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and SoundHound AI wasn't one of them.

That is, there were more number of shares purchased by insiders than there were sold."", 'While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.', ' View our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals ', ""Over the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by Chairman Seifollah Ghasemi for US$2.9m worth of shares, at about US$264 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, at around the current price, which is US$276. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. If someone buys shares at well below current prices, it's a good sign on balance, but keep in mind they may no longer see value. Happily, the Air Products and Chemicals insider decided to buy shares at close to current prices. The only individual insider to buy over the last year was Seifollah Ghasemi."", 'Seifollah Ghasemi bought a total of 21.00k shares over the year at an average price of US$259.

So take a peek at this free list of growing companies with insider buying.', 'At Air Products and Chemicals,over the last quarter, we have observed quite a lot more insider buying than insider selling. Chairman Seifollah Ghasemi spent US$5.4m on stock. But insider Jeffrey Kutz sold shares worth US$28k. We think insiders may be optimistic about the future, since insiders have been net buyers of shares.', 'Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Air Products and Chemicals insiders own 0.3% of the company, currently worth about US$211m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.', ""It's certainly positive to see the recent insider purchase. And the longer term insider transactions also give us confidence. When combined with notable insider ownership, these factors suggest Air Products and Chemicals insiders are well aligned, and quite possibly think the share price is too low. Looks promising! In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Air Products and Chemicals. You'd be interested to know, that we found 2 warning signs for Air Products and Chemicals and we suggest you have a look."", 'But note: Air Products and Chemicals may not be the best stock to buy.

If you want to skip our overview of this particular sub segment of the clean energy industry, then you can take a look at the 5 Most Promising Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Stocks to Buy. ', ""After humanity witnessed the marvels of mass production in the form of rapid industrialization that has revolutionized global travel and communication, humanity is now focused on technologies that are capable of meeting our massive energy needs and remaining environmentally friendly at the same time. After all, there is little point in progress if the Earth's natural climatic cycles are disturbed since a precise set of conditions must be met for humanity to thrive."", 'Most public attention when it comes to clean energy stocks is focused on solar power generation and storage systems, there are other sectors that are also seeking to develop technologies that can prove to be sustainable. One such segment is the hydrogen and fuel cell industry.\xa0 Hydrogen is one of the most unique elements that one can find on the periodic table since it is the simplest and most abundant element in the universe. The first bit provides it with ample potential to be used as a fuel since hydrogen requires vastly less energy for ignition and it also readily combines with oxygen in a high energy reaction that produces water. Not only do these enable efficient energy generation, but they also mean that hydrogen is one of the cleanest fuels in the world as no toxic pollutant gasses are released into the atmosphere.', ""However, there's a catch. Since hydrogen is the smallest known atom in the universe, storing it is tricky. A little known fact about the element present in the atmosphere as a gas is that it is also used as a rocket fuel. This is because its low mass allows for more storage mass per volume, and the reaction of hydrogen with oxygen results in a high specific impulse. Specific impulse is a central component of rocketry, and in layman's terms, it measures the per unit of thrust produced by a mass of fuel flowing through a rocket. Since hydrogen is light, more of it can flow in a unit of time, leading to higher thrust."", ""So what's the catch? Well, hydrogen is notoriously difficult to handle. One of the biggest examples of this phenomenon came last year when NASA attempted to fly its Space Launch System (SLS) rocket for the first time. The SLS is the world's biggest operational rocket, and it uses hydrogen as its fuel. NASA's Artemis 1 launch in November 2023 was delayed multiple times as engineers struggled to plug leaks between the rocket and its fueling systems and were left bamboozled when the leaks stopped themselves. Using hydrogen as a rocket fuel also makes for some remarkable visuals, with the United Launch Alliance's Delta IV Heavy lighting its base on fire to dispose of the extra fuel before igniting America's largest rocket engines for liftoff."", ""Back to general use. Apart from being used in rockets, hydrogen is also seeing interest from the clean energy industry. Hydrogen fuel cells are used in cars and other electric vehicles to generate electricity through the chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen. This is quite similar to the way a lithium battery powers a car, with the primary difference between a hydrogen fuel cell and a lithium ion battery being that while the former produces electricity, the latter stores it for later use. Hydrogen's benefits that we've mentioned above also mean that fuel cell electric vehicles are more power efficient than battery powered ones. However, the caveat is that they are also more expensive, and as NASA will agree, hydrogen is trickier to store and transport."", ""Coming towards companies that are using hydrogen to generate electricity, we can name two stocks right off the tip of our tongue. These are FuelCell Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FCEL) and Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ:PLUG). Talking about their share prices, the stocks haven't done well in 2023. Throughout the year, while some high growth areas such as technology have done well, others such as solar power have struggled as high rates stifle investor risk appetite. FuelCell Energy's shares are down by 37% year to date, and those of Plug Power have shed an even more painful 63%. Financial performance might also have a role to play here as Plug Power has missed analyst EPS estimates in all four of its latest quarters while FuelCell Energy has beaten estimates in three out of the four quarters."", ""Today, we'll look at the hydrogen and fuel cell stocks that analysts believe are promising. Some top picks are Nikola Corporation (NASDAQ:NKLA), Hyzon Motors Inc. (NASDAQ:HYZN), and Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ:PLUG)."", 'A mechanic in an orange jumpsuit inspecting a large truck and its hydrogen-electric battery.', 'Our Methodology ', 'To compile our list of the hydrogen and fuel cell stocks that analysts believe are worth looking at, we ranked the constituents of the Global X Hydrogen ETF, VanEck Hydrogen Economy UCITS ETF, and our previous coverage to pick out and rank pure play hydrogen stocks or those that provide associated technologies that trade on U.S. exchanges by their average analyst share price percentage upside.

Long-term exposure to this pollutant can lead to breathing issues such as asthma and respiratory infections.

228,a049763a-dbe9-30c4-b010-550165d778b6,DIS,2023-12-28,"I Hate to Say It, but Disney Shouldn't Reinstate Its Dividend",Motley Fool,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/a049763a-dbe9-30c4-b010-550165d778b6/i-hate-to-say-it%2C-but-disney.html,1703765100,STORY,['DIS'],"[""Disney (NYSE: DIS) did something important recently. It declared a dividend for the first time since the payment was eliminated during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic. There are a few big takeaways, but I can't help but think the company should have waited to start paying a dividend again. Here's why, despite being a dividend lover, I'm not particularly pleased with Disney's move."", ""When the pandemic hit in 2020, there was a great deal of uncertainty. Nonessential businesses were shut down by the government and people were asked to practice social distancing, all in an effort to slow the spread of the illness. Given that a huge portion of Disney's business is tied to group settings -- like its amusement parks, cruise ships, and the movie theaters that show its movies -- it makes sense that the company suspended the dividend."", 'The biggest benefit from the move was that it allowed Disney to conserve cash. The drawback was that the company let down investors who had come to count on the dividend. Also, some large investors, like pension funds and insurance companies, have requirements that they only invest in dividend-paying companies. So there were bigger issues at play as well.', ""But after the cut, Disney was quickly in a position that required it to rebuild trust with investors. So the dividend resumption announced in late 2023 was important (the dividend will be paid in early January 2024). But at $0.30 per share, I'm not at all pleased with this decision (and I love dividends!). It would have been better if Disney had chosen to pay just a token dividend (perhaps $0.01 a share) to allow dividend-limited institutional investors to own the stock again."", ""The reason for my concern is that while Disney's problems aren't as dire as they seemed in the early days of the pandemic, they are still fairly significant. For example, the company's experiences division had a good fourth quarter in fiscal 2023, largely driven by the reopening of the company's Shanghai property. That's good news, but it isn't a long-term growth driver, just a return to normal. In the U.S., performance was mixed, with lower spending at Disney's Florida properties only partially offset by stronger results in California. While not a full-on negative, the experiences segment was also not an unequivocal positive and the lingering impact of the pandemic is still an issue to contend with (specifically within China)."", ""In the entertainment space, Disney has released a string of underwhelming movies. The company admitted it was trying to do too much on the big screen, and it plans to pull back and refocus its efforts. This is more than just a reputation issue, given the interplay between the company's parks and its key movie franchises like Star Wars and Marvel. If Disney can't get its movie plans back on track, it could turn into a bigger problem."", ""Then there's the transition that's taking place between traditional media consumption via cable and broadcast TV and streaming, which is also hitting the media titan. Profits in the former are falling while Disney's efforts in the latter remain unprofitable. Even if streaming can get into the black, it will only help offset the declines from cord-cutting. Disney is making the right move at the right time, but the transition isn't nearly over yet, and it isn't quite clear how long it will take. Then there's ESPN, which was once a crown jewel asset that simply isn't as valuable as it once was. The company appears to be considering brand partners to help revive the iconic sports brand."", ""Although Disney is still facing notable problems across basically all of its business, it has reinstated the dividend. That's going to be a drain on cash flow at a time when it could probably better use that cash flow to reinvest in the company. While I understand the importance of regaining trust on Wall Street, the $0.30-per-share dividend is a burden that Disney didn't need to impose on itself."", ""My family and I love Disney, so I follow the company's products quite closely. For the most part, the quality is still top-notch, but it is still clear that Disney isn't firing on all cylinders today. Given enough time, the company will probably muddle through this rough patch (and there's a collection of activist investors lined up to prod it in a new direction). But spending cash on dividends that really didn't need to be spent won't help Disney get back on track. And if there's another dividend cut in the future -- not a far-fetched notion given the host of headwinds Disney is facing -- the resumption of the dividend will have caused more harm than good. Conservative dividend investors should probably stay on the sidelines until there's more evidence of the company's business moving in a positive direction."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Walt Disney right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Walt Disney, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Walt Disney wasn't one of them.

But some individual stocks like Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) have delivered an absolute fortune to investors who were game enough to bet on them early.', 'Netflix was founded in 1997. It went public five years later in 2002 with a market valuation of $309 million. The company is now worth $215 billion on the back of its world-leading streaming platform.', 'Investors who bought Netflix stock at its initial public offering (IPO) and held until now would be sitting on a gain of 45,332%. In other words, a mere $2,210 invested in 2002 would be worth more than $1 million today!', 'In fact, Netflix has created so much value that management has opted for two stock splits -- one in 2004, and another in 2015 -- to ensure the stock remained accessible to smaller investors.', 'The Netflix story is legendary. In 1997, its founders wanted to disrupt the video rental industry by mailing movies to customers in DVD format. The widespread adoption of the internet enabled customers to order online, so they no longer had to visit brick-and-mortar stores like Blockbuster.', 'But disaster struck in 2000 when the dot-com bubble burst, sending the technology sector plunging. It sank hundreds of early stage start-ups, and Netflix was still a private company, so it was incredibly hard for it to access funding.', 'Its founders approached Blockbuster and offered to sell Netflix for $50 million -- a deal which Blockbuster famously rejected.', 'Netflix pulled through the crisis, and its service continued to gather momentum. By 2007, it was leaning on the internet even further by offering customers a streaming service, which eliminated the need for DVD discs entirely.', ""It was a game changer, and it laid the groundwork for what Netflix is today: The world's largest streaming platform, with 247 million subscribers. Blockbuster, on the other hand, declared bankruptcy in 2010."", 'Netflix has faced slowing subscriber growth over the last couple of years. Most people who are likely to use Netflix have already joined, so the company has to work a little harder to grow its addressable market.', ""It has cracked down on password sharing to monetize the estimated 100 million households around the world that are using Netflix for free through a friend or family member's account. Now, paying account holders can add additional members for just $7.99 per month -- while it's much less than the $22.99 per month for the Premium tier, it's better than making no money at all."", ""Netflix also launched a new $6.99-per-month tier supported by advertising, which is designed to capture lower-income households. Management says the ad tier already generates the same amount of revenue per subscriber as the Standard tier, which is $15.49 per month -- so while it's cheaper at face value, advertising is contributing a significant amount of revenue."", 'The combination of the ad tier and the crackdown on password sharing has driven an acceleration in subscriber growth. In the 2023 third quarter (ended Sept. 30), subscribers grew by 10.8% year over year, which was the first double-digit percentage increase since early 2021.', 'With 2023 almost in the books, Netflix is on track to deliver $33.5 billion in revenue for the year. That will mark a 220-fold increase from its IPO year in 2002, when it generated $152 million.', ""But Netflix's bottom line is the real story. In 2022, Netflix delivered $4.5 billion in net income, which translated to $9.95 in earnings per share. That's on track to grow by 10.8% in 2023 to $11.03 per share. But Wall Street forecasts $14.41 in earnings in 2024, which means growth could accelerate to 30.6%."", ""Netflix faces growing competition with at least 61 other streaming platforms boasting 1 million subscribers or more, but it remains the only major stand-alone provider generating a consistent profit. Disney's Disney+ streaming service has over 150 million subscribers, but it continues to lose money."", 'Disney committed to slashing its content budget by over $3 billion earlier this year, and it will cut out a further $2 billion in 2024. While it will move Disney+ closer to profitability, the platform might become less appealing to members for a lack of new shows and movies.', ""To be frank, the best gains in Netflix stock are in the rear-view mirror. It's unlikely $2,210 invested today will grow into $1 million over the next 21 years, the same way it did over the last 21 years."", ""The larger Netflix gets, the harder it is to maintain the same levels of growth. That doesn't mean the company can't mint new millionaires over the long term, but investors will likely have to outlay a larger sum of money to start with."", ""For example, a $200,000 investment could become $1 million over the next 20 years if Netflix grows its annual revenue by 8.4% per year and maintains its current price-to-sales valuation. It's certainly possible, given that Netflix has grown its revenue at a compounded annual rate of 29.3% since 2002 -- although it is currently growing well below that long-term trend."", ""With that said, there is potential for a growth acceleration in the future. Streaming only represents 37.5% of television time in the U.S., so the industry still has plenty of room to expand. Plus, as I mentioned earlier, some of Netflix's key competitors are pulling away, which could leave the company with a larger market share in the coming years."", ""Netflix's penetration also remains incredibly low in parts of Europe, and in populous developing markets like South America and India. Those regions might be key to the platform crossing 1 billion subscribers over the very long term, which could certainly help Netflix stock mint new millionaires."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Netflix right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Netflix, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Netflix wasn't one of them.

'Barbie' success and Marvel struggles may signal a shift,Associated Press Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2023-tipping-point-movies-barbie-150039378.html,1703689239,STORY,['DIS'],"['NEW YORK (AP) — Eight years ago, Steven Spielberg predicted that the superhero movie would one day go “the way of the Western.”', 'Spielberg’s comments caused a widespread stir at the time. “Avengers: The Age of Ultron” was then one of the year’s biggest movies. The following year would bring “Captain America: Civil War,” “Deadpool” and “Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice.” The superhero movie was in high gear, and showing no signs of slowing down.', 'But Spielberg’s point was that nothing is forever in the movie business. These cycles, Spielberg said, “have a finite time in popular culture.” And the maker of “E.T.,” “Jurassic Park” and “Jaws” might know a thing or two about the ebbs and flows of pop-culture taste.', ""As 2023 draws to a close, no one is sounding the death knell of the superhero movie. The Walt Disney Co.'s “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” made $845.6 million worldwide and Sony's “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” ($691 million) was one of the most acclaimed films of the year. Marvel is still mightier than any other brand in the business."", 'But more than ever before, there are chinks in the armor of the superhero movie. Its dominance in popular culture is no longer quite so assured. A cycle may be turning, and a new one dawning.', 'For the first time in more than two decades, the top three movies at the box office didn’t include one sequel or remake: “Barbie,” “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” and “Oppenheimer.” The last time that happened was 2001, when “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone,” “Shrek” and “Monsters, Inc.” topped the box office.', 'No, it’s not exactly a lineup of originality like, say, 1973, when “The Exorcist, “The Sting” and “American Graffiti” led all movies in ticket sales. “Barbie” and “The Super Mario Bros.,” based on some of the most familiar brands in the world, will generate spinoffs and sequels of their own.', 'But it’s hard not to sense a shift in moviegoing, one that might have reverberations for years to come for Hollywood.', '“There’s an inflection point in 2023,” says Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for data firm Comscore. “ Barbenheimer is just one part of that story. Audiences, they want to be challenged. I think the tried and true is not necessarily working.”', 'Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie,” from Warner Bros., was the year’s runaway hit, with more than $1.4 billion in ticket sales worldwide. It was a blockbuster like none seen before: an anarchic comedy that set a string of records for a movie directed by a woman.', 'Nearly as unprecedented was the success of Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer,” a three-hour drama that nearly grossed $1 billion. As different as it and “Barbie” were, they were each original feats of cinema and personal statements by its directors.', 'At the same time, the Walt Disney Co.’s Marvel, a hit-making machine like none other in movie history, faltered like never before. “The Marvels” marked a new low for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, collecting $200 million globally. DC Studios, in the midst of a revamp, saw disappointing results for “The Flash” and “Blue Beetle” before watching “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom” sink to a $28.1 million debut.', ""Both Marvel and DC have already made moves to right their ships. Bob Iger, Disney's chief executive, has called turning around Marvel his top priority. He said the superhero studio has suffered greatly from too many films and series leading to “diluted quality.” The James Gunn, Peter Safran-led DC, meanwhile, won’t officially launch until 2025 with “Superman Legacy.”"", 'In the meantime, something else will have to fill the void. That was a theme in 2023, too, when the writers and actors strikes marred release plans and forced the delay of several films including Warner’s “Dune: Part Two,” Sony’s next “Ghostbusters” movie and MGM’s “Challengers.”', ""Those disruptions will continue in 2024. Analysts aren't expecting a banner year for Hollywood in part because films like the next “Mission: Impossible” film and the “Spider-Verse” sequel, both delayed by the strikes, won’t make their original dates."", 'Overall ticket sales in U.S. and Canadian theaters for 2023 are expected to reach about $9 billion, according to Comscore, an improvement of about 20% from 2022. The industry is still trying to regain its pre-pandemic footing, when ticket sales regularly surpassed $11 billion. Output of wide-releases in 2023 (88) still trailed those in 2019 (108) by 18.5%.', 'Hollywood is still coaxing moviegoers back to theaters — something “Barbie,” “Oppenheimer” and “Mario” went a long way to helping.', '“It reinforced something that we’ve known for 100 years in the business: People like going to the shared experience out of the home,” says Jeffrey Goldstein, distribution chief for Warner Bros. “They love being entertained. Movies are a good financial proposition and can bring in a mass audience.”', '“It probably started with ‘Mario’ last April,” adds Goldstein. “I think that showed audiences again that theaters are a fun place to be to. And it showed studios and content creators: Up your game.”', 'If 2023 is any guide, hits will come from increasingly unpredictable places.', 'That was the case with “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour,” a film released just two months after Swift’s recorded concerts in a first-of-its-kind distribution deal with AMC Theatres. It grossed $250 million worldwide, and was followed by the similarly released “Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé,” another No. 1 debut.', 'More surprising was “Sound of Freedom,” a $15 million film from the independent Angel Studios, which matched Swift with $250 million worldwide. It was released with a unique “pay it forward” program that allowed people to donate tickets.', 'Going into 2023, no one was betting “Sound of Freedom” would outgross “The Marvels” or that “Five Nights at Freddy\'s"" would have a bigger opening weekend than “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.”', '“There are going to be examples of big-budget, traditional blockbusters that do well,” says Dergarabedian. “But for every one of those, there have been two that failed. An audience that’s finding a lot of interesting material on streaming is becoming more open to films like ‘Godzilla Minus One,’ Indian cinema, Japanese anime. There’s a shift in audience taste and studios need to get a handle on this.”', 'That poses as much of a challenge as an opportunity to studios. If more-of-the-same no longer has quite the same appeal for moviegoers, an industry that for years has depended on sequels, prequels, reboots and remakes to make up the bulk of its profits may require new creativity.', 'The Western didn\'t vanish all at once. After two decades of ubiquity, it began going out of style in the 1960s. And the Western, of course, continues to be rich territory for filmmakers. This year, 81-year-old Martin Scorsese made his first Western in “Killers of the Flower Moon,"" the three-hour-plus $200 million epic from Apple Studios.', ""The superhero movie, likewise, won't ever die. But its heyday might have reached its endgame. "", '___', 'Follow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP']"

By analysing the two key metrics, it becomes much easier to identify companies whose earnings are growing relative to their share price. In most cases, companies whose earnings are growing much faster than share price are often considered gems that could explode in the near future.', 'In addition, if a company is churning out a high return on capital and re-investing the amount to expand the business, there is always a high chance of earnings growing much faster.

Therefore, the legendary investor calls for patience regarding the holding period of value stocks.', 'Joel Greenblatt of Gotham Asset Management', '""Most people just won\'t wait that long. Their investment time horizon is too short. If a strategy works in the long run (meaning it sometimes takes three, four, or even five years to show its stuff), most people won\'t stick with it.

Buying high-yielding stocks like Enbridge (NYSE: ENB), Black Hills Corporation (NYSE: BKH) and Devon Energy (NYSE: DVN) could be just the foundation you need to get to that seven-figure goal. Here's a look at each."", ""Enbridge operates in the energy sector, where oil and natural gas prices can lead to dramatic swings in financial performance. But the Canadian company's business is largely shielded from commodity prices because it charges fees for the use of the energy infrastructure assets it owns, like pipelines. It doesn't matter if oil prices are high or low, the fuel still has to be delivered to market, and that keeps demand resilient for Enbridge's business."", ""However, Enbridge isn't just a pipeline stock. Over the years it has been increasingly diversifying its business. The first step of that was to move from a heavy focus on oil infrastructure to include more natural gas infrastructure. Natural gas is considered a transition fuel as the world increasingly goes green. The company has also been building a natural gas utility business, most recently by agreeing to buy three gas utilities from Dominion Energy (NYSE: D). And it also owns a small but growing portfolio of renewable power assets (like offshore wind)."", ""The company's hefty 7.5% dividend yield, meanwhile, is backed by 28 years of annual dividend increases and an investment-grade-rated balance sheet. The hefty yield, which is likely to make up the vast majority of your return, gets you three quarters of the way to the around-10% historical return of the broader stock market.

This tends to result in slow and steady growth over time.', ""Black Hills is a Dividend King, with over 50 years of annual dividend increases behind it. And over the past one-, three-, five-, and 10-year periods the dividend has grown at a roughly-5% annualized clip. That's impressive consistency."", ""Black Hills isn't meant to be an exciting stock. It is a reliable, foundational investment. This one just happens to be backed by utility operations in regions that are growing nearly three times as fast as the broader U.S. population. More customers means more slow and steady growth, because regulators are incentivized to ensure reliable power is available. Black Hills will need higher rates and more capital spending to get that done. Meanwhile, its 4.6% dividend yield is near the highest levels of the last decade, suggesting that the stock is attractively priced today."", ""Sticking with the broader energy theme, you might also want to consider Devon Energy. This company produces oil and natural gas in the continental United States. Its top and bottom lines are basically driven by energy prices. So financial performance can be highly volatile. That might turn off a lot of investors, since the stock price typically rises and falls along with these vital global commodities. But there's an interesting wrinkle."", ""Devon Energy's dividend is tied to its financial performance. That means that the dividend will tend to rise when energy prices are high and fall when energy prices are low. Some will find that undesirable -- who wants to see a dividend get cut? But the dividend you collect here will likely be going up just when you might be facing rising prices for heating your home and filling your car up with gasoline. That can provide a hedge against rising real-world energy prices. In other words, it provides an inflation hedge of sorts to protect your buying power, supporting your ability to save money instead of spend it."", ""This won't be a great fit for everybody, but more active investors might appreciate this vital dividend nuance as they work toward millionaire status. The yield today is a lofty 6.2%, but that will change given the variable dividend policy currently in place."", ""Most investors looking to build a millionaire-level nest egg will be better off creating a diversified portfolio. Adding some reliable income stocks, like Enbridge and Black Hills, should provide a strong foundation. Meanwhile, a unique dividend stock like Devon Energy not only adds diversification, but also a hedge against the real-world impact of energy price volatility. You'll need more than these three stocks, of course, but each can help you in an important way on your quest to become a millionaire."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Devon Energy right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Devon Energy, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Devon Energy wasn't one of them.

The company's Compute & Networking revenues are gaining from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance computing and accelerated computing.The data center end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in Hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of AI-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds.Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.

The company is benefiting from the ongoing momentum across its cloud business, driven by the strong uptake of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and Autonomous Database offerings.Solid adoption of cloud-based applications, comprising NetSuite Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Fusion ERP bodes well. Oracle's Gen 2 Cloud is delivering better performance at a lower cost due to high bandwidth and low-latency RDMA networks.Partnerships with VMWare and Microsoft are helping Oracle win new clientele.

Economic headwinds like high inflation and rising interest rates forced consumers to spend less money in segments like personal computing and gaming, which sent demand for traditional chips plummeting."", ""Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) was a poster child for that weakness earlier this year, but its recent financial results for the fiscal 2024 first quarter (ended Nov. 30) suggest a comeback is underway. Here's why it's time to buy the stock."", ""Micron is a leading producer of memory (DRAM) and storage (NAND) chips. That hardware isn't quite as exciting as the glamorous GPUs produced by Nvidia that have become the beating heart of the data center, but they are equally important, especially under the demand of AI workloads."", ""Micron's new high-bandwidth memory chip (HBM3E) has been designed specifically for generative AI applications, with 10% more output and 30% less power consumption than competing hardware. HBM3E was selected by Nvidia to power its new flagship H200 data center chip, which is expected to extend the company's advantage over its competitors in the GPU space."", ""Micron is now gearing up for a monumental shift toward AI at the edge. While most of the AI action is happening in the data center right now, it's about to move to every new computer, device, and car in the world. Micron says AI-enabled industrial computers, for example, require three to five times more memory than standard computers. That calls for more advanced chips that sell at a higher price, and that's great news for Micron."", 'Leading CPU and GPU maker Advanced Micro Devices is already bringing AI chips to over 50 notebook computer designs in partnership with tech giants like Microsoft. Each of those devices will require increased DRAM and NAND capacity compared to traditional models, which spells profits for suppliers like Micron.', ""Micron's consumer segments struggled lately due to slowing sales of computers, devices, and gaming products. That led to an oversupply of chips and a huge inventory glut, which sent prices plunging. The company's revenue for fiscal 2023 (ended Aug. 31) sank by a whopping 50% year over year."", 'While those segments remain soft, they are improving, and Micron expects them to return to growth in calendar year 2024.', ""But the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was all about the data center. Micron's compute and networking segment generated $1.7 billion in revenue, and while that figure was flat year over year, it was up 45% compared to just three months ago. It was led by an increase in AI-related shipments, as well as normalized inventory conditions, which could drive prices higher in the coming quarters."", ""With relatively modest results in Micron's two other segments, compute and networking helped drive the company's total revenue to $4.7 billion, a 16% year-over-year jump. It was a welcome beginning to the new fiscal year following the dismal fiscal 2023."", ""Micron still has some work to do to bring its bottom line back to profitability. The company lost $1.2 billion in Q1, which translated into negative earnings per share of $1.12. It marked a continuation of the company's trend of losses from fiscal 2023."", ""But better times are coming, according to management. The high end of Micron's guidance for the upcoming fiscal 2024 second quarter points to a possible $0.07 in earnings per share (profit). The company also expects to bring in $5.3 billion in revenue, which would mark an accelerated growth rate of almost 30% year over year."", ""Micron stock trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 6.1, which is the most expensive level in at least a decade. But there are two reasons that shouldn't deter investors from buying shares:"", 'AI is driving valuations higher across the semiconductor industry. Advanced Micro Devices trades at a P/S ratio of 10.4, and Nvidia has a P/S ratio of 27.4. Both are also near their highs of the last decade.', ""The P/S ratio is calculated based on trailing revenue, and we know Micron's sales collapsed in fiscal 2023. Looking ahead, Wall Street expects the company's revenue to increase 30% to $20.3 billion in fiscal 2024, which would reduce its P/S ratio to 4.7 on a forward basis."", ""Plus, analysts think Micron's revenue growth could accelerate again to 41% in fiscal 2025. Micron believes it's at the start of a multiyear growth phase driven by generative AI, and now could be investors' chance to buy the stock ahead of a continued upswing in its business."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Micron Technology right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Micron Technology, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Micron Technology wasn't one of them.

The buzz around high-growth stocks\xa0in fields including AI and cloud computing is palpable. These advancements fuel Wall Street’s bullish stance, and the enthusiasm is set to continue into the next year. With the New Year fast approaching, savvy investors are eyeing key opportunities for substantial returns, yet there’s a compelling case for looking beyond the shimmer of tech.', 'While enticing, the tech sector’s current boom hints at possible overvaluation and market saturation. With that said, it’s prudent to broaden our horizons and delve into other sectors ripe with high-growth potential. Diversifying into industries like healthcare, renewable energy, and consumer goods isn’t just a safety play; it’s a strategic move to tap into burgeoning markets driven by innovation and evolving customer needs. Often overshadowed by tech’s allure, these sectors present growth stocks with more grounded valuations and promising long-term prospects. By embracing this diversified approach, investors can weave a portfolio that balances potential, stability, and reasonable valuations. Let’s look at some of the high-growth stocks:', 'Source: Deere & Company', 'Deere & Company\xa0(NYSE:DE) is a noteworthy yet often overlooked blue-chip stock, showcasing remarkable resilience and growth.\xa0Over the past five years, the company has demonstrated solid revenue and EBITDA expansion at 12.5% and 23.2%, respectively.

While its steady performance is often misconstrued as sluggishness in terms of growth, recent figures tell a different story, challenging this perception. In the latest quarter, McDonald’s demonstrated incredible growth, with\xa0comparable sales surging by 14% to $6.7 billion. This increase is particularly notable, considering the overall sales growth was 11% in the same period. This uptick in top-line growth underscores the company’s dynamic business model, contrary to its “slow-growing” status.', 'Furthermore, McDonald’s has set an ambitious goal to increase its restaurant count from 40,000 to 50,000 by 2027.

The firm witnessed laudable earnings per EPS growth in the first three quarters and is on track to meet its current year projections.

This is evident in its latest earnings report, with a first-quarter GAAP EPS of $3.70, beating expectations by two cents, and a revenue increase of 8.1% year-over-year, reaching $2.34 billion.

He also likes the stock because, even though they do have office properties, Hatfield says they tend to cater to sectors that favor work from the office.', 'A stock Hatfield is avoiding is Prologis (PLD), which owns warehouses. Hatfield says that, unlike office space, warehouse space is ""easy to replicate,"" which means there is a lot of new space coming online. Hatfield also says the stock has a ""premium valuation"" and that he expects the stock to lag. However, Hatfield says that if interest rates remain high or if there is a recession in the US, you would want to own Prologis because ""it\'s more defensive.""', 'Click here to watch more Good Buy or Goodbye or you can watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live here.', '[MUSIC PLAYING]', 'JULIE HYMAN: It\'s a big noisy universe of stocks out there. Welcome to ""Good Buy or Goodbye"" brought to you by E*TRADE from Morgan Stanley. Our goal? To help cut through that noise to navigate the best moves for your portfolio. And today, we\'re scooping out the real estate space, a sector that has gained renewed attention as interest rates have come down.', ""I'm here with Jay Hatfield. He's infrastructure Capital Advisors' CEO. Jay, thanks so much for being here. Appreciate it. So let's get straight to your buy stock, your good buy today which is Boston Properties. And as we kind of talk through this, one of the things that you're looking at is that interest rates will come down."", ""But you kind of have a little bit of a different flavor when we're looking at that, because you're looking at what the Fed is doing versus what the ECB is doing. Why is that important for where rates are going and then the feed through to REITs?"", ""JAY HATFIELD: Well, Julie, what a lot of US investors don't realize is it's really a global bond market. It's fine to just focus on US stocks, because we really dominate the whole world. But bonds are fungible. They have low default rates. And so it's a global market."", ""So we actually started focusing on the fact that rates are running up. And we said, why. Well, it's because the ECB is so tight. Well if they're so tight, their economy can't be doing well. And then when you really look, it's terrible. It's 3% below what the US is running at. So they have a negative growth last quarter. It's tracking at negative 1.2."", ""So we're bullish unlike a lot of strategists that the ECB will cut. We're worried the Fed will be slow. But if the ECB cuts, global rates will drop and that will benefit our markets. We're not dependent, like most people are, on the Fed because we look at all the global bond markets--"", 'JULIE HYMAN: Yeah.', 'JAY HATFIELD: --which really drive interest rates.', ""JULIE HYMAN: Well, real estate investment trusts tend to be interest rate sensitive and benefit when rates come down. So that's one of the things you're looking at--"", 'JAY HATFIELD: Correct.', 'JULIE HYMAN: --when it comes to Boston Properties. But I want to talk specifically about office REITs and why a company like Boston Properties because offices have not been in favor.', 'JAY HATFIELD: Right.', 'JULIE HYMAN: So why is that going to change?', 'JAY HATFIELD: Yeah, so offices in general are really well hated as some of them should be.', 'JULIE HYMAN: Yeah.', 'JAY HATFIELD: But the distinction that has to be drawn is between really a-plus offices like we have here in Manhattan, for instance. Boston Properties owns what used to be called the General Motors building. So like a real trophy asset. And for the sectors that they cater to like financial services, they do work from office.', ""When I started on Wall Street, we did LFO which is live from office. And so unless you want to be fired in financial services, you do go in. And AI, when you talk to brokers, is a very in-office. That's all-hands-on-deck. Also LFO. So we think the fundamentals are improving but only for a-plus buildings. We're not saying run out and buy every office [? three. ?] This is the best largest premier developer in the United States."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Gotcha. And then you're also looking at the valuation here. Your price target, if you look at the funds from operations which is a measure of cash flow that folks look at when they're measuring REITs, your price target on that base is $94."", ""JAY HATFIELD: Correct, yes. So we think that another way to look at valuation is just it's a simple number. It's the cap rate. So that's just the cash return on investment. So normally-- so normally, these trophy office buildings used to be at 4% to 5% cap rates. Now they're at 7% And so we think there's a 20% to 30% as they start to catch up to where they were before. And in fact, BXP is down 50% since the pandemic on a price basis."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. And one of the things we like to ask first is what could go wrong with this bullish case here. And maybe we don't see rates go down at the--"", ""JAY HATFIELD: Right. Yeah, so we probably have the highest target on Wall Street for the S&P. So we're at 5500, which is a Goldilocks scenario, 2% growth, falling interest rates. So particularly, if rates did not fall like say-- let's say the ECB doesn't cut, which is, I guess, possible, not prudent, but possible, I could definitely see the Fed not cutting and maybe rates go higher."", ""And BXP and most REITs are more than 50% correlated with interest rates. So you're absolutely not going to make money, unless rates keep dropping."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Gotcha. OK, so let's get to the stock that you want to avoid and that's Prologis which has done very well, right? And that's part of your case. But what we're seeing now-- and Prologis is an owner of warehouse space. And so you say now as we're seeing the pandemic boom sort of slow down, online retailers are not expanding as much in the warehouse."", ""JAY HATFIELD: Correct. And then the other thing that if you really think about warehouse space, it's easy to replicate. So if you drive on I-95, you'll see a lot of Prologis but very difficult to replicate office. So there's very few, if any, offices being built, but a lot of new space coming on."", ""And as you mentioned, Amazon is trying to optimize their distribution. So it's not like it's terrible. But this is a premium valuation, which is another point, I guess, but--"", ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, let's-- let's talk about that real quick, because I did look at a chart here of these price to FFO that--"", 'JAY HATFIELD: Right--', ""JULIE HYMAN: [INAUDIBLE] that we earlier talked about. Here's Prologis. And this is a five-year chart. It's a longer term chart. And here's BXP which--"", 'JAY HATFIELD: Right.', 'JULIE HYMAN: --looks at that valuation gap.', ""JAY HATFIELD: Yeah, so they're trading at 24 times. BXP is at 10. And again, if you think the other way to look at it is cap rates that they're going to compress. Because these are both trophy properties. If you've got these CBD and the gateway cities, they're going to be worth a lot at some point, if the fundamentals improve just as they are for PLD."", ""So we think that the gap will close. But we're not really saying short PLD because we think that BXP will come up and get closer--"", 'JULIE HYMAN: Gotcha.', 'JAY HATFIELD: --to PLD.', 'JULIE HYMAN: And then your final point on this one too is that you think small caps are going to do a bit better and Prologis is now the largest REIT by--', 'JAY HATFIELD: Correct.', 'JULIE HYMAN: --market cap.', ""JAY HATFIELD: Yeah, that's 11 times bigger than BXP. So it's defensive just like large cap tech is. So it's what people buy Or hedge funds will go long, PLD in short if the market's bad."", ""JULIE HYMAN: So what's the risk to this bearish call here? It's kind of the-- the flip--"", 'JAY HATFIELD: I would--', 'JULIE HYMAN: --of the--', 'JAY HATFIELD: --say--', 'JULIE HYMAN: --other.', ""JAY HATFIELD: Well, the interest rates are tough. But also if there's a recession in the US, you'd really want to be in PLD. It's more defensive. Office space is very variable. We already saw-- we think the cycle is over. But financial services, companies lay off. We saw tech layoffs a couple of years ago."", 'So if we have a major recession, office employment will get much harder, get hit harder than just warehouse space. And also the occupancy rate now is higher on warehouse. So it will act defensively. And you really should have flipped the good buy and goodbye.', ""JULIE HYMAN: And just quickly, what's your positions in the two stocks?"", ""JAY HATFIELD: Yeah, so BXP, we hold in our large cap dividend fund, ICAP, and also in our hedge fund. And then, thankfully, we have no position in PLD. So sometimes, we actually will have small positions in companies we think will underperform. But we don't have any position in PLD."", ""JULIE HYMAN: All right, Jay, I'm going to sum up what we have talked about here. We're going to recap. You're telling investors to buy Boston Properties based on attractive valuations, expectations for strong leasing demand for office buildings, and REITs, overall, continue to rally offices, in particular."", ""On the other side, you're saying avoid Prologis, the warehouse boom slowing down. Online retailers aren't spending as much. And the stock's valuation. Looks full. Jay Hatfield, thank you so much for being here. Really appreciate it."", 'JAY HATFIELD: Great. Thanks, Julie.']"

The run comes as the stock market rally broadens beyond technology stocks to include more blue-chip names. Despite the big run over the past few weeks, there is reason to believe the current rally has legs and is likely to continue into the new year.

The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years."", 'Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.', 'Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Martin Marietta basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.', 'Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices', ""The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock."", ""For Martin Marietta, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business.

So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.16."", 'So far, we\'ve learned that ROE is a measure of a company\'s profitability.

Despite this, Mondelez International's five year net income growth was quite low averaging at only 2.9%. That's a bit unexpected from a company which has such a high rate of return. We reckon that a low growth, when returns are quite high could be the result of certain circumstances like low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital."", ""Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Mondelez International's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 13% over the last few years, which is not something we like to see."", 'Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock.

Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 18%."", ""Overall, we feel that Mondelez International certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Yet, the low earnings growth is a bit concerning, especially given that the company has a high rate of return and is reinvesting ma huge portion of its profits.

However, consistent supply-chain issues might lead to lower jet deliveries and thereby remain a threat to the industry players. Nevertheless, improved projections for air travel, as stated by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), are expected to bode well for companies that are engaged in commercial aerospace operations. The frontrunners in the aerospace-defense industry are Safran, Textron and Leidos Holdings.', 'The Zacks Aerospace-Defense industry comprises companies that primarily design and manufacture heavy-built products like commercial as well as military jets and helicopters, tankers and other combat vehicles, missiles, combatant ships as well as auxiliary ships, submarines, bombs, guns, space transportation vehicles, military satellites and a few more.', 'The industry also includes cyber security players who offer information technology services and C4ISR (command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) solutions.

Such impressive projections bode well for commercial aerospace manufacturers that have long borne the brunt of poor air travel in the form of delayed jet deliveries and, in some cases, cancellation of orders by airlines.', ""Expanding Defense Budget Remains a Growth Catalyst: While the commercial aerospace market has been recovering steadily over the past couple of quarters, the defense side of the industry stood its ground amid the COVID-19 crisis, cushioned by steady government support. To this end, it is imperative to mention that in December 2023, U.S. President Joe Biden signed the U.S. defense policy bill that authorizes a record $886 billion in annual military spending, thereby increasing the nation's total national security budget by about 3%. Such improved budgetary provisions set the stage for industry players focused on the defense business to win more contracts, which is likely to boost their top line."", 'Supply-Chain Issues May Hurt: Significant supply-chain disruption impacted the Aerospace and Defense industry, thanks to the pandemic-induced lower aircraft demand and restrictions on the movement of people and goods.

This, in turn, might constrict the growth trajectory of the U.S. Aerospace and Defense industry, to some extent, in the near term.', ""Strengthening Dollar Adds to Industry Woes: The recently appreciating U.S. dollar is adding another layer of cost to airlines that are already burdened with high inflation and rising jet fuel prices. The Federal Reserve's policy rate now stands in the 5.25-5.50% range as of September 2023, having started at 0.25% in 2022."", 'All U.S. dollar-denominated costs are rising for airlines that earn revenues in non-U.S. currency.

As a result, many dividend-paying stocks have seen their dividend yields -- the ratio of a company's annual dividend to its share price -- fall to less attractive levels for income-seeking investors."", 'But not every stock has participated in the rally, so here are three dividend stocks that look incredibly cheap at current valuations heading into the new year.', 'Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) is a longtime favorite stock of prolific investor Warren Buffett, who first purchased shares through Berkshire Hathaway in 1988. Berkshire Hathaway still owns stock of the beverage giant today, receiving $704 million in dividends in 2022 despite never buying another share after it completed its $1.3 billion investment in 1994.', ""Coca-Cola's stock struggled in 2023, with a total return of roughly -5%. Nonetheless, Coca-Cola is a Dividend King, having paid and raised its dividend for at least 50 consecutive years."", ""Assuming management will stay the course, Coca-Cola will likely raise its quarterly dividend for the 62nd straight year in early 2024. Based on its previous quarterly dividend, the company currently pays an outsize annual yield of 3.2%. Again, that might be underselling it, given management's likelihood to raise it in the near future."", ""The company does have a relatively high net debt (total debt minus cash and cash equivalents) of roughly $25 billion, which will become more expensive to service as interest rates remain elevated. That scenario is already starting to play out, with Coca-Cola paying $1.1 billion in interest expense through the third quarter of 2023, a year-over-year increase of 93%. Smartly, Coca-Cola's management has been paying down its net debt, which has declined 22% over the past three years."", ""The good news is that Coca-Cola's revenue and earnings per share (EPS) are on the rise after recent lows. For its full-year 2023, management projected organic revenue (excluding currency fluctuations and recent acquisitions, divestitures, and structural changes) to grow 10% to 11% and its EPS to grow 13% to 14% on a currency-neutral basis compared to 2022."", ""So, despite Coca-Cola's stock struggles, the company should continue rewarding shareholders as a market leader with a consistent and rising dividend."", 'The next stock on this list is another iconic American brand, Harley-Davidson (NYSE: HOG), known for manufacturing motorcycles. The stock has severely underperformed the market over the past five years and in 2023, generating a total return of roughly 25% and -12%, respectively. Nonetheless, Harley-Davidson has consistently paid dividends since 1993, with a current annual yield of 1.8%.', 'Beyond its dividend, Harley-Davidson management favors share repurchases, lowering its outstanding share count by 4.5% in 2023 and 13% over the past five years. By reducing its outstanding shares, management returns capital to shareholders in a more tax-efficient way by increasing the ownership stake of each remaining share.', ""As for why the stock struggled in recent years, look no further than the company's revenue. When you consider price hikes and inflation, anytime a company's revenue steadily declines, it could signal a fundamental problem with the business."", ""In Harley-Davidson's case, its waning popularity is the culprit. Harley-Davidson's annual revenue peaked in 2014 when it generated $5.5 billion and hit rock bottom in 2020 with $4 billion during the height of the pandemic."", ""Encouragingly, the company's revenue has rebounded over the past few years. Moreover, through the first nine months of 2023, it generated total revenue of $4.8 billion, a year-over-year increase of 4%. The increase is mainly from its financial services, up 17% year to date to $707 million as interest rates remain elevated. On the flip side, the company is having a more challenging time selling its motorcycles, which was illustrated in its most recently reported quarter when unit sales dipped year over year by 16% worldwide."", ""One last key metric is Harley-Davidson's low payout ratio -- annual dividends payments divided by annual earnings -- which stands at a mere 13%. This suggests that the company is likely to increase its dividend and keep buying back its shares, which is welcome news for patient investors who are waiting on the cyclical business to potentially rebound."", 'Big-box retailer Target (NYSE: TGT)\xa0is the second Dividend King on this list, having paid and raised its dividend for 52 consecutive years. The stock, trading for roughly $141 per share, has been unusually volatile since the beginning of 2023, with a 52-week high near $182 and a 52-week low of $103. Despite the fluctuation, the stock has been roughly flat over that period, with a total return of approximately -2%.', 'Today, Target pays a quarterly dividend of $1.10, equating to an outsize annual dividend yield of 3.1%. The company has a comfortable payout ratio of 55%, and management has repurchased nearly 8% of its outstanding shares over the past three years.', 'As for why the stock has stumbled compared to the overall market in 2023, management called out ""higher-than-expected shrink and softer-than-expected sales."" ""Shrink"" is a term the industry defines as lost inventory caused by employee theft, employee error, damage, and shoplifting. Target management specifically singled out theft and organized crime as the main culprits of shrink, going as far as closing nine stores to combat the alleged problem.', ""Revenue is down about 3% through three quarters of Target's fiscal 2023 compared to the prior year. Despite sales being down, management has increased the company's profitability by prioritizing efficiency."", 'Specifically, Target generated $2.8 billion in net income through its fiscal third quarter of 2023, ended Oct. 28, representing a year-over-year improvement of 45%.

A lot of these retail traders are making use of new tools for stock buying and selling, most notably the use of artificial intelligence in their daily trading patterns.\xa0', 'Profit seems to be a key factor when analyzing the trades of these retail investors. Some of the most profitable Robinhood stocks include Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).

Environmental, social, and governmental concerns remain high on the retail investors agenda when investing in companies, in contrast to the older generation of stock pickers who prefer balance sheets.\xa0', 'The use of artificial intelligence is not just limited to stock trading. It has permeated many aspects of life. This is demonstrated by the recent earnings call of Alphabet Inc.

Pichai noted that his firm was using generative AI in ads products to serve both advertisers and users.

Among the myriad investment options available, the allure of steady dividend payments stands out as a beacon of reliability and security. These payments represent a portion of a company's profits shared with its shareholders, presenting a consistent income stream. Research indicates that a significant trend among Americans is retiring earlier than they had initially intended, often driven by factors that lie beyond their control. Among the primary reasons cited for this early retirement are issues like deteriorating health conditions or unexpected job loss. In 2022, a Gallup survey highlighted that while the anticipated retirement age averaged around 66 years old, the reality showed a different trend, with individuals retiring at an average age of 62. This discrepancy between anticipated and actual retirement ages has persisted over the years, maintaining a consistent gap of approximately five years since 2002, as reported by Gallup."", 'According to a recent Goldman Sachs Retirement survey, respondents pointed out that certain things like having credit card debt, setting aside money for college, and taking care of or financially assisting family members had an impact on their capacity to save for retirement. This influence persisted despite better conditions in the economy and financial markets. Here are some comments from Chris Ceder, Senior Retirement Strategist at Goldman Sachs Asset Management:', '“The financial vortex threatens all Americans because, despite their best efforts to consistently save when employed, life’s unexpected bumps can meaningfully derail the best retirement savings plans. Only 36% of US workers have three months of income or more saved for emergencies. Unplanned and often unpredictable financial challenges push too many of us off track, and catching up may be difficult. Saving for retirement must remain a top priority.”', 'Amidst this landscape of uncertainty, income generated from dividend stocks serves as a valuable lifeline for retirees. Dividend-paying stocks have demonstrated their resilience and potential as a source of stability in investment portfolios. Over time, these stocks have proven to be reliable performers, often surpassing the broader market in terms of generating consistent returns. Since 1900, dividends have made up roughly 45% of all the gains seen in the S&P 500 Index.', 'In one of its reports, Thornburg Investment Management illustrated the contrast in income growth between bonds and dividend-paying stocks. The firm took a hypothetical $1 million investment from 1990 and calculated the annual income generated. Over the years, the income from bonds gradually decreased, while the dividend income from the equity investment consistently increased. Initially lower than the bond income, the dividend earnings exceeded bond income in about a decade and eventually reached 912% of the bond income by 2020.', 'Dividend growers are popular for an early retirement portfolio.

As the sector emerges from the trials of a challenging 2023, there's a palpable sense of optimism for the new year.Moderating inflation, compelling valuations and the strength of companies' pricing power present great opportunities for consumer staple players in 2024. Before getting into the prospects for the new year, let’s take a quick look at the hurdles faced by consumer staple companies in 2023."", 'The year gone by was indeed difficult, with inflation making headlines. The inflationary landscape pinched consumers’ pockets, leading them to look for budget-friendly alternatives and shift from big brands toward private-label companies. This hampered the sales volume of consumer staple manufacturers.Meanwhile, the elevated cost of inputs and labor was a drag on margins. Although companies took to raising their product prices to cover higher input costs, it was not very well-received by consumers who were already stretching their budgets.', ""The dawn of 2024 brings renewed hope for the consumer staple sector. One of the key factors contributing to this positive outlook is the moderation of inflation, which is likely to enhance companies’ margins and profits. Also, moderating inflation is likely to help consumers ease their budgets, which will fuel companies’ sales volumes. Moreover, companies that made strategic advertising and brand-building investments this year are likely to experience resultant gains in 2024.Although economic uncertainties persist, the need for everyday products remains constant. Consumer staple companies stand to gain in such times as they offer items essential to daily life, ensuring a consistent market. While they do not usually offer exorbitant returns, they do not fail overnight either.Additionally, valuations in the consumer staple sector have become notably compelling due to the turmoil witnessed in 2023. The sector's underperformance in 2023 has left many stocks trading at attractive levels, presenting an enticing opportunity for investors.As we are nearing 2024, the consumer staple sector stands at the crossroads of recovery. While challenges remain, the prospects of a more favorable economic landscape, combined with companies’ operational excellence, bode well. On that note, we have pinpointed four stocks from the Zacks Consumer Staples universe that carry a favorable Zacks Rank and appear promising for the new year."", 'Molson Coors Beverage Company TAP is worth a shot.

This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.', ""The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system."", 'Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.', 'As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Waste Management is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.', 'Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices', ""The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock."", ""Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Waste Management imply an improvement in the company's underlying business.

During the initial months, even with concerns of a recession, investments in global equity markets spanning both crucial and discretionary sectors rebounded as the pandemic's end was officially announced.

These factors significantly hindered economic expansion in many regions worldwide."", 'However, the indispensable nature of the healthcare industry makes it an ever-growing industry. An emerging trend currently aiding the MedTech sector is the latest surge in artificial intelligence (AI), which is likely to provide a significant growth prospect for this resilient sector. Increasing adoption of telehealth, remote monitoring and cloud management services are likely to be the other drivers for the broader MedTech sector.', 'Amid the uncertain macroeconomic business environment, investors can turn their attention to a few MedTech stocks that have been holding steady. Investors should consider these fundamentally-sound stocks that are currently trading below their actual potential. DaVita Inc. DVA, GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. GEHC and Hologic, Inc. HOLX seem like the right picks.', 'As 2023 progressed, the overall MedTech sector gradually witnessed impacts on its operations due to post-pandemic headwinds, inflation, high cost of capital and market volatility. Going by the industry-wide trend so far, logistical challenges and increasing unit costs are heavily weighing on the profitability of the stocks across the board.', ""However, the MedTech sector, being one of the early adopters of AI, has been gradually witnessing a turnaround. AI's predictive capabilities make it easier for doctors and other healthcare providers to detect and diagnose diseases more quickly. This gives them more time with patients, thus improving patients’ satisfaction and health outcomes. Per a report by Precedence Research, the global AI in the healthcare market was estimated at $15.1 billion in 2022 and is anticipated to surpass around $187.95 billion by 2030 at a CAGR of 37%."", 'Amid the gradually transforming investment market, the MedTech sector holds the potential to provide long-term gains. It is one of the sectors that has held its ground despite being repeatedly battered by pandemic-related challenges and other macroeconomic uncertainties.', ""A notable MedTech player that has hopped onto the AI bandwagon is key global healthcare technology player, Medtronic plc MDT. This month, MDT entered into a definitive agreement to expand its partnership with Cosmo Intelligent Medical Devices, a subsidiary of Cosmo Pharmaceuticals. This strategic collaboration advances the use of AI in endoscopic care and strengthens Medtronic's leadership in AI-integrated healthcare solutions."", 'Given the impending AI revolution and continued innovations in patient monitoring within the MedTech sector, investors should scoop up stocks that are fundamentally strong but are currently trading at a cheaper rate.', 'The market is bracing for a widespread utilization of AI and other technology-enabled services.

Given the fact that such stocks are currently available at a cheaper rate, it will be prudent for investors to consider them for long-term benefits.', 'Listed below are three companies that have the potential to turn profitable for investors.', 'The first company to consider is DaVita, a renowned global comprehensive kidney care provider. The company, with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a Value Score of A, announced its third-quarter 2023 results last month.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: VeriSign Inc. VRSN, Block SQ, Royal Caribbean Cruises RCL, W.R. Berkley Corp. WRB and Eldorado Gold EGO.', 'Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:', 'With just a few trading days left, 2023 is turning out to be a banner year for Wall Street after several twists and turns. The three major indices have been on a blistering rally to end the year and have hit new highs on several occasions, buoyed by the tech surge, cooling inflation and the optimism that the Fed is done with interest rate hikes.', 'The Nasdaq Composite emerged as the outperformer, gaining 43.2%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial have risen 23.8% and 12.8%, respectively. The strong trend is likely to continue in the New Year as well.', 'Investors should consider stocks such as VeriSign Inc., Block, Royal Caribbean Cruises, W.R. Berkley Corp. and Eldorado Gold that could be compelling picks to tap the trend.', ""Let's discuss these events in detail below with the stocks:"", 'Technology has turned out to be the most profitable sector in 2023, driven by the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, easing inflation and a surge in ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks. Additionally, bets that the Fed\'s aggressive interest rate hiking campaign might be nearing an end powered the rally in the sector in recent months. As the tech sector relies on borrowing for superior growth, it is cheaper to borrow more money for initiatives when interest rates are low.', ""Investors should bet on the stocks that are yet to catch up with the broader sector rally. These stocks have a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), a strong VGM Score of B or better, and a positive earnings growth rate for 2024. While there are many in the sector, VeriSign, with a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of B, seems an intriguing option. The stock has gained just 0.5% in 2023, suggesting room for upside potential. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here."", 'VeriSign provides Internet infrastructure services that include domain name registry services and infrastructure assurance services. It has an estimated earnings growth rate of 9.4% for the next year.', ""The world's largest cryptocurrency started 2023 just above $16,000 and climbed to a 12-month high of $45,000 in early December. The rally came on the back of broad enthusiasm about U.S. interest rate cuts and the imminent regulatory approval for Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin halving, scheduled for April 2024, added to the strength. Bitcoin's performance in 2023 has outpaced other assets like global stocks and gold. Bitcoin mining companies have outperformed Bitcoin by a wide margin amid the recent bullish price action in the largest cryptocurrency. This trend is likely to continue."", 'Block, formerly known as Square, offers financial and marketing services through its comprehensive commerce ecosystem that helps sellers start, run and grow their businesses. It saw a solid earnings estimate revision of 75 cents over the past 90 days for 2024 and has an estimated growth rate of 53.2%. Block has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of A.', 'Inflation in the United States has been cooling, with the Consumer Price Index edging down for the second consecutive month in November. Inflation has now fallen significantly to 3.1% from a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022. Lower inflation often leads to decreased interest rates and heightened consumer spending, which, in turn, boost the demand for stocks. This heightened demand is further fueled by robust company revenues, ultimately culminating in an appreciation of share prices. Thus, growth stocks tend to perform better when inflation is low.', 'Although most companies will benefit from this trend,Royal Caribbean looks more appropriate. This cruise company owns and operates three global brands — Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Azamara Club Cruises. With a market cap of $32.8 billion, the stock has surged 22.7% over the past month. Royal Caribbean has an estimated growth rate of 38.1% for 2024. It has a Zacks ETF Rank #1 and a VGM Score of B.', 'In the latest meeting, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted at a major policy shift as inflation is easing and the economy is holding up better. He signaled three rate cuts for the next year, compared with the previous forecast of two rate cuts in 2024. The federal funds rate is expected to be in the range of 4.4-4.9%, down from the current 5.25% to 5.50%. This indicates that the Fed will cut rates by a total of 0.75% next year, indicating that the historic rate-hiking campaign might be ending.', 'Lower interest rates generally lead to reduced borrowing costs, which can stimulate economic growth. This can positively impact sectors like real estate, consumer discretionary and financial services, which are typically sensitive to interest rate changes. In real estate, for instance, lower rates can boost housing market activity by making mortgages more affordable. For consumer discretionary sectors, reduced borrowing costs can lead to increased consumer spending. In the financial sector, while lower rates can compress net interest margins for banks, they can also encourage lending and potentially lead to increased consumer and business loan activity.', ""As a result, investors could bet on any of these sectors to magnify gains in 2024. In particular, the most beaten-down stocks of 2023 could outperform in 2024. One exciting option could be W.R. Berkley, which is one of the nation's largest commercial lines property casualty insurance providers."", 'The stock is down about 3% this year but has the potential to move higher in 2024, given its Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of B. Additionally, W.R. Berkley saw a positive earnings estimate revision of 3 cents over the past 30 days for 2024, with an estimated growth rate of 20.2%.', 'The allure of gold has returned in recent months on a decline in bond yields and a weaker U.S. dollar. A potential shift in monetary policy coupled with geopolitical tension presents an intriguing scenario for investors looking into 2024. Lower interest rates are usually good for gold, as it weakens the U.S. dollar. A weak dollar makes bullion cheaper for overseas buyers, thereby driving gold prices higher.', 'Additionally, geopolitical tensions like the Israel-Hamas conflict will continue to raise safe-haven buying, making gold attractive. Gold is often used as a means of preserving wealth during times of financial and political uncertainty. It usually does well when other asset classes struggle.', ""Given the optimism, investors have a long list of options to tap into the metal's rally. Eldorado Gold, having a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of A, seems attractive. It is a gold-producing and exploration company with assets in Brazil and Turkey. It has a market cap of $2.7 billion. Eldorado Gold has an estimated earnings growth rate of 24% for 2024 and saw a positive earnings estimate of 15 cents over the past three months."", ""Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

For 2023, Ingersoll Rand expects total revenues to grow 14-16% year over year, whereas organic revenues are projected to increase 9-11%.The company remains focused on acquiring businesses to gain access to new customers, regions and product lines. In October 2023, IR acquired Slovakia-based Oxywise and Canada-based Fraserwoods, thus boosting its capabilities in the high-growth, sustainable end markets. Also, its buyout of Howden Roots in August 2023 expanded its low-pressure compression and vacuum product offerings and added centrifugal compression capabilities. For 2023, Ingersoll Rand anticipates acquisitions to contribute $360 million to total revenues.IR has been committed to rewarding shareholders through dividend payouts and share repurchases.

On surface level, you might think that such periods would be rather disastrous for equities, especially with the vituperative environment. However, the hard numbers suggest otherwise.', 'According to Morningstar, “historical data suggests that elections are not synonymous with market selloffs. A deeper look at the historical trends of the S&P 500 SPX during election cycles demonstrates instances where markets have not only weathered political transitions but have shown resilience and provided favorable returns despite the uncertainty.” That’s encouraging if you’re considering stocks to buy in an election year.', 'What’s more, Morningstar discovered that market performance based on political-party control “shows that even during periods of a divided Congress, S&P 500 returns did not experience significant fluctuations.”', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Put another way, you might not have to worry about equities as a whole. Indeed, this time could be an ideal opportunity for election year stocks to buy.', 'Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: A popular multinational food company, Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) is the third-largest food and beverage company in North America, per its public profile. Also, it happens to be the fifth-largest in the world. As I pointed out before, KHC represents one of Warren Buffett’s favorite holdings. You really can’t go wrong with the Oracle of Omaha’s endorsement.', 'Relevance: Admittedly, KHC ranks among the stocks to buy in an election year not necessarily because it’s poised to do well in 2024. I mean, KHC offers great value for investors, trading at a discounted forward earnings multiple of 12.34x. Rather, I’m just pointing out that nothing specific about next year suggests Kraft Heinz will enjoy the upside. So, why go for it? Simply, people need to eat no matter who becomes president.', 'Pros: The company offers an attractive forward dividend yield of 4.36%, well above the consumer staple sector’s average yield of 1.89%.', 'Cons: Based on analysts’ average price target of $37.31, we’re talking limited upside.', 'Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: For better or for worse, millions of residents in Southern California are familiar with Sempra (NYSE:SRE). A utility giant, Sempra enjoys a natural monopoly. Even if competitors appear on the horizon, it’s incredibly difficult to break into the utility industry. Indeed, the high barriers to entry include regulatory hurdles. That means Sempra is entrenched.', 'Relevance: Now, for the reasons that many residents under the Sempra umbrella don’t like the company, it’s also an ideal enterprise for election year stocks. Listening to the political campaign trails, it’s hard to decipher who will win. You have one candidate saying some – let’s face it – outrageous things. On the other hand, the incumbent candidate isn’t exactly inspiring the base. But no matter, we must pay our utility bills.', 'Pros: Sempra offers a forward dividend yield of 3.18%. While it’s a bit low compared to the industry average, the payout ratio is reasonable at just under 50%.', 'Cons: Although SRE effectively offers permanent relevance, it printed a disappointing performance this year.', 'Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: A massive healthcare giant, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) recently spun off its consumer care products division. That makes J&J a more streamlined enterprise, focusing on pharmaceuticals and medical technologies. It’s not the sexiest enterprise for stocks to buy in an election year. However, it might actually benefit from the rancor in Washington.', 'Relevance: Primarily, healthcare represents a hot-button issue for practically all voters. And that’s especially the case for the older demographics. No party can afford to be portrayed as giving up on the most vulnerable citizens of America. That would be political self-harm. Secondly, the aging of this nation means that J&J should offer relevance no matter who’s elected.', 'Pros: J&J offers a decent forward dividend yield of 3.06%. That’s noticeably higher than the healthcare sector’s average yield of 1.58%. Also, with 61 years of consecutive payouts, that’s a status management will want to keep going.', 'Cons: Unfortunately, JNJ has not yet resonated with investors, with shares suffering relatively deep losses this year.', 'Source: madamF / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: With so many venomous talking points going back and forth between the two major parties, it’s a wonder that anything gets done in Washington. Fortunately, on Wall Street, Republicans and Democrats can get together in support of Vulcan Materials (NYSE:VMC). My friends, Vulcan Materials is America because it builds the future or whatever. It’s easily one of the election-year stocks to buy.', 'Relevance: I don’t mean to be flippant but you’ve got to see the relevance here. Let’s consider the slogans of the last few years. At one point, we heard the rallying cry of build the wall. Later, the White House promised to build back better. What’s the common theme here? Building. Building what? I don’t know. Just something to keep the circus going.', 'Pros: Another reason why VMC ranks among the election year stocks is unanimous endorsement among analysts. Among 10 experts, they all stated VMC is a strong buy.', 'Cons: Vulcan has performed quite well this year so upside in 2024 could be limited.', 'Source: ranchorunner / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: Ordinarily, I would assign Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) as a beneficiary of Republican politics. However, a “flippening” happened in the political ecosystem where conservatives no longer eagerly support projection of military power, whereas Democrats seemingly want to bolster the military industrial complex. Strange stuff but that makes LMT one of the stocks to buy in an election year.', 'Relevance: I don’t want to go down too deep a rabbit hole regarding the geopolitical environment. However, you’d have to be comatose to not recognize the severe power plays at hand. Also, I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to say that America’s credibility is on the line here. Cynically, then, enterprises like Lockheed Martin should benefit because of the Teddy Roosevelt principle. If a fight goes down, it’s best to have the biggest stick.', 'Pros: If you’re looking for a discount among election-year stocks, LMT trades at a trailing-year earnings multiple of 16.33x. That’s lower than 79% of companies in the aerospace and defense industry.', 'Cons: Lockheed isn’t really convincing analysts who only rate it a consensus hold.', 'Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: An integrated oil and gas stalwart, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) could be one of the stocks to buy in an election year if you anticipate that the Republican candidate has a great chance of taking the White House. With conservatives often championing the hydrocarbon sector, CVX may be a solid buy, especially with the relative discount.', 'Relevance: When it comes to relevance of CVX and its ilk, it comes down to the science. Like it or not, fossil fuels command high energy density. Outside of nuclear fuel, many other energy sources simply lack such magnitude of density. Therefore, even with the political and ideological push for clean and renewable energy infrastructure, the hydrocarbon sector should be relevant for many years to come.', 'Pros: Right now, the company prints a solid three-year revenue growth rate of 18.1%. Outside of a few blips, it’s consistently profitable. Also, it features a dividend yield of 4.04%, making it an enticing example of election year stocks.', 'Cons: Due to a combo of economic and geopolitical headwinds, CVX has been volatile lately.', 'Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: Finally, if you anticipate that the Democrats will perform well in 2024 and you want to speculate on high-risk, high-reward enterprises, then solar-panel manufacturer First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) may be of significant interest. It goes without saying that liberals and progressives champion sustainability. And not that Republicans don’t but the left tends to be more vocal about it. That’s a plus for FSLR.', 'Relevance: Again, First Solar aligns with the left-leaning talking points about sustainability. Further, Generation Z advocates such practices, both at a broader level and also personally. You know what’s really enticing if you’re anticipating a blue wave? According to The New York Times, Gen Z is even more liberal than millennials. Plus, this cohort is less likely to become conservative as it ages.', 'Pros: Recently, several solar power enterprises have experienced a significant rise due to speculation about interest rate cuts.', 'Cons: I suppose that if those interest rate cuts don’t materialize, then FSLR may suffer a cruel reality check.', 'On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

280,6e23d3fe-a514-30a6-b986-472fc990f77c,VMC,2023-12-28,7 Stocks That Might Win on Election Year Uncertainty,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-might-win-election-140222273.html,1703167342,STORY,"['FSLR', 'SRE', 'KHC', 'JNJ', 'LMT']","['Soon, it will be that favorite time of the quadrennial cycle where American citizens will decide the future of this great nation, subsequently necessitating a discussion about election year stocks. On surface level, you might think that such periods would be rather disastrous for equities, especially with the vituperative environment. However, the hard numbers suggest otherwise.', 'According to Morningstar, “historical data suggests that elections are not synonymous with market selloffs. A deeper look at the historical trends of the S&P 500 SPX during election cycles demonstrates instances where markets have not only weathered political transitions but have shown resilience and provided favorable returns despite the uncertainty.” That’s encouraging if you’re considering stocks to buy in an election year.', 'What’s more, Morningstar discovered that market performance based on political-party control “shows that even during periods of a divided Congress, S&P 500 returns did not experience significant fluctuations.”', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Put another way, you might not have to worry about equities as a whole. Indeed, this time could be an ideal opportunity for election year stocks to buy.', 'Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: A popular multinational food company, Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) is the third-largest food and beverage company in North America, per its public profile. Also, it happens to be the fifth-largest in the world. As I pointed out before, KHC represents one of Warren Buffett’s favorite holdings. You really can’t go wrong with the Oracle of Omaha’s endorsement.', 'Relevance: Admittedly, KHC ranks among the stocks to buy in an election year not necessarily because it’s poised to do well in 2024. I mean, KHC offers great value for investors, trading at a discounted forward earnings multiple of 12.34x. Rather, I’m just pointing out that nothing specific about next year suggests Kraft Heinz will enjoy the upside. So, why go for it? Simply, people need to eat no matter who becomes president.', 'Pros: The company offers an attractive forward dividend yield of 4.36%, well above the consumer staple sector’s average yield of 1.89%.', 'Cons: Based on analysts’ average price target of $37.31, we’re talking limited upside.', 'Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: For better or for worse, millions of residents in Southern California are familiar with Sempra (NYSE:SRE). A utility giant, Sempra enjoys a natural monopoly. Even if competitors appear on the horizon, it’s incredibly difficult to break into the utility industry. Indeed, the high barriers to entry include regulatory hurdles. That means Sempra is entrenched.', 'Relevance: Now, for the reasons that many residents under the Sempra umbrella don’t like the company, it’s also an ideal enterprise for election year stocks. Listening to the political campaign trails, it’s hard to decipher who will win. You have one candidate saying some – let’s face it – outrageous things. On the other hand, the incumbent candidate isn’t exactly inspiring the base. But no matter, we must pay our utility bills.', 'Pros: Sempra offers a forward dividend yield of 3.18%. While it’s a bit low compared to the industry average, the payout ratio is reasonable at just under 50%.', 'Cons: Although SRE effectively offers permanent relevance, it printed a disappointing performance this year.', 'Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: A massive healthcare giant, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) recently spun off its consumer care products division. That makes J&J a more streamlined enterprise, focusing on pharmaceuticals and medical technologies. It’s not the sexiest enterprise for stocks to buy in an election year. However, it might actually benefit from the rancor in Washington.', 'Relevance: Primarily, healthcare represents a hot-button issue for practically all voters. And that’s especially the case for the older demographics. No party can afford to be portrayed as giving up on the most vulnerable citizens of America. That would be political self-harm. Secondly, the aging of this nation means that J&J should offer relevance no matter who’s elected.', 'Pros: J&J offers a decent forward dividend yield of 3.06%. That’s noticeably higher than the healthcare sector’s average yield of 1.58%. Also, with 61 years of consecutive payouts, that’s a status management will want to keep going.', 'Cons: Unfortunately, JNJ has not yet resonated with investors, with shares suffering relatively deep losses this year.', 'Source: madamF / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: With so many venomous talking points going back and forth between the two major parties, it’s a wonder that anything gets done in Washington. Fortunately, on Wall Street, Republicans and Democrats can get together in support of Vulcan Materials (NYSE:VMC). My friends, Vulcan Materials is America because it builds the future or whatever. It’s easily one of the election-year stocks to buy.', 'Relevance: I don’t mean to be flippant but you’ve got to see the relevance here. Let’s consider the slogans of the last few years. At one point, we heard the rallying cry of build the wall. Later, the White House promised to build back better. What’s the common theme here? Building. Building what? I don’t know. Just something to keep the circus going.', 'Pros: Another reason why VMC ranks among the election year stocks is unanimous endorsement among analysts. Among 10 experts, they all stated VMC is a strong buy.', 'Cons: Vulcan has performed quite well this year so upside in 2024 could be limited.', 'Source: ranchorunner / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: Ordinarily, I would assign Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) as a beneficiary of Republican politics. However, a “flippening” happened in the political ecosystem where conservatives no longer eagerly support projection of military power, whereas Democrats seemingly want to bolster the military industrial complex. Strange stuff but that makes LMT one of the stocks to buy in an election year.', 'Relevance: I don’t want to go down too deep a rabbit hole regarding the geopolitical environment. However, you’d have to be comatose to not recognize the severe power plays at hand. Also, I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to say that America’s credibility is on the line here. Cynically, then, enterprises like Lockheed Martin should benefit because of the Teddy Roosevelt principle. If a fight goes down, it’s best to have the biggest stick.', 'Pros: If you’re looking for a discount among election-year stocks, LMT trades at a trailing-year earnings multiple of 16.33x. That’s lower than 79% of companies in the aerospace and defense industry.', 'Cons: Lockheed isn’t really convincing analysts who only rate it a consensus hold.', 'Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: An integrated oil and gas stalwart, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) could be one of the stocks to buy in an election year if you anticipate that the Republican candidate has a great chance of taking the White House. With conservatives often championing the hydrocarbon sector, CVX may be a solid buy, especially with the relative discount.', 'Relevance: When it comes to relevance of CVX and its ilk, it comes down to the science. Like it or not, fossil fuels command high energy density. Outside of nuclear fuel, many other energy sources simply lack such magnitude of density. Therefore, even with the political and ideological push for clean and renewable energy infrastructure, the hydrocarbon sector should be relevant for many years to come.', 'Pros: Right now, the company prints a solid three-year revenue growth rate of 18.1%. Outside of a few blips, it’s consistently profitable. Also, it features a dividend yield of 4.04%, making it an enticing example of election year stocks.', 'Cons: Due to a combo of economic and geopolitical headwinds, CVX has been volatile lately.', 'Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: Finally, if you anticipate that the Democrats will perform well in 2024 and you want to speculate on high-risk, high-reward enterprises, then solar-panel manufacturer First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) may be of significant interest. It goes without saying that liberals and progressives champion sustainability. And not that Republicans don’t but the left tends to be more vocal about it. That’s a plus for FSLR.', 'Relevance: Again, First Solar aligns with the left-leaning talking points about sustainability. Further, Generation Z advocates such practices, both at a broader level and also personally. You know what’s really enticing if you’re anticipating a blue wave? According to The New York Times, Gen Z is even more liberal than millennials. Plus, this cohort is less likely to become conservative as it ages.', 'Pros: Recently, several solar power enterprises have experienced a significant rise due to speculation about interest rate cuts.', 'Cons: I suppose that if those interest rate cuts don’t materialize, then FSLR may suffer a cruel reality check.', 'On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

As this happens, investors should fortify their portfolios with the purchase of reliable blue-chip stocks that can be expected to outperform.', 'The good news is that many of the best blue-chip names are still available at attractive valuations. Some of the best-known blue chips are only just starting to rise. All after seeing their share price pushed lower during the bear market of 2022. How far they ultimately rise remains to be seen. But here are the best blue-chip stocks 2024: seven to add to your must-buy list.', 'Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com', 'What a turnaround story. After years as an industrial albatross and value trap, General Electric (NYSE:GE) had its best year in nearly two decades in 2023, rising 90%. The reversal caught many investors off guard. But it’s not too late to take a position in GE stock. The shares were so beaten down that even with the rally over the past year, the stock is only trading at 14x earnings estimates.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'The turnaround comes as General Electric has broken itself into three publicly traded companies. The first break-up occurred in January 2023 with the spinoff of GE HealthCare. General Electric’s energy business is being spun off into a new company called GE Vernova in 2024, with the remainder of the company to be renamed GE Aerospace. Although this plan was initially met with skepticism, it has proven to be the right strategy and helped to boost both General Electric’s earnings and GE stock.', 'Source: mimohe / Shutterstock.com', 'General Electric was the comeback story of 2023. But many analysts expect Nike (NYSE:NKE) to be one of the best blue-chip stocks to own in 2024, too. NKE stock has received upgrades from analysts ahead of its earnings report on Dec. 21. Analysts at Citigroup (NYSE:C), for one, upgraded Nike’s stock to a “buy” rating from “neutral” and raised their price target on the shares to $135. That implies 11% upside from current levels. The analyst upgrades come as Nike’s share price has gained 15% in the past month.', 'The analyst upgrades and share price appreciation come on expectations that Nike’s China business is rebounding and its inventories are normalizing after the COVID-19 pandemic. NKE is also expected to benefit in the coming year from lower freight costs, growth in its direct-to-consumer business, and improving margins. Nike’s sales are also expected to get a boost in 2024 from the product line that’s been created for the U.S. team that’s participating in the Paris Olympics.', 'NKE stock is up only 3% in 2023, but it’s clearly in the early innings of a sustained recovery.', 'Source: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.com', 'Shares of Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) have been on a tear ever since the warehouse club issued a stellar earnings report. COST stock has gained 7% since its latest print and the share price is now up 16% over the past month. Year-to-date, the company’s stock has increased 50%. Sales and profits beat Wall Street forecasts, with its e-commerce sales rising 6.3% from a year ago. The company added 72 million paid household members during what was its fiscal Q1.', 'Investors who take a position in COST stock now can also take advantage of a special one-time dividend of $15 per share that the company is paying to shareholders of record on Jan. 12, 2024. This is the fifth special dividend to be paid by Costco in the last 11 years. Beyond the special dividend, Costco pays a regular quarterly dividend to stockholders of $1.03 a share. Costco is also going into 2024 with new leadership as chief operating officer Ron Vachris is scheduled to take over as CEO on Jan. 1.', 'Source: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com', 'Although its stock has increased 55% in 2023, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) hasn’t enjoyed the exponential growth that other companies have gotten from their exposure to artificial intelligence. Companies such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and C3.ai (NYSE:AI) have seen their share prices more than double as the hype surrounding AI hit a fever pitch.', 'The year ahead could see MSFT stock breakout as another one of the best blue-chip stocks of the new year. Analysts acknowledge that the company’s leading role in AI is not fully captured in its share price. As Microsoft begins to monetize artificial intelligence and it shows up in the company’s earnings, the stock should get a boost. Analysts at Oppenheimer have named Microsoft their “top large cap pick” for 2024, citing an expected revenue boost from AI. Oppenheimer has a “buy” equivalent rating on MSFT stock and a $410 price target, implying 10% upside.', 'Source: Tama2u / Shutterstock', 'It’s strange to think that a company approaching its 70th anniversary is in growth mode. But that’s the situation at quick service restaurant chain McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD). The company known for its burgers and fries just announced plans to open 10,000 new restaurant locations and add 100 million members to its loyalty rewards program.', 'The company is also testing 10 locations of a spin-off brand called “CosMc’s” that’s meant to appeal to teenagers and young adults. The first of the new CosMc’s stores is opening in Illinois this December. The aggressive expansion is aimed at boosting McDonald’s global sales and stock price. MCD stock is no slouch. The share price has increased 10% in 2023 and is up 67% over five years.

The cosmetics retailer has seen its share price rise 30% since Nov. 1. However, even with that impressive surge, ULTA stock is up only 3% on the year. Earlier in 2023, Ulta Beauty’s stock had plunged 33% over fears of slowing sales, particularly in China where the economy is struggling.', 'However, Ulta Beauty’s third-quarter print calmed many of those worries and lit a fire under the company’s shares. ULTA stock jumped 11% after the cosmetics company reported strong Q3 financial results and raised its forward guidance. The retailer announced earnings of $5.07 a share and revenue of $2.49 billion. Analysts forecast earnings of $4.96 and $2.47 billion in revenue.

The industry has risen 12.2% year to date compared with the Zacks S&P 500 composite and the Finance sector’s rise of 25.1% and 14.9%, respectively. Per Fitch Ratings, the industry is poised to perform well, banking on improved personal auto, lower claims and an increase in investment.The performance of non-life insurers is affected by catastrophes. Per Gallagher Re, total economic losses were estimated to be $290 billion in the first nine months of 2023. According to AM Best, total net underwriting loss was $32.2 billion in the first nine months of 2023, much higher than $24.6 billion incurred in the year-ago period, largely attributed to rising loss costs, above-average catastrophe activity and adverse trends in personal auto. The combined ratio was 103.5 for the same time frame, per the credit rating giant, to which catastrophe losses added 980 basis points.Per a report in Insurance Journal, the combined net ratio in 2023 is estimated to be 102.2.\xa0 The soft performance of personal lines, which are expected to witness higher catastrophe losses per Insurance Information Institute and Milliman, is expected to result in underwriting losses. Fitch estimates the combined ratio to remain above 100 in 2024.An increase in catastrophe activities leads to a change in pricing. Global commercial insurance prices rose for 24 straight quarters, though the magnitude has slowed down, per Marsh Global Insurance Market Index. Improved pricing drives higher premiums, ensuring smooth claims settlement.Per Deloitte Insights, gross premiums are estimated to increase about six-fold to $722 billion by 2030. China and North America should account for more than two-thirds of the global market, per the report. Per Fitch Ratings, personal auto is likely to deliver better performance in 2024. This, coupled with better investment results and lower claims, should fuel insurers' performance next year per Fitch Ratings. \xa0The insurance industry benefits from a rising rate environment. Though the Fed paused rate hikes at its last three meetings in 2023, and there remains a high probability of rate cuts in 2024, the rate environment has improved over some time. The interest rate currently stands at 5.25-5.50%.The industry is continually undergoing technological developments to improve scale and efficiency. While a solid policyholders’ surplus helps the industry absorb losses, a sturdy capital level supports inorganic expansion, investment in growth initiatives and capital payout to shareholders.Here, we focus on two property and casualty insurers, namely Chubb Limited CB and The Progressive Corporation PGR. Chubb, with a market capitalization of $90.6 billion, is one of the world’s largest providers of property and casualty (P&C) insurance and reinsurance and the largest publicly traded P&C insurer based on market capitalization. Progressive Corporation, with a market capitalization of $92.1 billion, is a leading independent agency writer of private passenger auto coverage, and the market share leader in motorcycle products.

To skip our detailed analysis of the healthcare sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Hot Healthcare Stocks To Buy Now.', ""Healthcare is a vital part of daily living for everyone, whether it be to cure an illness or to ensure that you stay healthy through prompt checkups and consistent care for yourself. As a result, healthcare companies are among those that remain ever popular among investors and consumers alike because they are the type to never go out of fashion since we will always need medical care. However, in today's tech-dominated market, many investors may be concerned about the prospects for other sectors, including healthcare, and their performance through the end of the year and into 2024."", ""On November 30, CNBC's Jim Cramer discussed his opinions on the healthcare sector on 'Mad Money,' most notably about what is holding the healthcare sector back and how one can navigate a tech-dominated market. Here are some of his comments:"", '""First, we are talking about a whole sector that\'s in the crosshairs of the US government because we\'re headed into an election year. The entire election may actually hinge on the cost of things going too high, even as it is going lower according to all indicators. Of course, if you\'re going lower from a much higher base than pre-pandemic, and lower inflation simply means that price are rising more slowly, they\'re not falling, it won\'t cut it. And that make\'s healthcare a natural whipping boy for the government.""', ""So, according to Cramer, one factor holding back the healthcare sector today is the involvement of the government in the sector in preparation for the upcoming elections in the US. A CNBC article from December 7 highlighted how President Biden's administration had seized the patents of several costly medications to ramp up its efforts to slash drug prices and promote competition in the pharmaceutical industry as well. Biden has also been working on making lower drug prices a pillar of his healthcare agenda and reelection strategy. Such a move thus serves as a good example of the government involvement in the healthcare sector noted by Cramer. An implication of such a move by the Biden administration can be the slowdown in the healthcare sector."", ""Another trend Cramer noted that somewhat explains the healthcare sector slowdown is the fact that many people today are continuing to hold back when it comes to going for non-urgent surgeries. Here's what Cramer had to say on this and how that impacts medical device companies in the healthcare sector:"", '""Finally, the medical device business... crushed during COVID when people decided to hold of on all sorts of non-urgent surgeries. The strangest thing is, they\'re still holding off. The numbers never come back. Very hard to figure. Whatever the case, the healthcare group seems a pretty unlikely candidate to help the bullish cause.""', ""Despite the above, the fact that technology today is continuing to evolve and expand its horizons means that other sectors, like healthcare, will also benefit instead of just being overshadowed by a massive tech rally in the market. On November 30, Robert Garrett, the CEO of Hackensack Meridian Health, joined CNBC to discuss the impact of artificial intelligence (AI), in particular, on the healthcare sector. Here's what he had to say:"", '""I see AI as the most profound technology in the world today. If you think about it from a healthcare perspective, whether it\'s helping doctors diagnose disease earlier, helping more people enroll in clinical trials, there\'s no question that AI can improve healthcare in remarkable ways.""', 'In light of the above, despite the current slowdown in the healthcare sector, investors can treat this as a moment to consider some hot healthcare stocks to buy now as plausible additions to their portfolios since tech like AI is bound to rapidly improve healthcare companies and their products.

Specifically, I am going to focus on the purest cases of financial intermediation in which we are invested: AerCap Holdings N.V.

We own a stake in AerCap and ALD Automotive, two companies with very similar businesses in their essence. In short, these entities borrow money to acquire assets (aircraft and automobiles, respectively), lease them for a period of time (on average, seven and four years) and sell them at the end of their contract (in the case of AerCap, the longer useful life of its aircraft means that the contracts are usually renewed at maturity). If these companies were to operate like a bank, they would borrow at very short maturities and would have to continually roll over that financing to avoid falling into an unsustainable liquidity risk, should they have to repay their debt (their assets are leased). However, as we have already seen, operating with such a maturity mismatch would be a recipe for failure. In fact, Guinness Peat Aviation, the company that pioneered the aircraft leasing business in the 1970s and 1980s, ended up going bankrupt (among others), for over-reliance on short-term financing.32 A lesson never to be forgotten by Aengus Kelly, CEO of AerCap and the person who inherited the unloved assets of Guinness Peat Aviation after its sale to GECAS in 1996 (by a twist of fate, Kelly eventually acquired GECAS two years ago)…” (Click here to read the full text)', 'Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75', 'The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is an Ohio-based company that manufactures and markets fast-moving consumer goods.', 'According to Insider Monkey’s database that tracks 910 elite hedge funds, 75 funds had investments in The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)’s stock in the third quarter, compared to 74 in the previous quarter.

If you want to skip our discussion on the impact of residence on well-being, you can go directly to The\xa05 Happiest Cities in America in 2023.', ""Despite the common belief that money can't buy happiness, one cannot deny the fact that it enables a comfortable life. This is reflected in the observation that the happiest countries in the world are often the wealthiest. Conversely, it is widely acknowledged that economically disadvantaged nations tend to be among the least happy. America is among the top 10 wealthiest nations in 2023. Meanwhile, it holds the 16th position on the list of the world’s happiest countries. This incongruity in America's happiness levels and wealth may be attributed to various factors, including the absence of universal and affordable healthcare, a high cost of living, housing crises, and inflation."", 'Despite its overall happiness ranking, the United States was still home to some of the happiest cities in the world in 2023. Fremont, CA, is among the top 5 happiest cities in the world, whereas San Jose, CA, is among the top 10 happiest cities in America and worldwide. An individual’s place of residence has a significant impact on their happiness and overall well-being. Living in cities and towns like these enables individuals to lead more comfortable lives marked by greater economic stability and equality among residents. This is why policymakers and governments aim to bridge the gaps in their systems to provide more comfort to their citizens and cater to their well-being.', ""It is not only the governments and lawmakers who strive for a happier society. Many private and public corporations also play a part in improving people's lifestyles. Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG) is one such corporation that focuses on sustainability and social responsibility. They produce fast-moving consumer goods such as toiletries, hygiene products, cosmetics, skincare, and laundry essentials. Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG) has a strong focus on making their practices sustainable, with an ambition to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions in the next 17 years. Similarly, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is an American retail corporation that operates various grocery stores and discount department stores across the US. In this time of inflation and economic downturn, Walmart Inc.'s (NYSE:WMT) everyday low pricing strategy serves as a relief for American citizens struggling to stay afloat. Another notable company is Gilead Sciences, Inc (NASDAQ:GILD), a pharmaceutical company that aims to eradicate diseases such as HIV/AIDs and promote physical well-being."", ""Here's what ClearBridge Investments said about Gilead Sciences, Inc (NASDAQ:GILD) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:"", '“During the quarter we initiated positions in two new names: T-Mobile and\xa0Gilead Sciences, Inc.\xa0(NASDAQ:GILD).

With pandemic-induced distortions on quarterly financials largely in the rearview mirror (Veklury — aka Remdesivir — was an overnight success as an antiviral treatment of COVID), we believe Gilead’s organic revenue growth potential over the next many years is in the mid-single digits. Gilead’s growth should be stable, as the company has no major patent expirations until the early 2030s.', 'While less growthy than some high-flying drug classes (e.g., diabetes/obesity), Gilead’s current valuation is undemanding, with a P/E barely in the double digits. We tend to shy away from health care investments whose valuation is dependent on pipeline drugs transforming into a large commercial opportunity, given the uncertain nature of drug discovery and the binary characteristic of the stock reactions. In Gilead’s case, we believe the market is ascribing virtually no value to its existing pipeline, in effect providing us with a “free” call option. Lastly, Gilead’s 4% (and growing) coupon should offer considerable downside support amid a more challenging market backdrop.”', 'Our Methodology', 'To shortlist the 30 happiest cities in America in 2023, we consulted WalletHub’s report on the happiest cities in the US.

Among the myriad investment options available, the allure of steady dividend payments stands out as a beacon of reliability and security. These payments represent a portion of a company's profits shared with its shareholders, presenting a consistent income stream. Research indicates that a significant trend among Americans is retiring earlier than they had initially intended, often driven by factors that lie beyond their control. Among the primary reasons cited for this early retirement are issues like deteriorating health conditions or unexpected job loss. In 2022, a Gallup survey highlighted that while the anticipated retirement age averaged around 66 years old, the reality showed a different trend, with individuals retiring at an average age of 62. This discrepancy between anticipated and actual retirement ages has persisted over the years, maintaining a consistent gap of approximately five years since 2002, as reported by Gallup."", 'According to a recent Goldman Sachs Retirement survey, respondents pointed out that certain things like having credit card debt, setting aside money for college, and taking care of or financially assisting family members had an impact on their capacity to save for retirement. This influence persisted despite better conditions in the economy and financial markets. Here are some comments from Chris Ceder, Senior Retirement Strategist at Goldman Sachs Asset Management:', '“The financial vortex threatens all Americans because, despite their best efforts to consistently save when employed, life’s unexpected bumps can meaningfully derail the best retirement savings plans. Only 36% of US workers have three months of income or more saved for emergencies. Unplanned and often unpredictable financial challenges push too many of us off track, and catching up may be difficult. Saving for retirement must remain a top priority.”', 'Amidst this landscape of uncertainty, income generated from dividend stocks serves as a valuable lifeline for retirees. Dividend-paying stocks have demonstrated their resilience and potential as a source of stability in investment portfolios. Over time, these stocks have proven to be reliable performers, often surpassing the broader market in terms of generating consistent returns. Since 1900, dividends have made up roughly 45% of all the gains seen in the S&P 500 Index.', 'In one of its reports, Thornburg Investment Management illustrated the contrast in income growth between bonds and dividend-paying stocks. The firm took a hypothetical $1 million investment from 1990 and calculated the annual income generated. Over the years, the income from bonds gradually decreased, while the dividend income from the equity investment consistently increased. Initially lower than the bond income, the dividend earnings exceeded bond income in about a decade and eventually reached 912% of the bond income by 2020.', 'Dividend growers are popular for an early retirement portfolio. These are companies known for consistently increasing their dividend payouts over time. Their attractiveness lies in their ability to potentially offer a reliable and growing stream of income, a crucial factor for individuals aiming to retire early. Earlier this year, I wrote an article on Early Retirement Portfolio: 15 Stocks to Live Off Dividends Revisited sourced from diverse user platforms.

Although companies took to raising their product prices to cover higher input costs, it was not very well-received by consumers who were already stretching their budgets.', ""The dawn of 2024 brings renewed hope for the consumer staple sector. One of the key factors contributing to this positive outlook is the moderation of inflation, which is likely to enhance companies’ margins and profits.

Moreover, companies that made strategic advertising and brand-building investments this year are likely to experience resultant gains in 2024.Although economic uncertainties persist, the need for everyday products remains constant. Consumer staple companies stand to gain in such times as they offer items essential to daily life, ensuring a consistent market.

The speculative home strategy for each community is based on local market factors.In the first nine months of 2023, home sales revenues grew 8%, backed by a 4% increase in both closings and the average selling price.

If you want to skip our discussion on the airline industry, you can go directly to the 5 Most Dangerous Airlines In The World.', 'Air transport is essential for the development of the global economy as it facilitates connectivity. It enables the free flow of goods, technology, capital, people, and ideas across the globe to support the economic cycle. However, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic brought an abrupt halt to air transport. This disruption significantly impacted airline operations globally, resulting in the industry experiencing an unprecedented loss of $140 billion in 2020.', ""In 2023, the airline industry witnessed a substantial recovery post-COVID-19. The industry-wide revenue for 2023 is projected to reach $896 billion, surpassing the International Air Transport Association's (IATA) June outlook by $93 billion. The expected profit is also $9.8 billion higher than the previously predicted value. This jump in revenue is due to a significant increase in passenger business throughout the year. Passenger traffic recorded a 40% YoY increase in September and achieved 92.9% of the pre-pandemic levels. Moreover, with the exception of Asia Pacific, all regions worldwide are expected to either reach or exceed the 2019 levels of passenger traffic in 2023. Conversely, the cargo segment of the airline industry faced a slowdown this year, with cargo tons per kilometer being lower than the levels in 2022. The primary reason for this is the deceleration in global trade. However, IATA predicts a 4.54% growth in this segment next year."", ""Even with such a significant and fast turnaround, the airline industry faces its own set of challenges. The most significant of these challenges is the vulnerability of this industry to external factors. These factors include economic slowdown, geo-political challenges, rising oil prices, supply chain issues, and regulatory pressures. \xa0Furthermore, air safety is one of the major concerns affecting airlines' operations. A high-profile air crash can easily tarnish the reputation of an airline, leading to a decline in revenues as passengers switch to competing airlines. Hence, notable companies such as American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL), United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL), and Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) spend millions to ensure compliance with all safety standards and aim to be one of safest airlines in the world. You can also check out the 20 Best Airlines in the World in 2023 here."", ""Here's what Patient Capital Management said about Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:"", '“Airlines returned to trough multiples as higher oil prices pressured costs. Historically, airlines have passed these costs on to customers. We think\xa0Delta Air Lines, Inc.\xa0(NYSE:DAL) is a premium brand valued like its economics aren’t sustainable. With mid-teens returns on capital, significant free cash flow generation, excellent capital allocation and long-term earnings per share growth in the high-single to low-double-digits, we think the company is significantly mispriced.', 'Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL) reversed course in the third quarter, falling 24% from its highs in July. The airlines in general were hurt from rising commodity prices that are leading to increased cost per available seat mile (CASM). Historically, airlines have passed on higher fuel prices to customers with a lag. We see Delta as a premium global consumer brand that is materially misunderstood by the market. The market still sees airlines as a cyclical, bankruptcy prone industry. An improved supply-demand picture, management discipline and a better business mix make Delta a more resilient business. Their loyalty program with American Express is a source of stable and growing revenues with $6.5B in remunerations this year with a goal of reaching $10B by the end of the contract in 2028. Premium and ancillary service revenue should generate 65-70% of the total in the next year or two. The company should continue to generate consistent mid-teens returns on capital. As the market begins to understand, we believe the company will continue to be rewarded. On top of this, free cash flow is expected to expand generating a cumulative ~$11B from ’23-’25, or one-half of its current market cap. As the company pays down debt while growing the dividend and eventually resuming share repurchases, we think the stock will continue to trend higher.”', ""The last few decades have seen significant advances in aircraft engineering, which have rendered aviation the safest mode of travel. In 2022, IATA reported 1.21 accidents per million sectors. This is an improvement of 48% as compared to 2013, when 2.31 accidents per million sectors were reported.

It owns a myriad of patents that are critical to the 5G rollout.', 'Relevance: While QCOM has been one of the more frustrating tech juggernauts, it has recently come alive. Nevertheless, a case can be made that it’s still one of the Nasdaq-100 stocks because of its broad reach. For instance, the 5G chipset market reached a valuation of $13.26 billion in 2020. Further, experts project that by 2030, the segment could be worth over $92 billion. That would come out to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21.85%.', 'Pros: Even with the reliable financial performance of QCOM, it’s undervalued. Specifically, shares trade at only 15.62x forward earnings. In contrast, the sector median comes in at 23.34x. Also, analysts rate QCOM a moderate buy with a high-side target of $160.', 'Cons: Because shares have jumped so quickly in recent sessions, analysts on average see muted upside potential.', 'Source: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: Headquartered in Milpitas, California, KLA Corp (NASDAQ:KLAC) is a capital equipment company. Per its public profile, it supplies process control and yield management systems for the semiconductor industry and other related nanoelectronics industries.', 'Relevance: Fundamentally, KLA Corp benefits from a relevant and burgeoning niche in the broader semiconductor ecosystem. According to Business Research Insights, the semiconductor process control equipment market reached a valuation of $8.29 billion last year. Further, experts project that the segment could hit a value of just over $13 billion by 2028. If so, that would come out to a CAGR of 7.9% during the forecast period.', 'Pros: KLA makes a compelling case for bargain Nasdaq-100 stocks thanks to its overall financial print. Right now, it posts a three-year revenue growth rate of 26.8% and an impressive net margin of 30.51%. Both stats run well above the underlying sector averages. Nevertheless, KLAC also trades at a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 0.85x. In contrast, the sector median comes in at 1.46x.', 'Cons: While analysts peg shares a moderate buy, the average price target lands at only $585.42.', 'Source: michelmond / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: Hailing from Santa Clara, California, Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) bills itself as the leader in materials engineering solutions. The company’s products and services integrate into virtually every new chip and advanced display in the world.', 'Relevance: Fundamentally, what makes AMAT a compelling idea for undervalued Nasdaq-100 stocks is relevance to the core industry. According to Market Research Future, the global semiconductor materials market size reached a valuation of just over $59 billion in 2022. Further, experts project that the sector will expand at a CAGR of 4.6% from 2023 through 2030. At the culmination point, the industry should be worth $60.34 billion.', 'Pros: On paper, it’s difficult to argue that AMAT isn’t one of the bargain Nasdaq-100 stocks. Again, you have the relevance. Second, the financials are solid: 19% three-year revenue growth rate and robust margins across the board. On top of that, you get the bonus of a trailing-year earnings multiple of 19.35X. That’s below the sector median of 26.63X.', 'Cons: It’s a strong consensus buy but as one of the top-tier Nasdaq-100 stocks, the average price target of $165.72 implies limited upside.', 'Source: PopTika / Shutterstock', 'What it is: Based in Baltimore, Maryland, Constellation Energy (NASDAQ:CEG) is the nation’s largest producer of carbon-free energy and provides sustainable solutions to homes, businesses, and public-sector customers across the continental U.S. Per its website, its energy resources stem include wind, solar, hydroelectric and nuclear.', 'Relevance: Obviously, the key for CEG as one of the undervalued Nasdaq-100 stocks centers on the relevance of the business. To put it into numbers, the global renewable energy market size will come out to $1.21 trillion at year’s end. Plus, the sector will expand at a CAGR of 17.2% from 2024 to 2030. Again, that’s the global figure, whereas Constellation focuses on the continental U.S. Still, it gives you an idea of the opportunity.', 'Pros: As a diversified energy producer, Constellation fundamentally benefits from effectively permanent relevance. Thus, it enjoys consistency in its business. Still, CEG trades at only 1.46x trailing-year revenue. In contrast, the sector median comes in at 2.47x.', 'Cons: To be fair, the rest of Constellation’s financials aren’t exactly sterling. Also, CEG has already moved up so strongly this year.', 'Source: madamF / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: Headquartered in Tarrytown, New York, Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN) is one of the top-tier biotechnology firms. Originally, the company focused on neurotrophic factors and their regenerative capabilities, thus explaining its corporate name.', 'Relevance: Currently, one of Regeneron’s main focus is leveraging antibodies as therapeutics. And it doesn’t get much bigger of an arena when it comes to biotech firms. According to MarketsandMarkets, the global antibody therapeutics market will print sales of $247.3 billion at year’s end. Further, experts project that the segment will expand at a CAGR of 14.1% by 2028. At the forecast culmination, the industry could be worth $479 billion.', 'Pros: Financially, the company prints a three-year EBITDA growth rate of 25.8%, beating out nearly 74% of its peers. It also enjoys consistent profitability, helped by excellent operating and net margins. Even with these attributes, REGN trades for only 24x trailing-year earnings. That compares favorably to the sector median of 32.44x, making it one of the bargain Nasdaq-100 stocks.', 'Cons: REGN is a slow-and-steady mover so if you’re looking for blistering returns, this isn’t it.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'What it is: Calling Philadelphia, Pennsylvania home, Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is the largest American multinational telecommunications and media conglomerate per its public profile. It features a massive profile of broadcasting and cable television along with an internet service provider business.', 'Relevance: One could make jokes about the cord-cutting situation and you wouldn’t be wrong. However, unless you envision a future where there’s no television being watched and no Internet being used, Comcast commands permanent relevance. Plus, under the company umbrella, Comcast owns a rich entertainment portfolio. These factors should help keep the money flowing, even if it’s not the most exciting idea among undervalued Nasdaq-100 stocks.', 'Pros: For those willing to be a bit adventurous, CMCSA brings a solid financial profile to the table. Its three-year revenue growth rate of 5.1% isn’t spectacular but it’s definitely above average for the sector. Also, it’s consistently profitable thanks to strong margins across the board. And finally, it only trades for a forward multiple of 10.33x, lower than 67% of its rivals.', 'Cons: CMCSA is going through a frustrating sideways consolidation since late July.', 'Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com', 'What it is: Based in Stamford, Connecticut, Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR) is a telecommunications and mass media. It offers services under the brand Spectrum. Per its public profile, it features over 32 million customers in 41 states, making it the second-largest cable operator in the U.S., just behind Comcast.', 'Relevance: At first glance, CHTR might not seem like a particularly relevant example of bargain Nasdaq-100 stocks. However, it’s important to note that the TV and video market in the U.S. will print revenue of $275.7 billion by year’s end. Further, according to Statista, experts project that the sector will expand at a CAGR of 3.01%. By 2028, market volume should hit $319.8 billion.', 'Pros: Over the past three years, Charter’s revenue clocked in at 17.1%, beating out nearly 84% of its peers. Also, it enjoys a very strong operating margin of 22.8%. Enticingly, CHTR trades at only 9.92x forward earnings. In contrast, the sector median stands at 13.18x. Finally, analysts rate shares a moderate buy with a $456.18 average price target.', 'Cons: Growth has been slowing in recent quarters so it’s something to watch carefully.', 'On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'The #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of', 'Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.', ""We can see that Ameriprise Financial does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time.

315,777e7cb2-c2b8-3e42-ba52-8f8505f56cd7,CSCO,2023-12-28,Cisco: The Power of Purpose,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cisco-power-purpose-133000121.html,1703683800,STORY,['CSCO'],"['NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / December 27, 2023 / Cisco Systems Inc.', 'by Francine Katsoudas', ""We released our annual Purpose Report, which reflects and celebrates the past year's work towards Powering an Inclusive Future for All-the progress we've made against our goals, and the people and lives we've touched. The report explores the theme, The Power of Purpose, because we recognize that when we intersect our business, technology, and a network of partners together with our purpose, we create a powerful force for lasting change. And we have some incredible examples from this year, including the announcement that we achieved our goal of positively impacting 1 billion lives, and did so over a year early!"", 'For many years, the purpose of our Purpose Report has been to look back. But we must also look ahead.', ""Any company looking to successfully execute their business strategy must consider the changing terrain, identify upcoming challenges and trends, and anticipate how to best meet evolving requirements. The same is true for purpose. This year's Purpose Report begins to explore the landscape, and where we see opportunities for Purpose to grow."", 'Our biggest challenges are interconnected and interdependent', 'The past several years brought us all unprecedented challenges, and a world more prone to polarization than before. But instead of binary questions and issues, a more multipolar world has emerged, requiring us to operate with more nuance and greater context than ever. In this context one thing is clear-we are more interconnected and interdependent than ever.', 'Our lives and futures are linked by our shared dependence on our planet and its environments. We have a global responsibility to solve the climate crisis together. We see the growth of an increasingly digital and global economy, keeping us connected through ecosystems of financial interdependence. And as we learned in the recent pandemic, our collective health is also inextricably linked.', 'Global crises also continue to grow increasingly interconnected\xad\xad--and the consequences disproportionately fall on vulnerable communities. Developing nations who often contribute the least to climate change bear the brunt of its impact. And due to a lack of infrastructure and technological advancement, they are often the least equipped to respond to natural disasters. While the digital economy continues to grow, 2.6 billion people remain unconnected, denying them access to the opportunities and resources available. The consequences of each crisis exacerbate others\xad\xad-access to education is disrupted, progress for women and girls is set back, and extreme poverty rates rise.', 'Pursuing our Purpose can and must be the glue that brings us together to meet this moment and address these complex, interconnected issues. The question we must continue to ask as we look ahead is, how?', ""This year's report reflects on how-how we achieved our goal of positively impacting 1 billion lives, how the private sector can work in new ways to address critical issues facing our societies, and how we can apply lessons from the past to build resilience in our communities for the future."", 'Where do we go from here?', ""There is no doubt that the path forward for business in a multipolar world isn't entirely clear. There is significant work ahead to address risks in supply chains and manufacturing, and complex questions on how to best navigate a shifting geopolitical terrain. But should these challenges and uncertainties also apply to Purpose?"", ""I don't think so. In fact, in this moment when many are shying away from a global mindset and approach, our Purpose work proceeds by pursuing what is most meaningful, regardless if that is at the local or global level. Purpose can flex. It operates in a lane that is valued around the world, giving all of us who do this work the space to create and iterate, to sway and pivot, and find our rhythm. And when we do, pursuing our Purpose holds the door open for economic initiatives."", ""As we close the year in which we reached a goal of positively impacting one billion people, I'm looking ahead and considering the next goal we'll set for ourselves. We are stronger with our partners by our side-an ecosystem focused on driving impact. We'll continue to do this if we integrate the lessons of the past and take a new approach in the days and years ahead. I hope you'll join us on this journey and read about our impact this year, and my reflections on what's next, in our FY23 Purpose Report. Together, we can do good for our communities, good for our businesses, and good for all."", 'Read the full Cisco FY23 Purpose Report', 'View original content here.', 'View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.', 'Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-incEmail: info@3blmedia.com', 'SOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.', 'View the original press release on accesswire.com']"
