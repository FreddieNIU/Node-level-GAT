7,fd7e160a-02b5-33ff-b101-ca8a6a03b3e3,AYI,2023-06-23,Acuity Brands (AYI) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/acuity-brands-ayi-earnings-expected-140006651.html,1687442406,STORY,['AYI'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on lower revenues when Acuity Brands (AYI) reports results for the quarter ended May 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on June 29. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis lighting maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.60 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +2.3%.Revenues are expected to be $1.04 billion, down 2.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.86% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Acuity Brands?For Acuity Brands, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.01%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Acuity Brands will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Acuity Brands would post earnings of $2.54 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.06, delivering a surprise of +20.47%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Acuity Brands doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE: ARE), the first, preeminent, longest-tenured and pioneering owner, operator and developer of collaborative life science, agtech and advanced technology campuses in AAA innovation cluster locations, has led the development, expansion and transformation of the San Diego life science ecosystem into one of the country's top life science clusters since inventing and creating the novel Labspace® niche in 1994 with the acquisition of the company's first properties in Torrey Pines as a newly founded startup. Through Alexandria's disciplined focus on creating highly sought-after mega campuses in high-barrier-to-entry markets, the company has established a dominant market presence in San Diego, primarily located in the highly desirable submarkets of Torrey Pines and University Town Center (UTC). As of March 31, 2023, its highly impactful footprint in San Diego consists of 14.5 million RSF, with 8.1 million RSF of operating properties, which support a range of high-quality tenants, including multinational pharmaceutical companies that are among Alexandria's top 20 tenants by annual rental revenue and currently have an aggregate market capitalization of over $830 billion: Bristol Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly, Novartis and Takeda. Takeda's west coast global research and development site is located at Alexandria's 9625 Towne Centre Drive in the UTC submarket of San Diego and is home to four research platform groups — structural biology, computational biology, early target discovery and biologics — that enable the discovery and advancement of promising molecules. Designed to enhance innovation, collaboration and efficiency, the Class A life science facility comprises 163,648 RSF that Alexandria redeveloped in 2017 and delivered to Takeda in 2018. The modern research facility is LEED Gold and Fitwel certified, and the site can accommodate an expansion opportunity of 100,000 SF or larger.Story continuesAlexandria continued its strong execution of its successful value harvesting and asset recycling self-funding strategy with the completion of the recapitalization of an existing real estate joint venture for 9625 Towne Centre Drive on June 21, 2023. Alexandria and its former real estate joint venture partner for this asset completed the sale of a 70% interest in 9625 Towne Centre Drive at a total property valuation of $160.5 million, or $981 per RSF, and at a strong capitalization rate of 4.5% (based upon cash net operating income for 2Q23 annualized). As a result of this recapitalization, Alexandria's share of the sales price was $32.3 million and its ownership interest in the property decreased from 50.1% to 30%; the company retains operating control, while the former joint venture partner exited the investment entirely, reaping a strong return. This transaction resulted in consideration in excess of book value of $15.6 million and a value-creation margin of 88% for Alexandria. Proceeds from this recapitalization will be reinvested into the company's highly leased value-creation pipeline. As of March 31, 2023, 6.7 million RSF of current and near-term projects that are 72% leased are expected to generate more than $610 million of annual incremental net operating income, primarily commencing from 2Q23 through 1Q26. This multiyear visibility for future growth enabled Alexandria to reiterate guidance of 6.4% annual growth in funds from operations per share – diluted, as adjusted, for 2023 at the midpoint of guidance as of April 24, 2023, with a strong adjusted EBITDA margin of 69% for 1Q23.""Our successful recapitalization of this stand-alone, single-tenant building showcases the value of and demand for our scarce, high-quality life science assets,"" said Daniel J. Ryan, co-chief investment officer and regional market director at San Diego of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. ""Purpose-built for Takeda, the state-of-the-art, mission-critical facility houses complex, specialized equipment and contiguous, integrated nontechnical workflow space to support their highly valuable pipeline of scientific research that cannot be operated from home. As one of Takeda's three global research and development centers, this site plays an important role in advancing their pipeline, particularly for debilitating gastrointestinal and neurological diseases. Ideally located in our UTC submarket — at the epicenter of the San Diego Science Sector, which is home to over 525 life science companies — 9625 Towne Centre Drive provides Takeda with critical proximity to leading research institutions and enables their relentless pursuit to bring transformative therapies to patients worldwide.""""The value and essential nature of laboratory space is based on the high value of the science that is housed, researched, developed and commercialized in these mission-critical and often government-regulated spaces,"" said Joel S. Marcus, executive chairman and founder of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. and Alexandria Venture Investments. ""Alexandria's one-of-a-kind life science real estate platform, operational excellence, best-in-class design and thoughtfully curated placemaking continue to empower the growth of and accelerate innovation for our tenants in San Diego and across all our innovation clusters to enable their mission-critical work to improve, extend and save people's lives.""Alexandria counts 17 of the top 20 pharmaceutical companies by R&amp;D spend, according to data from Evaluate Pharma, in its REIT industry-leading tenant base. The life science industry, which has an estimated market value of over $5 trillion and aggregate annual research and development funding in the range of $450 billion to $500 billion, is large, diverse and well positioned for continued secular growth. Alexandria's client base reflects this diversity with over 850 tenants that span multinational pharmaceutical companies; public and private biotechnology companies; life science product, service and device companies; and academic/medical institutions. With strong balance sheets and significant free cash flows to fuel innovation and growth, Alexandria's multinational pharmaceutical segment constitutes 18% of its annual rental revenue as of March 31, 2023. Additionally, global biopharma companies invested nearly $270 billion into R&amp;D in 2022 in their efforts to translate discoveries into new, more effective medicines for patients, reflecting a 57% increase over the past decade. 2023 is on pace to be a record-setting year for new FDA-approved medicines, with potentially up to 60 new approvals anticipated this year. Yet, with 10,000 known diseases that affect us all, and only about 10% addressable with therapies, we are still in the early innings of a biology revolution that has remarkable growth potential for the life science industry. Catalyzed by innovative technologies, massive unmet medical need and strong fundamentals, this vital life science industry remains uniquely positioned to tackle and solve society's most persistent and pervasive healthcare challenges. Alexandria's Labspace infrastructure, which houses billions of dollars of irreplaceable tenant research and clinical pipeline assets, remains a key component of this noble pursuit.9625 Towne Centre Drive, University Town Center, San Diego.

Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Unum Group UNM, Kinsale Capital Group Inc. KNSL, Reinsurance Group of America Inc. RGA, RLI Corp. RLI and Corebridge Financial Inc. CRBG.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:5 Momentum Insurance Stocks to Buy for a Stable PortfolioThe Wall Street rally of the past month has halted recently. Although the primary reason for the break in the rally was simply profit bookings, concerns regarding further hike in interest rate is also looming large. On Jun 22, in his testimony before the U.S. Congress, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that more rate hikes are expected by the end of this year.According to Powell “Inflation pressures continue to run high, and the process of getting inflation back down to 2% has a long way to go.” The core consumer price index (excluding volatile food and energy items) was 5.3% in May, well above the central bank’s 2% target rate.In the June FOMC meeting, the Fed kept the Fed fund rate unchanged in the range of 5-5.25% after 10 consecutive rate hikes. However, the Fed’s “dot plot” of the last FOMC indicated two more rate hikes of 25 basis points. This implies that the range of the benchmark lending rate is likely to go up in the range of 5.5-5.75% with a terminal rate of 5.6% instead of 5.125% projected after the May FOMC meeting. Insurance Industry to GainA massive rise in the market interest rate will raise the cost of funds, enabling financial companies to widen the spread between longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities, thus boosting the financial sector’s profit margin.Moreover, higher bond yields will raise the market's risk-free returns. Insurance providers are generally compelled to hold ample long-term safe bonds to back the policies that are written. A higher interest rate should benefit insurance companies.Story continuesThe spread between the longer-term assets and shorter-term liabilities would increase the spread of insurers.

Although the primary reason for the break in the rally was simply profit bookings, concerns regarding further hike in interest rate is also looming large. On Jun 22, in his testimony before the U.S. Congress, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that more rate hikes are expected by the end of this year.According to Powell “Inflation pressures continue to run high, and the process of getting inflation back down to 2% has a long way to go.” The core consumer price index (excluding volatile food and energy items) was 5.3% in May, well above the central bank’s 2% target rate.In the June FOMC meeting, the Fed kept the Fed fund rate unchanged in the range of 5-5.25% after 10 consecutive rate hikes. However, the Fed’s “dot plot” of the last FOMC indicated two more rate hikes of 25 basis points. This implies that the range of the benchmark lending rate is likely to go up in the range of 5.5-5.75% with a terminal rate of 5.6% instead of 5.125% projected after the May FOMC meeting. Insurance Industry to GainA massive rise in the market interest rate will raise the cost of funds, enabling financial companies to widen the spread between longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities, thus boosting the financial sector’s profit margin.Moreover, higher bond yields will raise the market's risk-free returns. Insurance providers are generally compelled to hold ample long-term safe bonds to back the policies that are written. A higher interest rate should benefit insurance companies.The spread between the longer-term assets and shorter-term liabilities would increase the spread of insurers. The insurance industry's profitability has risen historically during periods of rising interest rates.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five momentum insurance stocks.

""You always want something like this to happen to a great partner. He's a role model for our partners and the passion he has for his customers is just unmatched.

That coworker drove Rosa and his wife Betty – a 9-year Cintas employee-partner, also at the Decatur Rental location – to work on Thursday morning since they would have the truck to drive home at the end of the day.During the Cintas-Carhartt customer awareness campaign, each Cintas SSR in the U.S. and Canada had the opportunity to participate in the Cintas-Carhartt customer awareness program, which ran January through December 2022. Those SSRs who achieved a specified threshold of Carhartt Company Gear direct sales from the co-branded Cintas Sourcebook earned an entry for a monthly drawing to randomly select 12 contest finalists. The 12 randomly selected finalists were then flown into the Cincinnati area for the two-day, grand-prize event in late April at Cintas’ corporate headquarters in Mason, Ohio.During the trip, finalists received $1,000 for an exclusive shopping event at the Cincinnati Carhartt store, a custom-embroidered Carhartt Legacy Gear Bag, dinner and breakfast with Cintas and Carhartt executives, a tour of Cintas’ company headquarters, and meet-and-greet opportunities with Cintas President and CEO Todd Schneider and Carhartt President and COO Linda Hubbard.At the conclusion of the grand-prize ceremony, each finalist selected one box among 12 on a display on stage – one of which contained the key to the grand prize: the brand-new Chevrolet Silverado Carhartt Edition heavy-duty truck.

Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.Another thing that can drive investing is the fear of missing out, or FOMO. This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Cintas (CTAS) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to CTAS for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Cintas' Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Cintas' main business drivers.Founded in 1968 and headquartered in Cincinnati, OH, Cintas Corporation provides specialized services to businesses of all types throughout North America. It also operates in Europe, Asia and Latin America. The company designs, manufactures, implements corporate identity uniform programs, and provides entrance mats, restroom supplies, promotional products and first aid and safety products for diversified businesses.Notably, the company provides products and services through distribution and retail channels to small service and manufacturing companies as well as leading corporations.The company primarily reports revenues under two operating segments — Uniform Rental and Facility Services, and First Aid and Safety Services.Uniform Rental and Facility Services (78.4% of third-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues) segment includes rental, and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels as well as the provision for restroom supplies, and other facility products and services. Further, selling items from catalogs to customer routes are reported under this segment.First Aid and Safety Services (10.6% of third-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues) segment includes the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training to customers.Businesses, with Uniform Direct Sale and Fire Protection Services, are included in All Other. Revenues generated from All Other businesses represented 11.1% of second-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues.It's worth mentioning here that results of First Aid and Safety Services segment and All Other businesses are grouped under Other Services in Cintas' income statement.Story continuesBottom LineWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in Cintas ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in June 2013 would be worth $10,779.97, or a 978% gain, as of June 22, 2023, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.Compare this to the S&amp;P 500's rally of 174.15% and gold's return of 37.45% over the same time frame.Analysts are anticipating more upside for CTAS.Strong segmental performances are aiding Cintas. Increased volumes are boosting the Uniform Rental and Facility Services unit’s results. Strength in the first aid cabinet service business is driving growth of the First Aid and Safety Services unit. Cintas’ efforts to reward shareholders are impressive. Last July, CTAS hiked its dividend by 21%. The company’s improved earnings and revenue forecast for fiscal 2023 is encouraging. Amid these positives, shares of the company have outperformed its industry in the past six months. However, rising cost of sales (up 11.3% in the first nine months of fiscal 2023) poses a threat to the bottom line. Selling and administrative expenses also climbed 16.6% in the same period. Foreign currency headwinds might hurt sales going forward. The company's weak liquidity position is an added woe.The stock is up 5.24% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 1 higher, for fiscal 2023. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Walmart has been building its e-commerce business while Amazon has tried its hand at physical stores, for example. Winner Sells All: Amazon, Walmart and the Battle For Our Wallets author Jason Del Rey tells Yahoo Finance Live how the competition between the retailers has changed over the years.Video Transcript- All right, well, Amazon and Walmart, two retail titans with a long history of going head to head. From e-commerce and groceries, to even dipping their toes in the world of health care. So where does the rivalry stand today? And what's ahead for the two retail giants? We want to bring in Jason Del Rey. He has a new book out ""Winner Sells All"" hitting shelves this week. Jason, it's great to see you here.So I think a lot of people are just trying to figure out the situation that we are in right now. Walmart, obviously, has been struggling to keep up with what Amazon has been doing over the last nearly three decades. Where do things stand today? And how are we in this position?JASON DEL REY: Sure. Thanks for having me. So I think first of all, Walmart is finally-- after a few decades of treating e-commerce largely as a side project, a hobby if you will-- has finally been taking it rather seriously the last five to seven years.And, really, the pandemic has helped force them into connecting one advantage they have, their physical stores, with the online capabilities that come with online shopping to offer online pickup from curbside, also delivery from stores. And they're finally, I wouldn't say catching up to Amazon, but showing themselves to be sort of a worthy competitor in the online space.- Yeah. And Walmart has often touted that the online offline model, right? That they have the footprint in place here. It's a different play with Amazon. But you get the sense that with Amazon, at least on the e-commerce side of things, things have started to kind of not level off because they're still seeing strength in the retail sector, but it's just not at the level that it was during COVID. We have seen some of the layoffs happening. I mean, where do you think their e-commerce play goes from here? How do they continue to dominate in the face of more competition?Story continuesJASON DEL REY: Yeah. This is-- the Amazon of the past year or so is not the Amazon we have known for-- during the early days of the pandemic and even the prior decade. CEO transition, obviously, lay offs, investment cutbacks. A lot of folks internally would say they needed some more discipline in their investments. But online sales growth slowing as well.So we see them investing heavily into advertising. I think around the $40 billion business, analysts say more profitable-- higher profit margins than even AWS. And so when you visit the site, if you look closely, just about everything feels like it has a sponsored label.Now they say they can do that in a way that is beneficial for consumers, but long term, I do-- you know, I think there is concern about the shopping experience itself. That said, Walmart, trying to invest heavily in advertising as well.I was at a recent conference for this industry, the retail media industry basically advertising on retail sites. And Walmart was a sponsor right alongside Amazon. So both going at this space heavily, robust profit margins, but a questionable experience for shoppers.- What about the brick and mortar play? Obviously that's an area where Walmart has this massive advantage. Is this something that you think Amazon should focus on or will focus on at all in future given the fact that they are such a leader in the e-commerce side of it?JASON DEL REY: I think we saw with the Whole Foods acquisition back in 2017 and some of the build out of Amazon's own stores, many of which have not worked yet. So Amazon Bookstores which were closed down, Amazon Fresh Grocery Stores, which have sort of-- that expansion has been put on pause. I think they believe they need a physical presence because we forget somewhere around 80% of retail still happens in stores.So Amazon feels like they need that presence even if it's just for a pickup and drop off offering for delivery-- for merchandise ordered and returned. So they really haven't figured it out though. Their DNA is online. They think that technology could be a differentiation in stores. That really hasn't proven out yet. But I think they'll keep going at this space just largely because so much spending still happens there.- Jason, from an investor standpoint, in many ways Walmart's an easy one to understand because they are all in on retail. Amazon, obviously, has other arms. AWS is a significant one. But as they try to focus or refocus the company, I wonder what sense you get in terms of what it is that Amazon wants to be moving forward. Is it about doubling down on the e-commerce side in the face of competition from the likes of Walmart? Or is there enough loyalty built in there that Amazon feels comfortable in taking bigger bets on other businesses?JASON DEL REY: It's a great question. And I think we really are seeing an inflection point at Amazon, where it's still unclear whether this is a company moving from what Jeff Bezos called day one very innovative to a day to mature company that is satisfied with slower growth but bigger profits and less risk taking.I can't imagine Andy Jassy, the CEO, would be satisfied with that. But they're in this weird phase right now. That said, Prime is really sticky. I mean, we'll see what happens with the recent FTC lawsuit having to do with alleged misleading tactics to keep people signed up and then retain them. But Prime is really sticky.Walmart Plus is a competing offering, which is a pretty good offering. They feel like they need to steal some Prime customers. All of that said, I think health care is one space where Amazon will continue to be aggressive, Walmart as well. Think it's possible we look back a decade from now and see these two companies making a pretty profound impact on that space, in addition to all the industries they play in already.- Jason, when it comes to Amazon, lots of talk just about how Walmart's worried about Amazon. Who should Amazon be worried about? Who's some of the smaller players that you think could be a larger competitor to them down the road?JASON DEL REY: Sure. Listen, I think they are absolutely paying attention, again, to Walmart. They didn't for a long time after it seemed like Walmart was not going to be any sort of rival. Some of the companies that are interesting to me-- and I think Amazon pays attention to-- Shopify not a retail company, a technology company. Maybe overextending themselves when they tried to get into logistics themselves, how to spin off that operation.But Shopify is worthy competitor in that they really care about small businesses and medium sized businesses. So it be interesting to watch that. The one looking out far I think is TikTok. I know Amazon has long tried to go from not just being a place you shop when you know what you want to a place that you might browse. TikTok with this immersive video experience has ambitions of breaking into e-commerce in a real way.And it's just a company. I'll continue to watch over the next few years to see whether they can attract interest from folks who want to sort of window shop and find influence from people they follow, and maybe make some buying decisions based on that.- Yeah, a big part of that, the element of discovery. It'll be interesting to see how that all shakes down. Jason Del Rey, author of ""Winner Sells All"" in tech business journalist. Good to talk to you today.JASON DEL REY: Great. Thanks for having me.]"

Let’s take a closer look at each.WalmartWalmart offers a diverse blend of products at reasonable prices, allowing it to capture revenue from lower and higher-end consumers who decide to ‘trade down’ and save their cash. The stock is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The retail titan posted strong results in its latest release, delivering year-over-year global eCommerce growth of 26% and raising its FY24 outlook. Quarterly revenue totaled $152.2 billion, ahead of expectations and improving 7% from the year-ago period.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, Walmart’s 21.3% trailing twelve-month ROE is certainly worth highlighting, reflecting a higher level of efficiency in generating profits from existing assets. As shown below, the current value is well above the Zacks Retail and Wholesale sector average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAnd to top it off, Walmart is a member of the elite Dividend Aristocrat group, putting its shareholder-friendly nature on full display. Shares currently yield 1.5% annually, with the payout growing 2% over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesMcDonald’sWe’re all familiar with the restaurant titan McDonald’s, seeing those golden arches at seemingly every stop. The stock is presently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with earnings expectations increasing across the board.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchShares may not entice value-focused investors, further reflected by the Style Score of “D” for Value. MCD shares currently trade at a 26.6X forward earnings multiple, modestly above the five-year median and Zacks sector average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStill, investors haven’t minded forking up the premium for shares given the company’s favorable growth trajectory, with earnings forecasted to climb 10% on 8% higher revenues in its current fiscal year (FY23). And in FY24, estimates call for an additional 9% uptick in earnings and 7% sales growth.Procter &amp; GambleProcter &amp; Gamble, a current Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), posted better-than-expected results and provided optimistic guidance in its latest release, helping shares close 3.5% higher post-earnings. Earnings improved 3% year-over-year, whereas revenue saw growth of 4%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchProcter &amp; Gamble is a classic dividend stock, holding the ranks of not only a Dividend Aristocrat but a Dividend King as well. PG shares currently yield 2.5% annually, with the company carrying a solid 6.3% five-year annualized growth rate.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, it’s worth noting that shares have recently found support near the $142 per share level, a previous resistance level for the stock. This ‘resistance-support flip’ is illustrated in the chart below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineFor those seeking a more conservative approach, low-beta stocks provide precisely that. These stocks are less susceptible to the broader market’s movements, helping to limit those spooky price swings.And all three above – Walmart WMT, McDonald’s MCD, and Procter &amp; Gamble PG – could be great considerations for those looking for stability.All three sport a favorable Zacks Rank and have an established track record of success, undeniably significant benefits.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.V.F. Corp Q4 Earnings &amp; Sales Beat Estimates, Fall Y/YV.F. Corp reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results, with the top and bottom lines surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

At cc, revenues were flat. The top line was hurt by sluggishness in the Americas region on account of a tough wholesale environment, which was partially offset by growth in the EMEA and APAC regions.Revenues in the Americas declined 7% year over year on a reported basis and at cc. In the EMEA region, revenues rose 2% (up 8% at cc). Revenues in both the APAC and Greater China regions increased by 3% on a reported basis (up 10% at cc).

In the prior-year quarter, the company reported revenues of $2.4 billion.Factors to NoteCarnival’s fiscal second-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from strong demand for cruising, acceleration in booking volumes, bundled package offerings and pre-cruise sales. Management stated that its 2023 cumulative advanced booked position is at increased prices compared with 2019 levels.Increased revenues from its onboard and passenger ticket are likely to have driven fiscal second-quarter top line. Our model predicts passenger ticket revenues, and onboard and other revenues to increase 150.7% and 39.5% year over year to $3,221.6 million and $1,557.3 million, respectively.However, inflationary pressures are likely to have dented CCL’s margins in the to-be-reported quarter.

The dollar was the big market mover - surging into the weekend against Asia and European currencies.With central bankers around the world this week still focused on squeezing the last vestiges of inflation from the system, questions will inevitably be raised about the remarkable resilience of economies to date in the face of tighter credit.While Federal Reserve boss Jerome Powell slightly softened his tone at the second day of his semi-annual congressional hearings on Thursday - talking of a ""careful pace"" in any further hikes - he continued to point to two more tightening notches this year even though markets still only see one.But the hawkishness was more pronounced in Europe where inflation looks slower to retreat. The Bank of England and Norway's central bank both executed stiff half-point rate rises on Thursday, with the Swiss National Bank hiking rates too.For stock and commodity markets, the latest brush strokes to the combined picture provided another reason to reverse some of June's ebullience, with European stocks on course for their worst week in three months.Even though Shanghai was closed for a holiday, other Asia bourses were also lower by more than 1% on Friday.Brent crude oil prices, which are still falling at a rate of more than 30% year-on-year, dropped to a 10-day low.After a late rally by Wall Street's main stock indexes on Thursday after Powell's comments, U.S. stock futures were back in the red early today.Story continuesCompared with Europe, the picture appears more benign stateside - even if still complicated. Inflation is falling faster, real wage growth is back positive, the jobs market is loosening slightly and housing is rebounding somewhat.So even as stock prices have come off the year's highs, the VIX implied volatility gauge continues to fall away - closing below 13 on Thursday for the first time since January 2020.Two-year Treasury yields did pop higher to 4.80% on Thursday for the first time in a week, but have slipped back a bit since.And the Treasury yield curve inversion between 2- and 10-years, often seen as a harbinger of slowdown and recession, deepened below 100 basis points for the first time since the banking stress of early March.The dollar was the big mover however - hitting its highest for the year against Japan's yen and China's yuan and surging also against the euro, sterling and Swiss franc.Events to watch for later on Friday: * Flash June business surveys from the United States and around the world * Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic, St Louis Fed President James Bullard and Cleveland Fed chief Loretta Mester all speak * U.S. Corporate earnings: Carmax(By Mike Dolan, editing by Jane Merriman mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell 35 cents, or 0.5%, at $69.16.On Thursday, Brent dropped about $3 a barrel after the Bank of England raised interest rates by a bigger-than-expected half a percentage point. Central banks in Norway and Switzerland also hiked rates.The benchmarks declined more than 3.5% for the week.More U.S. interest rate hikes also seemed likelier. San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President Mary Daly said two more rate hikes this year was a ""very reasonable"" projection.""There seems to be a growing 'risk back off' type of trade now in crude, triggered by the interest rate rises in the EU and disappointing stimulus numbers out of China,"" said Dennis Kissler, senior vice president of trading at BOK Financial.The Bank of England rate rise triggered fund liquidation and energy producers were moving to a ""hedge now"" mentality, Kissler added.Higher interest rates increase borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, which could slow economic growth and reduce oil demand.Risk-aversion among investors also boosted the value of the U.S. dollar, which pressures oil prices by making the commodity more expensive for other currency holders.U.S. business activity also fell to a three-month low in June as services growth eased for the first time this year and the contraction in the manufacturing sector deepened, survey data showed.Wall Street's main indexes fell, while gold prices were on track for their biggest weekly decline since early February.China's promising economic recovery has faltered with several months in a row of softer-than-expected consumption, production and property market data.Story continuesThe recession and demand concerns outweighed signs of supply-side tightness.U.S. energy firms this week cut the number of oil rigs operating for an eighth week in a row, energy services firm Baker Hughes Co said. U.S. oil rig count, an indicator of future output, fell 6 to 546 this week, the lowest since April 2022.This week's U.S. inventory report showed crude stocks posted a surprise decline of 3.8 million barrels.Also set to tighten the market is Saudi Arabia's production cut of 1 million barrels per day in July announced along with an OPEC+ deal to limit supplies into 2024.Money managers raised their net long U.S. crude futures and options positions in New York and London by 4,790 contracts to 78,064 in the week to June 20, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on Friday.(Additional reporting by Alex Lawler and Sudarshan Varadhan; Editing by Kirsten Donovan, Louise Heavens, David Gregorio and David Evans)]"

Both contracts were now set to lose over 3% each this week.Fed, inflation in focus after BoE hike rattles oil marketsA bigger-than-expected rate hike from the BoE came after data showed British inflation unexpectedly grew through May. The trend is likely to attract more hikes from the central bank, with markets raising their expectations for the BoE’s terminal rate this year.The U.S. dollar also strengthened on Thursday after the Fed’s Powell and other members of the central bank said that at least two more interest rate hikes were warranted, given high inflation levels in the country.The comments, coupled with the shock BoE decision, fed into fears that economic conditions will worsen amid rising interest rates, denting oil demand this year.Fed members James Bullard, Ralph Bostic, and Loretta Mester are set to speak later on Friday, and potentially offer more cues on the path of U.S. interest rates.Markets are widely pricing in an at least 25 basis point hike by the Fed in July.Concerns over high inflation in the rest of the globe were also pushed up by stronger-than-expected Japanese inflation data, with a core indicator hitting a 42-year high.This saw oil markets largely disregard data showing a drop in U.S. inventories, coupled with strong fuel demand in the country.Story continuesU.S. inventories shrink, fuel demand at strongest since DecemberData on Thursday showed that U.S. crude inventories shrank far more than expected in the week to June 16, while total fuel products supplied hit their highest level since December 2022.The readings indicated that U.S. fuel demand was heating up in tandem with the travel-heavy summer season, potentially heralding tighter oil supplies in the coming weeks.This, coupled with lower Saudi Arabian production, could tighten global oil supplies this year.

41,e56742a1-effa-3fd1-ba87-feb71c16380a,O,2023-06-23,Can Colombia’s Oil Industry Survive Petro’s Revolutionary Reforms?,Oilprice.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/colombia-oil-industry-survive-petro-210000268.html,1687467600,STORY,"['NG=F', 'CL=F']","[The outlook for Colombia’s economically crucial oil industry is bleak. Not only has it failed to recover from the pandemic and return to a pre-2020 tempo of operations, but the July 2022 presidential electoral victory of former leftist guerilla Gustavo Petro sparked considerable concern over the oil industry’s future. Colombia’s first-ever left-wing president, who took office on August 7, 2023, plans to end awarding new contracts for hydrocarbon exploration and ban hydraulic fracturing. Those propositions form an important part of Petro’s energy transition and ending Colombia’s overreliance on hydrocarbons. While this policy is attracting substantial negative attention from various industry participants and financial markets, there are many credible reasons to decrease Colombia’s dependence on oil extraction.The primary headwind impacting Colombia’s hydrocarbon sector is a chronic lack of oil and natural gas reserves. Indeed, despite the considerable hype surrounding the Andean country’s hydrocarbon potential, there are signs Colombia does not share the oil resources of its regional neighbors like Brazil, Ecuador and Venezuela. At the end of 2022, it was determined that Colombia has meager proven hydrocarbon reserves (Spanish) of 2 billion barrels of oil and 2.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Those proven oil reserves are only sufficient to last another 7.5 years at the current rate of production, while the gas reserves will sustain just over seven years of production.Of considerable concern is that Colombia’s reserve growth over the last two decades has come from minor oil discoveries and the adoption of improved recovery techniques at mature oilfields rather than world-class finds. A range of methods is being employed to improve oil recovery from Colombia’s aging mature onshore oil fields. The most common technique is waterflood or injection, which occurs after the primary recovery phase has ended. Waterflood is used to boost reservoir pressure making it more efficient and cost-effective to lift the crude oil contained within.Story continuesOnce secondary recovery no longer proves effective, then enhanced or tertiary recovery is employed. This typically consists of natural gas, nitrogen, carbon dioxide or chemical injection to bolster reservoir pressure and the oil’s viscosity, making it easier to extract. A popular tertiary recovery technique employed in Colombia is natural gas injection. The gas associated with oil production is captured by drillers and then reinjected in wells to bolster reservoir pressure and enhance recovery. This is one of the reasons for the Andean country’s constrained natural gas supply. Tertiary recovery is costly with their widespread deployment, as is occurring in Colombia, leading to high breakeven costs for each barrel of oil produced. It is estimated that Colombia’s average breakeven price is around $45. That was before Petro’s November 2022 tax hikes added a scalable levy that increases taxes payable as Brent prices rise and removed royalties as an income tax deduction, causing breakeven prices to increase.Improved recovery techniques are widely used in Colombia, where 80% of the Andean country’s oil output is sourced from aging mature oilfields with high decline rates and have passed their peak production. According to Energy Minister Irene Velez (Spanish), those oilfields, which are between 30 years to 100 years old, are still pumping significant commercial volumes of crude despite their age because of the use of improved recovery methods. It is the prolific Rubiales field, which commenced operations in 1988 and hit peak production a decade ago, that is Colombia’s most important oilfield pumping around 100,000 barrels per day. A range of improved recovery techniques is employed at the Rubiales field, which is operated by the national oil company Ecopetrol, to counter rising decline rates and bolster economically crucial oil production.Reserve growth through the employment of enhanced recovery techniques is unreliable and unsustainable, with a limited lifespan. This means for Colombia’s petroleum industry to have a sustainable long-term future then, hydrocarbon reserves must be boosted through major hydrocarbon discoveries. It is Colombia’s lack of exploration success since the 1990s when the country saw its last world-class oil discovery, which is responsible for the lack of hydrocarbon reserves and weighing heavily on the petroleum industry's outlook.For these reasons, Colombia’s considerable economic dependence on oil production despite lacking significant oil reserves, like Venezuela’s 303.5 billion barrels or Brazil’s nearly 13 billion barrels, leaves the country vulnerable to considerable turmoil. Data from Colombia’s government statistics agency DANE shows (Spanish) for the first four months of 2023, petroleum generated $4.8 billion of export income, making it the largest export by value and around 3% of gross domestic product (Spanish). Petroleum production is an important source of taxation income for a financially strained Bogota. In 2022, the oil industry contributed (Spanish) $4.5 billion in taxes or around 8% of the total tax revenue received by Colombia’s Tax and Customs National Authority (DIAN – Spanish initials) for that year. It is estimated that oil industry tax revenue combined with dividends received from state-controlled Ecopetrol is responsible for nearly a fifth of Bogota’s fiscal income.Taxes paid by Colombia’s oil industry for 2023 are expected to soar because of the oil industry tax hikes introduced by Petro, which were approved by Congress in November 2022. Colombia’s Autonomous Committee of the Fiscal Rule (CARF – Spanish initials) estimates that 2023 taxation revenue from the petroleum industry will rise by a whopping 72.5%, compared to a year earlier, to $7.7 billion. That will give government coffers a crucial boost at a time when the Petro administration is seeking to significantly increase spending on social programs in an effort to alleviate the sharp spike in poverty since 2022, with 39% of Colombians living below the poverty line.While those numbers emphasize how important oil extraction is to Colombia’s economy and government revenue, they also underscore the Andean country’s vulnerability to financial turmoil when oil reserves are no longer sufficient to support production. That highlights why Bogota must wean Colombia off its economic dependence on fossil fuels. If changes to the economic mix are not made soon, Colombia’s economy and its currency, the peso, which is closely correlated to the value of oil, are at risk as reserves and production decline. For that reason, Petro’s controversial plan to cease awarding new contracts for hydrocarbon exploration may be the solution if other economic sectors can fill the gap left by a shrinking oil industry.By Matthew Smith for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Navigating Georgia’s Potential Ascent To The EUSoaring Car Prices Put American Auto Loans UnderwaterHow Sunlight Is Transforming Waste Into EnergyRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this investment bank have returned +6.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.3% change. The Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, to which Morgan Stanley belongs, has gained 4.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Morgan Stanley is expected to post earnings of $1.60 per share, indicating a change of +11.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.50 points to a change of +2.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.5%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.44 indicates a change of +14.5% from what Morgan Stanley is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.4%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Morgan Stanley.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Morgan Stanley, the consensus sales estimate of $13.62 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +3.8%. The $55.07 billion and $57.9 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.6% and +5.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMorgan Stanley reported revenues of $14.52 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.9%. EPS of $1.70 for the same period compares with $2.06 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.91 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.35%. The EPS surprise was +1.8%.Over the last four quarters, Morgan Stanley surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Morgan Stanley is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Morgan Stanley. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This may save customers close to $80 million.The agreement with AES Warrior Run was signed in 2000 as a provision of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA), a law approved by Congress in 1978. It relates to the coal-fired power plant near Cumberland, MD.Maryland customers of Potomac are currently subject to a Cogeneration PURPA Project Surcharge on their electricity bills, determined by the price at which the company can resell the power it acquired from Warrior Run. Due to changes in the competitive market, the surcharge amount has changed significantly from year to year.Potomac’s Customer BenefitsAccording to the Maryland PSC's directive, customers would continue to see the PURPA surcharge on their bills during the buyout period. However, Potomac’s customers are expected to save a sizable sum of money throughout the buyout time. Additionally, the elimination of charges based on a volatile market will help to stabilize their costs as a result of this arrangement. There is a 90% chance that ending the Warrior Run contract early will result in cost savings for the consumers for the remaining period of the contract.Other Customer-Friendly InitiativesIn order to help reduce potential weather-related outages and increase reliability for customers this summer, Potomac has taken various initiatives across its Maryland service territory.Equipment inspections have been proactively undertaken. Over 590 miles of transmission lines in the Maryland service area have been inspected by helicopter crews to locate hardware issues that are not readily apparent from the ground. The ground workers assessed about 80 substations and made the necessary repairs before the summer. Additionally, they carried out detailed inspections of nearby power lines and concentrated on more than 450 line capacitors, which maintain proper electric voltage.Also, to minimize tree-related damages during severe weather and improve the reliability of the electric service, the company plans to clear vegetation along 1,100 miles of power lines in 2023, of which 500 miles have already been covered.Story continuesPrice PerformanceOver the past year, shares of FE have gained 6.8% against the industry’s 8.5% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksFirstEnergy currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The stock has also outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Index, which rallied 15.4% in the same frame.The impressive performance marks a significant rebound from its March lows following the banking turmoil owing to the deposit outflows across many banks, which led to the collapse of three large banks. Moody’s has regained its lost ground and is now up almost 50% from its 52-week low.Moody’s inorganic expansion and revenue diversification efforts will continue to support growth. Though the operating backdrop hasn’t improved much, green shoots are visible. Further, its ongoing cost-efficiency initiatives will aid the bottom line. Year-to-Date Price PerformanceZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther, analysts are bullish on this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. Over the past seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $9.80 and $11.11 per share has moved marginally and 1% upward for 2023 and 2024, respectively. These indicate growth of 14.4% for this year and 13.4% for 2024.Now let’s check out some of the key factors that are likely to provide further impetus to Moody’s stock.Rising Demand for AnalyticsMoody’s continues to pursue growth in areas outside the core credit ratings service. The company has increased its exposure to banking and insurance industries, and is diversifying into the emerging and fast-growing professional services and ERS businesses. A rising share of the analytics business, which is not correlated with the volatility of interest rates, has added stability to top-line growth.Though revenues declined in 2022 because of weakness in bond issuance volumes, the same witnessed a four-year (2018-2022) CAGR of 5.3%. Given the improved mix and lower-risk nature of the company’s product portfolio, the top line is expected to rise in the quarters ahead. Moody’s is currently focused on investing in technology platforms and processes to boost operations.The consensus estimate for sales indicates growth of 7.2% and 10.2% for 2023 and 2024, respectively.Story continuesOpportunistic Acquisitions Bode WellMoody’s continues to grow meaningfully through several strategic acquisitions. In December 2022, it announced a deal to acquire SCRiesgo, which will bolster its presence in Central America and the Dominican Republic. In March 2022, in a bid to strengthen its Know Your Customer (KYC) capabilities, Moody's purchased 360kompany AG, while in December 2021, it acquired PassFort Limited. It has also acquired Bogard, RMS, Cortera and Catylist Inc.These deals, along with other strategic buyouts over the years, are expected to continue helping the company diversify revenues and be accretive to earnings. Moody’s is likely to continue pursuing opportunistic deals, which are strategic fits and help diversify its revenue base.Geolocation Restructuring ProgramManagement expects the program to help the company further adapt to the new global workplace and talent realities. The restructuring plan will accelerate a number of ongoing cost-efficiency initiatives, and includes real estate optimization and increased utilization of lower-cost operational hubs.The program is expected to result in annualized savings of $100-$135 million per year. The exit from certain leased office spaces is likely to result in $50-$70 million of pre-tax charges to either terminate or sublease the affected real estate leases.The program also comprises $75-$100 million of pre-tax personnel-related restructuring charges, including severance and related costs primarily determined under MCO’s existing severance plans.Cash outlays associated with the program are expected to be $75-$100 million, which are expected to be paid through 2024. The program is likely to be substantially complete by the end of this year.Strong Balance SheetMoody’s diversifying efforts are well supported by a strong balance sheet position. As of Mar 31, 2023, Moody’s had total debt worth $7.5 billion, an undrawn revolving credit facility of $1.25 billion, and cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $2.20 billion. The company doesn’t have any significant debt maturities before 2024. These will enable it to continue pursuing growth opportunities.2023 Earnings Guidance RaisedMoody’s now expects adjusted earnings in the range of $9.50-$10.00 per share, up from the earlier projection of $9.00-$9.50. On a GAAP basis, earnings are projected within $8.45-$8.95 per share, rising from the prior target of $8.05-$8.55.Moody’s projects revenues to increase in the mid-to-high-single-digit percent range.Operating expenses are expected to rise in the mid-single-digit percent range, an increase from the low-single-digit percent range provided previously.Stocks Worth a LookA couple of better-ranked stocks from the finance space are Axos Financial, Inc.

This performance was attributed to bets on rising interest rates and volatility across various asset classes. It was Rokos' best annual performance since 2015, the year he started trading for his own firm, and it helped the fund recover from a record 26% loss suffered in the previous year.However, Rokos Capital Management faced challenges in early 2023. The hedge fund experienced a 15% decline in March. Year-to-date, the macro hedge fund is down by approximately 9.5% as of March. The firm was caught off-guard by the bond market turmoil, and its bets on US government bonds backfired. This led to concerns from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding the size of potential margin calls on the firm.In response to the losses, Rokos Capital Management decided to de-risk its portfolio and reduce exposure to market volatility. The firm stated that its cash levels remained healthy, and it emphasized its open and collaborative engagement with regulatory authorities such as the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the SEC. The SEC chair, Gary Gensler, reportedly discussed Rokos with the UK regulators, highlighting the concerns over margin calls and the potential impact on the US government bond market.According to Forbes, Chris Rokos, the CEO and founder of Rokos Capital Management, has a net worth of $1.5 billion. Rokos is a macro investor who specializes in commodities, currencies, interest rates, and equities. He is known for advocating a strict approach to fund management, including immediate termination of unsuccessful traders and considering a trader's first year as an extended interview. Rokos is recognized as an exceptional manager in handling large debt and option holdings.

(NASDAQ:LESL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 22Leslie's, Inc. (NASDAQ:LESL) is a prominent direct-to-consumer brand within the U.S. pool and spa care sector. Their extensive selection of essential pool and spa care products serves residential and professional clientele. Through their network of 1,000+ physical stores and robust digital platform, Leslie's offers customers the convenience of shopping in-person or online, accommodating their preferred purchase method.The hedge fund first initiated stake in the company in Q3 2021 by purchasing 127,302 shares.

Andrew Carter reduced the price target on Leslie's, Inc. (NASDAQ:LESL) to $11 from $12 while maintaining a ‘Hold’ rating on the shares.

(NASDAQ:LESL), the leading direct-to-consumer pool and spa care services company in the U.S. The company differentiates itself through its loyal client base, vertically integrated supply chain, scale advantage and seamless customer experience. Shares have recently sold off on near-term operational issues at a distribution facility, as well as concerns around the sustainability of the company’s growth profile in a normalized, post-pandemic environment. Although we believe new pool installments will likely experience a slowdown, the install base has materially increased and ~80% of LESL’s business is tied to recurring maintenance. We found this entry point as an attractive opportunity to own a differentiated retailer, well positioned to benefit from secular tailwinds in an industry, permanently elevated by the pandemic.”9. Mobileye Global Inc. (NASDAQ:MBLY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 22Mobileye Global Inc. (NASDAQ:MBLY) is a global leader in developing and deploying advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technologies. Mizuho increased the price target on Mobileye Global Inc.

(NASDAQ:MBLY), compared to 29 funds in the prior quarter.Baron Funds made the following comment about Mobileye Global Inc. (NASDAQ:MBLY) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“During the fourth quarter, we participated in Mobileye Global Inc. (NASDAQ:MBLY)’s IPO. Mobileye is a leading ADAS and autonomous driving technologies and solutions provider with over 125 million vehicles across 800 models that have incorporated its products to date across 50-plus vehicle manufacturers (OEMs) including 13 of the top 15 global OEMs. The company was founded in 1999 and effectively pioneered the ADAS market introducing its first EyeQ system-on-chip (SoC) in 2007, enabling the vehicle to gain ADAS capabilities (such as real-time detection of vehicles, pedestrians, and lane markings) for a price of around $50. While the company remains a leader in ADAS today (with an approximate 70% market share), we believe the bigger opportunity is in leading the autonomous driving revolution. This would, in our view, significantly improve safety; meaningfully increase the vehicle utilization rate, which today is only around 4%; and dramatically grow the company’s content per vehicle. Mobileye’s SuperVision, a fully operational point-to-point assisted driving navigation solution, is the next step in the company’s progress towards autonomous driving, and it has a price tag of over 20 times that of its basic ADAS SoC. At the last Consumer Electronics Conference, the company announced a $3.5 billion backlog for its SuperVision solution across six OEMs and nine vehicle models. In addition, the company announced a $1.5 billion design win for its consumer AV program and a $3.5 billion backlog for its Mobility-as-a-Service or robotaxi solution. CEO and Founder, Amnon Shashua discussed his long-term vision in the company’s shareholder letter:“More than two decades ago, I founded Mobileye on the belief that computer vision technology could help prevent automobile crashes and save lives. From that simple idea, a global industry was born… By 2030, we expect Mobileye driver-assistance systems to be deployed in another 270 million vehicles globally… We believe that we will be positioned to deliver an autonomous driving solution that can enable the mass adoption of AVs [Autonomous Vehicles] including both Mobileye-powered robotaxis and consumer-owned autonomous driving vehicles. And Mobileye will be well on the way to delivering the future I first envisioned more than two decades ago.””8. New Fortress Energy Inc.

It, too, has surprised us to some extent, with the resiliency that it’s showing in a slowing trucking market. We think there’s a decent chance that weakness in its end markets will eventually catch up with PACCAR, but we believe the stock is cheap, and its steady parts business will act as a moderate stabilizer in such a scenario.”Click to continue reading and see Billionaire Chris Rokos is Selling These 5 Stocks in 2023.Suggested articles:10 Best Value Stocks to Buy in 2023 According to Billionaire Mario GabelliBillionaire John Paulson’s 2023 Portfolio: Top 15 Stock PicksBillionaire David Tepper’s 2023 Portfolio: Top 15 Stock PicksDisclosure: None. Billionaire Chris Rokos is Selling These 12 Stocks in 2023 is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

We're prepared with multiple layers of protection and innovative new technologies to mitigate catastrophic wildfires in our hometowns. We want a future where our customers don't have to choose between safety and reliability—we want both and we are working every day to make that possible,"" said Sumeet Singh, PG&amp;E executive vice president and chief operating officer.Several innovations and collaborations were on display today at two PG&amp;E facilities – the San Ramon Valley Conference Center and PG&amp;E's Applied Technology Services Center, the company's hub of research, development, and innovation. The selected technologies included:Neither Overhead Nor Underground: With novel Ground-Level Distribution Systems (GLDS), powerlines are neither suspended from utility poles nor buried underground. Instead, lines are placed inside protected and resilient conduits that rest on the ground. PG&amp;E is exploring moving overhead powerlines to ground level to eliminate ignition risk and enhance grid resilience. PG&amp;E anticipates this innovative approach could provide comparable risk reduction to undergrounding.Fighting Fire with ""Good"" Fire: South San Francisco-based Burnbot offers a remotely operated, controlled-burn technology to manage landscapes and burn woody materials onsite to reduce environmental and safety issues associated with controlled burns. PG&amp;E is testing Burnbot as an alternative to traditional land management techniques (such as using herbicides or mowers) around its facilities to clear vegetation and to explore the potential environmental and safety benefits and determine opportunities to scale.Next-Gen Drones: Automated and beyond visual line-of-sight drone operations in collaboration with San Mateo-based Skydio are helping to determine how these tools can augment today's manually operated drone asset inspections and provide a fast, safe, and effective solution for field-validating a range of sensor alerts.Remote microgrids for local resiliency: To enhance local resilience and eliminate fire risk, PG&amp;E recently deployed three new remote grid systems in Tehama and Mariposa counties with several more anticipated for deployment in 2023 and up to 30 to be deployed by 2026 in collaboration with Richmond, Calif.-based NewSunRoad. Locally sited solar, batteries and back-up generators provide the same or better level of electric service reliability while serving as a permanent alternative to poles and powerlines.First-of-its-Kind Easy-Connect Backup Power: PG&amp;E has successfully developed a first-of-its-kind personal backup power transfer meter device for customers that fully integrates into PG&amp;E's existing electric SmartMeter system. The device provides customers with a safe, easy to use and more reliable solution for interconnecting backup power sources, such as portable generators, batteries, and qualified electric vehicles, to power essential devices and appliances during a power outage. PG&amp;E has installed more than 1,500 backup power transfer meters for customers in high-fire risk areas since 2022 and plans to install thousands more through 2025. PG&amp;E demonstrated using the on-board generator of an all-electric Ford F-150 Lightning to power devices through the backup power transfer meter.Detecting a Fault, Cutting Off Power: PG&amp;E's Enhanced Powerline Safety Settings, which shut power off in one-tenth of a second or less when contact with a foreign object or a fault occurs on a powerline, reduced ignitions by 68% last year in High Fire-Risk Areas. Watch a similar version of the demonstration performed today: PG&amp;E Engineers Use Laboratory to Stress Test EPSS Technology - PGE Currents. Building upon the operational mitigations of EPSS, PG&amp;E is also deploying additional layers of operational mitigations including new downed conductor and partial voltage detection technology to detect potential threats to the electric grid and rapidly reduce or shut off power to help mitigate wildfire ignitions.A Moon Shot for Wildfire Detection: Detect and suppress a high-risk wildfire in 10 minutes or less. Pinpoint all fire ignitions across multiple states or countries from space in 60 seconds. These are the challenges for innovators of XPRIZE Wildfire, a four-year, $11 million competition aimed at developing innovative technologies to improve the detection and suppression of destructive wildfires. As co-title sponsor, PG&amp;E believes the competition can be a game changer.Story continuesLearn more about PG&amp;E's wildfire mitigation innovation efforts in the emerging technology chapter of PG&amp;E's 2023-2025 Wildfire Mitigation Plan.About PG&amp;EPacific Gas and Electric Company, a subsidiary of PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), is a combined natural gas and electric utility serving more than 16 million people across 70,000 square miles in Northern and Central California.

Night Shyamalan, Netflix Inc. Chief Content Officer Bela Bajaria, and media scion James Murdoch.The presence of corporate executives at Thursday’s event highlighted Modi’s efforts to establish India as a manufacturing and technology partner for the US, part of a broader effort to ramp up New Delhi’s diplomatic and economic engagements around the globe.Also at the dinner were members of the president’s family, including his son, Hunter Biden, days after he struck a plea agreement over federal tax and gun charges.Read more: Biden and Modi Deals Span Drones, Jet Engines and ChipsTo accommodate Modi, a vegetarian, First Lady Jill Biden worked with guest chef Nina Curtis, a Sacramento, California-based culinary artist known for her innovative plant-based cuisine, to build the menu.Story continuesGuests are dining on a marinated millet and grilled corn kernel salad and compressed watermelon for the first course.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on June 29, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis payroll processor and human-resources services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.98 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +21%.Revenues are expected to be $1.22 billion, up 6.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.76% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Paychex?For Paychex, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.64%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Paychex will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Paychex would post earnings of $1.24 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.29, delivering a surprise of +4.03%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Paychex doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

79,6062cee8-a207-36c2-a1dd-46844125e333,SNPS,2023-06-23,Why Is Intuit (INTU) Up 8.3% Since Last Earnings Report?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-intuit-intu-8-3-153012896.html,1687447812,STORY,"['INTU', 'SNPS']","[A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Intuit (INTU). Shares have added about 8.3% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Intuit due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Intuit’s Q3 Earnings Beat Expectations, Sales MissIntuit reported fiscal third-quarter 2023 non-GAAP earnings of $8.92 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.45 per share. The bottom line surged 17% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of $7.65 per share.Revenues of $6.02 billion missed the consensus mark of $6.09 billion but increased 7% year over year.Quarter DetailsSegment-wise, Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenues grew 21% year over year to $2.02 billion. This rise was driven by the solid growth in customers for QuickBooks Online, a favorable mix-shift and the addition of Mailchimp.Total Online Ecosystem revenues grew 23% year over year to $1.47 billion. QuickBooks Online Accounting revenues were up 25% year over year to $723 million, mainly driven by the mix-shift, higher pricing and customer growth.Online Services revenues which include payroll, payments, time tracking and capital, grew 21% year over year to $745 million. This was driven by strong performances of Mailchimp, QuickBooks Online payroll and QuickBooks Online payments solutions.Within QuickBooks Online payroll, a mix-shift to INTU’s full-service offering and the continued uptick in the customer base acted as tailwinds. Within QuickBooks Online payments, an increase in the charge volume per customer and ongoing customer growth drove revenues.Total international online revenues increased 12% year over year on a constant-currency basis.Total Desktop ecosystem revenues grew 16.4% year over year during the reported quarter to $553 million.Story continuesIn the fiscal third quarter, revenues from Consumer Group increased to $3.34 billion from $3.24 billion reported a year ago, mainly driven by a strong peak in new customers and extension filers. Further, ProTax Group's professional tax revenues decreased by 5% to $246 million from $258 million in the year-ago quarter.The Credit Karma business contributed $410 million to Intuit’s third-quarter total revenues, down from $468 million in the year-ago quarter. The drastic year-over-year fall reflects headwinds in personal loans, home loans, auto insurance and auto loans, partially offset by strength in credit cards and Credit Karma Money.Intuit’s non-GAAP operating income climbed 16% to $3.36 billion.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowAs of Apr 30, 2023, Intuit’s cash and investments were $4.3 billion compared with $2.07 billion as of Jan 31, 2023.The company exited the fiscal third quarter with long-term debt of $6.1 billion, down from the previous quarter’s $6.58 billion.During the first nine months of fiscal 2023, the company generated $4.20 billion worth cash from operating activities.Intuit repurchased stocks worth $483 million during the fiscal third quarter and had a remaining share-repurchase authorization of $2 billion at the end of the quarter. INTU announced that its board approved a quarterly cash dividend of 78 cents per share payable on Jul 18, 2023. The newly approved cash dividend represents a year-over-year increase of 15%.OutlookIntuit projects fiscal 2023 revenues in the band of $14.279-$14.317 billion, indicating 12-13% growth.The company anticipates non-GAAP operating income between $5.441 billion and $5.461 billion, indicating approximate year-over-year growth of 21%.Intuit’s fiscal 2023 non-GAAP earnings per share forecast stands between $14.20 and $14.25, suggesting year-over-year increase of 20%.For the fiscal fourth quarter, INTU expects revenues to grow between 9% and 10% on a year-over-year basis. Adjusted earnings for the quarter are estimated in the range of $1.43-$1.48 per share.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended upward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted 30.48% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Intuit has a strong Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a C. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Intuit has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerIntuit belongs to the Zacks Computer - Software industry.

83,c19f4da7-3e8d-3622-aac7-25900c008988,HST,2023-06-23,Host Hotels (HST) Gains 12% in 3 Months: Will the Trend Last?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/host-hotels-hst-gains-12-143100424.html,1687444260,STORY,['HST'],"[Host Hotels &amp; Resorts, Inc. HST has a portfolio of luxury and upper-upscale hotels in the United States and abroad. With the industry rebounding in the wake of the pandemic, HST’s well-located properties in markets with strong demand drivers are benefiting.Shares of this Bethesda, MD-based lodging real estate investment trust (REIT) have gained 12% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 3.6%.Analysts, too, seem bullish on this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HST’s 2023 funds from operations (FFO) per share has moved 1.6% northward over the past month to $1.91. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet us discuss the factors that supported the uptick.Host Hotels has been experiencing healthy operating performance owing to the continued momentum in leisure travel demand. Also, healthy demand from small and medium-sized businesses, representing a large share of the company’s corporate demand, has aided business transient recovery.  Given this backdrop, in the first quarter of 2023, HST’s comparable revenue per available room (RevPAR) was $217.77, climbing 31.1% from the year-ago quarter’s $166.12. The figure also improved 7.4% from the first-quarter 2019 tally. We expect comparable RevPAR to grow 9.6% year over year in 2023. For 2024 and 2025, the same is anticipated to increase 7.9% and 9.5%, respectively.With improving industry demand-supply fundamentals, HST is likely to witness healthy operating performance in the upcoming period.The company is focused on enhancing the quality of its portfolio. It has made significant acquisitions of high-quality properties over the past years with long-term growth prospects, supporting external growth.Additionally, to achieve a higher portfolio EBITDA and revenues, HST has broadened its acquisition focus to include urban markets beyond the top 25 ones. These efforts augur well for its external growth. Our estimate for 2023 EBITDA suggests an increase of 9.3% year over year.Host Hotels’ capital recycling efforts seem encouraging. Over the years, it has disposed of non-strategic assets that have lower growth potential or properties with significant capital expenditure requirements through its capital-recycling program. It redeploys the proceeds to acquire or invest in premium properties in markets that are anticipated to recover faster. From 2021 through May 23, 2023, total dispositions amounted to approximately $1.5 billion, which is 17.5 times the EBITDA multiple.HST’s solid balance-sheet position with ample liquidity has enabled it to capitalize on growth opportunities and has facilitated redevelopment activities. As of Mar 31, 2022, the company had $2.3 billion in total available liquidity. Moreover, it is the only company with an investment-grade rating among the lodging REITs. With no material debt maturities until January 2024 and enough financial flexibility, HST is well-poised to ride the growth curve.  Further, the company’s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) highlights its growth potential. Its ROE is 11.83% compared with the industry’s average of 3.77%, indicating that it is more efficient in using the shareholders’ funds than its peers.Solid dividend payouts are the biggest enticements for REIT investors, and Host Hotels has remained committed to that. The company recently rewarded its shareholders with a 25% sequential hike in its second-quarter 2023 cash dividend payment to 15 cents per share from 12 cents paid out earlier. Given the company’s improving operating fundamentals, a lower dividend payout ratio compared with the industry and a solid financial position, we expect the latest dividend rate to be sustainable.Story continuesOther Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are Ventas VTR, Omega Healthcare Investors OHI and Ryman Hospitality Properties RHP, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ventas’ current-year funds from operations (FFO) per share has moved marginally northward over the past month to $2.98.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Omega Healthcare’ ongoing year’s FFO per share has been raised 1.1% over the past week to $2.80.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ryman Hospitality’ 2023 FFO per share has moved 1.9% upward in the past month to $7.31.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represent funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Fed paused its aggressive interest rate hike policy in its June FOMC meet but Chairman Jerome Powell suggested that the central bank will act according to month-on-month data and most likely raise interest rates this year.The S&amp;P 500, the Nasdaq and the Dow have posted positive returns of 13.70%, 29.0% and 2.43%, respectively, so far this year.The central bank has hinted at another half a percentage point increase in overnight interest rate within this year. Possibilities of such a move is validated by the inflation reading of 4.9% for April, which is still two times higher than the Fed's long-term inflation expectation. Currently, the interest rate is at a 16-year high.The U.S. labor market remains strong as payroll employment added more than 300,000 jobs in May. Yet,other key economic indicators like retail sales, manufacturing PMI, services PMI and industrial production have shown signs of shrinking in 2023. Many economists have given warnings of an impending recession if the Fed fails to strike the right balance.Economic challenges continue worldwide as well. China's economy is showing signs of slowing down, which will indirectly impact global manufacturing and supply chain. Also, the decision to cut down on oil supply by OPEC+ members is expected to push oil prices higher.Thus, from an investor's point of view, dividend stocks can be the preferred choice for investors looking for regular income and capital preservation in such adverse economic conditions. These companies have mature businesses, pay out regular dividends and remain profitable due to their proven business models. Companies that tend to reward investors with a high dividend payout outperform non-dividend-paying stocks during market volatility. Investors can expect a regular flow of income in volatile market conditions.On that note, let us look at companies like National Fuel Gas Company NFG, Host Hotels &amp; Resorts HST and Casey's General Stores CASY that have lately hiked their dividend payouts.Story continuesNational Fuel Gas Company is an integrated energy company. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has natural gas assets located in the prolific Appalachian basin and oil-producing assets in California.

The company’s top line is expected to decline in 2023 due to potentially steep declines in revenues from its COVID-19 products, Comirnaty vaccine and Paxlovid oral pill, on lower demand.Concerns remain about its long-term growth drivers beyond its COVID products due to competitive pressure. Nonetheless, Pfizer boasts a diversified portfolio of innovative drugs and vaccines, including Ibrance, Abrsyvo and Prevnar.Pfizer is witnessing solid pipeline progress and expects to launch some key non-COVID products in 2023, which can drive long-term sales and profit growth. Its cash position is strong, which can be used to make acquisitions, increase dividends, buy back shares and reduce debt. Importantly, Pfizer shares are hardly expensive and offer a 'juicy' dividend that is currently yielding 4.2%.(You can read the full research report on Pfizer here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Philip Morris have declined -5.2% over the past six months against the Zacks Tobacco industry’s decline of -7.7%. The company has been battling cost-related headwinds and expects certain margin pressures in the first half of 2023. Also, soft cigarette shipment volumes and volatile currency movements have been concerns.In 2023, the total international industry volume is estimated to decline by 1-2%, excluding China and the United States. Nevertheless, Philip Morris has been gaining from its pricing power. Higher pricing variance was an upside to the company’s performance in the first quarter of 2023 and is likely to drive performance in the full year.A focus on reduced risk products, especially IQOS, has been working well for the company, which is witnessing a continued product mix shift from cigarettes to smoke-free products. These upsides are likely to boost organic revenues in 2023.(You can read the full research report on Philip Morris here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of American Tower have underperformed the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry over the year-to-date period (-10.4% vs. -1.2%). However, Zacks analyst believes that the company’s extensive and geographically diversified communication real estate portfolio is set to benefit from the high capital spending by wireless carriers amid the incremental demand from global 4G and 5G deployment efforts, growing wireless penetration and spectrum auctions.Its resilient and stable business model helps in generating steady revenues. Also, focus on macro-tower investment opportunities has enabled it to fortify its position in the global market, aiding growth.Strategic buyouts and a solid balance sheet enable it to capitalize on the secular trends of the industry. Further, given the company’s lower-than-industry dividend payout and solid operating fundamentals, we expect its dividend distribution to be sustainable over the long run.(You can read the full research report on American Tower here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Boston Scientific Corp. and Northrop Grumman Corp.Story continuesWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

Also, soft cigarette shipment volumes and volatile currency movements have been concerns.In 2023, the total international industry volume is estimated to decline by 1-2%, excluding China and United States. Nevertheless, Philip Morris has been gaining from its pricing power. Higher pricing variance was an upside to the company’s performance in the first quarter of 2023 and is likely to drive performance in the full year.A focus on reduced risk products, especially IQOS, has been working well for the company, which is witnessing a continued product mix shift from cigarettes to smoke-free products.

Also, focus on macro-tower investment opportunities has enabled it to fortify its position in the global market, aiding growth.Strategic buyouts and a solid balance sheet enable it to capitalize on the secular trends of the industry.

The volume of orders from varied customers worldwide has already exceeded the 800 mark since the onset of 2023, signifying the strong global demand for the product.Pratt &amp; Whitney now has a firm commitment to deliver 10,000 GTF Engines from its order book to more than 90 customers spread over 30 countries. This indicates the wide footprint the product enjoys, buoyed by its ability to provide superior economic and environmental advantages to airline operators, as nations worldwide are concerned about transportation-related emissions and are looking for ways to reduce emissions.Importance of GTF EnginesAn increased focus on sustainability in the aviation industry has unlocked substantial opportunities for a GTF Engine and its wide adoption. In the days ahead, one may expect airlines to increase investments in more fuel-efficient aircraft, explore alternative fuels and implement eco-friendly practices to reduce carbon emissions.In such a scenario, Pratt &amp; Whitney’s GTF Engine is the optimal pick as it consumes the lowest fuel volume, and its CO2 emissions for single-aisle aircraft are much lower compared with other engines.RTX’s continuous investment strategy to support the continuous production of the engine will assist the company in meeting such strong demand. The recently announced infrastructural upgrade and capacity expansion in its Georgia business, which supports commercial and military engine programs, are likely to increase the overhaul capacity to 400 GTF Engines per year.Key Customers of GTF EnginesGTF Engines have already gathered considerable attention in the aviation industry and currently power more than 1,600 aircraft across 64 airlines. The value-added features offered by the engine have led to a very strong customer base in the domestic and international markets. In 2022, the engine was chosen by Cessna SkyCourier, Daher Kodiak 900 and TBM960.Story continuesThe engine is also part of the highly sought-after fleet of Airbus EADSY and Embraer ERJ. This proclaims the strong buying trend for GTF Engines.The Airbus A320neo family and Airbus A220 are the two Airbus aircraft models that are equipped with RTX’s GTF Engine and deliver the highest fuel efficiency and the lowest CO2 emission for the family.Airbus inked a major order to supply 500 of its A320 family aircraft at the Paris Air Show 2023 to Indigo, the biggest order in commercial aviation history. This highlights potential orders for GTF Engines.Embraer’s E2 family of aircraft, considered to be eco-friendly, is powered by GTF Engines. E2 jets enjoy strong demand due to their fuel efficiency, and less carbon and noise footprint.As of Mar 31, 2023, Embraer’s E-Jets E2 had 281 orders in the backlog. Considering the valued demand for its E-jet family of aircraft, the company may continue to witness the solid delivery of these jets in the coming quarters as well, highlighting the strong demand for GTF Engines.Price MovementIn the past year, shares of Raytheon Technologies have increased 8% compared with the industry’s growth of 11.3%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; a Stock to ConsiderRaytheon Technologies currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). One better-ranked stock in the same industry is Transdigm Group TDG, which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate of TDG is projected at 25.1%.

While stable stocks may not provide the same adrenaline rush or returns, they can be more predictable, easier to hold, and balance a portfolio. Below are 3 steady movers to own now:TransDigm GroupPull up a long-term TransDigm Group (TDG) chart and you will see why it made the list. Aside from the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 and the Covid-19-induced correction of 2020, the stock has been treating investors to a steady climb for more than 15 years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTransdigm Group, which earns the best possible Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is a leading global designer, producer, and supplier of aerospace components used in military and commercial aircraft.DefenseIf we’ve learned anything over the past couple of decades, it’s that defense spending will continue to increase, regardless of which political party holds the White House. For example, President Joe Biden’s Pentagon budget has $842 billion set aside, a 3.2% increase versus already high numbers. Because Transdigm is a leader in this space, it should continue to benefit.CommercialThough air travel plummeted during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, recent data shows that air traffic is on its way back. Air travel is expected to exceed pre-COVID-19 highs as people take advantage of remote work and the ability to travel again.Robust EstimatesZacks Consensus Estimates suggest that earnings will grow 30% year-over-year over the next three quarters.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurthermore, though analyst estimates are robust, TDG will likely eclipse them. TDG has delivered positive earnings surprises in five straight quarters.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWednesday, shares broke out to fresh all-time highs.JP MorganNew York-based JP Morgan (JPM) is the largest bank in the United States and is getting bigger. After First Republic Bank’s (FRC) bankruptcy, JPM won a bid to buy First Republic’s assets from the FDIC for more than $10 billion.Story continuesHow Steady is JPM?While banks such as FRC, Signature Bank of New York (SBNY), and Silicon Valley Bank (SBNY) failed, JPM’s debt-to-equity ratio fell to multi-year lows.Relative StrengthThroughout the thick of the banking crisis of early 2023, JPM shares held the 200-day moving average while the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLF) and the Regional Bank ETF (KRE) tanked below it and lagged. Now that the worst of the crisis seems to have blown over, JPM shares are hovering near 52-week highs and are threatening to break out of a multi-month base structure.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMcDonald’sSince the 1950s, Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) McDonald’s (MCD) has been the leading fast-food chain in the world. Like Transdigm, MCD has been trending higher for decades with few interruptions.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLow BetaOne measure of the steadiness of a stock is its beta. Beta is a measure of risk commonly used to compare the volatility of a stock to that of the S&amp;P 500 Index. McDonald’s beta of 0.64 means the stock is less volatile than the general market.Loyalty Program &amp; Focus on DeliveryThough McDonald’s has been selling fast food successfully for decades, the company has two strong catalysts that could drive shares higher over the coming years. First, its loyalty program has transformed its offerings across drive-through, takeaway, delivery, and dine-in. Because of the loyalty program, digital sales have shot higher by more than 30% year-over-year. Second, MCD has inked strategic partnerships with delivery juggernauts like Uber (UBER) and DoorDash (DASH) to drive delivery revenue.Strong Earnings History &amp; EstimatesSince 2020, MCD has grown earnings per share each year. Analysts anticipate that this trend will continue into 2024 and beyond.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineSuccessful investing is more than just looking for the next hot stock.

Details of her new role could not be learned.Goldman Sachs did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Evercore and Kiely declined to comment.Kiely, who was co-head of technology investment banking and global semiconductor practice head, joined Goldman in 1999, was named managing director in 2007, and became partner in 2014.Kiely's exit leaves Ryan Limaye as the sole head of technology investment banking within Goldman's technology, media and telecommunications group.As technology dealmaking plunged, a number of top bankers have left Goldman and other firms such as Bank of America and Barclays, often for smaller peers such as Moelis &amp; Co, Qatalyst Partners, Evercore, and Jefferies Financial Group. Kiely's professional plans could not be learned.Goldman has lost several high-ranking technology bankers this year, including Nick Pomponi, former co-head of global software investment banking who left for Evercore, Rob Chisholm, a partner who moved to Qatalyst, and Troy Broderick, who was named chief operating officer of Goldman's M&amp;A business in May only to leave for Perella Weinberg Partners.Technology was the top sector for mergers and acquisitions for eight consecutive quarters until the second quarter of 2022, when a bout of inflation forced central banks to raise interest rates, weighing on tech stock valuations.Global deal volumes in the technology sector have dropped by more than half so far this year, according to data from LSEG Deals Intelligence.

Faced with vast geopolitical and economic uncertainty and complex family dynamics, the survey found that family offices are returning to a focus on core principles: making sure they have the right investing and governance plans, and the best strategies, to fulfil the family's long-term goals, including:How family offices are responding to inflation, potential recession and geopolitical risks;Special considerations for direct investments;Interest and action related to environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing; andHow families are most effectively making decisions and preparing the next generation to manage the wealth.Geopolitical and Economic UncertaintyWhen asked about their greatest concerns, family office respondents cited inflation (24%), the possibility of recession (18%) and geopolitical risk (17%) as top of mind. While these concerns are not surprising given the current environment, they do manifest in a similar fashion: increased market volatility.Direct Investments and ESG InvestingFamily offices have substantially increased direct private investments at the expense of making investments through private-equity firms. However, at the same time, family offices have not staffed up with private equity professionals to evaluate, structure, monitor and add value to such direct investments.""Private investments are attractive for many family offices because of the potential for high returns, but it is imperative that they deploy the right resources to evaluate and manage these investments,"" said Professor Raphael Amit, Founder and Chairman of the Wharton Global Family Alliance and the author of the Wharton 2022 Family Office report.Story continuesIn addition, many family offices report that they are or plan to deploy capital to ESG investments. Even so, a significant number of survey respondents report that ESG investments amount to less than 10% of their portfolios. Hesitancy to act may be attributed to challenges in finding consensus among the family on investment themes. It can be hard to find agreement on what is ‘most' important, as many families remain uncomfortable about potentially sacrificing returns, while others grapple with the best way to measure performance.Succession PlanningWhile succession is a normal, healthy part of every family's evolution, succession plans are rare, with just one-third of respondents having a formal succession plan in place for either the family office or the family itself. Further, when there is a succession plan in place, only 37% of stakeholders are aware of the plan.""The risks inherent in avoiding these conversations and failing to prepare are immense. A well-planned succession process takes at least a year; the time to start is now,"" said David W. Fox, President of Northern Trust Global Family and Private Investment Office Services.MethodologyThe Wharton Global Family Alliance is a world-leading research forum created by the Wharton School and the CCC Alliance. Northern Trust and Wharton have collaborated on research programs spanning multi-generational, multi-branch families and their businesses since 2017.This report is the sixth in a series of benchmarking surveys that seek to develop a better understanding of trends and financial performance drivers of family offices. It highlights the latest knowledge and best practices that will benefit substantial global families.For the purposes of the survey, a family office is defined as a professional organization, owned and controlled by a wealthy family, dedicated to managing the personal and financial affairs of family members.The sample used in this survey spans 24 countries. With respect to assets under management, the majority of survey respondents have more than $1 billion in assets under management and represent families who own, manage and/or control at least one business in addition to the wealth managed by their family offices.Assets under management (AUM) managed by respondents, 51% have greater than $1 billion; 27% have between $500 million to $1 billion; 19% have AUM between $100 million and $500 million; and 3% have less than $100 million.34% of the Family Offices in our sample serve 1-3 households, about 23% serve 4-6 households, and about 43% of the Family Offices in the sample serve more than 7 households.More than 30% of sample Family Offices employ 4-7 professionals. Nearly 20% are larger Family Offices that employ more than 21 professionalsRequest the full executive summary here.Northern Trust Wealth Management offers holistic wealth management services for affluent individuals and families, family offices, foundations and endowments, and privately held businesses.

AIZ’s U.S. Connected Living business will continue to drive growth in this segment.The International business is also expected to stabilize as the multi-line insurer is taking steps to grow its footprint through expansion and expense handling. The Global Automotive business is expected to show steady progress as AIZ materializes benefits from its partnership with CNH Industrial.Increasing the number of partnerships outside the United States will further boost its results. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to show modest growth for 2023.The Global Housing segment will benefit from higher policy growth from new and existing clients. As inflation continues to improve, the segment’s bottom line should grow in the future. Ongoing expense actions should lead to improved performance, going forward. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to grow, driven by improved performance in Homeowners reflecting higher lender-placed net earned premiums.Net investment income is expected to gain from higher income from higher yields on fixed maturity securities, and cash and cash equivalents, and increased income from commercial mortgage loans on real estate due to a rise in invested assets.Assurant has a strong capital management policy. Its solid capital position supports effective capital deployment. At present, $274 million remains unused under the repurchase authorization. The insurer did not repurchase any shares in the first quarter but aims to resume soon.

DGX recently completed its previously-announced acquisition of Haystack Oncology. The acquisition is intended to improve patient outcomes through early, accurate detection of residual or recurring cancer.Based on circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA), Haystack Oncology created a highly-sensitive minimal-residual disease (“MRD”) testing tool to help with the early detection of residual or reoccurring cancer and to better guide treatment choices. This MRD technology will be used by Quest Diagnostics to create new blood-based clinical lab services for solid tumour cancers that will be made available starting in 2024.The latest move will expand Quest Diagnostics’ portfolio of cancer services, fortifying the Diagnostic Solutions business.About Haystack OncologyIn order to report residual, recurring, or resistant disease earlier than other MRD tests, Haystack Oncology uses the most advanced ctDNA detection technology to cut through the clutter and identify the lowest quantities of ctDNA in blood.Strategic ImplicationsThe acquisition of Haystack is a significant step toward transforming two decades of top-tier liquid biopsy research and development into clinical laboratory services that are incredibly dependable and widely available. By combining its strengths in screening, pathology and sequencing with Haystack's liquid biopsy technology, DGX will likely dominate the rapidly expanding MRD sector.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe acquisition will leverage Quest Diagnostic's capabilities and size in pathology, genomics, and oncology. Through its AmeriPath specialist pathology-diagnostics division, Quest Diagnostics employs around 400 pathologists and has over 7,000 patient access points for the collection of blood and other specimens in the United States. The ability to find patient-specific mutations for Haystack's tumor-informed MRD strategy is another aspect of Quest Diagnotics’ proficiency in next-generation tumour sequencing.Story continuesIndustry ProspectsPer a report by Grand View Research, the global minimal residual disease testing market size was estimated at $1.89 million in 2022 and is expected to expand at a CAGR of 11.45%. The minimal residual disease testing market is witnessing growth due to the increasing prevalence of cancer, increasing consumer awareness for therapy and increasing funding for research with an increasing disposable income in emerging economies.Recent DevelopmentsThis month, Quest Diagnostics partnered with Coriell Life Sciences to provide select medical plan members with pharmacogenomics testing services. The test indicates how different genes and their variants affect an individual’s reaction to drugs. The pharmacogenomics test is a voluntary, no cost DNA-testing programme that uses a saliva collection kit that can be used at home to analyze a person's DNA. The effectiveness of the patient's existing drugs is evaluated in light of the test results. The test results can improve pharmaceutical effectiveness and safety and also assist in selecting the appropriate drug and dosage. Through testing, each patient receives personalized, actionable clinical recommendations and drug management regimens.In May 2023, Quest Diagnostics announced that the RestoreU Dementia Panel, a risk assessment and care plan service developed by uMETHOD Health, a health technology company specializing in precision medicine for chronic diseases, would be made available nationwide. This would enable doctors to fill in any care gaps for patients with cognitive decline. The RestoreU service uses artificial intelligence (AI) created by uMETHOD to build personalized care plans that support cognitive care standards and aid clinicians in providing better patient care.Price PerformanceShares of the company have gained 2.9% in the past year against the industry’s fall of 5.1%.Zacks Rank and Key PicksQuest Diagnostics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

The products offered, Denon PerL and PerL Pro True Wireless (""TWS"") Earbuds featuring Masimo AAT, will likely allow users to create a personal audio profile to optimize the sound quality of the headphones.The Denon PerL and PerL Pro headphones are now available for purchase in a limited number at Denon.com, with a fuller rollout expected later in 2023.The latest launch is expected to significantly expand Masimo’s foothold in the global personalized hearables market, thereby boosting its non-healthcare consumer audio business.Few Words on the ProductsDenon PerL Pro earbuds deliver high-quality sound wirelessly, providing a streaming experience like listening to a CD. This leads users to enjoy high-fidelity streaming sources with excellent audio fidelity. PerL Pro also creates a surround sound effect that enhances the overall audio experience in a compact and comfortable wireless earbud design.Additionally, both the Denon PerL Pro and PerL models offer active noise cancellation and a more transparent social mode. This is expected to enable the user to tune the world out or let it in.The eight and four microphones in the PerL Pro and PerL, respectively, provide upgraded noise cancelation, automatically adjusting the level of cancelation according to the amount of leak-through, the environment’s sound and the tightness of fit in the ears.Significance of the LaunchPer Masimo, hearing varies from person to person, thus impacting the listening experience. The two Denon PerL TWS models use proprietary Masimo technology to assess each person’s unique response to sound. This is done by measuring the faint otoacoustic emissions (OAEs), produced by the inner ear in the presence of a range of tones played. Once the OAEs are analyzed to determine the sensitivity of a person’s ears to each frequency, a personal hearing profile is created in the Denon PerL Headphone app using artificial intelligence. This personalized profile is expected to provide superior depth, detail and clarity.Story continuesPer management, the introduction of the PerL and PerL Pro is expected to end the concept of one-sound-fits-all, thereby enhancing the listening experiences of individual listeners.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Zion Market Research, the global hearable market was worth around $28 billion in 2022 and is anticipated to reach around $96.53 billion by 2030 at a CAGR of approximately 16.7%. Factors like the growing advancements in hearables-related technology and increased demand for wireless earphones and infotainment gadgets are expected to drive the market.Given the market potential, the latest launch is likely to provide a significant boost to Masimo’s business globally.Recent DevelopmentsThis month, Masimo announced that Hospital La Fe in Valencia, Spain, is expanding its telehealth and telemonitoring program with the Masimo W1 advanced health tracking watch.The same month, Masimo announced that Fresno, CA-based Community Health System was adopting a variety of advanced Masimo monitoring technologies and solutions across its campuses.Also, in June, Masimo received the FDA’s 510(k) clearance for its patient-worn, continuous multi-parameter vital signs monitor, Radius VSM.Price PerformanceShares of Masimo have gained 20.3% in the past year compared with the industry’s 11.2% rise and the S&amp;P 500's 14.9% growth. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Zacks Rank &amp; Other Key PicksCurrently, Masimo carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

Yahoo Finance Reporter Alexandra Canal breaks down the investment and what it means for Netflix.Video Transcript- Meantime, it's not just ""Squid Game"" that will be seeing a comeback to Netflix. Netflix co-CEO, Ted Sarandos, said that the streaming platform will be investing in Korean content, including new original series and sequels to some of your favorites. Now this comes after the company made a public commitment back in April to spend $2.5 billion on original content. Our very own, Allie Canal, has more. Allie?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yes, so there is a commitment that Ted Sarandos made back in April, $2.5 billion in Korean original content over the next four years. That's something that the company wants to continue to invest in and continue to grow. Sarandos is making it clear that he wants to expand beyond some of the originals that Netflix has done. So that's been more so drama. So they've been referring to that as K dramas.Now he wants to go into unscripted. He wants to go into Korean movies because we've really seen this surge in popularity for originals like ""The Glory"" and ""All of Us Are Dead."" In addition to just creating content, the company also wants to continue to nurture some of that talent in the region, so the next generation of emerging directors and screenwriters, so really feeding into this narrative from Netflix and from Netflix analysts that international exposure, international content creation is something the company is looking for.And it doesn't necessarily have to be the next big ""Squid Game"" that comes over to the US and explodes, but really creating that localized content that can do well in those local regions and see a type of success that we haven't seen. And that's really what's separating Netflix from a lot of these competitors out there in the streaming war. It's such a competitive market right now. But this is an area of a lot of untapped potential.Story continues- Yeah, and they have a big international exposure. Just real quickly, this also helps them avoid the writers strike, doesn't it?- I was just thinking that. That's right.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yes, 100% now. There has been some issues overseas with these local content creators saying that Netflix hasn't proportionately shared in the success of some of these shows. So perhaps what's happening here in the US could eventually happen abroad.But definitely, it helps them with the writers strike because no one's striking over there, then you're creating more content. Especially if they go the unscripted route, that's something that can be turned pretty quickly. So we'll see how this feeds into it because the writers strike, there's no end in sight at this point.- All right. Allie, thank you so much. Appreciate it.]"

These Are The Properties And Tenants You'd Be Adding To Your Portfolio,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thinking-buying-hudson-pacific-properties-140004282.html,1687442404,STORY,"['HPP', 'SQ', 'AMZN', 'NFLX', 'GOOGL']","[When investors buy real estate investment trusts (REITs), they aren’t just buying real estate companies. They are also buying the large block of tenants that comprise the REIT’s leasing portfolio.So, before you decide to buy any REIT, consider the stability and solvency of much of its tenant base. Consider these questions: Are any tenants facing bankruptcy or closing a number of locations? Are the tenants high quality? Are the tenants diversified — geographically and by industry? And what is the percentage of each tenant’s annualized base rent (ABR) in the total tenant portfolio?Take a look at an office REIT that has fallen on hard times, and consider the questions raised above in evaluating its merits.The market has a long history of overselling REITs when facing a potential recession, providing an incredible opportunity for investors to ""lock in"" massive yields. Gain access to insights from Benzinga's real estate research team with the free Weekly REIT Report. Hudson Pacific Properties Inc. (NYSE: HPP) is a Los Angeles-based office REIT with 49 office properties and four studio properties with an emphasis on centers of innovation for media and tech companies in California, Washington state and Vancouver, British Columbia.Hudson Pacific Properties was founded in 2006 by Chairman and CEO Victor Coleman. Soon after its creation, it began purchasing motion picture studios and office buildings on the West Coast. Hudson Pacific Properties went public in 2010. It has a market cap of $690.43 million. The 52-week range is $4.08 to $16.31.One problem Hudson Pacific Properties has, like some other office REITs such as SL Green Realty Corp. (NYSE: SLG) and Boston Properties Inc. (NYSE: BXP), is a lack of geographic diversity. All of Hudson Pacific’s properties are located in only five areas: Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Silicon Valley and Vancouver.Office occupancy rates have been decreasing for months on the West Coast. Hudson Pacific Properties’ occupancy of in-service offices has declined year-over-year from 92.3% to 88.7%. Net effective rent per square foot dropped from $41.72 to $40.46 over that same time frame.Story continuesThe percentage of properties leased by geographic area as of March 31 is as follows: AREAPercentage LeasedSeattle86.4%San Francisco93.9%Los Angeles99.3%Silicon Valley80.8%Vancouver94.4%While it’s true that several tech companies, such as Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. are beginning to mandate employees to return to office work three to four days per week, it’s also true that the office vacancies in areas like Seattle and Silicon Valley are on the rise.In the three months ending March 31, 466,351 square feet of Hudson Pacific Properties’ office space had either contractual expirations or early terminations. In addition, while renewal space was leasing for $45.36 per square foot, new leases were only garnering $34.56, possibly showing a need to cut lease prices to attract tenants and maintain occupancy levels.Largest TenantsThe following is a chart of Hudson Pacific Properties’ 15 largest tenants. Notice that the top four tenants comprise about 25% of the total ABR.Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is a Mountain View, California-based multinational technology conglomerate. It was created in October 2015 by a restructuring within Google to become the parent company of Google. Alphabet is the world’s third-largest technology company by annual revenue and one of the five Big Tech stocks that comprise the Nasdaq 100. Sundar Pichai replaced the original founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, near the end of 2019. It has a market capitalization of $1.62 trillion. Google’s share of Hudson Pacific Properties’ annualized base rent (ABR) is 13.9%.Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) is a multinational technology company that is one of the world’s most valuable brands and one of five American technology companies that make up the popular Big Tech stocks on the Nasdaq 100. It was founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos as an online marketplace for selling books.In the 29 years since, it has branched out into selling thousands of different products. In recent years, Amazon has also expanded into retail by purchasing Whole Foods Market Inc. and now has subsidiaries in cloud computing, autonomous vehicles, computer hardware research and development and satellite internet.Amazon.com has a market cap of $1.29 trillion and daily volume of over 11 million shares.Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX) is a Los Gatos, California-based video-on-demand, streaming television service offering movies and TV series in multiple languages. Netflix began in the late 1990s with a DVD-by-mail service. Netflix then developed its streaming service in 2007. Today, it is the No. 1 subscription video-on-demand streaming service with more than 232 million paid memberships across more than 190 countries. Netflix also expanded into original productions and video game publishing.Netflix has a market cap of $193.24 billion and trades over 1 million shares per day. Like Amazon, it is also one of the Bigh Tech stocks that make up about 30% of the Nasdaq 100.Salesforce Inc. is a San Francisco-based software company that provides sales, customer service, marketing automation, e-commerce, analytics and application development. Salesforce was founded by Marc Benioff, a former executive at Oracle Corp. Its initial public offering (IPO) was in 2004. It was the first cloud computing company to reach $1 billion in annual revenue, which it achieved in 2009. As of September 2022, it was the 61st-largest company in the world by market capitalization. It has a present market capitalization of $206.63 billion.The tenants cited above are grade-A companies and not at risk for bankruptcies or failure to pay rent. But further downsizing of office space remains a risk for Hudson Pacific Properties. Amazon has demonstrated it is willing to build its own industrial space, so it wouldn’t be a total shock if Amazon decided to construct its own office buildings.Another weakness of Hudson Pacific Properties’ portfolio is the heavy reliance upon the tech and movie industries. A more diverse portfolio might minimize some of the risks to its occupancy rates. That Google is responsible for almost 14% of the ABR is clearly a danger.PerformanceHudson Pacific Properties’ long- and short-term performances both have been weak. Over nearly 28 years, it has a total return of 30.44%, which is less than one could get from a certificate of deposit (CD) or Treasury bond. Since the beginning of 2022, Hudson Pacific Properties has had a negative 75.83% return. Year to date, it’s down 45%.Recent NewsOn May 8, Hudson Pacific Properties reported its first-quarter operating results, but the news was somewhat negative. Funds from operations (FFO) of $0.35 missed analyst estimates by $0.07 and were down from $0.50 in the first quarter of 2022. Revenue of $252.26 million was $9.19 million shy of the estimates. The only positive was that revenue was 3.2% better than revenue in the first quarter of 2022.On June 9, Hudson Pacific Properties declared a quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share. This was a 50% reduction from the previous quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share. This was not a surprise as it was revealed on its May conference call. The quarterly dividend had been stable at $0.25 per share since March 2017, so the news was not well received. The forward annual dividend of $0.50 now yields 10.37%.Analysts are somewhat blase about Hudson Pacific Properties. Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo have recently maintained Equal-Weight ratings on it and Citigroup and Piper Sandler both rate it as Neutral. All of them have lowered price targets within the range of $4 and $6 over the last month.Short interest is also a problem and is now up to 13.2%. Traders are seeing the growing weakness in the California office markets, especially in areas like San Francisco, and betting against Hudson Pacific. The strike at the Writers Guild of America, now up to 50 days, could also hurt demand for Hudson Pacific’s studio properties. Total debt of $4.9 billion, along with a 56% debt-to-capital ratio, necessitated the recent dividend cut. Before the cut, the yield was over 20%.Despite the many negatives, there are still a few positives. The dividend yield remains high, while the payout ratio, assuming a forward annual dividend of $0.50, is now down to 36%. The price/FFO is abnormally low now at 3.51.Hudson Pacific Properties is a blood-in-the-streets purchase at this point. Despite the high dividend yield and a payout ratio of 36%, this is not a REIT for conservative income investors as the ongoing risks could send shares even lower, negating the dividend with further loss of principal. The office REITs continue to struggle, and Hudson Pacific Properties is one of the weakest REITs within that subsector.But Hudson Pacific Properties was a $24 stock when 2022 began, so those with a longer time horizon and a more aggressive approach to investing could do well accumulating shares at present levels and hoping for either a mild recession or no recession at all over the next few years.Weekly REIT Report: REITs are one of the most misunderstood investment options, making it difficult for investors to spot incredible opportunities until it’s too late.

(NFLX) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-inc-nflx-trending-stock-130013986.html,1687438813,STORY,['NFLX'],"[Netflix (NFLX) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this internet video service have returned +16.3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry, which Netflix falls in, has gained 11.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Netflix is expected to post earnings of $2.81 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -12.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1%.The consensus earnings estimate of $11.22 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +12.8%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $14.69 indicates a change of +31% from what Netflix is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.8%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Netflix is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Netflix, the consensus sales estimate of $8.24 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +3.4%. The $33.86 billion and $38.12 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +7.1% and +12.6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNetflix reported revenues of $8.16 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.7%. EPS of $2.88 for the same period compares with $3.53 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.18 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.25%. The EPS surprise was +1.77%.Over the last four quarters, Netflix surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Netflix is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Netflix. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

116,8317bbed-f9bc-3f2f-bc3a-9da81e25b47b,TJX,2023-06-23,Growth Endeavors Aid Tractor Supply (TSCO) Amid Cost Woes,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/growth-endeavors-aid-tractor-supply-150200401.html,1687446120,STORY,"['TSCO', 'TJX']","[Tractor Supply Company TSCO has been gaining from continued market share growth and progress on its strategic initiatives. Moreover, TSCO benefited from its Life Out Here Strategy, Neighbor’s Club membership program and healthy product demand.This led to year-over-year sales growth of 9.1% to $3,299.2 million in first-quarter 2023. The top line also benefited from contributions from the Orscheln Farm and Home acquisition concluded in October 2022, store openings and increased comparable store sales (comps).Comps improved 2.1% year over year led by growth in comparable average tickets, offset by a decline in comparable average transactions. The company’s comparable average ticket improved 2.8%, while the comparable average transaction count was down 0.7%. Sturdy demand for everyday merchandise, including consumable, usable and edible products, as well as year-round products, contributed to comp growth.Tractor Supply has been on track to build up its Out Here lifestyle assortment and the convenient shopping format to gain customers and market share. The strategy is essentially based on five key pillars — customers, digitization, execution, team members and total shareholder return.As part of the plans, it revised the long-term financial growth targets for 2022-2026. Management envisions achieving net sales growth of 6-7%, while comps are expected to grow 4-5%. The operating margin is expected to be 10.1-10.6%, up from the earlier mentioned 9-9.5%. Earnings per share are likely to grow 8-11%, up from the previously disclosed 8-10%.Earlier, the company launched the Field Activity Support Team (“FAST”), and implemented various technology and service enhancements across the enterprise. It is also in the initial phase of transforming its side lots and mature stores to improve space productivity, bringing the latest merchandising strategies to life and advancing efforts to remain nationally strong and locally relevant.TSCO’s focus on integrating its physical and digital operations to offer consumers a seamless shopping experience bodes well. The company has been on track with the ‘ONETractor’ strategy aimed at connecting stores and online shopping. Its omni-channel investments include curbside pickup, same-day and next-day delivery, a re-launched website, and a new mobile app.In the first quarter, Tractor Supply’s e-commerce business performed well, with its mobile app representing more than 20% of its digital sales. Earlier, the company launched Tractor Supply Visa Credit Card, which allows customers to earn points on their everyday purchases, both in-store and anywhere Visa is accepted.Tractor Supply exited the first quarter with more than 30 million Neighbor's Club members. The company’s rebranding of Petsense by Tractor Supply and expansion of its Neighbor's Club program to Petsense stores received positive customer feedback. The move will enable it to gain pet customers for both banners.TSCO has also been expanding its store base, and implementing technological advancements to induce traffic and drive the top line. The company is well-positioned to expand its store base, remaining on track to increase its domestic store to 2,500 in the long term.In the first quarter, the company opened 17 Tractor Supply stores and three Petsense by Tractor Supply stores. It expects to complete the planned conversion of 81 Orscheln Farm and Home to Tractor Supply stores by the end of 2023. Management expects to continue its store-opening initiatives in 2023. It plans to open 70 Tractor Supply stores and 10-15 Petsense stores in 2023.Driven by these factors, management expects fiscal 2023 net sales of $15-$15.3 billion, in line with our estimate of $15.2 billion. Comp growth is likely to be 3.5-5.5%. The company is likely to witness comp sales toward the top half of its guidance in the second quarter.TSCO also anticipates strength in CUE products and DIY categories like repairs and maintenance. Its second and third quarters are anticipated to have the strongest comp sales growth potential, while the fourth quarter is expected to be at the low end of the guidance range.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Consequently, shares of TSCO have lost 2.7% in the past three months but came ahead of the industry’s decline of 4.7%.Hurdles on the WayTractor Supply has been reeling under inflation woes and rising costs. In first-quarter 2023, SG&amp;A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of sales, expanded 119 bps year over year to 28.1%. Higher SG&amp;A expenses resulted from the deleverage due to moderate comps, and higher depreciation and amortization; the opening of a distribution center; and the impacts of the Orscheln Farm and Home acquisition.Bottom LineDespite inflation and cost woes, Tractor Supply looks well-poised on the back of online strength, solid demand and other growth efforts. Also, a Value Score of B and long-term earnings growth of 9.6% raise optimism in this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks that investors may consider are Tecnoglass TGLS, Kroger KR and TJX Companies TJX.Tecnoglass manufactures and sells architectural glass and aluminum products for the residential and commercial construction industries.

This factor can impact your investment portfolio as well as help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.Another thing that can drive investing is the fear of missing out, or FOMO. This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in TJX (TJX) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to TJX for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?TJX's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at TJX's main business drivers.Based in Framingham, MA, The TJX Companies, Inc. is a leading off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions in the U.S. and worldwide. The company’s broad range of assortments at varying prices helps it to reach out to a broad range of consumers. In addition to these, The TJX Companies tries to attract consumers through rapid turn of inventories. As of Apr 30, 2023, the company operated a total of 4,865 stores in nine countries, the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, Poland, Austria, the Netherlands, and Australia, and five e-commerce sites.The company has been able to distinguish itself from traditional retailers on the grounds of opportunistic buying strategies and flexible business model. In fact, The TJX Companies’ low-cost structure sets it apart from other traditional retailers. In order to maintain control on costs, the company engages in the promotion of retail banners, rather than specific brands. The company’s distribution network is also designed in a manner such that helps curtailing costs. Moreover, the company emphasizes on creating strong relations with vendors across different countries, in order leverage buying power.  The TJX Companies operates through four business segments:In the U.S., it operates through two segments, namely, Marmaxx (through stores under the names of T.J. Maxx and Marshalls) and HomeGoods.Story continuesMarmaxx divisions (62.5% of Q1 fiscal 24 Sales) sell family apparel (including footwear and accessories), home fashions (including home basics, accent furniture, lamps, rugs, wall décor, decorative accessories and giftware) and other merchandise.HomeGoods (16.7% of Q1 fiscal 24 Sales) chain offers home basics, giftware, accent furniture, lamps, rugs, wall décor and decorative accessories from around the world, seasonal and other merchandise.In Canada, it operates through TJX Canada (8.8% of Q1 fiscal 24 Sales) through stores under the names of Winners, Marshalls and HomeSense and in Europe, it operates through TJX International (12% of Q1 fiscal 24 Sales) through stores under the names of T.K. Maxx and HomeSense.Bottom LinePutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For TJX, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in June 2013 would be worth $3,268.13, or a 226.81% gain, as of June 22, 2023. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.Compare this to the S&amp;P 500's rally of 174.15% and gold's return of 37.45% over the same time frame.Analysts are anticipating more upside for TJX.The TJX Companies has outpaced the industry in the past six months. The company’s off-price business model, strategic store locations, impressive brands and fashion products and supply-chain management have been working well. The TJX Companies is benefiting from its solid store and e-commerce growth efforts. The company’s Marmaxx segment is doing particularly well, wherein comp store sales increased in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, backed by improved customer traffic. However, the HomeGoods (U.S.) division has been seeing soft sales. Also, TJX has been grappling with increased wage and supply-chain costs. Management expects these costs to be deterrents in fiscal 2024. Nonetheless, the company expects the pretax profit margin to increase in fiscal 2024 and also anticipates overall comp store sales growth.Over the past four weeks, shares have rallied 5.27%, and there have been 9 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2023 compared to none lower.

Following the approval of the sBLA, Blincyto can be used to treat patients experiencing first or second complete remission with minimal residual disease (MRD) greater than or equal to 0.1%.Per Amgen, the approval of Blincyto, a bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) immuno-oncology therapy, is based on positiveadditional data from two phase III studies that were submitted to the regulatory body for review.

The detection of such cancer cells is only possible through highly sensitive instruments.The 2018 accelerated approval of Blincyto was the first-and-only approved BiTE immunotherapy as well as the first-and-only therapy to be FDA-approved for MRD.Management claimed that in a phase II study, approximately 80% of adult patients treated with Blincyto were observed to have experienced a complete MRD response.

In a February outlook, Newmont said Peñasquito was expected to produce between 190,510 and 208,654420 metric tons of zinc this year and 77,111 and 86,183 tons of lead.Companies declare force majeure when unexpected circumstances prevent them from meeting contract obligations.""Due to interruptions in production caused by the union strike at Newmont's Peñasquito mine in Mexico, force majeure has been declared with certain customers for some of the mine's products,"" Newmont said in an emailed statement.On June 7, the National Union of Mine and Metal Workers of the Mexican Republic notified Newmont of strike action demanding an increase in the profit-sharing benefit provided for in the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) from 10% to 20%, the company said.""We remain in a constructive dialogue with the union and the authorities participating in the mediation process,"" it said.Peñasquito is a major employer in the area, with a direct workforce of over 5,000.Governments and workers have become more vocal in demanding a share of mining company profits as commodity prices increase.Worries about zinc supplies and the potential for tightness due to production cuts have boosted zinc prices on the London Metal Exchange, which at around $2,420 have gained more than 7% since the end of May.Swedish miner Boliden last week said it will suspend production at Europe's largest zinc mine in Ireland within the next month because of ""unsustainable financial losses"".It was also forced to halt output at its largest production unit, the Ronnskar smelter in Sweden, after a fire broke out overnight.(Reporting by Pratima Desai and Clara Denina; editing by Kirsten Donovan and Jane Merriman)]"

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Newmont Corporation (NEM) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Newmont currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.93, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 14 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.93 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 14 recommendations that derive the current ABR, seven are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 50% and 7.1% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for NEMBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for NEMCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Newmont here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Newmont, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Story continuesZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is NEM Worth Investing In?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Newmont, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 3.2% over the past month to $2.50.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Newmont.

M has been a weak performer for a while now, due to multiple headwinds that are hurting the company’s performance. Macroeconomic pressures, waning consumer confidence and a pullback in spending activity have hit the retailers, and Macy’s is not immune to the same. The company has posted soft first-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein both the top and bottom lines declined year over year, and comparable sales fell on an owned basis and an owned-plus-licensed basis. Management is taking a cautious approach for the rest of fiscal 2023 and thus has trimmed the annual sales and earnings view.Driven by these limitations, shares of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) have plunged 25.2% in the year-to-date period, wider than the industry’s 13.8% decline. For fiscal 2023, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Macy's sales and earnings per share (EPS) is currently pegged at $22.97 billion and $3.05, respectively. These estimates show corresponding decreases of 6% and 31.9% from the year-ago period’s figures.Let’s Delve DeepIn addition to the aforesaid headwinds, inflationary pressures and changing consumer behavior have been weighing on the company’s performance. Markdowns to optimize inventory levels within overstock categories and elevated promotional environment have been weighing on margins. It has been witnessing higher selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses for a while now. The company’s digital business also remains soft.Apart from a dull first quarter, Macy’s’ digital sales dropped 8% from the year-ago quarter’s level. Also, brick-and-mortar sales decreased 6% versus the first quarter of 2022. Comparable sales fell 7.9% on an owned basis and 7.2% on an owned-plus-licensed basis from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s tally. The metric across Macy’s brand declined 8.7% on an owned basis and 7.9% on an owned-plus-licensed basis. At the Bloomingdale brand, comparable sales dropped 3.9% on an owned basis and 4.3% on an owned-plus-licensed basis.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDuring first-quarter fiscal 2023, SG&amp;A expenses increased 2.4% year over year to $1,950 million, and as a percentage of net sales, SG&amp;A expenses increased 350 basis points year over year to 37.7%. SG&amp;A expenses consisted of investments in colleagues like competitive pay, incentives and benefits. Any deleverage in expenses, unless fully offset by sales, may have a direct bearing on margins, and in turn the bottom line.Consequently, for fiscal 2023, management cut sales and earnings views to reflect the expected macroeconomic impacts. Net sales are now projected to be $22.8-$23.2 billion for fiscal 2023, down from the prior view of $23.7-$24.2 billion. Comparable owned plus licensed sales on a 52-week basis are expected to decline 6-7.5% versus the prior view of a 2-4% decrease year over year. Adjusted EPS are envisioned in the bracket of $2.70-$3.20 for the fiscal year, down from $3.67-$4.11 expected earlier and $4.48 earned in the last fiscal year.For the fiscal second quarter, net sales are projected to be $5-$5.1 billion and the gross margin is likely to fall no more than 100 basis points year over year. Adjusted EPS are envisioned to be 10-15 cents.Given the aforesaid negatives, we remain cautious about the stock in the near term. A Momentum Score of F further adds to the weakness.Solid Picks in RetailWe have highlighted three better-ranked stocks, namely Abercrombie &amp; Fitch ANF, Urban Outfitters URBN and American Eagle Outfitters AEO.Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, a leading casual apparel retailer, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

The constant rise in GD’s backlog indicates a solid demand for its products, thereby bolstering its revenue generation prospects.However, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has to face supply-chain issues that continue to pose risks for its Marine Systems’ submarine programs and Technologies segment.TailwindsGeneral Dynamics has been investing in its business to enhance operating efficiency, innovation and affordability for its customers. This is evident as capital expenditures in the first quarter of 2023 amounted to $161 million, up 14.2% from the prior-year quarter’s level. The company plans to invest $1.8 billion in the expanded and modernized facilities at Electric Boat to support submarine construction.At the end of the first quarter, General Dynamics witnessed a record order backlog of $89.8 billion, up 3% from that registered in the year-ago period. This uptick in order inflow was driven by strong demand across the company’s product and services portfolio, as well as orders for all models of Gulfstream aircraft.On the product development front, General Dynamics’ Gulfstream Aerospace unit is working on the ultra-long-range, ultra-large-cabin jet named G700. This jet features a technologically advanced flight deck, consisting of new engines that deliver high-speed performance. The aforementioned unit is currently in the process of flight testing and seeking U.S. Federal Aviation Administration certification for G700, which has logged more than 3,200 test hours.HeadwindsThe company has been witnessing supply-chain issues in its defense business, particularly in the Marine Systems (the submarine supply chain) and Technologies segments.

This performance was attributed to bets on rising interest rates and volatility across various asset classes. It was Rokos' best annual performance since 2015, the year he started trading for his own firm, and it helped the fund recover from a record 26% loss suffered in the previous year.However, Rokos Capital Management faced challenges in early 2023. The hedge fund experienced a 15% decline in March. Year-to-date, the macro hedge fund is down by approximately 9.5% as of March. The firm was caught off-guard by the bond market turmoil, and its bets on US government bonds backfired. This led to concerns from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding the size of potential margin calls on the firm.In response to the losses, Rokos Capital Management decided to de-risk its portfolio and reduce exposure to market volatility. The firm stated that its cash levels remained healthy, and it emphasized its open and collaborative engagement with regulatory authorities such as the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the SEC. The SEC chair, Gary Gensler, reportedly discussed Rokos with the UK regulators, highlighting the concerns over margin calls and the potential impact on the US government bond market.According to Forbes, Chris Rokos, the CEO and founder of Rokos Capital Management, has a net worth of $1.5 billion. Rokos is a macro investor who specializes in commodities, currencies, interest rates, and equities. He is known for advocating a strict approach to fund management, including immediate termination of unsuccessful traders and considering a trader's first year as an extended interview. Rokos is recognized as an exceptional manager in handling large debt and option holdings. Chris Rokos’ Rokos Capital Management 13F portfolio value decreased from $2.28 billion in Q4 2022 to $1.35 billion in Q1 2023. The fund made 29 new purchases in the first quarter, increased its stakes in 13 stocks, sold out 30 equities and reduced holdings in six stocks.

(NASDAQ:LESL), the leading direct-to-consumer pool and spa care services company in the U.S. The company differentiates itself through its loyal client base, vertically integrated supply chain, scale advantage and seamless customer experience. Shares have recently sold off on near-term operational issues at a distribution facility, as well as concerns around the sustainability of the company’s growth profile in a normalized, post-pandemic environment. Although we believe new pool installments will likely experience a slowdown, the install base has materially increased and ~80% of LESL’s business is tied to recurring maintenance. We found this entry point as an attractive opportunity to own a differentiated retailer, well positioned to benefit from secular tailwinds in an industry, permanently elevated by the pandemic.”9.

(NASDAQ:MBLY), compared to 29 funds in the prior quarter.Baron Funds made the following comment about Mobileye Global Inc. (NASDAQ:MBLY) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“During the fourth quarter, we participated in Mobileye Global Inc. (NASDAQ:MBLY)’s IPO. Mobileye is a leading ADAS and autonomous driving technologies and solutions provider with over 125 million vehicles across 800 models that have incorporated its products to date across 50-plus vehicle manufacturers (OEMs) including 13 of the top 15 global OEMs. The company was founded in 1999 and effectively pioneered the ADAS market introducing its first EyeQ system-on-chip (SoC) in 2007, enabling the vehicle to gain ADAS capabilities (such as real-time detection of vehicles, pedestrians, and lane markings) for a price of around $50. While the company remains a leader in ADAS today (with an approximate 70% market share), we believe the bigger opportunity is in leading the autonomous driving revolution. This would, in our view, significantly improve safety; meaningfully increase the vehicle utilization rate, which today is only around 4%; and dramatically grow the company’s content per vehicle. Mobileye’s SuperVision, a fully operational point-to-point assisted driving navigation solution, is the next step in the company’s progress towards autonomous driving, and it has a price tag of over 20 times that of its basic ADAS SoC. At the last Consumer Electronics Conference, the company announced a $3.5 billion backlog for its SuperVision solution across six OEMs and nine vehicle models. In addition, the company announced a $1.5 billion design win for its consumer AV program and a $3.5 billion backlog for its Mobility-as-a-Service or robotaxi solution. CEO and Founder, Amnon Shashua discussed his long-term vision in the company’s shareholder letter:“More than two decades ago, I founded Mobileye on the belief that computer vision technology could help prevent automobile crashes and save lives. From that simple idea, a global industry was born… By 2030, we expect Mobileye driver-assistance systems to be deployed in another 270 million vehicles globally… We believe that we will be positioned to deliver an autonomous driving solution that can enable the mass adoption of AVs [Autonomous Vehicles] including both Mobileye-powered robotaxis and consumer-owned autonomous driving vehicles. And Mobileye will be well on the way to delivering the future I first envisioned more than two decades ago.””8. New Fortress Energy Inc.

""Well, even though it was advertised as having a clean title (which it had), the CARFAX Vehicle History Report showed that it had been totaled in Texas just 6 months before. Without CARFAX, I would have paid retail money for a truck that had over $15,000 in repairs. I did find a clean truck a few weeks later and its CARFAX showed a history of low mileage and that it had been well-maintained.""It's stories like Brian's that motivate the CARFAX team, including Jay Smith, a longtime employee in the Columbia office. ""I've had awesome opportunities that have challenged me and given me a reason to continue to grow professionally here at CARFAX. Not only from the people I've worked with, but also the work itself.

In an interview with Yahoo Finance Live at the Cannes Lions International Festival, Raja Rajamannar, Mastercard's Chief Marketing and Communications Officer, explains what his company is doing to woo those younger customers.Video Transcript[MUSIC PLAYING]BRAD SMITH: Welcome back to Yahoo Finance. You are watching our coverage coming to you from Cannes France, where we're at the Cannes Lions Festival of Creativity. Brad Smith here with Brian Sozzi, and we've got a great guest here with us right now, Raja Rajamannar, who is the Mastercard Chief Marketing and Communications Officer as well as the President of Healthcare at the company. Thank you so much for joining us here today.RAJA RAJAMANNAR: Thank you very much for having me here. I appreciate it.BRAD SMITH: So you have a lot of customers who may be swiping Mastercard out here, but you've got a lot of business to business customers here as well. Take us into the pulse of your conversations and what you're hearing from a conference like Cannes.RAJA RAJAMANNAR: See, first and foremost, I think Cannes is predominantly a marketing festival. So people are focused on creativity. They're focused on technology, marketing technology, the agency models, and how budgets are likely to be squeezed for some of the companies because of probably expectation of recession or inflation not subsiding enough and so on. And I think the conversation essentially-- what a reflection of all these.Plus, of course, there is the technology play always with the AI, particularly with generative AI coming in now. There is a lot of hype around it and a lot of discussion and a lot of concerns as well in terms of the ethics and how the whole thing is going to shape industry-- the IP issues and so on and so forth on the one hand. And on the other hand, talent is always an issue, and this actually is one of the best places as hunting grounds to find the top talent, and then you try to have conversations with them and see if you can attract them into your own company. So it's been a series of wonderful conversations and excellent meetings throughout.Story continuesBRIAN SOZZI: You're a big spender. You have a big ad budget.RAJA RAJAMANNAR: I wish so.BRIAN SOZZI: Oh, OK. Well, how do you plan to spend?RAJA RAJAMANNAR: Please don't tell my CEO this.[LAUGHTER]BRIAN SOZZI: I understand. We understand the financial dynamics. Well, say, you have money to spend. Let's put it that way. How are you spending it in later this year compared to 12 months ago? Do you have that concern given where the economy is?RAJA RAJAMANNAR: So you know, I actually seriously say this, which is that we are a huge brand, but we are not very-- what do you call? Lavish in our spending. We're very conservative. We're very thoughtful. We measure our ROI of every single thing that we are spending. We connect the dots between the marketing actions and the business outcomes. And so that diligence is really very helpful to us, and therefore, we don't have these wild swings which are sentiment-based.We have our plans laid out well in advance. We stick to the plans. We can either dial up or down a little bit either way, depending on how the circumstance is. Whether it is the competitive pressure sometimes. Sometimes it's the economic pressure, or sometimes some new things are happening in the marketplace. So as far as we see, we are continuing to be on an upswing, which is the good news. And even in a relatively recessionary kind of a situation, consumers are not going to stop spending on the one hand. The basket changes-- the mix of things in the basket change. Like for example, if you look at travel, travel is not slowing down. And all of us who came here to Cannes, we saw the ticket prices. You know whether it is--BRIAN SOZZI: Our bosses saw the ticket.RAJA RAJAMANNAR: Exactly, right? So you have got those kind of things on the one hand, and on the other hand, you also have like culinary-- anything to do with eating out. That's going through the roof. So there has been a significant uptick in terms of people eating out. Experiences are being sold out like anything. Whether it-- and I'm talking more of live entertainment and so on. So there are certain areas which might be paring back a little bit, but there are others which are compensating. So overall, I think we are not slowing down in terms of our marketing plans, and we are, of course, constantly fine tuning.BRAD SMITH: The mix of products and services that people buy into has changed as you acknowledged a moment ago.RAJA RAJAMANNAR: Correct.BRAD SMITH: But how they spend that's also changed as well. They're leaning into or tapping less of their cash, perhaps. They're leaning more into Mastercard. Leaning more into their credit card, their debit card. Is perhaps something that they reserve for necessities, whereas their credit card, something that says, let's just have a bridge. What are you seeing in that type of consumer spending action?RAJA RAJAMANNAR: So two things. Firstly, the way they are spending has significantly shifted through the pandemic. In pandemic, people were forced to go digital even if they were not digital before, or people like me who are already doing spending online to make purchases but only for certain categories and categories like groceries I never bought before pandemic online. But then when I was forced into that situation, I had to buy groceries. When I started buying groceries, I discovered how easy and comfortable it was and how safe it was too. So therefore now, even post-pandemic, I continue to do shopping online, even for my groceries.BRAD SMITH: Are groceries making Mastercard more profitable then?RAJA RAJAMANNAR: No. Our profitability models don't depend on necessarily which category are spending on. There are a whole mix of things. It's not a straight one-to-one correlation. But the point is that digital spending, away from cash and checks, has accelerated tremendously during the pandemic because of the circumstances. Post-pandemic when things are coming back to physical, still, e-commerce has not slowed down.BRIAN SOZZI: One of your largest competitors-- let's say they are having a blue card. We'll leave it there. They are-- they've gained a lot of customers, sub 25-year-olds. What are those? I mean, Gen Z or whatever it is. Is there a marketing battle for this customer, and why is this such a lucrative customer base, and how are you marketing to them at your company?RAJA RAJAMANNAR: So firstly, there is intense competition in this category of payments across all the segments. If you look, for example, the silver segment as you call people beyond 65 years, they have huge disposable incomes. They have a lot of net savings by and large. And if you think about the spending pattern, these are the bigger spenders than the other demographics. But future is dependent on the younger demographics. So everyone is competing for those, and that includes Mastercard as well.And what we try to do is whichever segments you are, we look at 10 passion points in your life. Music is a passion point-- sports, entertainment. You have got fashion. You've got philanthropy. You got sustainability, shopping, travel. So we got 10 of these passion points, and we try to figure out which segment is responding to what passion point more, and within a given passion point, which sub-area is small?BRAD SMITH: Raja, thank you so much for taking the time--[INTERPOSING VOICES]RAJA RAJAMANNAR: Much appreciate having me here. Thank you. Great talking to you both.BRIAN SOZZI: Thank you.BRAD SMITH: I appreciate it. And you've been watching Yahoo Finance in Cannes. We've got much more coming up.]"

Its shares gained 0.4% on Jun 21.The first tie-up of MA relates to the one with the reputed Cards as a Service platform, SimpliFi. As part of this collaboration, the cutting-edge technology of SimpliFi will extend a helping hand in enabling a diversified set of businesses in the region to seamlessly launch Mastercard-backed payment products and services across the market.SimpliFi’s technology capabilities will further take care of the headwinds associated with such initiatives which often exhaust substantial time as well as expenses on the part of the business. At the same time, the partnership will lead to increased usage of Mastercard’s products suite, which in turn, is likely to aid its payment network revenues. Providing access to innovative payment solutions suite also reflects the tech giant’s endeavor to bring more businesses under the ambit of a booming digital economy.Concurrent with the SimpliFi partnership, Mastercard also teamed up with Kuwait’s digital transformation and innovation company, One Global, and the leading payment switch of Pakistan, 1LINK Pvt. Limited.By forming an alliance with One Global, Mastercard unveiled its online checkout platform, Click to Pay (“C2P”), throughout Kuwait. After Kuwait, One Global plans to roll out the service to other countries as well. The service assures to provide smooth payment outcomes for merchants and consumers. Thus C2P guarantees an enhanced, seamless and secure checkout experience without the need of inputing card credentials or saving the confidential data of consumers with different merchants.The benefits of the payment service can be reaped while buying digital gift cards and gaming vouchers. It can also be utilized to conduct bill payments on one of the vertical markets of One Global - Og Money. Mastercard seems to be prudent in choosing One Global as its partner for launching C2P since the latter has a widespread presence across the MENA region.Story continuesThe collaboration with 1LINK bears testament to Mastercard’s intensified focus to harness the promising digital growth prospects of Pakistan. The power of MA’s innovative technologies will be combined with the solid market footprint of 1LINK to launch upgraded payment solutions for the benefit of the country’s consumers and businesses.Mastercard remains on a spree with respect to efforts in the form of partnerships with tech platforms or undertaking significant investments to strengthen its MENA footprint. MA’s keen eye on the region is due to its rapidly growing digital economy, spurred by increased Internet penetration and higher usage of smartphones. This provides a perfect opportunity for the tech giant to drive digitization in the region’s payments ecosystem through its suite of affordable payment solutions.Shares of Mastercard have gained 18.8% in a year compared with the industry’s 7.8% growth.

Then again, the $115 million investment Sequoia lost on FTX was just 2% to 3% of its global growth fund, he said, adding that the firm was “still very excited about the concepts of crypto.”On Sequoia’s recent announcement that it was separating its China and India businesses from its US brand, Lin said geopolitics played a role, but was not the primary driver. Sequoia has come under increasing pressure in Washington over its investments in Chinese companies such as ByteDance Ltd.’s popular video app TikTok.Overall, Lin said, while the current environment has created higher capital costs for founders, it’s still a good time for building resilient startups.Bloomberg News is hosting its annual US Technology Summit in San Francisco, focused on the industry’s most intriguing topics, from artificial intelligence and the future of transportation to social media and cryptocurrencies.

All times are local in San Francisco.Fintech Startup Brex Says IPO Is Years Away (4 p.m.)Henrique Dubugras, co-founder and co-chief executive officer of finance-tech startup Brex, said his company is committed to going public, but it probably won’t happen until the six-year-old startup reaches the 10-year mark.“We absolutely want to be a publicly traded company,” he said. “We’re definitely not in the category of, ‘We could stay private forever if we could.’”The company saw a record inflow of deposits when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March, according to Dubugras. Brex had attempted to set up an emergency loan program prior to the bank being backstopped by the federal government.Dubugras said many of the new clients stuck with Brex, even after SVB’s situation was resolved. The startup has surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue for its Empower spending-management business, Bloomberg reported in May.Dubugras said during the summit that profitability is important to the company and that Brex won’t need to raise fresh funding anytime soon.Wendy Cai-Lee, founder and CEO of commercial-banking startup Piermont Bank, offered a different perspective on going public, noting that “someone can just short your stock and create a ton of volatility to your operations and your survival.”Artificial Intelligence Will Democratize Hollywood, AI Backers Say (3:40 p.m.)Despite its reputation as a threat, artificial intelligence has the power to democratize and expand the way that entertainment is created in Hollywood. That’s according to Sarah Guo, founder of venture capital firm Conviction, and Cristóbal Valenzuela, head of Runway AI Inc., a company that builds AI models for content creation.New AI tools will allow creators from all backgrounds to turn any media into a form that their audience wants, Guo said in a panel at the Bloomberg Technology Summit in San Francisco. Valenzuela compared AI to a new form of camera that will “enable things that weren’t possible before.”AI may decrease jobs in creation to cut down on some of the “toil,” but Guo believes it won’t eliminate creative jobs from production.“There’s a human element that people will always want,” Guo said.Panel Warns That Rush for Generative AI Can’t Ignore Ethics (2 p.m.)Experts on technology and ethics urged lawmakers and companies developing artificial intelligence to keep a close watch on the potential dangers as the technology continues to move forward.Firm ethical and regulatory guidelines are needed for generative AI as companies race to add the technology to their products to gain a competitive edge, said Navrina Singh, founder and CEO of Credo AI, which helps companies develop “responsible” AI.Generative AI is often advertised as the future of work, said Meredith Whittaker, president of the Signal Foundation, but it’s important to remember “whose future” is at stake when people talk about AI replacing jobs, citing, for example, issues raised in the Hollywood writers’ strike.Amazon’s Zoox Races to Beat Robotaxi Rivals (1:45 p.m.)Zoox, the self-driving unit of Amazon.com Inc., is still in the race to win key markets for future robotaxi services, according to Chief Executive Officer Aicha Evans. That’s despite the business having no current commercial or public services.“I’m not conceding I am behind,” Evans said in an interview at the Bloomberg Technology Summit in San Francisco. Evans said New York City was the ultimate prize, but more testing — along with judicious spending — was required. The business is testing the capabilities of its robotaxi, which has no steering wheel or pedals and features inward-facing seats. That includes seeing how it handles snowy conditions.Zoox operates a limited pilot project where its robotaxi ferries employees between two office buildings over a one-mile stretch in Foster City, California. It also puts the autonomous shuttle through its paces on a private test track, which replicates real-world roads and scenarios. Meanwhile, industry competitors Waymo, owned by Alphabet Inc., and Cruise, backed by General Motors Co., have semi-commercial robotaxi services in multiple cities.Self-driving technology will help make US roads safer, Evans said. There are about 40,000 human-induced fatalities each year, she said, adding that “the majority of them are due to somebody doing something dumb. That is unacceptable.”The startup’s valuation has also grown since Amazon acquired it, she said.Chesky Says Airbnb Aims to Be ‘Ultimate AI Concierge’ (12:10 p.m.)Airbnb Inc. CEO Brian Chesky said he envisions artificial intelligence to be at the core of the future of the home-sharing travel site, where it will be in the “business of connecting people.”Airbnb’s opportunity in AI is “built around personalization,” with the help of the large amount of customer data it has collected and reviews left by travelers, Chesky said. “The better we can understand you, the more we can be like the ultimate AI concierge pointing you to places, community homes, experiences and many more things.”Chesky, who helped start the company by sharing his apartment to make rent in San Francisco, also called for a closer relationship between the city and the tech and business community to address ongoing issues such as homelessness, crime and empty offices. He also had suggestions for revitalization such as rezoning commercial spaces to be residential and creating mixed-use and communal spaces.“If we have more dialogue and a little less ideology, we’re going to actually start to solve problems,” he said.San Francisco Mayor Urges Downtown Makeover (11:30 a.m.)San Francisco Mayor London Breed called on investors to redevelop the city’s struggling downtown core by converting or even demolishing empty buildings to make way for new growth.“I think we have to start reimagining what the downtown can be,” Breed said. “Let’s look at what’s possible rather than dwelling on the stories of another store closing — there are a lot of people who may not even shop in those places” because of the increase in online shopping.San Francisco’s troubles are mounting as the tech industry downsizes its operations and retailers flee the city’s downtown area. In a major blow for the city, Westfield announced this month that it’s giving up its San Francisco mall located in one of the main downtown shopping and tourist areas.Breed highlighted the potential to convert office towers into housing, tear down buildings for construction and encourage new startups to plant their roots.Stability AI CEO Says Better Data Needed to Train AI Models (10:30 a.m.)Stability AI CEO Emad Mostaque called for countries to have more open data to help improve artificial intelligence models, noting that “garbage” data is contributing to poor results from the technology.“Let’s build AI so it works for us, not against us,” he said. Stability AI also released a new model for creating AI-generated images on Thursday.Mostaque said artificial intelligence is the biggest economic phenomenon of our lifetime, but that the industry is still figuring out issues around ethics and securing better data to train AI models.The massive impact of the technology hasn’t yet been realized, Mostaque said, noting that “this is like Covid before Tom Hanks got it.”Mostaque said Stability AI isn’t currently fundraising. Bloomberg reported in March that the company was aiming to raise at a $4 billion valuation.Bloomberg News is hosting its annual US Technology Summit in San Francisco, focused on the industry’s most intriguing topics, from artificial intelligence and the future of transportation to social media and cryptocurrencies. At the event Thursday at SVN West, titled “Tech’s Turning Point,” speakers include OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Amazon Web Services CEO Adam Selipsky, venture capitalist Reid Hoffman, San Francisco Mayor London Breed and Airbnb Inc.

Chief Executive Officer Cristiano Amon said his company has been working on high-performance chips that should soon help power generative artificial intelligence applications on smartphones.Amon said as soon as next year, some smartphone models powered by Qualcomm chips may have the power to use generative AI applications for photos and images, such as Stable Diffusion’s model.“We’re just at the very beginning” of understanding generative AI, Amon said in an interview with Bloomberg Television’s Ed Ludlow. “There are going to be so many applications.”The CEO said generative AI will also be useful in self-driving cars, particularly when a rider gives the automated system complicated directions. AI processors in these cars need to make decisions “in real time,” Amon said, and “that computation needs to happen locally” with powerful chips in the car rather than relying on the computing power of the cloud.Amazon Spending $100 Million to Help Cloud Clients with AI (9:30 a.m.)Amazon.com Inc.’s cloud unit is building a program to help customers develop and deploy new kinds of artificial intelligence products as the biggest seller of cloud services tries to match Microsoft and Google in the market for so-called generative AI.Amazon Web Services is investing $100 million to set up the AWS Generative AI Innovation Center, which will link customers with company experts in AI and machine learning. They’ll help a range of clients in health care, financial services and manufacturing build customized applications using the new technology.Read More: Amazon Is Spending $100 Million to Teach Cloud Clients About AIInflection AI Drops New Model for Personal Assistant (9:21 a.m.)Artificial intelligence startup Inflection AI announced at the tech summit that it’s releasing a new large language model — the kind of AI system that underlies generative tools like ChatGPT — to power its Pi personal assistant product. Called Inflection-1, the LLM is supposed to outperform OpenAI’s GPT-3.5, according to the company.Inflection AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman called artificial intelligence “the most radical transformation of our lifetime” during a panel discussion at the summit. Reid Hoffman, who co-founded LinkedIn and is a partner at VC firm Greylock Partners, added that Inflection AI’s Pi chatbot takes a more personal, emotional approach compared with ChatGPT. “IQ is not the only thing that matters here,” he said. “EQ matters as well.”Sam Altman Cautions Against Over-Regulation of AI: (8:45 a.m.)Sam Altman, chief executive officer of ChatGPT creator OpenAI, said lawmakers around the world should be careful not to “overdo” regulation of artificial intelligence and that it should be limited to “existential risk-level” systems.In an onstage interview, Altman said all powerful technologies can be used in dangerous ways, and AI is no different: “Things will go wrong,” he said, citing potential cybersecurity risks among others. The world can manage those risks through global regulation, Altman said, but regulations should only be on “these powerful existential risk-level systems” and “you don’t want to overdo it.”The upsides to developing and improving upon AI systems are so tremendous that the world shouldn’t try to stop the technologies from happening, Altman said, citing the potential for better educational systems and healthcare.“At this point, given how much people see the economic benefits and potential, no company could stop it,” he said. But global regulation “can help make it safe — which is a better answer than stopping,” Altman said. “I also don’t think stopping it would work.”Read More: OpenAI CEO: AI ‘Most Important Step Yet’ For Humans and Tech--With assistance from Eari Nakano, Priya Anand, Hannah Miller, Ed Ludlow, Eliyahu Kamisher, Tom Giles, Caelyn Pender, Lucas Shaw, Emily Chang and Natalie Lung.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Bank Robbers Who Are Stealing Their Own MoneyThe World’s Empty Office Buildings Have Become a Debt Time BombThe Low-Tech, High-Stakes World of Ripping Off Benefits RecipientsThe Ad Industry Has No Intention of Letting AI Ruin the PartyThe ‘Extend and Pretend’ Real Estate Strategy Is Running Out of Time©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Source: Adobe Stock/Leung Chopan Leung Chopan / Adobe StockOnline travel is a weird industry when it comes to its outsized marketing spend as compared with other types of businesses.None of this is shocking because it’s been the pattern for many years, but a BTIG investor report published Thursday put Booking Holdings’ marketing spend in a different context.Booking Holdings, which owns brands including Booking.com, Kayak and Priceline, spent around $6 billion on marketing in 2022 — and that was about 35% of its total revenue. BTIG stated that Booking gets around 50% of its traffic direct; around 20 percent from free search engine listings; roughly 15% from social media, email, display ads and referrals, and 15% from paid search engine marketing — “and it spends billions annually to get that last piece.”That’s worth repeating: Booking Holdings spent around $6 billion on sales and marketing last year to attract just 15% of visitors to its platform. (Sure, it directs some of that spend toward goals other than luring travelers to its platforms, but you get the general idea.)How Expedia and Airbnb Do ItOver at rival Expedia Group, its marketing spend was even more top-heavy — around 47% of revenue last year.Airbnb is an outlier in the online travel agency space because around 90% of its customers come directly to its website or app, as well as from free listings in search engines. You’ve heard the company’s talking points ad infinitum: Airbnb is so mainstream that it’s “a noun and a verb.”So Airbnb focuses on limiting its paid search engine marketing on platforms like Google and Bing. Airbnb shelled out a very modest 18% of revenue on marketing in 2022.Yes, before the hate mail arrives, it’s true that the three companies calculate marketing spend differently, but the basic points about their marketing spend as a portion of overall revenue hold true.Airbnb Smart, Booking Foolhardy?All of this is a contrast to most U.S. industries, according to a 2022 Gartner survey, which found them planning to spend a relatively minuscule 6-10% on marketing as a percent of revenue last year.Story continuesBut before you leap to the conclusion that Booking’s strategy (35% of revenue on marketing) is dumb, and Airbnb’s approach (just 18%) is valedictorian-worthy, consider that Booking’s profit margin was considerably higher than Airbnb’s or Expedia’s last year.Booking’s 2022 EBITDA margin was 31.3% compared with 23.2% for Airbnb, and 11.9% for Expedia. (True, their businesses are different as they sell some different things, and they are spread out across different geographies.)Booking “has historically had an advantage in paid channels with a higher conversion rate, allowing it to bid more efficiently,” the BTIG report stated.Another way to look at Booking’s advantage over Expedia is in marketing spend as a percent of bookings, not revenue, and by this metric Booking was more efficient, 4.9% versus 5.7%, according to BTIG.Marketing as a Percent of Bookings, Booking Versus ExpediaRegarding these companies’ big-stakes marketing programs, now you know how strategic it is for them to try to attract more free, direct traffic to their websites and to coax more app downloads. It’s all in the hope that their customers won’t stray once they land on their websites, and won’t have to be enticed with billions of marketing dollars all over again.Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

Earlier this year, Lockheed was selected by the U.S. Army’s Aviation and Missile Center to develop LRMF missiles.The significance of LRMF missiles lies in their capability to neutralize targets way beyond the present capacity of the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) baseline. Aerojet Rocketdyne’s propulsion solution will play a key role in extending the missile range. Extension of the missile range will provide an edge to defense personnel in offensive operations.The development of the LRMF missiles will take place in multiple phases. In the first phase of the program, Lockheed and its team will concentrate on the design and risk-reduction activities.Missiles Play a Crucial Role in Modern WarfareMissiles are tactical weapons that have virtually changed the concept of modern warfare.

However, the average selling price, or ASP, declined 3% from a year ago to $479,500.Net orders grew 1% to 3,936 units from the prior year.

Along with other notable homebuilders, shares of Denver, CO-based homebuilder M.D.C. Holdings, Inc. MDC have gained 41.9% this year compared with the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry’s 42.3% rise.The Zacks Consensus Estimate has witnessed an uptrend over the past 30 days as analysts raised their estimates. Over the said time frame, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.55 and $4.06 for 2023 and 2024 has increased 4.7% and 2.3%, respectively.MDC currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with an impressive VGM Score of A. This helps to identify stocks with the most attractive value, growth and momentum.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat Makes the Stock an Attractive Pick?Improved Builders’ Sentiment: Builders are now cautiously optimistic for 2023 as the lack of existing inventory is shifting demand to the new home market. Although builders continue to grapple with high construction costs and material supply chain disruptions, they continue to witness strong pent-up demand as buyers turn more to the new home market due to a shortage of existing inventory.According to a report released on Jun 19 by the National Association of Home Builders, the Monthly Housing Market Index experienced a significant surge, rising by five points to reach 55 in June compared to May. This upward trend in confidence has been sustained for six consecutive months, showcasing a positive outlook for the housing market.Built-to-Order Approach Gives Competitive Advantage: The company’s Build-to-Order process, also known as “dirt sales”, provides buyers with a wide range of choices in major aspects of their future home and personalized customer experience through in-house community teams. This highly consumer-centric approach helps homebuyers to design a home with the features and amenities of their choice. Also, buyers have the flexibility to customize their options according to their preferences and affordability.The company limits the number of homes started without a contract, also known as “spec homes”, and follows a strategy of initiating construction only after a purchase agreement has been executed. This reduces inventory risk, enhances efficiencies in construction, and provides greater visibility, as well as predictability on future deliveries. MDC’s build-to-order homes model gives it a competitive edge over its peers.Focus on First-Time/Move-Up Buyers: MDC remains focused on the growing demand for entry-level homes, addressing the need for lower-priced homes, given affordability concerns prevailing in the U.S. housing market. The company has been reaping benefits from the successful execution of strategic initiatives to boost profitability, with a focus on entry-level homes. In view of these strategic efforts, the growing share of first-time buyers is encouraging, especially post-pandemic.Story continuesOther Key PicksHere are some other top-ranked stocks that investors may consider from the same industry:PulteGroup Inc.

AMWD as the Bull of the Day and Victoria's Secret &amp; Co. VSCO as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on PulteGroup PHM, Lennar LEN, and Toll Brothers TOL.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:American Woodmark Corp. is riding the wave of stronger housing demand into fiscal 2024. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) posted a big earnings beat in the fiscal fourth quarter.American Woodmark is one of the largest cabinet manufacturers in the United States. It partners with major home centers, builders and independent dealers and distributors on kitchen, bath and other cabinets.A Big Earnings Surprise in Fiscal Q4On May 25, American Woodmark reported its fiscal fourth quarter 2023 earnings and blew by the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $0.86. Earnings were $2.21 versus the Zacks Consensus of $1.35, for a beat of 63.7%.It has beat 3 out of the last 4 quarters.Sales fell 4.1% in the quarter to $481.1 million with free cash flow of $61.9 million. For the fiscal year, sales rose 11.3% to $2.066 billion   with free cash flow of $153.5 million.As of the end of fiscal 2023, on Apr 30, 2023, American Woodmark had $41.7 million in cash plus access to $323.2 million of additional availability under its revolving credit facility.""The strengthening in our operational performance throughout the year combined with the platform changes we began executing in fiscal year 2023, gives us the confidence that we can deliver strong margin performance in the dynamic market conditions,"" said Scott Culbreth, CEO.Analysts Bullish About Fiscal 2024American Woodmark gave fiscal 2024 guidance of low double digit net sales decline but given the margin improvement, that didn't deter the analysts from raising their earnings estimates.2 estimates were raised in the last 30 days for fiscal 2024 pushing the Zacks Consensus up to $6.53 from $5.34. That's still an earnings decline of 14.3% because the beginning of last year was still red hot before the housing market froze up.Story continuesShares at 1-Year HighsShares of American Woodmark have rallied in 2023, adding 72.2% in the last year. Even just over the last month, shares are up 31%. This follows along with many of the homebuilder stocks that have also had big rallies this spring.But shares are still lagging compared to earlier in the pandemic. Over the last 2 years, shares are down 12.3%.American Woodmark is cheap, with a forward P/E of just 11.If you're looking for a way to play the pick-up in the housing market without buying a homebuilder, American Woodmark should be on your short list.Bear of the Day:Victoria's Secret &amp; Co. recently lowered full year guidance as North America sales slowed. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) is expected to see earnings fall 50% this year.Victoria's Secret is a specialty retailer of signature bras, panties, lingerie, casual sleepwear, athleisure and swim as well as fragrances and body care. Its brands include Victoria's Secret and PINK as well as Adore Me, a digital-first innovative intimates brand serving women of all sizes and budgets.Victoria's Secret has approximately 1,350 retail stores in about 70 countries.First Ever Earnings Miss in Q1 2023On May 31, 2023, Victoria's Secret reported its first quarter 2023 results and missed on the Zacks Consensus for the first time since it went public in 2021.It reported earnings of just $0.28 versus the consensus of $0.54. That's an earnings miss of $0.26.What went wrong in the quarter? Sales were in-line with the original expectations but Victoria's Secret was more promotional than planned.Sales were particularly challenging in the core categories where there was significant decline in the overall stores and digital intimates market in North America.The good news was that inventory levels in Victoria's Secret and PINK divisions ended the quarter down low-double digits compared to the prior year. Excess inventory has been a big issue for many retailers over the last year.Additionally, international business continued to see stellar growth with China as a bright spot.Adore Me, which was recently acquired, also met the company's expectations in the quarter.Full Year 2023 Forecast LoweredGiven the results of Q1 and the recent trends, Victoria's Secret updated its forecast and now sees full year 2023 net sales in the range of flat to down low-single digits compared to last year's net sales of $6.344 billion.The analysts are bearish on earnings as well. 5 estimates have been lowered in the last 30 days, pushing the Zacks Consensus Estimate down to $2.45 from $4.90.That's an earnings decline of 50.5% as the company made $4.95 last year.Shares Near All-Time LowsVictoria's Secret went public in 2021 when L Brands split into two companies: Victoria's Secret and Bath &amp; Body Works. Shares of Victoria's Secret have fallen this year, losing 48.9%. It is trading near all-time lows.But even with the cuts to earnings estimates, it's still cheap with a forward P/E of just 7.7.It also has a PEG ratio of 0.8. A PEG under 1.0 usually indicates a company has both value and growth.But Victoria's Secret itself even sees a challenging environment for the rest of 2023. Investors might want to stay on the sidelines until earnings turn around.Additional content:3 Housing Stocks to Buy on Bullish Homebuilders’ SentimentAn uptick in raw materials coupled with higher mortgage rates has impacted housing activity for quite some time. However, for the first time in almost a year, homebuilders’ sentiment about the housing market has turned bullish, thanks to strong housing demand.The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)/ Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI) jumped five points to 55 in June, indicating that builders are feeling good about the newly built single-family housing market. The NAHB Index moved above the midpoint of 50 for the first time in 11 months, while sentiment among builders improved for the sixth successive month.The NAHB Index’s, June reading of 55, in reality, was the strongest since July 2022 as steady improvements in supply chains and low levels of inventory boost builders’ confidence. Further, the NAHB index’s readings on current and future sales conditions in the housing market also improved. Home builders, at present, have begun to curtail sales incentives, a tell-tale sign that demand for single-family homes is increasing.And with the Federal Reserve almost nearing the end of its tightening cycle, the future of the housing market certainly looks brighter. This is because a pause in interest rate hikes will make it easier to purchase physical properties, which won’t be expensive.Meanwhile, housing starts have picked up pace in the country despite economic headwinds, added the U.S. Census Bureau. Housing starts soared by 21.7% in May, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) of 1.63 million units, with both multifamily and single-family starts ticking up.Construction of single-family homes picked up pace mostly in the Midwest region, as the weather warmed up. Building permits for single-family homes also increased 5.2% last month. Thus, with homebuilder sentiment improving, and builders ramping up the construction of single-family homes, housing stocks like PulteGroup, Lennar, and Toll Brothers are well-poised to benefit in the near term.These stocks flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). The search was also narrowed down with a VGM Score of A or B. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum, and the score is a weighted combination of these three metrics. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.PulteGroup is primarily involved in homebuilding activities in the United States. PHM aims to increase its investment in land acquisition and development initiatives mostly due to strong buyer demand, and an uptick in construction activities.PHM, currently, has a Zacks Rank #1 and a VGM Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up almost 23.9% over the past 60 days. PHM’s expected earnings growth rate for the next five-year period is 16%.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up almost 2% over the past 60 days. LEN’s expected earnings growth rate for the next five-year period is 6%. Its shares have already gained 29.6% in the past five-year period.Toll Brothers primarily build single-family homes in the United States.

She joined the Army in 2002 because she wanted to follow in her family's footsteps and to defend her country. After serving for 14 years, including three deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, Sergeant Calmese was honorably discharged in January 2016 with a 100% service-connected injury rating.During her years of service and deployments to war zones, including deployment to Baghdad in 2003 during the first stage of the Iraq War, she was involved in many combat situations that attributed to her injuries. On one of the convoys, her unit came under attack by enemy fire, and she was thrown in the 5-ton truck, which caused her to sustain major injuries to her back and knees. On that same deployment, Sergeant Calmese lost her very good friend from high school in a firefight, which resulted in her having PTSD symptoms. As a result of years of service, she has been rated as totally and permanently disabled by the Department of Veterans Affairs.For her service, Sergeant Calmese has been awarded several military honors, including the Afghanistan Campaign Medal W/ 2 Campaign Stars, Army Commendation Medal (2nd Award), Army Achievement Medal (2 Award), Meritorious Unit Commendation, Army Good Conduct Medal (4th Award), National Defense Service Medal, Global War On Terrorism Service Medal, and Iraq Campaign Medal W/ Campaign Star.About Built to Honor®For the last decade, PulteGroup’s Built to Honor® program has recognized and thanked returning military personnel who have been injured during their term of service by providing mortgage-free homes to veterans and their families.

Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Merck is expected to post earnings of $1.85 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.95 points to a change of -7.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.46 indicates a change of +21.7% from what Merck is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Merck is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Merck, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $14.42 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -1.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $58.79 billion and $62.71 billion estimates indicate -0.8% and +6.7% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMerck reported revenues of $14.49 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -8.9%. EPS of $1.40 for the same period compares with $2.14 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.84 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.65%. The EPS surprise was +4.48%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Merck is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Merck. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

""But it depends on the performance this year also."" (Reporting by Devjyot Ghoshal; Editing by Susan Fenton)]"

They are the code that gives every instruction to our bodies about how to move, digest and think. So understanding those genes can be critical to understanding our own health. It’s no wonder that the clinical sequencing market is expected to have a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.6% through 2032. With such growth comes profits, and some of the best biotech stocks to buy right now are already building the future of gene testing.Ever since the human genome project was completed in 2003, gene testing companies have leveraged its success to bring genetic screening and personalized medicine to the masses. Gene testing can not only determine your susceptibility to a number of diseases and conditions but also tell you which drugs would best treat your conditions. This had led to a revolution in medicine, and it’s no accident that many high-growth health stocks of the past few decades have been involved with gene testing.Modern gene testing companies are now serving more than just individual customers. They can also leverage their data to provide a better understanding of diseases and drug targets. This makes them key players in the pharmacology industry, as their data is worth big money to big pharma.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAdd to that the continued growth of the gene testing industry as a whole and the future of gene testing looks bright. Here are three of the best gene testing stocks to play the trend.23andMe (ME)A close-up shot of the saliva collection kit from 23andMe.Source: nevodka / Shutterstock.com23andMe (NASDAQ:ME) started as and may be best known for its direct-to-consumer genetic kits. But the company has grown into so much more. The company has managed to bring its health and genomic data into drug partnerships as well.In 2018, for example, 23andMe entered into a multiyear partnership with GSK PLC (NYSE:GSK). Under that agreement, GSK gained access to 23andMe’s data, which included not only the results of genetic tests sold to consumers but also health information provided by the consumers. This genetic and survey information allowed GSK to study and develop new drug targets.Story continuesThat partnership is coming to an end, but there is room for new partnerships to take its place. 23andMe has a unique opportunity as its genetic and survey information brings more data to the table than genetic results alone. Biologically speaking, 23andMe has not only genotypic data but also phenotypic data from the survey information. And that is a powerful tool for understanding how our genes affect our health and our reactions to drugs. Both are important questions that biologists are still trying to answer.In terms of financial outlook, 23andMe remains a speculative play. For fiscal 2023, which ended March 31, the company generated $300 million in revenue, up 10% from the year prior. However, it reported a net loss of $312 million, up from a $217 million loss in fiscal 2022.  And with cash and cash equivalents of just $387 million, 23andMe will likely need financing from debt or selling equity. So investors should be on the lookout for dilution.That said, investors should also be on the lookout for new partnerships, which could provide an upside catalyst for shares. The combined information of 23andMe is a true godsend for researchers. And a path to profitability would make them one of the hottest biotech stocks to own.Myriad GeneticsBiochemical/biotech research scientist team working with microscopeSource: Mongkolchon Akesin / Shutterstock.comMyriad Genetics (NASDAQ:MYGN) is a leader in the field of genetic testing and personalized medicine. However, it is perhaps most famous for its 2013 legal setbacks. The company attempted to patent two human genes for use in cancer screening. But the Supreme Court ruled against its gene-patenting practices and broke its monopoly on certain cancer tests.The company has rebounded strongly from these setbacks, though, and has continued on as a much more ethical leader in genetic testing and screening. For example, Myriad partnered with Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) to provide homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) testing, a crucial test in cancer treatment decision-making. It also partnered with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in utilizing circulating tumor DNA to study metastatic cancers.These partnerships and others are key to Myriad’s continued growth. By harnessing genetic insights and collaborations, Myriad has positioned itself to deliver improved patient outcomes. As our aging population requires ever more cancer screening and testing, this places Myriad as a leader in the future of gene testing.Financially, Myriad is improving as well. On May 23, MYGN stock received a double upgrade from Goldman Sachs following the company’s latest earnings report. The analysts raised their rating on shares to “buy” from “sell” and upped their price target by $7 to $25, implying upside of 9% from the current level. The analysts also raised their growth forecasts for 2024 to 2025.While Myriad posted a first-quarter net loss of $54 million, revenue increased by 10% year over year to $181.2 million. If the company can continue to grow revenue, it will have a path to profits and share price appreciation.Illumina (ILMN)Illumina (ILMN) logo displayed on reddish stone facade building against blue sky backgroundSource: shutterstock.com/JHVEPhotoIn the world of gene testing stocks, Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) is the shovel salesman. The company provides the kits and instruments needed to perform modern gene testing. And its instruments provide longer reads of the genome, allowing greater coverage and potentially higher accuracy of the reads. The human genome isn’t read as a single long strand, it has to be broken up into smaller pieces that are read and put back together. Illumina’s longer reads simplify that process immensely compared to its competitors.Yet, it hasn’t exactly been a smooth ride for the company or its shareholders in recent years.  In 2021, Illumina sought to acquire cancer detection company GRAIL. But it has since been ordered to divest from the acquisition by the Federal Trade Commission. Although former Chief Executives Officer (CEO) Francis deSouza continued to pursue the acquisition, he was strongly opposed by activist investor Carl Icahn.Icahn seems to have won the fight, however, as deSouza is stepping down. And with the GRAIL/Icahn drama hopefully behind them, Illumina can move forward with its core business, buoyed by the continued rise of the genetic testing market.Financially, Illumina’s most recent earnings report shows revenue of $1.1 billion and net income of $3 million, both of which decreased from a year ago. Whoever replaces deSouza will be doing so at a pivotal time, hoping to turn the ship around.But this also presents a great opportunity for investors. Illumina’s products are some of the most trusted in industry and academia. If a new CEO can right the ship, then Illumina can once again take its place as one of the best gene testing stocks to buy.On the date of publication, John Blankenhorn did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Moreover, redevelopment and technology initiatives, and solid balance sheet bode well for the company’s long-term growth despite a high interest rate environment and elevated supply in certain markets.MAA’s well-diversified Sunbelt-focused portfolio is set to gain from healthy operating fundamentals. The pandemic has accelerated employment shifts and a population inflow into the company’s markets, as renters seek more business-friendly, low-taxed and low-density cities. These favorable longer-term secular dynamic trends are increasing the desirability of its markets.Also, the high pricing of single-family ownership units amid a high interest rate environment continues to drive the demand for rental apartments. Given these factors, MAA is well-poised to capture demand recovery for residential apartments, aiding leasing activities. Our projection for average physical occupancy for 2023 is 95.8%. Additionally, the company is expected to witness year-over-year top-line growth of 6.2% for the current year.MAA has been implementing its three internal investment programs — interior redevelopment, property repositioning projects and Smart Home installations. The programs will help the company capture the upside potential in rent growth, generate accretive returns and boost earnings from its existing asset base.Along with healthy operating fundamentals of the Sunbelt markets and a robust development pipeline, the prospects of the company’s redevelopment program and progress in technology measures are likely to drive margin expansion. We expect same-store net operating income to grow 6.4% for 2023 and 7.7% for 2024.MAA also enjoys a solid balance sheet, with low leverage and ample availability under its revolving credit facility. As of Mar 31, 2023, MAA had a strong balance sheet with $1.4 billion in combined cash and capacity available under its unsecured revolving credit facility. It generated 95.1% unencumbered NOI in the first quarter of 2023, providing the scope for tapping additional secured debt capital if required.Moreover, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticements for REIT shareholders and MAA remains committed to that. In the last five years, MAA has increased its dividend six times and its five-year annualized dividend growth rate is 6.80%.However, a high interest rate environment is concerning for MAA. Elevated rates imply a high borrowing cost for the company, which will affect its ability to purchase or develop real estate. Moreover, the dividend payout may become less attractive than yields on fixed income and money market accounts due to high interest rates.Additionally, the struggle to attract renters will persist as supply volumes are expected to remain elevated in some markets. Management expects this phenomenon to put some pressure on rent growth in 2023. Moreover, real estate taxes and insurance costs are expected to produce significant cost pressure. Reflecting these, we expect total property operating expenses to increase 5.6% for 2023.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 5.5% over the past three months compared with industry’s rise of 13.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 funds from operations (FFO) per share has increased marginally over the past two month to $9.15.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are Elme Communities ELME, and BRT Apartments BRT.

This change outpaced the S&amp;P 500's 0.37% gain on the day. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.01%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 1.26%.Coming into today, shares of the health insurer had gained 9.64% in the past month. In that same time, the Finance sector gained 3.13%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 4.31%.Investors will be hoping for strength from Cigna as it approaches its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $6.03, down 3.05% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $47.13 billion, up 3.74% from the year-ago period.CI's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $24.81 per share and revenue of $188.88 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +6.62% and +4.56%, respectively.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Cigna should also be noted by investors. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988.

Cigna is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).In terms of valuation, Cigna is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 11.04. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 8.73, which means Cigna is trading at a premium to the group.Story continuesWe can also see that CI currently has a PEG ratio of 0.99.

Earlier this year, Lockheed was selected by the U.S. Army’s Aviation and Missile Center to develop LRMF missiles.The significance of LRMF missiles lies in their capability to neutralize targets way beyond the present capacity of the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) baseline. Aerojet Rocketdyne’s propulsion solution will play a key role in extending the missile range. Extension of the missile range will provide an edge to defense personnel in offensive operations.The development of the LRMF missiles will take place in multiple phases. In the first phase of the program, Lockheed and its team will concentrate on the design and risk-reduction activities.Missiles Play a Crucial Role in Modern WarfareMissiles are tactical weapons that have virtually changed the concept of modern warfare. The countries that have advanced missiles and missile defense systems have an added advantage on the battlefield.Aerospace and defense operators and governments across the globe are trying to develop more advanced missiles with the capacity to strike targets at ranges of several thousand miles.More research and development work is going into increasing the reliability and accuracy of the missiles to hit targets precisely at long distances.Expanding Global Missile MarketPer MarketsandMarkets research report, the global Rockets and Missile Markets is expected to expand from $58.3 billion in 2021 to $73.8 billion in 2026. The primary reason behind the expansion of the missile market is the consistent increase in defense budgets as nations become more focused on creating a strong missile system.Other major defense operators involved in the development of missiles of different types and benefiting from the rising demand are Northrop Grumman Corporation NOC, Raytheon Technologies RTX and General Dynamics Corporation GD, each carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The long term (three- to five-year) earnings growth rate of Northrop Grumman, Raytheon Technologies and General Dynamics is pegged at 3.8%, 8.3% and 8.9%, respectively.The stable performance of these companies is also reflected in their respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. For 2023, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of Northrop Grumman and Raytheon Technologies reflects an increase of 2.5% and 0.6%, respectively, in the past 60 days. For 2023, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for General Dynamics reflects a year-over-year increase of 3.9%.Story continuesPrice PerformanceShares of Aerojet Rocketdyne have soared 40.2% in the past year compared with the industry’s growth of 11.3%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankAerojet Rocketdyne Holdings currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.

191,26e17d3f-66f1-3be4-adf2-ef52d8ba34e5,NKE,2023-06-23,Analysts Estimate Nike (NKE) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-nike-nke-report-140006197.html,1687442406,STORY,['NKE'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Nike (NKE) reports results for the quarter ended May 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on June 29. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis athletic apparel maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.67 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -25.6%.Revenues are expected to be $12.57 billion, up 2.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.65% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Nike?For Nike, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.50%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Nike will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Nike would post earnings of $0.52 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.79, delivering a surprise of +51.92%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Nike doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Eggs, chicken over sirloin steak.",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/july-4th-bbq-will-cost-you-more-again-advice-eggs-chicken-over-sirloin-steak-153006072.html,1687447806,STORY,['WFC'],"[The traditional July 4th barbecue is once again going to cost you more this year, according to the latest report from Wells Fargo. Here's the deal: The price of sirloin steak, for instance, is up 2.9% compared with the same time last year, Wells Fargo (WFC) said, citing the Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) May Consumer Price Index (CPI). That's a big-ticket item for Americans at $10.75 per pound. The good news: That's far less than July 4th, 2022, BBQ season, when sirloin steak jumped 14% in May compared to the same time in 2021.You might get a better deal with hamburgers, per Wells Fargo. Ground beef is up less than 1% with an average cost of $5.36 per pound.Pork and chicken are also in the bang-for-your-buck category. Pork is up only 1%, coming in at $4.19 per pound. The cost of chicken breasts, on the other hand, saw prices actually decline, down 2% on a year-over-year basis, costing Americans $4.24 per pound.""If you want to stretch the food dollar, chicken is going to be the protein that's going to let you really make that happen,"" Wells Fargo agricultural economist Michael Swanson told Yahoo Finance.Another bargain: eggs. Think egg salad, potato salad, and deviled eggs. Swanson called egg prices ""a remarkable reversal in that volatility.""As of May 2023, the cost of a dozen large grade-A eggs was $2.67, 7% lower than a year ago. That's also compared to $4.82 back in January of this year, Swanson added, ""The Avian Influenza shock has just about left the stage.""Toppings? They'll cost more too.The cheese for your Fourth of July cheeseburger costs 10% more than last year with an average price of $4.77 per pound. Hamburger and hot dog buns? The news isn't good for roll fans — flour costs 22% more going into July 4th. As of May this year, bread per pound costs $1.95. (A year ago: $1.61.)What's behind the higher prices? Swanson said it's the ""driver who rushes them from the bakery to the store when they're still fresh.""Story continues""It's really been a lot about labor and that transportation cost, which has really been tough on them [companies], but it is very, very sticky...""On the side, potato chips cost more year-over-year, up 15% from this time last year, coming in at $6.45 per pound. Back in May 2022, the same amount cost consumers $5.62 per pound. The reason behind the jump, Swanson said, is the drought in Idaho and the Dakotas last year that led to ""record high potato prices. Prices we've never even seen before.""Meanwhile, If you're topping off your meal with dessert — and who isn't — prices won't be sweet.A pound of chocolate chip cookies costs Americans $5.15. That's about 14% higher than in May of last year.Ice cream is also feeling the impact of inflation, up 9% from a year ago, with an average price of $5.81 for a half gallon. High future contracts made by companies is the reason behind the higher price, ""They're dealing with the fact that they had to contract the butter, fat that goes into that ice cream... [about] three months ago, to make sure that it was ready to go for the Fourth of July,"" said Swanson.Pre-inflation (no wonder they're smiling): a BBQ in Pennsylvania July 4, 2020. (Getty Images). (MediaNews Group/Reading Eagle via Getty Images via Getty Images)Drinks haven't escaped the wrath of inflation, largely because packaging, particularly aluminum, is driving up the cost of canned sodas and beer. For instance, a 12-ounce soft drink currently costs $0.54, up 14% from last year, while beer prices spiked 8% to $1.75 per pint. (Advice to save money: Grab a bottle of Barefoot rosé wine and make sangria for your guests over canned, ready-to-drink beers and cocktails.)Relief should be on the way soon though, slowly. Earlier this month, the White House published a blog post saying that it expects, ""grocery inflation to continue improving alongside headline inflation but remain elevated relative to its pre-pandemic levels through the rest of 2023.""In other words, things should be better in time for BBQ season next year.—Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

This particular strain made up about 40% of all Covid cases in the United States in early June, making it one of the most immune-evasive variants to date, per CDC data, as quoted on CNBC.Advanced Development for In-Time RolloutAmid pressures to distribute new shots by fall, Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax had already begun developing versions of their vaccines targeting XBB.1.5 months before the FDA's decision. Preliminary data presented by these companies indicates that their vaccines produce strong immune responses against all XBB variants.Focus on Commercial MarketWith fall moving closer, the United States plans to shift Covid vaccine distribution to the private sector, with the federal government's supply of free shots expected to be over. Pfizer and Moderna see this change as a chance to tap more distribution channels than they did under government contracts. This move also strengthens their position in the commercial market.FDA Move is Crucial for NovavaxFor Novavax, the commercial market is vital for its survival in 2023 and beyond. The company lagged its competitors in receiving U.S. approval for its Covid vaccine. It won only last year under emergency use. Now, with the FDA's strain specification, Novavax can pose decent competition to its Covid-19 vaccine peers Pfizer and Moderna.Vaccine Hesitancy to Weigh on Revenues?Despite the production of vaccines’ fall versions, Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax have varying revenue expectations for their Covid vaccines. Pfizer apprehends a weakening in sales due to less reliance on vaccines. Vaccine hesitancy continues to be a challenge.Against this mixed backdrop, investors may follow the biotech and pharma ETFs closely.ETFs in FocusPfizer has considerable exposure to First Trust Nasdaq Pharmaceuticals ETF FTXH, Invesco Dynamic Pharmaceuticals ETF PJP and Horizon Kinetics Medical ETF MEDX.

On that day, General Motors Company is projected to report earnings of $1.64 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 43.86%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $41.7 billion, up 16.62% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $6.84 per share and revenue of $163.85 billion.

Power Initial Quality Study. Interestingly, these results come despite the study showing overall quality of new vehicles deteriorating over time.This year’s J.D. Power study polled 93,380 buyers and lessees of new 2023 model-year cars in the US, using a survey that tracks nine different vehicle categories like infotainment, features, powertrain, and driving experience. Based on a problems-per-100 vehicle (PP100) metric, the study found that Dodge was the highest-ranking brand overall in initial quality with a score of 140, with Ram (141) ranking a close second and Alfa Romeo third (143). GM’s Buick (162) and Chevrolet (166) rounded out the top 5.The overall trend as noted by J.D. Power, however, was a rising number of complaints overall, with technology issues the main culprit.""The automotive industry is facing a wide range of quality problems, a phenomenon not seen in the 37-year history of the [study],"" said Frank Hanley, J.D. Power senior director of auto benchmarking, in a statement. ""From persistent problems carrying over from years past to an increase in new types of problems, today’s new vehicles are more complex—offering new and exciting technology—but not always satisfying owners.""The key findings from the survey found among other things that vehicle basics— like door handle functionality – were increasingly problematic, safety systems like collision warnings were causing hiccups, and wireless smartphone charging could be hit and miss. But in other areas owners were happier with features like smartphone apps that could connect with the car.Rankings across the spectrum… and TeslaJ.D. Power's overall brand rankings for 2023 model year vehicles (J.D. Power)Looking across premium and luxury brands, which typically suffer more from quality issues due to reliance on new technology and advanced features, the aforementioned Alfa Romeo tops the quality rankings, followed by Porsche (167) and Cadillac (170).Story continuesAt the bottom of the overall rankings list were Tesla (257) and Polestar (313), which both ranked well below the industry average of 192; however, J.D. Power says both of these brands were not ""rank eligible"" because the brands did not meet the study’s award criteria. This is because Tesla and Polestar did not grant J.D. Power permission to survey its owners in states where authorization is required.The scores for Tesla and Polestar were calculated based on a sample of surveys from owners in the other states, J.D. Power said. With that caveat in mind, J.D. Power found that Tesla’s score increased (or worsened) by 31, while Polestar’s improved by 15.Carlos Tavares, Chief Executive Officer of Stellantis, left, and Mike Koval, RAM Brand Chief Executive Officer, introduces the REV Ram 1500 at the New York International Auto Show in New York Wednesday, April 5, 2023.

Power said Lucid (340) and Rivian (282) were included in the overall industry calculations for the first time, but the two automakers’ sales were too small a sample size to be award-eligible.Looking deeper into the models themselves, across the automakers GM cars received the most awards (seven), followed by Hyundai (five) and Toyota (four). Among the individual brands, Chevrolet and Kia received the most segment awards at four each.

214,e8cb9f63-408e-35a3-bb98-0d4f5ae4bd58,MKC,2023-06-23,McCormick (MKC) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mccormick-mkc-earnings-expected-grow-140007664.html,1687442407,STORY,"['GIS', 'MKC-V']","[McCormick (MKC) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended May 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on June 29, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis spices and seasonings company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.57 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +18.8%.Revenues are expected to be $1.67 billion, up 8.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for McCormick?For McCormick, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +4.43%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that McCormick will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that McCormick would post earnings of $0.49 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.59, delivering a surprise of +20.41%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.McCormick appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Food - Miscellaneous industry, General Mills (GIS) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.05 per share for the quarter ended May 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -6.3%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $5.17 billion, up 5.7% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for General Mills has been revised 0.2% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 1.91%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that General Mills will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company expects sales in the range of $5.086-$5.141 billion, suggesting a rise of 5.8-7.0% year over year. FLO earlier projected sales in the band of $5.176-$5.242 billion, implying a rise of 7.7-9.1% year over year.Adjusted EBITDA is likely to be in the range of $494-$528 million compared with the earlier view of around $513-$543 million. For fiscal 2023, the adjusted EPS is envisioned in the range of $1.15-$1.25 compared with the $1.20-$1.30 band projected earlier.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCost &amp; Margin PressureIn the first quarter of fiscal 2023, materials, supplies, labor and other production costs (excluding depreciation and amortization) escalated by 170 basis points (bps) to 52.2% of sales on rising input cost inflation.

(ISRG) is a Trending Stock",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-intuitive-surgical-130007037.html,1687438807.0,STORY,['ISRG'],"[Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (ISRG) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this company have returned +7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.3% change. The Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, to which Intuitive Surgical, Inc. belongs, has gained 2.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is expected to post earnings of $1.32 per share, indicating a change of +15.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.47 points to a change of +16.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.35 indicates a change of +16.2% from what Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Intuitive Surgical, Inc.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Intuitive Surgical, Inc. the consensus sales estimate of $1.73 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +13.8%. The $7.11 billion and $8.06 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +14.3% and +13.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryIntuitive Surgical, Inc. reported revenues of $1.7 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14%. EPS of $1.23 for the same period compares with $1.13 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.59 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.88%. The EPS surprise was +3.36%.Over the last four quarters, Intuitive Surgical, Inc. surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

The conversion work will be done at CSX’s Huntington, West Virginia locomotive shop.“This innovative collaboration expands our hydrogen locomotive program beyond a single railroad and represents an exciting next step in proving the long-term viability of hydrogen as a solution to emissions reduction for our industry,” said Keith Creel, CPKC president and chief executive officer. “Our hydrogen locomotive went from concept to reality in 24 months with the first zero emissions hydrogen locomotive having already pulled freight in revenue service. We look forward to this collaboration as we work to create a lower carbon future.”“CSX looks forward to working as a partner with CPKC in the development of the hydrogen locomotive program as it demonstrates our commitment to implementing alternative fuel solutions that could further enhance our emissions performance and offer our customers an even more environmentally-friendly transportation solution,” said Joe Hinrichs, CSX president and chief executive officer. “This exciting initiative will greatly benefit from the expertise of CSX’s advanced, large-scale facilities, where the locomotives will be built.”Nearly the entire freight locomotive fleet of all railway operators in North America consists of diesel-powered units, representing the industry's most significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. Rail has an important role to play in a lower carbon economy and the industry needs a long-term, effective alternative fuel solution.Story continuesIn December 2020, Canadian Pacific (CP) announced plans to develop North America’s first line-haul hydrogen-powered locomotive by retrofitting a diesel freight locomotive with hydrogen fuel cells and battery technology to drive the locomotive's electric traction motors. The prototype, designed and built by in-house CP engineers, made its first movement under its own power in late 2021. By the end of 2022, the locomotive had made its first revenue moves and now has accumulated more than 1,000 miles of testing in revenue service.CPKC has deployed a second hydrogen locomotive for testing in terminal operations, a program expansion supported by funding awarded by Emissions Reduction Alberta and the Government of Canada Low Carbon Economy Fund. The second hydrogen locomotive is expected to enter service later in 2023.Forward looking information This news release includes certain forward-looking statements and forward looking information (collectively, “FLI”) within the meaning of applicable securities laws in both the U.S. and Canada.

Market participants are currently divided on whether the rally can resume in the near future or whether Wall Street will again witness rangebound trading. The Fed Chairman testified before the U.S. Congress that bringing down inflation to a controllable level is a long way to go, and more interest rate hikes are likely by the end of this year.The consumer discretionary sector has flourished so far in 2023. This sector is generally recognized as being growth-oriented. Notably, growth sectors are highly sensitive to the movement of market interest rate and are inversely related.The consumer discretionary sector suffered a big blow in 2022 as the Fed pursued an aggressive interest rate hike and tighter monetary control policy in order to control the 40-year high inflation. However, the magnitude of rate hike has reduced to quite an extent in 2023 as the inflation rate has declined steadily from its peak in June 2022.  Moreover, in the June FOMC meeting, the Fed paused rate hike after 10 consecutive increases.Year to date, the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY) — one of the 11 broad-sector ETFs of the S&amp;P 500 Index — has rallied 28%. Despite more rate hike threats, a handful of consumer discretionary stocks look promising at this stage.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five consumer discretionary stocks that have solid potential for the rest of 2023.

236,b1a588e9-c5de-3ff9-bb6a-3993e21807f5,RF,2023-06-23,Improve Your Retirement Income with These 3 Top-Ranked Dividend Stocks,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/improve-retirement-income-3-top-131003146.html,1687439403,STORY,"['RF', 'BMY']","[Here's a revealing data point: older Americans are scared more of outliving wealth than of death itself.Also, retirees who have constructed a nest egg have valid justifications to be concerned, since the traditional ways to plan for retirement may mean income can no longer cover expenses. Some retirees are now tapping their principal to make a decent living, pressed for time between decreasing investment balances and longer life expectancies.In today's economic environment, traditional income investments are not working.For many years, bonds or other fixed-income assets could produce the yield needed to provide solid income for retirement needs. However, these yields have dwindled over time: 10-year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s were around 6.50%, but today, that rate is a thing of the past, with a slim likelihood of rates making a comeback in the foreseeable future.While this yield reduction may not seem drastic, it adds up: for a $1 million investment in 10-year Treasuries, the rate drop means a difference in yield of more than $1 million.And lower bond yields aren't the only potential problem seniors are facing. Today's retirees aren't feeling as secure as they once did about Social Security, either. Benefit checks will still be coming for the foreseeable future, but based on current estimates, Social Security funds will run out of money in 2035.So what can retirees do? You could dramatically reduce your expenses, and go out on a limb hoping your Social Security benefits don't diminish. On the other hand, you could opt for an alternative investment that gives a steady, higher-rate income stream to supplant lessening bond yields.Invest in Dividend StocksDividend-paying stocks from low-risk, high-quality companies are a smart way to generate steady and reliable attractive income streams to replace low risk, low yielding Treasury and bond options.Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.Story continuesA rule of thumb for finding solid income-producing stocks is to seek those that average 3% dividend yield, and positive yearly dividend growth. These stocks can help combat inflation by boosting dividends over time.Here are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.57 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.48%. This compares to the Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry's yield of 0% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.68%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 5.56%. Check Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Regions Financial (RF) is paying out a dividend of $0.2 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 4.52% compared to the Banks - Southeast industry's yield of 2.76% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 17.65% over the past year. Check Regions Financial (RF) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $0.1 per share, TIM S.A. Sponsored ADR (TIMB) has a dividend yield of 3.91%. This is compared to the Wireless Non-US industry's yield of 0.11% and the S&amp;P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 23.45%. Check TIM S.A. Sponsored ADR (TIMB) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?It is true that stocks, as an asset class, carry more risk than bonds, but high-quality dividend stocks not only have the ability to produce income growth over time but more importantly, can also reduce your overall portfolio volatility relative to the broader stock market.Combating the impact of inflation is one advantage of owning these dividend-paying stocks. Here's why: many of these stable, high-quality companies increase their dividends over time, which translates to rising dividend income that offsets the effects of inflation.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.If you're thinking, ""I want to invest in a dividend-focused ETF or mutual fund,"" make sure to do your homework. It's important to know that some mutual funds and specialized ETFs charge high fees, which may diminish your dividend gains or income and thwart the overall objective of this investment strategy. If you do want to invest in fund, research well to identify the best-quality dividend funds with the least charges.Bottom LineRegardless of whether you select high-quality, low-fee funds or stocks, looking for a steady stream of income from dividend-paying equities can potentially lead you to a solid and more peaceful retirement.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: American Woodmark AMWD, GIII Apparel Group GIII, Marriott International MAR and Playtika PLTK.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:4 Big Winners as Americans Go on a Spending SpreeAmericans are feeling optimistic about the current state of the economy, and aren’t disconcerted by a pending recession. This is because consumer outlays are still strong, with sales at U.S. retailers rising in May despite economic challenges.Retail sales that account for one-third of consumer outlays slowed down last year. However, a strong labor market and retailers’ initiatives to offer a wide product mix at a competitive price helped sales improve, pointing to a resilient economy.Sales at U.S. retailers increased by 0.3% in May from April and registered a year-over-year increase of 1.6%, per the U.S. Census Bureau. Additionally, the National Retail Federation stated that retail sales have gone up 0.4% in May from April, and were up 4.4% year over year, per their calculations.Sales in most of the retail categories improved, led by healthcare stores, grocery stores, furniture stores, and even online sales. Consumers, in reality, increased spending on all kinds of services, including restaurants, hotel stays, and flights. This is because more jobs were added to the U.S. economy, and the unemployment rate continues to hover at historic low levels.The U.S. jobs market shrugged off all kinds of headwinds, including the debt ceiling crisis, banking turmoil, elevated inflation, and an aggressive Federal Reserve (read more: 5 Stocks to Gain From Stunning Jobs Growth in May).What’s more, the consumer outlook for the month of June looks even more positive. Easing of travel restrictions due to the official end of the coronavirus pandemic, coupled with lower gas prices, encouraged many Americans to travel in summer. Simultaneously, the Fed’s pause on interest rate hikes in its latest policy meeting held in June is expected to boost consumer spending.Story continuesThus, courtesy of an uptick in household spending, consumer discretionary companies are positioned to gain the most as outlays play a pivotal role in shaping their revenues.We have, thus, selected four consumer discretionary stocks that flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). The search was also narrowed down with a VGM Score of A or B. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth, and M for Momentum, and the score is a weighted combination of these three metrics.

VZ successfully conducted a field demonstration of its network slicing capabilities in a commercial 5G environment. Network slicing facilitates the creation of multiple virtual networks on a shared physical network and allows operators to offer parts of the same network to different customers based on their use cases. Each network slice is individually configured with its own security measures and latency settings, customized to meet the dynamic requirements of various types of applications.For instance, the network requirement for loT devices differs from smartphone applications. Automobile navigation, multiplayer online gaming or various AR/VR devices demand varying levels of network capabilities.By leveraging cloud-native virtualized applications on the 5G standalone core, integrated with AI and ML, operators can allocate network resources in an efficient manner. Network slicing ensures effective utilization of resources, reduces expenses and boosts operational efficiency.In the recently conducted test, a commercial 5G smartphone was employed with a combination of virtualized and non-virtualized RAN equipment and Verizon's 5G standalone core. This trial comprehensively assessed end-to-end data transmission capability on a virtual network slice by validating the optimum functionality of the device chipset, operating system, application, radio network base station and the network core.Verizon’s cloud-based virtualized standalone core will be available for 5G network scaling compatible devices. This deployment will bring remarkable enhancements to network performance, and ensure unprecedented levels of service agility, flexibility and automated scalability.Verizon is witnessing significant 5G adoption and fixed wireless broadband momentum. The telecom giant plans to accelerate the availability of its 5G Ultra-Wideband network nationwide. The company’s growth strategy includes 5G mobility, nationwide broadband and mobile edge compute and business solutions.Verizon is building the entire network infrastructure and ecosystem to provide customers with the most amazing 5G experience.

These upgrades are part of a multi-year redesign of its network architecture to stay ahead of exponential data usage increases, upgrade the technology in the network, and to pave the way for personalized customer experiences. Network upgrades in Buffalo include deploying new cell sites to extend coverage and capacity in local communities. They also include adding more capacity on fiber optic cables to move more data through the network and adding bandwidth to the cellular network to accommodate new services like wireless internet service for homes and businesses. Specifics on the upgrades include:Engineers have deployed 5G Ultra Wideband service using Millimeter Wave (mmWave), its premium, high-band spectrum which allows for extremely fast speeds and massive capacity as well as C-band spectrum designed for fast speeds, high capacity and wide coverage. With the recent deployments and upgrades, more than 1.1 million people in Buffalo now have access to 5G service from Verizon. Verizon Engineers have deployed 5G Ultra Wideband service using its C-band spectrum designed for high capacity and wide coverage. Most notably, Verizon’s 5G Ultra Wideband service has recently expanded to areas near Niagara Falls, Key Bank Arena, New Era Stadium, SUNY Fredonia, Chautauqua County Fairgrounds, portions of the NYS Thruway, throughout the town of Dunkirk, and throughout Marshfield, specifically improving intersection of New York State Route 75 and 448 as well as the intersection of NYS Route 75 and Marshfield Road.Buffalo’s exceptional 5G coverage uses a combination of mmWave spectrum and Verizon’s recently acquired C-band spectrum. Verizon engineers are using between 60-100 MHz of C-band spectrum to deliver 5G service to customers. By the end of the year, customers in Buffalo will be able to take advantage of nearly twice that amount of spectrum as it becomes available for 5G Ultra Wideband. That additional bandwidth will turbo charge the service, offering significantly higher speeds, much greater capacity to accommodate more customers and more robust servicesLastly, the addition of 5G service and the many additional wireless solutions allow far more data to travel on the wireless network in Buffalo. That exponential increase in data carried into and out of the cell sites serving the community requires upgraded fiber optic cable links.  Fiber optic cables are used to move data between cell sites and connect those sites to the rest of the network. Verizon has increased the capacity on the fiber connections in many cell sites in the Buffalo area so they can carry 10 times the amount of data.Story continues“We know customers count on us, and we work everyday to ensure we deliver for them. Our reliable, secure network connects families, friends, homes and businesses in Buffalo, NY with best-in-class 5G Ultra Wideband technology,” said Kevin Smith, Vice President of Engineering and Operations for Verizon.With these and other technology advancements on Verizon’s network, customers are able to use more data in more ways. This multi-service network powers:Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices that do very little networking and stay in place,smartphones with countless opportunities to use data in a highly mobile environment,home and business internet which provides connectivity via the wireless network for homes, offices and retail environments, andcomplex solutions like Augmented Reality or enterprise real-time video and data analysis that require massive computing capabilities.As 5G technology advances and is even more widely adopted by consumers the variety of solutions that will use Verizon’s network will continue to evolve as well.Buffalo, NY customers have the best experience on Verizon’s networkThe recent network upgrades have led to customers having the best experience on the Verizon network in Buffalo, NY, according to the nation’s most rigorous scientific testing company RootMetrics®. In the most recent test measuring performance of major wireless carriers throughout Buffalo, Verizon came in first place for overall network performance, and in fact was unbeaten in every single category measured including reliability, accessibility, speed and call, text and data performance. Today’s results show great speeds for Verizon customers in Buffalo with Verizon’s median download speed increasing 65% and media upload speeds increasing 30% since last year in the market.*Services from the network customers rely onFor customers in Buffalo, the additional coverage and capacity means more customers now have access not only to reliable, fast mobile service, but also Verizon Home Internet service, a different kind of home internet with no data caps.

My goal was to describe both the 40% jump in annual sales forecasts this quarter and the multi-trillion dollar TAM (total addressable market) of AI applications that NVIDIA is serving, which justifies those revenue projections.I’ll share much of those details here, plus follow-up by providing more color on where the leap in sales forecasts is coming from: the DGX servers which are used to build the “massively parallel architectures” for AI workloads.The video attached to this article explains what a DGX “box” is, how it works, and the evolution of configurations that make them sell for between $100,000 and $150,000.In 2018 at the Gamescom conference in Cologne, Germany, CEO Jensen Huang joked that you could buy the first generation DGX server -- with 8 Tesla Volta GPUs capable of 1 PetaFLOPS (1 quadrillion floating-point operations per second) -- for “just 3,000 easy payments of $19.95.”Below I will share links to the NVIDIA AI experts and partners that I profiled in today’s video who break down the power of the DGX “superpods.”The Valuation DebateFirst, here’s a quick intro to the controversy…As NVIDIA cruised into the stratosphere of $1 trillion valuations, one of the most common remarks heard across business and social media was “Oh my, look at that sky-high valuation!”There was first talk of NVDA trading at 100 times on a price to earnings (PE) basis. Then I saw posts about a 200X PE.Where were investors and journalists -- and armchair analyst-traders -- getting these ridiculous numbers?The Rearview MirrorMostly from looking backwards. Because when NVIDIA reported quarterly earnings on May 24, those looking in the rearview mirror ran off the road in bewilderment.Maybe they got scared by the “smart trucks” (large quantitative investors) accelerating behind them.But if they had only listened to me in my umpteenth explanation of why you buy NVDA at all valuations between 10 and 15 times sales, they would have been looking forward.For years I have said two things over and over again;Story continues1. Advances in Gaming GPU R&amp;D were teaching NVIDIA engineers what they needed to know to build the foundations of world-changing Artificial Intelligence (AI).2. Datacenter demands for NVIDIA AI “massively parallel architectures” would overtake Gaming revenues in the early 2020s. The Quarter That Blew the Roof OffOn March 20, I published a special edition of Zacks Confidential (ZC) where I outlined why NVIDIA was still the reigning “King of AI” and how the acceleration of, and access to, tools from ChatGPT had just put the stock back on the launch pad -- even though we already had 100%+ gains from buying the October lows.At the time, I was looking at consensus estimates for NVDA sales of about $30 billion for this fiscal year (ends in January) and around $37 billion for next year.But we were already starting to see the optimism being expressed in those 12-24 months forward estimates as ChatGPT ignited like wildfire and NVIDIA was inking deals left and right with partners like Microsoft MSFT.Little did we know that Jensen &amp; Co. would blow the roof off with a big raise in sales guidance on May 24. Here’s how I described the situation in TAZR Trader…NVIDIA: It's the TAM, Stupid!Posted on 5/24/23TAZR Traders""How extremely stupid not to have thought of that.""--Thomas Henry Huxley, upon hearing of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selectionNVIDIA blew some doors off tonight -- and not just for the bears.Yes, they raised guidance significantly. But so many investors and amateur analysts are still grappling to understand the significance of this juggernaut that I have called the King of AI for 6 years...Get Your ""MPA"" in Deep LearningMarch, 2017NVIDIA Gaming Drives the Deep Learning-AI RevolutionAugust 21, 2018Who Cares NVIDIA Makes Great Gaming Graphics?August 23, 2018NVDA Valuation in a Giant TAMIn mid 2022, CEO Jensen Huang guesstimated a TAM just for NVIDIA of $300 billion in hardware and $300 billion in software. This is the defining projection for the CUDA hard+soft stack I've been preaching about for 6 years.I think Jensen has been so conservative because it would blow the minds of even professional analysts to think about what is possible.Imagine NVDA growing to just 3X a $600 billion TAM where it would still be the dominant player...That would be a $1.5 trillion valuation minimum. See you soon above $1T.(end of May 24 TAZR commentary excerpt)Architect of the AI SupercomputerI used to talk 5 years ago about how much NVIDIA’s revenue could grow as they sold DGX “boxes” for $68,000. That’s the “mini” supercomputer in a 2-cubic foot space with 400 to 500 billion transistors for machine learning (ML) applications -- depending on what generation of GPU card is used, from Volta to Ampere to Hopper. The A100 system-on-a-chip GPU costs $10,000 each.A single DGX box is capable of massive computing power of between 1 to 5 petaFLOPS. A petaFLOP is a billion million floating point operations per second, so you can imagine how many you need to build a supercomputer like the one NVIDIA built at Tesla TSLA for their autonomous driving R&amp;D.Here’s a good description from software consulting firm Run:ai of what a user gets for their investment in a single DGX server…“Beyond the powerful hardware they provide, DGX systems come out of the box with an optimized operating system and a complete pre-integrated environment for running deep learning projects. They provide a containerized software architecture that lets data scientists easily deploy the deep learning frameworks and management tools they need with minimal setup or configuration.”To build a corporate, university, or scientific R&amp;D lab supercomputer, you need between 100 and 1,000 of these dynamic cubes, “stacked” together to form “massively parallel architectures.”The CUDA Stack RisesNow a DGX box costs anywhere from $100,000 to $150,000. Not to mention the value-enriching capabilities of the full CUDA hardware + software stack.And every major enterprise wants 100 to 1,000 of them now that ChatGPT took center stage. They either need to capitalize on the “chatterbox that ate the internet,” or exceed it. Now imagine the Fortune 500 adopting the mindset of Elon Musk about AI innovation for their companies as he did for Tesla.THIS is the math you need to understand to grasp how and why Wall Street analysts underestimated NVIDIA sales potential, even after ChatGPT.And they are just catching up with these potential topline moves…Fiscal year 2024 (ends January ‘24): $42.64 billion = 58% growthFiscal year 2025 (ends January ‘25): $54.70 billion = 28% growthThese are dramatic turnarounds from where revenue projections were only a few months ago when I wrote my ChatGPT report.In fact, the day I published that ChatGPT report on March 20 was the start of the greatest computing event of the year, the NVIDIA GPU Tech Conference, or GTC. Jensen &amp; Co. are always full of surprises that wow the tech crowd and this was no disappointment as NVIDIA launched DGX Cloud, where users can rent access to single-instance servers for $37,000 per month. Then in late May, they unveiled DGX GH200, a large-memory AI supercomputer that uses NVIDIA NVLink to combine up to 256 NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips into a single data-center sized GPU. Alphabet’s GOOGL Google Cloud, Meta Platforms META and Microsoft are already the first customers.This was one of the primary drivers in the dramatic leap in sales estimates for this year and next.The Trillion-Parameter Instrument of AIHere’s how Jensen &amp; Co. introduced the newest superpod…Open up enormous potential in the age of AI with a new class of AI supercomputer that fully connects 256 NVIDIA Grace Hopper™ Superchips into a singular GPU. NVIDIA DGX™ GH200 is designed to handle terabyte-class models for massive recommender systems, generative AI, and graph analytics, offering 144 terabytes (TB) of shared memory with linear scalability for giant AI models.In the video that accompanies this article, I share insights from two prominent technology consultants and partners for NVIDIA GPU architectures that explain the power of these AI tools.The first is Lambda Labs where they help customers build custom NVIDIA DGX “SuperPOD” solutions. They are a preferred NVIDIA partner who claims to help corporate clients ""Guarantee ROI for your NVIDIA DGX™ deployment with Lambda’s deep learning expertise."" Here's their mission description...Accelerate development with purpose-built software for ML/AIAll DGX systems come with the DGX software stack, including AI frameworks, scripts, and pre-trained models. It also comes with cluster management, network/storage acceleration libraries, and an optimized OS.The second expert is Run:AI where they have a highly useful article breaking down the evolution of DGX generations since 2017.Be sure to watch the video where I explain machine learning/deep learning neural networks and offer more resources to learn from.Where to Buy NVDA Shares for the Run to $2 TrillionIt won’t happen this year. Maybe next year. But I think the days of NVDA trading below $750 billion are gone.And I don’t think the stock will fill the gap back down below $320. A sea-change moment occurred between March and May where corporations and investors realized that NVIDIA AI platforms weren’t a luxury anymore.They became essential for competition in the world of big data mining and modeling. So buy all dips toward $350.Disclosure: I own shares of NVDA for the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Fed has made three hikes in 2023, taking the tally to 10 since March 2022. However, at its recently concluded FOMC meeting, the committee has paused further rate hikes for the time being despite high inflation. The Fed hinted at another increase by 2023 end. Companies that have locked in high interest rates are bound to generate higher yields at this point.P&amp;C or non-life insurers are exposed to catastrophes that induce volatility in underwriting profits. Colorado State University predicts a “near average active Atlantic hurricane season in 2023.” However, improved pricing (most of the lines are witnessing rate increase), prudent underwriting, favorable reserve development and a sturdy capital level should help withstand the blow.Global commercial insurance prices rose for 22 straight quarters though the magnitude has slowed down, per Marsh Global Insurance Market Index. Improvement in pricing drives premiums and claims payment. Per Deloitte Insights, gross premiums are estimated to increase sixfold to $722 billion by 2030Life insurers continue to roll out investment products that provide bundled covers of guaranteed retirement income, life and healthcare to cater to customers preferring policies with “living” benefits more than those with death benefits. A compelling product portfolio will thus aid sales of life insurers. Per Deloitte Insights, life insurance premium is estimated to increase 1.9% in 2023. Per a report published in ReporterLinker, global life insurance gross written premium is expected to be $2.5 trillion by 2026.Players are investing heavily in technology to improve scale and efficiencies. Also, a solid capital level continues to aid insurers in pursuing strategic mergers and acquisitions, investing in growth initiatives, engaging in share buybacks, and increasing dividends or paying out special dividends.Amid the current situation, let’s focus on some low-beta stocks that tend to deliver steady performance irrespective of market conditions.Story continuesWhat is Beta?Beta indicates the volatility of a particular stock with respect to the market. In other words, beta measures the extent of stock price movement relative to the market.If a company has a beta of 1, it means that the relative volatility of the stock is the same as that of the market. In the same way, if the stock's beta is greater than 1, then it is more volatile than the market. Conversely, a beta below 1 signifies low volatility.In a turbulent market, it is advisable to focus on low-beta stocks as these will ensure a steady return on investment.The Winning StrategyWe have used our proprietary Zacks Stock Screener to find out stocks that can deliver steady performance even in times of uncertainty. We have included stocks with a beta less than 1 for shortlisting low-risk stocks. But low beta cannot be the only stock selection criterion. So, we have added a few other parameters:Percentage Change in Price in the Last 12 Weeks greater than 1: This ensures that the stocks saw positive price movement over the last three months.Average 20 Day Volume greater than 400,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stocks are easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than equal to 3: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) stocks will either outperform or perform in line with the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months.

Certain sectors are set to heat up as we head into the U.S. summer season. Below, we explore the top sectors investors should consider for a sunny summer portfolio.Travel &amp; LeisureWith the ebbing pandemic and easing travel restrictions, the Travel &amp; Leisure industry is poised for a strong recovery this summer. Airlines, hotels, cruise lines, and travel booking sites are set to benefit from a surge in pent-up demand for travel. As more and more people feel comfortable venturing out, this sector could see significant growth.Defiance Hotel Airline and Cruise ETF CRUZ has gained decently past month. Hotelier Marriott International MAR is a good pick, as far as the stock-picking is concerned.RetailSummer is a time for spending, and nowhere is this more apparent than in the Retail sector. Clothing retailers, in particular, tend to thrive as consumers update their wardrobes for the new season. Additionally, home improvement stores often see a boost from summer DIY projects. With the added factor of economic recovery, this summer could be particularly robust for retail.While SPDR S&amp;P Retail ETF XRT is rich with apparel stocks, iShares U.S. Consumer Focused ETF IEDI is heavy home-improvement stocks. As far as stocks are concerned, Investors can bet on Urban Outfitters URBN and Home Depot HD are lucrative bets.Food &amp; BeveragePicnics, barbecues, and beach trips – summer is full of occasions that call for food and drink. This can translate to an uptick in sales for Food &amp; Beverage companies, especially those in the beer and soft drink industries. Also, keep an eye on companies that cater to healthier options, as the warmer weather often inspires a focus on fitness and well-being. AdvisorShares Restaurant ETF EATZ and the fast-food behemoth McDonald's MCD can be played here.Story continuesEnergyAir conditioners, fans, and refrigerators all work overtime in the summer, leading to an increase in energy consumption. Therefore, utility companies, especially those in the electricity sector, often experience a seasonal surge in demand during the hotter months.

This performance was attributed to bets on rising interest rates and volatility across various asset classes. It was Rokos' best annual performance since 2015, the year he started trading for his own firm, and it helped the fund recover from a record 26% loss suffered in the previous year.However, Rokos Capital Management faced challenges in early 2023. The hedge fund experienced a 15% decline in March. Year-to-date, the macro hedge fund is down by approximately 9.5% as of March. The firm was caught off-guard by the bond market turmoil, and its bets on US government bonds backfired. This led to concerns from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding the size of potential margin calls on the firm.In response to the losses, Rokos Capital Management decided to de-risk its portfolio and reduce exposure to market volatility. The firm stated that its cash levels remained healthy, and it emphasized its open and collaborative engagement with regulatory authorities such as the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the SEC. The SEC chair, Gary Gensler, reportedly discussed Rokos with the UK regulators, highlighting the concerns over margin calls and the potential impact on the US government bond market.According to Forbes, Chris Rokos, the CEO and founder of Rokos Capital Management, has a net worth of $1.5 billion. Rokos is a macro investor who specializes in commodities, currencies, interest rates, and equities.

Their extensive selection of essential pool and spa care products serves residential and professional clientele.

Andrew Carter reduced the price target on Leslie's, Inc. (NASDAQ:LESL) to $11 from $12 while maintaining a ‘Hold’ rating on the shares.

(NASDAQ:LESL), the leading direct-to-consumer pool and spa care services company in the U.S. The company differentiates itself through its loyal client base, vertically integrated supply chain, scale advantage and seamless customer experience. Shares have recently sold off on near-term operational issues at a distribution facility, as well as concerns around the sustainability of the company’s growth profile in a normalized, post-pandemic environment. Although we believe new pool installments will likely experience a slowdown, the install base has materially increased and ~80% of LESL’s business is tied to recurring maintenance. We found this entry point as an attractive opportunity to own a differentiated retailer, well positioned to benefit from secular tailwinds in an industry, permanently elevated by the pandemic.”9. Mobileye Global Inc. (NASDAQ:MBLY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 22Mobileye Global Inc. (NASDAQ:MBLY) is a global leader in developing and deploying advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technologies. Mizuho increased the price target on Mobileye Global Inc.

(NASDAQ:MBLY), compared to 29 funds in the prior quarter.Baron Funds made the following comment about Mobileye Global Inc. (NASDAQ:MBLY) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“During the fourth quarter, we participated in Mobileye Global Inc. (NASDAQ:MBLY)’s IPO. Mobileye is a leading ADAS and autonomous driving technologies and solutions provider with over 125 million vehicles across 800 models that have incorporated its products to date across 50-plus vehicle manufacturers (OEMs) including 13 of the top 15 global OEMs. The company was founded in 1999 and effectively pioneered the ADAS market introducing its first EyeQ system-on-chip (SoC) in 2007, enabling the vehicle to gain ADAS capabilities (such as real-time detection of vehicles, pedestrians, and lane markings) for a price of around $50. While the company remains a leader in ADAS today (with an approximate 70% market share), we believe the bigger opportunity is in leading the autonomous driving revolution. This would, in our view, significantly improve safety; meaningfully increase the vehicle utilization rate, which today is only around 4%; and dramatically grow the company’s content per vehicle. Mobileye’s SuperVision, a fully operational point-to-point assisted driving navigation solution, is the next step in the company’s progress towards autonomous driving, and it has a price tag of over 20 times that of its basic ADAS SoC. At the last Consumer Electronics Conference, the company announced a $3.5 billion backlog for its SuperVision solution across six OEMs and nine vehicle models. In addition, the company announced a $1.5 billion design win for its consumer AV program and a $3.5 billion backlog for its Mobility-as-a-Service or robotaxi solution. CEO and Founder, Amnon Shashua discussed his long-term vision in the company’s shareholder letter:“More than two decades ago, I founded Mobileye on the belief that computer vision technology could help prevent automobile crashes and save lives. From that simple idea, a global industry was born… By 2030, we expect Mobileye driver-assistance systems to be deployed in another 270 million vehicles globally… We believe that we will be positioned to deliver an autonomous driving solution that can enable the mass adoption of AVs [Autonomous Vehicles] including both Mobileye-powered robotaxis and consumer-owned autonomous driving vehicles. And Mobileye will be well on the way to delivering the future I first envisioned more than two decades ago.””8. New Fortress Energy Inc.

It, too, has surprised us to some extent, with the resiliency that it’s showing in a slowing trucking market. We think there’s a decent chance that weakness in its end markets will eventually catch up with PACCAR, but we believe the stock is cheap, and its steady parts business will act as a moderate stabilizer in such a scenario.”Click to continue reading and see Billionaire Chris Rokos is Selling These 5 Stocks in 2023.Suggested articles:10 Best Value Stocks to Buy in 2023 According to Billionaire Mario GabelliBillionaire John Paulson’s 2023 Portfolio: Top 15 Stock PicksBillionaire David Tepper’s 2023 Portfolio: Top 15 Stock PicksDisclosure: None. Billionaire Chris Rokos is Selling These 12 Stocks in 2023 is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

This may save customers close to $80 million.The agreement with AES Warrior Run was signed in 2000 as a provision of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA), a law approved by Congress in 1978. It relates to the coal-fired power plant near Cumberland, MD.Maryland customers of Potomac are currently subject to a Cogeneration PURPA Project Surcharge on their electricity bills, determined by the price at which the company can resell the power it acquired from Warrior Run. Due to changes in the competitive market, the surcharge amount has changed significantly from year to year.Potomac’s Customer BenefitsAccording to the Maryland PSC's directive, customers would continue to see the PURPA surcharge on their bills during the buyout period. However, Potomac’s customers are expected to save a sizable sum of money throughout the buyout time. Additionally, the elimination of charges based on a volatile market will help to stabilize their costs as a result of this arrangement. There is a 90% chance that ending the Warrior Run contract early will result in cost savings for the consumers for the remaining period of the contract.Other Customer-Friendly InitiativesIn order to help reduce potential weather-related outages and increase reliability for customers this summer, Potomac has taken various initiatives across its Maryland service territory.Equipment inspections have been proactively undertaken. Over 590 miles of transmission lines in the Maryland service area have been inspected by helicopter crews to locate hardware issues that are not readily apparent from the ground. The ground workers assessed about 80 substations and made the necessary repairs before the summer. Additionally, they carried out detailed inspections of nearby power lines and concentrated on more than 450 line capacitors, which maintain proper electric voltage.Also, to minimize tree-related damages during severe weather and improve the reliability of the electric service, the company plans to clear vegetation along 1,100 miles of power lines in 2023, of which 500 miles have already been covered.Story continuesPrice PerformanceOver the past year, shares of FE have gained 6.8% against the industry’s 8.5% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksFirstEnergy currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Moreover, TSCO benefited from its Life Out Here Strategy, Neighbor’s Club membership program and healthy product demand.This led to year-over-year sales growth of 9.1% to $3,299.2 million in first-quarter 2023. The top line also benefited from contributions from the Orscheln Farm and Home acquisition concluded in October 2022, store openings and increased comparable store sales (comps).Comps improved 2.1% year over year led by growth in comparable average tickets, offset by a decline in comparable average transactions. The company’s comparable average ticket improved 2.8%, while the comparable average transaction count was down 0.7%. Sturdy demand for everyday merchandise, including consumable, usable and edible products, as well as year-round products, contributed to comp growth.Tractor Supply has been on track to build up its Out Here lifestyle assortment and the convenient shopping format to gain customers and market share. The strategy is essentially based on five key pillars — customers, digitization, execution, team members and total shareholder return.As part of the plans, it revised the long-term financial growth targets for 2022-2026. Management envisions achieving net sales growth of 6-7%, while comps are expected to grow 4-5%. The operating margin is expected to be 10.1-10.6%, up from the earlier mentioned 9-9.5%. Earnings per share are likely to grow 8-11%, up from the previously disclosed 8-10%.Earlier, the company launched the Field Activity Support Team (“FAST”), and implemented various technology and service enhancements across the enterprise. It is also in the initial phase of transforming its side lots and mature stores to improve space productivity, bringing the latest merchandising strategies to life and advancing efforts to remain nationally strong and locally relevant.TSCO’s focus on integrating its physical and digital operations to offer consumers a seamless shopping experience bodes well. The company has been on track with the ‘ONETractor’ strategy aimed at connecting stores and online shopping. Its omni-channel investments include curbside pickup, same-day and next-day delivery, a re-launched website, and a new mobile app.In the first quarter, Tractor Supply’s e-commerce business performed well, with its mobile app representing more than 20% of its digital sales. Earlier, the company launched Tractor Supply Visa Credit Card, which allows customers to earn points on their everyday purchases, both in-store and anywhere Visa is accepted.Tractor Supply exited the first quarter with more than 30 million Neighbor's Club members. The company’s rebranding of Petsense by Tractor Supply and expansion of its Neighbor's Club program to Petsense stores received positive customer feedback. The move will enable it to gain pet customers for both banners.TSCO has also been expanding its store base, and implementing technological advancements to induce traffic and drive the top line. The company is well-positioned to expand its store base, remaining on track to increase its domestic store to 2,500 in the long term.In the first quarter, the company opened 17 Tractor Supply stores and three Petsense by Tractor Supply stores. It expects to complete the planned conversion of 81 Orscheln Farm and Home to Tractor Supply stores by the end of 2023. Management expects to continue its store-opening initiatives in 2023. It plans to open 70 Tractor Supply stores and 10-15 Petsense stores in 2023.Driven by these factors, management expects fiscal 2023 net sales of $15-$15.3 billion, in line with our estimate of $15.2 billion. Comp growth is likely to be 3.5-5.5%. The company is likely to witness comp sales toward the top half of its guidance in the second quarter.TSCO also anticipates strength in CUE products and DIY categories like repairs and maintenance. Its second and third quarters are anticipated to have the strongest comp sales growth potential, while the fourth quarter is expected to be at the low end of the guidance range.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Consequently, shares of TSCO have lost 2.7% in the past three months but came ahead of the industry’s decline of 4.7%.Hurdles on the WayTractor Supply has been reeling under inflation woes and rising costs. In first-quarter 2023, SG&amp;A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of sales, expanded 119 bps year over year to 28.1%. Higher SG&amp;A expenses resulted from the deleverage due to moderate comps, and higher depreciation and amortization; the opening of a distribution center; and the impacts of the Orscheln Farm and Home acquisition.Bottom LineDespite inflation and cost woes, Tractor Supply looks well-poised on the back of online strength, solid demand and other growth efforts. Also, a Value Score of B and long-term earnings growth of 9.6% raise optimism in this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks that investors may consider are Tecnoglass TGLS, Kroger KR and TJX Companies TJX.Tecnoglass manufactures and sells architectural glass and aluminum products for the residential and commercial construction industries.

The S&amp;P 500's Energy Select Sector (XLE) is down roughly 10% year-to-date, compared to last year's rise of 57.6%.Houston-based Occidental Petroleum (OXY), backed by Warren Buffett, has followed a similar trend. The stock has pulled back 8% year-to-date, after rising a whopping 117% last year, making it the best-performing S&amp;P 500 company of 2022.The stock's move downward creates an opportunity for investors, according to Lee Munson, president and chief investment officer of Portfolio Wealth Advisors. Munson sees Occidental Petroleum as a top-pick value play.""I love that they have cheap production. I love that this place has half of the Permian Basin in their back pocket,"" said Munson, referring to the oil-and-gas-producing area located in West Texas.""The Permian Basin is America's easy oil. It's huge, the fields are nice and rich, and it's easy to extract it,"" he added.Munson points out that Occidental Petroleum has proprietary processes related to fracking, which decreases its dependence on oil services companies.""I think it's a good deal. I think that goes for the energy sector in general. It's beat up,"" said Munson. He added, ""I understand that it did really well, but I think going forward you have to think, how is this going to compound for the next five years? At what valuation? And things start looking attractive.""Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK-A, BRK-B) Warren Buffett has been increasing his position in the stock during pullbacks.""I'm not going to lie, it's nice to see Grandpa Buffett having a little floor on this and feeling like he's going to step in around that $59 level,"" Munson said.Occidental Petroleum has made it a point to prioritize returning money to investors through share buybacks.During the company's earnings call in May, CEO Vicki Hollub said, ""The corporation's capital is going to be invested in a way that fits with the priorities that we've established, one of which and as important as any of the others, is investing in and ourselves, that is the repurchase of shares.""Story continuesThe logo for Occidental Petroleum is displayed on a screen on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 30, 2019.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Pfizer Inc., Philip Morris International Inc. and American Tower Corporation. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Pfizer have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the year-to-date period (-22.7% vs. +3.2%). The company’s top line is expected to decline in 2023 due to potentially steep declines in revenues from its COVID-19 products, Comirnaty vaccine and Paxlovid oral pill, on lower demand.Concerns remain about its long-term growth drivers beyond its COVID products due to competitive pressure. Nonetheless, Pfizer boasts a diversified portfolio of innovative drugs and vaccines, including Ibrance, Abrsyvo and Prevnar.Pfizer is witnessing solid pipeline progress and expects to launch some key non-COVID products in 2023, which can drive long-term sales and profit growth. Its cash position is strong, which can be used to make acquisitions, increase dividends, buy back shares and reduce debt. Importantly, Pfizer shares are hardly expensive and offer a 'juicy' dividend that is currently yielding 4.2%.(You can read the full research report on Pfizer here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Philip Morris have declined -5.2% over the past six months against the Zacks Tobacco industry’s decline of -7.7%. The company has been battling cost-related headwinds and expects certain margin pressures in the first half of 2023. Also, soft cigarette shipment volumes and volatile currency movements have been concerns.In 2023, the total international industry volume is estimated to decline by 1-2%, excluding China and the United States. Nevertheless, Philip Morris has been gaining from its pricing power.

The company’s top line is expected to decline in 2023 due to potentially steep declines in revenues from its COVID-19 products, Comirnaty vaccine and Paxlovid oral pill, on lower demand.Concerns remain about its long-term growth drivers beyond its COVID products due to competitive pressure. Nonetheless, Pfizer boasts a diversified portfolio of innovative drugs and vaccines, including Ibrance, Abrsyvo and Prevnar.Pfizer is witnessing solid pipeline progress and expects to launch some key non-COVID products in 2023, which can drive long-term sales and profit growth. Its cash position is strong, which can be used to make acquisitions, increase dividends, buy back shares and reduce debt.

316,df80ab97-84c6-3a31-907c-33e30eedfacf,BSX,2023-06-23,Quest Diagnostics' (DGX) New Buyout Expands Cancer Portfolio,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quest-diagnostics-dgx-buyout-expands-163500461.html,1687451700,STORY,"['DGX', 'HOLX', 'BSX']","[Quest Diagnostics, Inc. DGX recently completed its previously-announced acquisition of Haystack Oncology. The acquisition is intended to improve patient outcomes through early, accurate detection of residual or recurring cancer.Based on circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA), Haystack Oncology created a highly-sensitive minimal-residual disease (“MRD”) testing tool to help with the early detection of residual or reoccurring cancer and to better guide treatment choices. This MRD technology will be used by Quest Diagnostics to create new blood-based clinical lab services for solid tumour cancers that will be made available starting in 2024.The latest move will expand Quest Diagnostics’ portfolio of cancer services, fortifying the Diagnostic Solutions business.About Haystack OncologyIn order to report residual, recurring, or resistant disease earlier than other MRD tests, Haystack Oncology uses the most advanced ctDNA detection technology to cut through the clutter and identify the lowest quantities of ctDNA in blood.Strategic ImplicationsThe acquisition of Haystack is a significant step toward transforming two decades of top-tier liquid biopsy research and development into clinical laboratory services that are incredibly dependable and widely available. By combining its strengths in screening, pathology and sequencing with Haystack's liquid biopsy technology, DGX will likely dominate the rapidly expanding MRD sector.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe acquisition will leverage Quest Diagnostic's capabilities and size in pathology, genomics, and oncology. Through its AmeriPath specialist pathology-diagnostics division, Quest Diagnostics employs around 400 pathologists and has over 7,000 patient access points for the collection of blood and other specimens in the United States. The ability to find patient-specific mutations for Haystack's tumor-informed MRD strategy is another aspect of Quest Diagnotics’ proficiency in next-generation tumour sequencing.Story continuesIndustry ProspectsPer a report by Grand View Research, the global minimal residual disease testing market size was estimated at $1.89 million in 2022 and is expected to expand at a CAGR of 11.45%. The minimal residual disease testing market is witnessing growth due to the increasing prevalence of cancer, increasing consumer awareness for therapy and increasing funding for research with an increasing disposable income in emerging economies.Recent DevelopmentsThis month, Quest Diagnostics partnered with Coriell Life Sciences to provide select medical plan members with pharmacogenomics testing services. The test indicates how different genes and their variants affect an individual’s reaction to drugs. The pharmacogenomics test is a voluntary, no cost DNA-testing programme that uses a saliva collection kit that can be used at home to analyze a person's DNA. The effectiveness of the patient's existing drugs is evaluated in light of the test results. The test results can improve pharmaceutical effectiveness and safety and also assist in selecting the appropriate drug and dosage. Through testing, each patient receives personalized, actionable clinical recommendations and drug management regimens.In May 2023, Quest Diagnostics announced that the RestoreU Dementia Panel, a risk assessment and care plan service developed by uMETHOD Health, a health technology company specializing in precision medicine for chronic diseases, would be made available nationwide. This would enable doctors to fill in any care gaps for patients with cognitive decline. The RestoreU service uses artificial intelligence (AI) created by uMETHOD to build personalized care plans that support cognitive care standards and aid clinicians in providing better patient care.Price PerformanceShares of the company have gained 2.9% in the past year against the industry’s fall of 5.1%.Zacks Rank and Key PicksQuest Diagnostics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

The products offered, Denon PerL and PerL Pro True Wireless (""TWS"") Earbuds featuring Masimo AAT, will likely allow users to create a personal audio profile to optimize the sound quality of the headphones.The Denon PerL and PerL Pro headphones are now available for purchase in a limited number at Denon.com, with a fuller rollout expected later in 2023.The latest launch is expected to significantly expand Masimo’s foothold in the global personalized hearables market, thereby boosting its non-healthcare consumer audio business.Few Words on the ProductsDenon PerL Pro earbuds deliver high-quality sound wirelessly, providing a streaming experience like listening to a CD. This leads users to enjoy high-fidelity streaming sources with excellent audio fidelity. PerL Pro also creates a surround sound effect that enhances the overall audio experience in a compact and comfortable wireless earbud design.Additionally, both the Denon PerL Pro and PerL models offer active noise cancellation and a more transparent social mode. This is expected to enable the user to tune the world out or let it in.The eight and four microphones in the PerL Pro and PerL, respectively, provide upgraded noise cancelation, automatically adjusting the level of cancelation according to the amount of leak-through, the environment’s sound and the tightness of fit in the ears.Significance of the LaunchPer Masimo, hearing varies from person to person, thus impacting the listening experience. The two Denon PerL TWS models use proprietary Masimo technology to assess each person’s unique response to sound. This is done by measuring the faint otoacoustic emissions (OAEs), produced by the inner ear in the presence of a range of tones played. Once the OAEs are analyzed to determine the sensitivity of a person’s ears to each frequency, a personal hearing profile is created in the Denon PerL Headphone app using artificial intelligence. This personalized profile is expected to provide superior depth, detail and clarity.Story continuesPer management, the introduction of the PerL and PerL Pro is expected to end the concept of one-sound-fits-all, thereby enhancing the listening experiences of individual listeners.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Zion Market Research, the global hearable market was worth around $28 billion in 2022 and is anticipated to reach around $96.53 billion by 2030 at a CAGR of approximately 16.7%. Factors like the growing advancements in hearables-related technology and increased demand for wireless earphones and infotainment gadgets are expected to drive the market.Given the market potential, the latest launch is likely to provide a significant boost to Masimo’s business globally.Recent DevelopmentsThis month, Masimo announced that Hospital La Fe in Valencia, Spain, is expanding its telehealth and telemonitoring program with the Masimo W1 advanced health tracking watch.The same month, Masimo announced that Fresno, CA-based Community Health System was adopting a variety of advanced Masimo monitoring technologies and solutions across its campuses.Also, in June, Masimo received the FDA’s 510(k) clearance for its patient-worn, continuous multi-parameter vital signs monitor, Radius VSM.Price PerformanceShares of Masimo have gained 20.3% in the past year compared with the industry’s 11.2% rise and the S&amp;P 500's 14.9% growth. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Zacks Rank &amp; Other Key PicksCurrently, Masimo carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

Shares have added about 8.3% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Intuit due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Intuit’s Q3 Earnings Beat Expectations, Sales MissIntuit reported fiscal third-quarter 2023 non-GAAP earnings of $8.92 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.45 per share. The bottom line surged 17% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of $7.65 per share.Revenues of $6.02 billion missed the consensus mark of $6.09 billion but increased 7% year over year.Quarter DetailsSegment-wise, Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenues grew 21% year over year to $2.02 billion. This rise was driven by the solid growth in customers for QuickBooks Online, a favorable mix-shift and the addition of Mailchimp.Total Online Ecosystem revenues grew 23% year over year to $1.47 billion. QuickBooks Online Accounting revenues were up 25% year over year to $723 million, mainly driven by the mix-shift, higher pricing and customer growth.Online Services revenues which include payroll, payments, time tracking and capital, grew 21% year over year to $745 million. This was driven by strong performances of Mailchimp, QuickBooks Online payroll and QuickBooks Online payments solutions.Within QuickBooks Online payroll, a mix-shift to INTU’s full-service offering and the continued uptick in the customer base acted as tailwinds. Within QuickBooks Online payments, an increase in the charge volume per customer and ongoing customer growth drove revenues.Total international online revenues increased 12% year over year on a constant-currency basis.Total Desktop ecosystem revenues grew 16.4% year over year during the reported quarter to $553 million.Story continuesIn the fiscal third quarter, revenues from Consumer Group increased to $3.34 billion from $3.24 billion reported a year ago, mainly driven by a strong peak in new customers and extension filers. Further, ProTax Group's professional tax revenues decreased by 5% to $246 million from $258 million in the year-ago quarter.The Credit Karma business contributed $410 million to Intuit’s third-quarter total revenues, down from $468 million in the year-ago quarter. The drastic year-over-year fall reflects headwinds in personal loans, home loans, auto insurance and auto loans, partially offset by strength in credit cards and Credit Karma Money.Intuit’s non-GAAP operating income climbed 16% to $3.36 billion.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowAs of Apr 30, 2023, Intuit’s cash and investments were $4.3 billion compared with $2.07 billion as of Jan 31, 2023.The company exited the fiscal third quarter with long-term debt of $6.1 billion, down from the previous quarter’s $6.58 billion.During the first nine months of fiscal 2023, the company generated $4.20 billion worth cash from operating activities.Intuit repurchased stocks worth $483 million during the fiscal third quarter and had a remaining share-repurchase authorization of $2 billion at the end of the quarter.

We support the objectives of the Paris Agreement to limit global temperature rise to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5°C.We are committed to reducing GHG emissions from our global operations and value chain, and to delivering solutions which advance our customers' climate ambitions and support society's transition to a low carbon world. We believe a commitment to net zero scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by 2050 and a credible pathway to 2030 for scopes 1, 2 and 3 are critical to the long-term success of LyondellBasell.In December 2022, we stepped up our ambition by accelerating our interim targets for 2030 in line with the best available science. We increased our 2030 GHG emissions reduction target for scope 1 and 2 emissions to 42% and established a 2030 scope 3 emissions reduction target of 30%, relative to a 2020 baseline. We submitted a commitment letter to the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi) for validation of our 2030 goals. The SBTi drives ambitious climate action in the private sector by enabling organizations to set science-based emissions reduction targets.Included in our approach is a commitment to secure at least 50% of our global procured electricity from renewable sources by 2030. We will also work with our utility suppliers to lower the carbon intensity of the electricity and steam that we procure.Importantly, as companies within our value chains increasingly set their own scope 3 goals, we believe our increased climate ambitions will be an advantage. As an early mover, we aim to deliver low carbon foot- print materials that will meet increasing demand across our value chains.Story continuesOUR GOALSAchieve net zero GHG emissions from our global operations by 20501Reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 42% by 20302Reduce absolute scope 3 GHG emissions 30% by 20303Procure a minimum of 50% of electricity from renewable sources by 20304OUR APPROACHIntegrate proven solutions to improve the efficiency of our manufacturing processes and switch to less carbon intensive fuelsAssess opportunities in electrification of our processes and in carbon capture technologyIncrease our use of renewable and low carbon energy primarily through power purchase agreements and collaboration with our utility suppliersHelp accelerate the scale up and deployment of breakthrough technologies to reduce the carbon footprint of chemical processes to net zero by 2050 through collaborationAdvance our use of circular and renewable-based feedstocks and engage with suppliers to support scope 3 emissions reductionsContinue to integrate climate impacts into our business processes and strategyEngage with governments and industry peers to support effective policies to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement and our global climate ambitionsThe role of public policyWe believe public policy has an essential role to play in the transition to a low carbon economy. Our strategy for achieving our climate ambitions relies on several key enablers. These includes stable positions and policies independent of political cycles, and the development of necessary infrastructure and technologies to support the transition toward net zero.We support policies that:Encourage the development of affordable and reliable low carbon energy needed to support industrial operations through various incentives that reward investment in carbon-reducing technologies and support the development of needed infrastructure.Promote advances to develop carbon capture and storage infrastructure at the scale required to enable the storage of GHG emissions, which are technically unavoidable today, or where the solution involves excessively high economic or social costs.Promote significant increases in renewable electricity production and grid capacity upgrades needed to support the highelectricity demand tied to the electrification of processes.Encourage further development of affordable, reliable renewable energy and baseload generation from other non-emitting sources.Accelerate the development of emerging technologies that enable the reduction of emissions from carbon intensive, large scale manufacturing needs, including processes and adjacent infrastructure to enable cost effective use of CO2 at scale for the production of higher value chemicals.We also support a carbon pricing scheme that effectively facilitates a transition to a net zero economy. We believe a global carbon price provides the most efficient, fair and uniform way to reduce GHG emissions at scale. In the absence of a global price on carbon, in the near-term, we support regionally implemented cap-and-trade programs.Finally, while we expect the cost of low carbon hydrogen, irrespective of its mode of production, to become increasingly competitive, we will continue to need public support for the development of hydrogen production and transport capabilities in our regions of operations.In 2023, we will publish more details on our climate advocacy approach, including our approach to participation in trade associations.Governance of our climate goalsRecognizing the vital importance of the issue, our climate strategy is embedded in our overall business strategy and managed at the highest levels of our company. Our Board of Directors (Board) leads our commitment to sustainability and maintains oversight of our ESG profile on topics including climate change.At the management level, our CEO oversees the company's ESG profile through regular reporting and discussion on key topics and initiatives among members of the Executive Committee, comprised of senior executives that lead LyondellBasell's businesses and functions. ESG matters including climate change impact, and are impacted by, our operations, with each function playing a role in identifying relevant opportunities, managing associated risks, and contributing to our overall sustainability program. The Executive Committee includes, among others, our Executive Vice President, Sustainability and Corporate Affairs, with responsibility for sustainability strategy and ESG reporting.In 2022, we promoted our Director, Global Sustainability to the role of Vice President and Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO). The CSO is responsible for the management of sustainability programs, strategy, and reporting.In 2022, we reviewed our approach to our climate strategy, and created a new organization dedicated to the execution of our strategy to reach our 2050 net zero goal and underlying interim targets for scope 1 and 2 emissions. This organization is directly embedded within our business, with a direct reporting line to business executive leadership to facilitate the integration of climate as part of our overall business strategy. In addition, with the announcement of our commitment to reduce our value chain (scope 3) emissions, we are establishing an internal network to address and reduce our scope 3 emissions, which will include representatives from several business units across the company due to the diversity of scope 3 emission sources.OUR GOAL: ACHIEVE NET ZERO GHG EMISSIONS FROM OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS BY 2050Our strategy to reach net zero scope 1 and scope 2 emissions from our global operations by 2050 is focused on six levers.Energy efficiency: Lowering the energy demand of our operations through initiatives including flare gas recovery, heat integration and process optimization.Fuel Switching: Reducing the carbon intensity of the fuels we use on site by increasing the share of lower carbon intensive fuels in our fuel mix, and in particular hydrogen, to displace other fuels.Electrification: Electrifying our processes to replace the use of fossil fuels with low carbon or renewable electricity.Carbon Capture and Storage/Utilization (CCS/CCU): Reducing direct emissions by enabling the capture and storage or reuse of CO2 from our operations.Emerging technologies: Developing and utilizing new technologies for the production of olefins, chemicals and polyolefins with a lower carbon footprint compared to traditional processes. This includes technologies that enable circularity, such as our MoReTec advanced recycling technology.Low Carbon Energy: Reducing emissions associated with our purchased electricity and steam needs by sourcing electricity from renewable energy projects, and collaborating with utility suppliers to lower the carbon intensity of the energy we purchase.OUR GOAL: REDUCE ABSOLUTE SCOPE 1 AND 2 GHG EMISSIONS 42% BY 20305Our 2030 strategy for scope 1 and 2 emissions includes a portfolio of projects categorized under the levers listed below. We take into account organic growth and divestitures and previously announced closures of assets. We have accounted for the additional emissions from our new PO/TBA plant in Channelview, Texas, commissioned in March 2023. As announced in April 2022, we plan to close the Houston refinery by the end of December 2023. This is expected to reduce scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by more than 3 million metric tons annually.Levers for reducing scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by 2030 include:ElectrificationElectrification is part of our approach to achieving our 2030 target and our 2050 net zero goal for scope 1 and scope 2 emissions. Part of our 2030 approach will be to reduce the use of fossil fuels in our utilities, in particular through electrifying our steam production. When coupled with renewable or low carbon electricity, this approach will allow us to lower the carbon footprint of our onsite produced energy.Longer term, we anticipate process electrification will be an integral part of our approach to achieving net zero in our operations, and notably in our olefins plants, which represent more than half of our scope 1 and 2 footprint.Fuel switchingWe refer to fuel switching as the use of hydrogen and other fuels with low carbon intensity to displace higher carbon intensive fuels and thereby reduce GHG emissions in our operations. We anticipate fuel switching will be another key element in our approach to achieving our 2030 target and 2050 net zero goal for scope 1 and 2 emissions, in particular for our olefin and other higher energy intensive process units.We are evaluating hydrogen supplies from a variety of sources, both internal and external, in our effort to reduce GHG emissions from fuels used in our operations. Internally, we are evaluating reforming gases from our processes to produce hydrogen, and the production of on-purpose hydrogen. Externally, we support the development of a hydrogen value chain. To enable this development, we believe supportive policies and value chain collaboration will be critical. This is why we are working with several parties, including Air Liquide, Uniper and Chevron, on a joint study to evaluate and potentially advance the development of a production facility for low carbon hydrogen and ammonia in the U.S. Gulf Coast.We are also pursuing other opportunities to reduce the carbon intensity of the fuels we use. Our collaboration with Evonik will allow us to phase out coal from our power plant in Wesseling, Germany, by 2024, replacing it with high pressure steam produced from natural gas at Evonik's neighboring site.Carbon capture storage and utilizationWe support the development of infrastructure for the capture and storage of CO2 to enable emission reductions from processes where no other suitable technical or economical solution exists today. In particular, carbon capture and storage (CCS) can be used in combination with hydrogen production from natural gas, to create what is known as blue hydrogen. Recognizing economically feasible CCS infrastructure as a critical lever to reduce emissions and enable a supply of blue hydrogen, we are conducting feasibility studies at key manufacturing sites in Europe and in the U.S. for the potential deployment of carbon capture equipment with linkages to storage infrastructure under development.Longer term, we believe in the potential of CO2 utilization as an alternative to permanent storage. We are exploring collaboration opportunities with different stakeholders to bring CO2 utilization approaches to technological and commercial maturity. CO2 utilization not only has the potential to reduce scope 1 and 2 emissions through CO2 capture, but also to reduce scope 3 emissions by converting the captured CO2 to higher value chemicals that could replace current fossil-based feedstocks.The graph represents our expected progress toward our 2030 target. We expect our scope 1 and 2 emissions will increase temporarily in 2023 due to the commissioning of our PO/TBA plant. We estimate that a significant portion of our reduction efforts will take place in the latter half of the decade, as many of these projects are aligned with the turnaround schedules of our manufacturing sites. Several of our projects are also dependent on key enablers, such as the construction of infrastructure.Estimates of the capital expenditures necessary to achieve our emissions reduction goals are built into the company's long-range plan. These investments are not expected to represent a significant portion of total capital expenditures over the next three years, nor change the capital allocation strategy. While many of the GHG emissions reduction projects are still in the early stages of development, the company will evaluate, pursue and prioritize its GHG emission reduction investments based on each project's rate of return.OUR GOAL: PROCURE A MINIMUM OF 50% OF ELECTRICITY FROM RENEWABLE SOURCES BY 20306Renewable electricity is a critical reduction lever in our journey to achieve net zero scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by 2050.We have made significant progress toward achieving our renewable energy procurement goal. Renewable energy is an important component of our 2030 and 2050 strategy, and power purchase agreements are our preferred approach to decarbonizing our electricity supply. These strategic projects propel us forward in greenhouse gas emissions reduction, and they also provide scalability and support investment in new renewable energy capability. Power purchase agreements also are a good business decision, helping to protect businesses against a potentially volatile market.In 2022, we signed eight renewable electricity power purchase agreements (PPAs) in the U.S. and Europe, achieving more than 50% of our 2030 target. The projects are both wind and solar, and the majority are located in Texas. The Tarragona Solar Project in Spain is the first physical PPA project located at a LyondellBasell manufacturing site. This project is expected to begin operations in the third quarter of 2023 with approximately 5 megawatts (MW) of renewable energy capacity. In total, these PPAs represent approximately 933 MW of renewable energy capacity and are estimated to generate an amount of renewable electricity equivalent to the annual electricity consumption of approximately 380,000 households.In March 2023, LyondellBasell and Grenergy signed five long-term solar power PPAs. Under the 15-year contracts, the Spanish renewable energy producer will supply solar energy from the La Cereal solar farm project, which is expected to be operational at the end of 2025. The agreements represent approximately 141 MW of solar energy capacity, equivalent to the annual electricity consumption of approximately 90,000 European homes. With these agreements, LyondellBasell achieved 70% of our goal to procure at least half of our electricity from renewable sources by 2030. In total, these PPAs will reduce our company's scope 2 emissions by more than 1 million metric tons per year when the projects are operational.In addition, we are working to identify and implement solutions to secure low carbon energy through various projects under evaluation to supplement our renewable electricity supply at our sites in North America and Europe. These include working with our current utility suppliers to reduce the carbon intensity of the energy we procure, and assessing the feasibility of emerging technologies to deploy at our sites.OUR GOAL: REDUCE ABSOLUTE SCOPE 3 GHG EMISSIONS 30% BY 20307Our scope 3 goal was developed following the best available science, and we are seeking SBTi validation of our goal.Our scope 3 goal was developed following the best available science, with a coverage of two thirds of our total scope 3 emission inventory in line with the latest SBTi guidance. We are currently seeking validation of our goal with the SBTi. Several reduction levers are important for achieving scope 3 reductions:The exit from our refining business: Our exit from the sale of refined products, including gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, and corresponding exit from procuring various raw materials including crude oil, will represent in total a reduction of approximately 40 million metric tons of scope 3 emissions annually.Use of circular feedstocks: We are increasing our use of renewable bio-based and recycled feedstocks, in line with our commitment to produce and market at least 2 million metric tons of recycled and renewable-based polymers annually by 2030.Engaging with suppliers: By engaging with suppliers, including those that supply our feedstocks and raw materials, we can better understand the product carbon footprint of the materials we procure from them and explore the potential for collaboration on emissions reduction opportunities. We will also utilize the product carbon footprint guidance from Together for Sustainability to enable further harmonization on scope 3 accounting approaches across the value chain.Shifting to less carbon intensive fuels: Switching to the use of lower carbon intensive fuels in our operations may offer the potential to lower our scope 3 emissions, in addition to reducing our scope 1 and/or scope 2 emissions.Engaging with logistics providers: We are engaging with our logistics suppliers to better understand emissions linked to the transportation of our products to our customers, and reviewing opportunities to optimize our distribution routes to reduce GHG emissions. We participated in the development of the Global Logistics Emissions Council (GLEC) guidance for the European Chemical Industry as part of the Smart Freight Centre and are working with logistics suppliers to improve the accuracy of emissions reporting to guide optimization efforts.Estimating scope 3 emissions can be challenging as the industry's understanding of sources and appropriate emission methodologies is evolving. Additional guidance for calculating and addressing scope 3 emissions is currently underway across many industries, including the chemical sector. We are engaged in several sector initiatives to improve the consistency and accuracy of scope 3 emission estimates and reporting, including in SBTi Chemical Industry Guidance and Together for Sustainability's Product Carbon Footprints.1 Our 2050 net zero GHG emissions goal includes scope 1 and 2 emissions. 2 Relative to a 2020 baseline. 3 Relative to a 2020 baseline. 4 Based on 2020 procured levels. 5 Relative to a 2020 baseline. 6 Based on 2020 procured levels. 7 Relative to a 2020 baseline.View the full LyondellBasell 2022 Sustainability Report.For information about the factors that could impact our forward-looking statements, please see page two of the LyondellBasell Sustainability Report.LyondellBasell, Thursday, June 22, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from LyondellBasell on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: LyondellBasellWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/lyondellbasellEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: LyondellBasellView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/763150/LyondellBasell-2022-Sustainability-Report-Taking-Climate-Action]"

""Australia is an ally. India wants the same privileges that allies get without having any of the same obligations or responsibilities.""The source noted that India wanted access to sensitive technologies that many of the closest U.S. allies do not have, even while sticking to its stance of maintaining close relations with Russia and refusing to condemn Moscow's Ukraine invasion.Bill Greenwalt, a former senior Pentagon official for industrial policy, said approvals for the jet engine deal and for the military drones should be relatively straightforward, although it appeared GE was still in the process of getting export authorization, which would come with State Department-mandated restrictions.""Complicating factors include to what degree congressional review and approval thresholds kick in. I expect that likely will happen for the SeaGuardians,"" said Greenwalt, adding that the U.S. Missile Technology Control Regime was an added likely complication.LIMITS ON TECHNOLOGY USEAnd there is another factor: how willingly India will accept the restrictions that may come along with any technology it receives from the U.S.Greenwalt said the conditions ITAR attaches to use of technology and the limits it imposes on India's ability to add its own intellectual property to what it learns from that could mean New Delhi “quickly grows tired of being dictated to by the U.S. State Department.”He added that given India's growing IT expertise, it had the potential to leapfrog the United States in areas such as integrated command and control, sensor fusion, autonomy, and data analytics.""Together we could likely make a lot more progress than if we pursue separate paths, but ITAR disincentives will keep them from cooperating with us on things that matter while our over-confidence will keep us from seeing their potential,"" said Greenwalt.Rick Rossow, an India expert at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies, said approval processes for advanced defense technology transfer were ""onerous but not impossible.""""The U.S. — with great effort — can move faster for India,"" he said. ""But we need India’s deal-making process to move fast, too. Otherwise, potential deals will not be accelerated on our side.""(Reporting by David Brunnstrom; additional reporting by Mike Stone and Patricia Zengerle; Editing by Don Durfee and Deepa Babington)]"

Cheers,"" Biden told Modi in a toast at a state dinner. Modi said in reply: “You are soft spoken, but when it comes to action, you are very strong.”Though the countries are not formal treaty-bound allies and India has long relished its independence, Washington wants Delhi to be a strategic counterweight to China. While neither leader criticized Beijing directly in official statements, they alluded to the Xi Jinping-led government.""The dark clouds of coercion and confrontation are casting their shadow in the Indo Pacific,"" Modi told Congress. ""The stability of the region has become one of the central concerns of our partnership.""After Biden and Modi spoke privately for more than two hours, a joint statement included a warning of rising tensions and destabilizing actions in the East and South China Sea and stressed the importance of international law and freedom of navigation.""The challenges and opportunities facing the world in this century require that India and the United States work and lead together, and we are,"" Biden said as he welcomed Modi to the White House.The state dinner, held in a large, elaborately erected tent on the White House South Lawn, featured a number of Silicon Valley executives on the guest list, including Apple's Tim Cook, 23andMe CEO Anne Wojcicki, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, among others.Story continuesWith the slightly Indian-accented dinner, the Bidens followed a White House tradition of serving guests from abroad food that has faint echoes of home with a strong American bent.Modi is seeking to raise the status that India, the world's most populous country at 1.4 billion and fifth-largest economy, has on the world stage as a manufacturing and diplomatic powerhouse while navigating strained ties with China.His participation in a White House press conference itself was a reflection of contrasting political traditions, marking the first time Modi has taken questions in such a format in his nine-year tenure. He took one question apiece from an American and an Indian journalist selected in advance, and dismissed criticism about India's human rights record.Washington has been frustrated by India's close ties with Russia while Moscow wages war in Ukraine. Modi avoided direct mention of Russia, but told lawmakers the conflict was ""causing great pain in the region. Since it involves major powers, the outcomes are severe.""BOYCOTTS AND WELCOME CROWDSModi's visit was not without controversy. The speech to Congress, normally a bipartisan affirmation of a visiting leader from an allied nation, was boycotted by some liberal lawmakers, who cited the Modi government's treatment of India's Muslim minority.""I encourage my colleagues who stand for pluralism, tolerance and freedom of the press to join me in doing the same,"" Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted on Wednesday.Modi's speech to the Congress also drew a crowd of on-lookers who chanted ""Modi, Modi"" at applause lines.As some 7,000 well-wishers gathered for a colorful opening ceremony at the White House, a far smaller group of demonstrators gathered blocks away to protest the Biden administration's coziness with Modi, who leads the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party.Asked by a U.S. reporter about what steps he would take to improve the rights of Muslims and other minorities, Modi said ""there's absolutely no space for discrimination"" in India.Biden told reporters he and Modi had a straightforward discussion about democratic values.NEW US-INDIA DEALSThe two countries announced agreements on semiconductors, critical minerals, technology, space cooperation and defense cooperation and sales.Some are aimed at diversifying supply chains to reduce dependence on China. Others are aimed at cornering the market in advanced technologies that may feature on the battlefields of the future. They also ended disputes at the World Trade Organization, and India removed some tariffs on U.S. goods.The United States is India's largest trading partner but the U.S. has much larger trading relationships with China, the EU, and North American neighbors.Biden and Modi signed off on a deal to allow General Electric to produce jet engines in India to power Indian military aircraft, through an agreement with Hindustan Aeronautics.U.S. Navy ships in the region will be able to stop in Indian shipyards for repairs under a maritime agreement, and India will procure U.S.-made armed MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones.U.S. chipmaker Micron Technology's plans a $2.7 billion semiconductor testing and packaging unit, to be built in Modi's home state of Gujarat. The U.S. will also make it easier for skilled Indian workers to get and renew U.S. visas.India also agreed to join the U.S.-led Artemis Accords on space exploration and to work with NASA on a joint mission to the International Space Station in 2024.Indian Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra said the visit so far had been ""truly pathbreaking"" and New Delhi is confident it will help take the relationship with Washington to ""higher reaches"".""The richness of form and substance of the visit clearly tells you that it’s an exceptional, landmark, pathbreaking visit,"" Kwatra told reporters.""The decisions taken during the visit are truly transformative across a wide range of areas. Naturally, it is something which is possible when the countries have deep trust in each other and are in it for long term.""

After being top contributors in 2022, the positions were a headwind in Q1 2023. We believe there were a few main drivers of the underperformance and remain optimistic about the path forward. Two regulatory items arose in Q1, both of which we feel are immaterial to our broader thesis. First, a federal audit test for billing accuracy initiated five years ago ultimately revealed very little billing inadequacies at larger insurers but created short-term sentiment headwinds. The “RADV” (Risk Adjustment Data Validation) was finalized on January 30 with very little impact or fallout. Second, Medicare Advantage rate determinations were softer than expected. That is, advanced notice rate growth came in lower than expected, which weighed on the stocks. However, our view has remained unchanged as we believe the program maintains excellent standing. We believe the rate update simply kept the industry near its long-term trendline after some strong years. This view was reinforced at the close on the last day of Q1, as rates were effectively revised higher and the Biden administration committed to “protecting and strengthening Medicare”—a good sign, in our view.Nevertheless, our overarching view of structural winners being closely tied to their ability to reduce the overall cost of health care remains unchanged.

343,961b30be-0db0-3c02-b157-612cc2545308,EL,2023-06-23,16 Most Profitable Malls in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/16-most-profitable-malls-world-123808730.html,1687437488,STORY,['EL'],"[This article will look at the 16 most profitable malls in the world. It will also cover the latest trends observed in the world of shopping malls while highlighting the changes the pandemic has brought to the functioning of malls today. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can head straight to the 5 Most Profitable Malls in the World.During the height of the pandemic in April 2020, mall visits dropped by a staggering 91%. This decline was even more significant than the impact of the Great Recession. However, shopping malls started experiencing a resurgence in 2021, particularly in major cities, as people sought opportunities to venture out after months of restrictions.According to a study by INRIX, there was still demand for in-person retail experiences, and retailers are optimistic about the future. The recent surge in mall visits may have been driven by factors such as ""revenge spending"" and pent-up demand, indicating that people were not completely avoiding physical retail experiences.However, the rise of e-commerce and online shopping posed challenges to brick-and-mortar retailers and malls even before the pandemic. Online platforms like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) gained popularity, diverting consumer spending away from traditional retailers. Shopping malls faced closures and declining foot traffic amid the pandemic like never before.Despite the struggle, in 2022, there was a notably high resurgence in mall visits driven by people seeking a sense of normalcy after the pandemic. Yet, this is unlikely to be a long-term trend as online shopping offers convenience and competitive pricing. Traditional retailers and malls will face ongoing challenges in the coming years.Interestingly, how profitable it is to own a shopping mall can be closely tied to the ongoing debate about the death or revival of malls in today's age. This profitability hinges on three crucial factors: the property's purchase price, management efficiency, and the shopping mall's distinctive features. When these elements align as intended, investors can expect an annual return from 5% to 20%.Story continues2023 Trends to ObserveShopping malls are evolving into lifestyle centers offering shopping and entertainment, catering to post-pandemic consumers seeking retail experiences and leisure activities. Outlet malls are rebranding as destination shopping centers to attract digitally native brands and provide a comprehensive customer experience.The Superette in Boston Seaport, launched recently, is one such example that offers a unique concept inspired by European-style settings. The center features a charming tree-lined courtyard where visitors can find a mix of digitally-native brands, such as Lunya and Framebridge, and local cafes, bars, and restaurants. The design aims to capture the attention of people passing by, encouraging them to explore the boutiques and retailers while going about their daily activities, whether working out or getting a manicure. By creating an inviting atmosphere, The Superette aimed to merge leisure and shopping seamlessly, providing a vibrant space where people can engage with various experiences and discover new brands.Mall kiosks drive international expansion for retailers, allowing them to establish a presence in new markets. Moreover, pop-up stores have become a powerful tool for young retail brands, offering visibility and the flexibility of short-term leases to generate excitement and encourage repeat visits.For example, EssilorLuxottica has launched its first Prada Eyewear pop-up store in collaboration with Gebr Heinemann and Unifree Duty-Free at Istanbul Airport. The pop-up store, which will run until July 16th, is inspired by Prada's spring/summer 2023 campaign.Furthermore, malls are embracing the digital age by exploring retail media, live streaming, and other digital shopping strategies to adapt to changing consumer behaviors and attract foot traffic. This indicates a shift towards a more dynamic and diverse mall landscape that seeks to meet the evolving demands of modern shoppers.Majid Al Futtaim has announced the launch of the Mall of the Metaverse, Dubai's first virtual mall, catering to customers seeking enhanced digital experiences across retail, entertainment, and leisure. The mall will feature well-known brands such as Carrefour, VOX Cinemas, and Samsung Store. This development highlights the increasing demand for digital experiences as Futtaim aims to leverage behavioral science and data to deliver what customers desire to improve their shopping experience.While Iran mall is the biggest mall in the world, area wise at 21 million sqft, the Dubai Mall is considered to be world's most popular shopping and entertainment destination, covering over 13 million sqft with 1,200 stores, including 70 high-fashion outlets and renowned brands from The Estée Lauder Companies Inc (NYSE:EL), Ralph Lauren Corp (NYSE:RL), and Tiffany and Co (NYSE:TIF). In the 2019 expansion, Dubai Mall Zabeel added 15,000 sqm of lifestyle space, new dining and retail options, and 3,000 parking spaces. On the other hand, the largest mall in the US is the Mall of America, with an area of 5.6 million sqft.The New Era for Shopping MallsAccording to a report by analytics firm Placer.ai, mall owners are adopting innovative strategies to reinvent themselves and attract visitors, resulting in increased foot traffic. The report analyzed nine US malls that introduced unique tenants and experiences, such as a casino, kids' play spaces, improved food options, and an American Ninja Warrior Adventure Park. Each of these malls witnessed a rise in visitor numbers.The reinvention of malls reflects a shift in their purpose, focusing on entertainment and enhanced dining experiences. Ethan Chernofsky, Vice President of Marketing at Placer.ai, stated that malls are undergoing a fundamental reimagining and transitioning from a retail-centric model to one that offers diverse entertainment options. This shift is driving positive impacts on mall businesses.For instance, the MainPlace Mall in Santa Ana, California, experienced an 18% increase in monthly visitors compared to the pre-pandemic period after opening the American Ninja Warrior Adventure Park. Similarly, the York Galleria Mall in Pennsylvania saw a 31.4% spike in visits after introducing the Hollywood Casino.The report indicated that foot traffic at Westfield Valley Fair increased by more than 20% compared to pre-pandemic levels during Eataly's opening week. Similarly, 99 Ranch Market's presence turned Westfield Oakridge Mall into a popular one-stop shopping destination, leading to a 10% rise in visits.Including entertainment-focused spaces like Surge Entertainment at Pierre Bossier Mall in Louisiana led to longer waiting times for visitors, with median waiting times consistently exceeding 75 minutes.16 Most Profitable Malls in the WorldPixabay/Public DomainMethodologyWe have determined the ranking of the most profitable malls in the world by their sales per square foot, a standardized measure of profitability.

Let’s take a closer look at each.WalmartWalmart offers a diverse blend of products at reasonable prices, allowing it to capture revenue from lower and higher-end consumers who decide to ‘trade down’ and save their cash. The stock is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The retail titan posted strong results in its latest release, delivering year-over-year global eCommerce growth of 26% and raising its FY24 outlook. Quarterly revenue totaled $152.2 billion, ahead of expectations and improving 7% from the year-ago period.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, Walmart’s 21.3% trailing twelve-month ROE is certainly worth highlighting, reflecting a higher level of efficiency in generating profits from existing assets. As shown below, the current value is well above the Zacks Retail and Wholesale sector average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAnd to top it off, Walmart is a member of the elite Dividend Aristocrat group, putting its shareholder-friendly nature on full display. Shares currently yield 1.5% annually, with the payout growing 2% over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesMcDonald’sWe’re all familiar with the restaurant titan McDonald’s, seeing those golden arches at seemingly every stop. The stock is presently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with earnings expectations increasing across the board.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchShares may not entice value-focused investors, further reflected by the Style Score of “D” for Value. MCD shares currently trade at a 26.6X forward earnings multiple, modestly above the five-year median and Zacks sector average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStill, investors haven’t minded forking up the premium for shares given the company’s favorable growth trajectory, with earnings forecasted to climb 10% on 8% higher revenues in its current fiscal year (FY23). And in FY24, estimates call for an additional 9% uptick in earnings and 7% sales growth.Procter &amp; GambleProcter &amp; Gamble, a current Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), posted better-than-expected results and provided optimistic guidance in its latest release, helping shares close 3.5% higher post-earnings. Earnings improved 3% year-over-year, whereas revenue saw growth of 4%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchProcter &amp; Gamble is a classic dividend stock, holding the ranks of not only a Dividend Aristocrat but a Dividend King as well. PG shares currently yield 2.5% annually, with the company carrying a solid 6.3% five-year annualized growth rate.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, it’s worth noting that shares have recently found support near the $142 per share level, a previous resistance level for the stock. This ‘resistance-support flip’ is illustrated in the chart below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineFor those seeking a more conservative approach, low-beta stocks provide precisely that. These stocks are less susceptible to the broader market’s movements, helping to limit those spooky price swings.And all three above – Walmart WMT, McDonald’s MCD, and Procter &amp; Gamble PG – could be great considerations for those looking for stability.All three sport a favorable Zacks Rank and have an established track record of success, undeniably significant benefits.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

345,e1a6b81e-310c-3058-b413-3f6bfd667ed8,PG,2023-06-23,How Procter & Gamble is using AI to market to its consumers more effectively,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/procter-gamble-using-ai-market-170832903.html,1687453712,VIDEO,['PG'],"[AI may be everywhere, but not all companies are using it the same way. Marc Pritchard, Procter &amp; Gamble Chief Brand Officer spoke with Yahoo Finance Live at the Cannes Lions International Festival about how P&amp;G is using AI in its marketing.Video Transcript[MUSIC PLAYING]BRIAN SOZZI: I'm Brian Sozzi here with Brad Smith at the Cannes Lions Festival Creativity. Joining us now is P&amp;G Chief Brand Officer Marc Pritchard. Marc, great to get some time with you here. And we're really diving into the business behind Cannes Lions. There's a lot of big activity here, a lot of key meetings. From a P&amp;G perspective, who are you meeting with, and why are you here, and what do you hope to achieve?MARC PRITCHARD: Well, why we're here is, we kind of consider ourselves the hardest working company in the festival because we are here to learn, get inspired, and figure out how we can continue to grow our brands through creativity. I just did a keynote speech on creativity that grows markets. It's the highest order ambition because in our categories, which are the cleaning health and hygiene products that people use every day, the best growth is market growth.And so that's what creativity should do. It should be inclusive, insightful, and impactful because that's what's going to make the market better, and it makes consumers' lives better. You attract more people in the market, you delight them with better performing products, and they reward you with buying more and making the market grow.BRIAN SOZZI: I think a lot of investors on our platform realize that this is a different P&amp;G. Notably, over the past, let's say, three years, a real innovation burst, cool names on these products, products that do different things. What is the secret sauce to getting consumers to buy some of these newer products? And how do you stand up the innovation in the storytelling behind the scene?MARC PRITCHARD: Secret sauce is, focus on the consumers, focus on what are the consumers' needs. What are their jobs to be done, the problems to be solved, the habits that they need to form? And then identify how you can then create a superior performing product, a noticeably superior performing product in a noticeably superior performing package.Story continuesAnd then communicate that in such a way that is insightful and tells them what the product is, how it works, what it does, why it's better, how it's going to delight them, and then reach as close to 100% of people you possibly can.BRIAN SOZZI: Marc, I've used so much of-- what, power wash and Microban. I can't stop using this.MARC PRITCHARD: Dawn Powerwash is an amazing product.BRIAN SOZZI: It's the sprayer bottle. The bottle, it's great. It just--MARC PRITCHARD: Based on an insight from the consumer, which is that people were washing, one dish at a time. So, let's make it easy for them. Spray, wipe, rinse, done.BRIAN SOZZI: Sorry, Brad. Brad, get in here because I could go all day talking about some of these products.BRAD SMITH: I mean, you know, they're truly amazing products, and we've seen them really evolve over so many years. And what's also evolved is the environment that you're selling into the consumer, the culture as well. One of the themes that we've been discussing here this week-- and we've heard from some of the chief brand officers like yourself, is cultural relevance. What does that look like at P&amp;G as you do approach the market?MARC PRITCHARD: The way we think about it, Brad, is that, our job is to make sure that we serve all consumers and each individual consumer based on what their needs are, and do it in an inclusive way and do it in a way where possible that's sustainable. So for example, what we do is, we try to identify, how can we best meet the needs of the Black consumers, White consumers, Hispanic consumers, Asian consumers, native consumers, LGBTQ consumers, and in the US and in different markets around the world.So it's understanding unique insights, and when you understand those unique insights that allows you to be able to serve them with products that meet their unique needs, and that is what's most relevant, particularly in our products because our products are everyday household and personal care products that people want to know how they work and they want to know why they're better for them. That is what creativity that's inclusive is about, and that is very culturally relevant.BRAD SMITH: You know, I view the-- your role is incredibly important because it is the data you get and the messages you tell that drive the financial statements. It drives the earnings calls and the earnings releases that a lot of people a lot of investors on Yahoo Finance ultimately read. What new needs are you seeing emerge in consumers? And what should investors know about what P&amp;G is about to stand product wise going into 2024?MARC PRITCHARD: Well, look, our strategy is just crystal clear, we focus on superior performing products, packaging, communication, retail execution and value fueled by productivity and constantly constructively disrupting. The constructive disruption aspect of it affects us here in creativity because there's so many new mediums in which we can reach people. From a media standpoint, what investors should know, and they've heard this a couple of times, we want to reach, mass reach-- it's close to 100%, with precision.We don't want excess frequency. We want to get to as close to 100% as we possibly can, and we're doing that on some brands. We're close to more than 90% reach on tide. We're close to 95% reach on Pampers. But that is a very narrow audience because it's just diapering households, and we do that through data. We do that through programmatic spending, where we're able to precisely reach people.We then are also using AI to figure out how we can optimize the creative execution. Pampers has 140 different pieces of creative optimized through this program called AI Studios, which is allows us to be able to test ads versus a big database of reactions and figure out how we can make it better.That's a way in which what we're doing, is, we're giving precision, and we're increasing effectiveness and reaching as many people as possible, which gives us a runway for growth and market growth, of course.BRAD SMITH: Just briefly, how far are we from AI telling me whether or not I'm using the wrong shampoo, or the wrong lotion, or the wrong detergent?BRIAN SOZZI: Well, we;re staying in the same hotel, Brand. You use a great shampoo. I just want to let the [INAUDIBLE] know.[CHUCKLING]MARC PRITCHARD: First of all, I think-- there's a lot of discussion about AI here, and there is are lots of applications already being used for AI. The one that I just mentioned, is to figure out how you can get better creative and improve the productivity. What I could do is, at some point, we'll be able to tell you those kinds of things because it'll understand-- and there's a way in which you can do dynamic content creation that allows you to be able to then reach you based more on what your needs are. So lots of practical applications.The way we're looking at it is, in terms of what are the practical applications that make our media better and more precise and be able to reach the people we want and make our advertising more effective so we can have greater impact and drive more growth?BRIAN SOZZI: All right, we'll leave it there. I know you're a busy guy. Please tell Jon Moeller, your CEO, that we'll talk to him in a few weeks for earnings. So I look forward to talking to him. Marc Pritchard, good to see you. Brian Sozzi, heading it back over to you.]"

VNO has endured considerable downgrades to its earnings expectations over the last 18 months giving it a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).CompanyVornado Realty Trust is a leading US real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in commercial properties. Established in 1982, Vornado owns, develops, and manages prime office buildings, retail centers, and residential properties in major markets such as New York City and Washington, DC. The company focuses on strategic investments, value creation through renovations and repositioning. Vornado is also recognized for its commitment to sustainability and is the largest owner of LEED-certified property in the United States, with more than 27 million square feet of LEED-certified properties. Challenged Environment Shares in the VNO REIT have suffered over the last five years, down -72% over that time. This is significantly worse than the industry average and broad market. Vornado has a high concentration of buildings in metropolitan areas that have changed dramatically since the Covid-19 pandemic.While office buildings in NYC were once thought of as premier assets, they have been completely upended by the transition to work from home. While top of the market assets, like those owned by Vornado have held up a bit better than the rest of the market, Manhattan landlords are still struggling to fill their properties. Q1 office vacancy in Manhattan was estimated at 16% and analysts expect more distress in the sector.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEarnings EstimatesRecord high vacancies, as well as a high interest rate environment, which strains real estate businesses does not bode well for VNO’s earnings expectations. Analysts are in near unanimous agreement in downgrading estimates across timeframes.Story continuesCurrent quarter earnings have been revised lower by -4.5% over the last two months and are expected to decline -23% YoY. FY23 earnings have been cut by -4.2% and are projected to slide -20% YoY.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchValuationBecause of the severe decline VNO’s share prices over the last two years, its valuation is at a 10-year low. Vornado Realty Trust is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 6.2x, which is well below the industry average of 14.7x, and below its 10-year median of 18x.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConclusionVornado Realty Trust is under tremendous pressure, and it does not look like things will be getting better anytime soon. While the 9.7% dividend yield may have been the only thing drawing in investors today it may not be worth the risk. Vornado announced a -29% cut in the dividend in January, and in April announced that all dividend payments will be postponed until the end of 2023.Because of the reasons listed above it is recommended that investors steer clear of Vornado Realty Trust.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(TOL) Soars to 52-Week High, Time to Cash Out?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/toll-brothers-inc-tol-soars-131503748.html,1687439703,STORY,"['TOL', 'DHI']","[Have you been paying attention to shares of Toll Brothers (TOL)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 17.1% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $76.55 in the previous session. Toll Brothers has gained 52.7% since the start of the year compared to the 25.3% move for the Zacks Construction sector and the 43% return for the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on May 23, 2023, Toll Brothers reported EPS of $2.85 versus consensus estimate of $1.89.For the current fiscal year, Toll Brothers is expected to post earnings of $10.61 per share on $9.33 billion in revenues. This represents a 6.74% change in EPS on a -9.24% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $10.45 per share on $9.95 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of -1.51% and 6.7%, respectively.Valuation MetricsToll Brothers may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Toll Brothers has a Value Score of A. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.Story continuesIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 7.2X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 9.8X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 6.9X versus its peer group's average of 5.5X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 0.65. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Zacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Toll Brothers currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Toll Brothers meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though Toll Brothers shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.How Does TOL Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of TOL have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI). DHI has a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of A, a Growth Score of D, and a Momentum Score of B.Earnings were strong last quarter. D.R. Horton, Inc. beat our consensus estimate by 43.68%, and for the current fiscal year, DHI is expected to post earnings of $11.21 per share on revenue of $32.3 billion.Shares of D.R. Horton, Inc. have gained 11.8% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 10.61X and a P/CF of 6.96X.The Building Products - Home Builders industry is in the top 7% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for TOL and DHI, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(AAL) reached a significant support level, and could be a good pick for investors from a technical perspective. Recently, AAL's 50-day simple moving average broke out above its 200-day moving average; this is known as a ""golden cross.""A golden cross is a technical chart pattern that can signify a potential bullish breakout. It's formed from a crossover involving a security's short-term moving average breaking above a longer-term moving average, with the most common moving averages being the 50-day and the 200-day, since bigger time periods tend to form stronger breakouts.Golden crosses have three key stages that investors look out for. It starts with a downtrend in a stock's price that eventually bottoms out, followed by the stock's shorter moving average crossing over its longer moving average and triggering a trend reversal. The final stage is when a stock continues the upward climb to higher prices.A golden cross contrasts with a death cross, another widely-followed chart pattern that suggests bearish momentum could be on the horizon.AAL could be on the verge of a breakout after moving 18.1% higher over the last four weeks. Plus, the company is currently a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank.The bullish case only gets stronger once investors take into account AAL's positive earnings outlook for the current quarter. There have been 8 upwards revisions compared to none lower over the past 60 days, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has moved up as well.Investors should think about putting AAL on their watchlist given the ultra-important technical indicator and positive move in earnings estimates.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

DGX recently completed its previously-announced acquisition of Haystack Oncology. The acquisition is intended to improve patient outcomes through early, accurate detection of residual or recurring cancer.Based on circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA), Haystack Oncology created a highly-sensitive minimal-residual disease (“MRD”) testing tool to help with the early detection of residual or reoccurring cancer and to better guide treatment choices. This MRD technology will be used by Quest Diagnostics to create new blood-based clinical lab services for solid tumour cancers that will be made available starting in 2024.The latest move will expand Quest Diagnostics’ portfolio of cancer services, fortifying the Diagnostic Solutions business.About Haystack OncologyIn order to report residual, recurring, or resistant disease earlier than other MRD tests, Haystack Oncology uses the most advanced ctDNA detection technology to cut through the clutter and identify the lowest quantities of ctDNA in blood.Strategic ImplicationsThe acquisition of Haystack is a significant step toward transforming two decades of top-tier liquid biopsy research and development into clinical laboratory services that are incredibly dependable and widely available. By combining its strengths in screening, pathology and sequencing with Haystack's liquid biopsy technology, DGX will likely dominate the rapidly expanding MRD sector.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe acquisition will leverage Quest Diagnostic's capabilities and size in pathology, genomics, and oncology. Through its AmeriPath specialist pathology-diagnostics division, Quest Diagnostics employs around 400 pathologists and has over 7,000 patient access points for the collection of blood and other specimens in the United States. The ability to find patient-specific mutations for Haystack's tumor-informed MRD strategy is another aspect of Quest Diagnotics’ proficiency in next-generation tumour sequencing.Story continuesIndustry ProspectsPer a report by Grand View Research, the global minimal residual disease testing market size was estimated at $1.89 million in 2022 and is expected to expand at a CAGR of 11.45%. The minimal residual disease testing market is witnessing growth due to the increasing prevalence of cancer, increasing consumer awareness for therapy and increasing funding for research with an increasing disposable income in emerging economies.Recent DevelopmentsThis month, Quest Diagnostics partnered with Coriell Life Sciences to provide select medical plan members with pharmacogenomics testing services. The test indicates how different genes and their variants affect an individual’s reaction to drugs. The pharmacogenomics test is a voluntary, no cost DNA-testing programme that uses a saliva collection kit that can be used at home to analyze a person's DNA. The effectiveness of the patient's existing drugs is evaluated in light of the test results. The test results can improve pharmaceutical effectiveness and safety and also assist in selecting the appropriate drug and dosage. Through testing, each patient receives personalized, actionable clinical recommendations and drug management regimens.In May 2023, Quest Diagnostics announced that the RestoreU Dementia Panel, a risk assessment and care plan service developed by uMETHOD Health, a health technology company specializing in precision medicine for chronic diseases, would be made available nationwide. This would enable doctors to fill in any care gaps for patients with cognitive decline. The RestoreU service uses artificial intelligence (AI) created by uMETHOD to build personalized care plans that support cognitive care standards and aid clinicians in providing better patient care.Price PerformanceShares of the company have gained 2.9% in the past year against the industry’s fall of 5.1%.Zacks Rank and Key PicksQuest Diagnostics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

(CSCO) is a Trending Stock",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-cisco-systems-130013126.html,1687438813,STORY,['CSCO'],"[Cisco Systems (CSCO) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this seller of routers, switches, software and services have returned +5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.3% change. The Zacks Computer - Networking industry, to which Cisco belongs, has gained 3.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Cisco is expected to post earnings of $1.06 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +27.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.81 points to a change of +13.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.04 indicates a change of +6.2% from what Cisco is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Cisco is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Cisco, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $15.05 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +14.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $56.84 billion and $58.3 billion estimates indicate +10.3% and +2.6% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCisco reported revenues of $14.57 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.5%. EPS of $1 for the same period compares with $0.87 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.39 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.27%. The EPS surprise was +3.09%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Cisco is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Cisco. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
