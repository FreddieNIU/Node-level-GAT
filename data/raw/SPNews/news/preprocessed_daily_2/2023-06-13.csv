1,24779cfc-1a30-3a60-8590-ec31b2fce4d8,SCHW,2023-06-13,Top-Ranked ETFs to Buy on Small-Cap Comeback,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-ranked-etfs-buy-small-140500342.html,1686578700,STORY,"['^RUT', '^GSPC', 'SCHW']","[After lagging this year, small-cap stocks have been showing strong momentum since the start of June, beating the broader market. This is especially true as the Russell 2000 Index has jumped 6.6% so far this month, outpacing the gain of 2.9% for the S&amp;P 500 Index. The outperformance came on the back of solid jobs data, which indicates a resilient economy and accelerated the bets for a pause in Fed rate hike (read: 5 Best Performing ETFs of the New Bull Market).While there are many options available in this space to tap the strong trend in the space, investors should consider ETFs having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). iShares Core S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF IJR, iShares Russell 2000 ETF IWM, Vanguard Small-Cap Value ETF VBR, Schwab U.S. Small-Cap ETF SCHA and iShares Russell 2000 Value ETF IWN could be solid pure plays.Inside the OutperformanceThe labor market is not showing any signs of cooling down. The economy added 339,000 jobs in May, up from April’s revised job gains number of 294,000, and hotter than the 190,000 jobs that economists were expecting. This has offered Fed a chance to stick with the wait-and-see approach. The odds favor the central bank maintaining short-term interest rates steady, with a reconsideration likely at the July meeting (read: 4 Sector ETFs &amp; Stocks to Bet on Superb May Jobs Data).According to CMEGroup's Fedwatch tool, traders see a 72% chance of the U.S. central bank holding interest rates at the current 5-5.25% range in its Jun 13-14 policy meeting. This pause in rate hikes could potentially be supportive of small-cap stock performance as it raises the likelihood that the U.S. economy can avoid a recession. Given the economic sensitivity of small caps, this could be a significant factor in their performance.As small-cap companies are more domestically tied, these are poised to outperform when the economy improves. Further, they are considered safer and better plays if political issues or economic turmoil creep into the picture as the pint-sized stocks generate most of their revenues from the domestic market. Currently, geopolitical risk and global economic slowdown are major concerns for the stock market performance.Further, the relative valuation of small-cap stocks supports continued outperformance versus large-cap stocks. At present, small-cap stocks sell for 14.4 times 2023 estimated earnings, while the S&amp;P 500 is 19.5 times, marking one of the largest valuation gaps since the dot com bubble. This valuation gap supports continued outperformance against large-cap stocks.Story continuesETFs to BuyWe have profiled the above-mentioned ETFs here:iShares Core S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF (IJR)iShares Core S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF offers exposure to U.S. small-cap stocks and follows the S&amp;P SmallCap 600 Index. iShares Core S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF holds 669 stocks in its basket, with none accounting for more than 1.9% of assets.

If you want to read about some more mining companies, go directly to Top 5 Mining Countries in the World.The mining industry is a key player in the global economy, providing essential raw materials that fuel various industries and contribute to economic growth. From precious metals to fossil fuels, minerals extracted from the earth's crust are integral to manufacturing, construction, energy production, and technological advancements. In this article, we delve into the top 20 mining countries in the world, exploring their mineral wealth, production capabilities, and the significant role they play in shaping the global mining landscape.Mining has been an essential human activity for centuries, driving exploration and extraction in pursuit of valuable resources. Today, mining operations span across continents, with countries harnessing their geological advantages to access and utilize mineral reserves. These resources serve as the backbone of industrial development, enabling nations to meet domestic demands, stimulate exports, and foster economic prosperity.Mining is the process of extracting minerals and other valuable resources from the earth. It involves several stages, beginning with exploration to identify potential mineral deposits. Once a deposit is discovered, feasibility studies are conducted to assess the viability of extraction. If deemed economically viable, mining operations commence, involving excavation, blasting, and transportation of ore to processing facilities. Finally, the processed minerals are refined and prepared for distribution and use in various industries.The mining industry operates on a global scale, with countries around the world participating in mineral extraction. Each country possesses a unique geological composition, leading to variations in the types of minerals available for mining. Some countries are rich in mineral resources, while others have limited reserves. These disparities contribute to the formation of mining countries that are distinguished by their mineral wealth and their ability to exploit and process those resources.Story continuesSome of the top firms working in the mining sector around the world include Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE), Wheaton Precious Metals Corp. (NYSE:WPM), and Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX), among others discussed in detail below. Factors affecting current market situationsThe current market situation of the mining industry is influenced by several factors. Geopolitical events, economic conditions, technological advancements, and environmental concerns all impact the sector's dynamics. Fluctuations in commodity prices, changes in demand patterns, and shifts towards sustainable practices are some of the key challenges and opportunities faced by the industry.In recent years, the mining industry has been undergoing significant changes driven by environmental and social considerations. Environmental sustainability has become a critical focus, with mining companies adopting practices that minimize ecological impact, reduce carbon emissions, and promote responsible resource management. Social responsibility is also a key aspect, with a growing emphasis on community engagement, local employment opportunities, and indigenous rights protection. Governments and regulatory bodies have implemented stricter regulations to ensure sustainable mining practices and minimize negative environmental and social impacts.Ranking the top mining countries in the world Ranking the top 20 mining countries provides valuable insights into the global distribution of mineral resources and highlights the countries that excel in this sector. It is important to note that the rankings can vary depending on the specific minerals considered. Different countries specialize in different resources based on their geological structure, resulting in varying levels of production and revenue generation. For instance, countries like Australia and China are prominent in iron ore production, while South Africa and Russia dominate in precious metals such as gold and platinum.The ranking of mining countries is a complex process that considers various factors related to mineral production and the financial impact of mining activities. Several methodologies can be used to rank mining countries, with each approach focusing on specific criteria. Common metrics include mineral production volume, export rate, revenue generated from mining activities, foreign direct investments, and employment opportunities created by the industry. By analyzing these metrics, a comprehensive ranking can be established to highlight the leading mining countries based on their contributions to the sector.The rankings shed light on the dynamic nature of the mining industry and the factors that contribute to a country's success in this field. Geological factors, political stability, investment climate, technological advancements, and environmental regulations all play a role in shaping a nation's mining landscape. By exploring the top 20 mining countries, we can uncover the strategies and initiatives that have propelled these nations to the forefront of the industry.Minerals extracted in one country often find their way into the value chains of various industries across the world. This highlights the importance of international trade and cooperation within the mining sector, as countries rely on each other to meet their resource needs. Understanding the leading mining countries allows us to comprehend the complexities and dependencies of the global mining market. Our MethodologyHere, the countries are ranked on the basis of two metrics that are Mineral Production Volume and Export Value. When countries are ranked globally, a combination of these two factors is typically considered. Data on mineral production volume and export value is collected from various sources, including government reports, industry publications, trade statistics, and international databases. This data provides information on the production volumes and the value of mineral and metal exports for each country.The total volume or quantity of minerals and metals produced by each country is calculated by aggregating the production volumes of various minerals and metals. This involves summing up the individual production volumes for each commodity. The total value of mineral and metal exports for each country is calculated by multiplying the exported volume of each commodity by its corresponding market price. The export values of all relevant minerals and metals are summed up to obtain the total export value.Countries can be compared and ranked based on both the mineral production volume and the export value. Typically, countries with high production volumes and significant export values rank higher in the list. The specific weight or importance given to each metric may vary depending on the methodology used or the specific ranking criteria. The rankings should be analyzed and interpreted in the context of the global mining industry. Factors such as the diversity of commodities, the value-added processing of minerals and the stability of export markets can also influence a country's ranking. Additional factors or metrics, such as reserves or investment attractiveness, may be considered to provide a more comprehensive assessment.It's worth noting that rankings based on these metrics are subject to data availability, accuracy, and variations in methodology used by different organizations or reports. Therefore, it's important to refer to reliable sources and consider multiple metrics when assessing the top mining countries. By examining their mining industries, mineral resources, export value and market situations, we gain a deeper understanding of these countries' contributions to the global mining sector.Top 20 Mining Countries in the WorldImage by Tshekiso Tebalo from PixabayTop Mining Countries in the World20.

4,ed3b2c73-e4d7-310a-a9bf-674cc915fc58,NUE,2023-06-13,Investors Heavily Search Nucor Corporation (NUE): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-nucor-corporation-130012146.html,1686574812,STORY,['NUE'],"[Nucor (NUE) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this steel company have returned +4.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.6% change. The Zacks Steel - Producers industry, to which Nucor belongs, has gained 4.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Nucor is expected to post earnings of $5.32 per share, indicating a change of -45% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.4% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $17 points to a change of -41% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +1.7%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.85 indicates a change of -30.3% from what Nucor is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -5%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Nucor.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Nucor, the consensus sales estimate of $8.99 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -23.8%. The $35.45 billion and $33.24 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -14.6% and -6.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNucor reported revenues of $8.71 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -17%. EPS of $4.45 for the same period compares with $7.67 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.5 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.45%. The EPS surprise was +16.8%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nucor is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nucor. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

One such ratio, Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF), can work wonders in stock picking if used prudently. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis – the lower the number, the better. Unum Group, General Motors Company, American International Group, Inc. and G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. boast a low P/CF ratio.Why P/CF Ratio?You must be wondering why we are considering this when the most widely used valuation metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E). Well, an important factor that makes P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing a company’s financial health.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. Then again, cash flow is quite reliable. Net cash flow unveils how much money a company generates and how effectively management is deploying the same.A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company’s liquid assets. This gives the company the means to settle debt, meet its expenses, reinvest in the business, endure downturns and finally undertake shareholder-friendly moves. Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which, in turn, lowers its flexibility to support these endeavors.Story continuesHowever, an investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and take into account the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chances of falling into a value trap.Here are four of the 11 stocks that qualified the screening:Unum Group, which provides financial protection benefit solutions, sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has an expected EPS growth rate of 8.4% for three-five years.

(NYSE:CF) Potentially Undervalued?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cf-industries-holdings-inc-nyse-155503103.html,1686585303,STORY,['CF'],"[Let's talk about the popular CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CF). The company's shares saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s take a look at CF Industries Holdings’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for CF Industries Holdings What Is CF Industries Holdings Worth?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 18% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy CF Industries Holdings today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $82.46, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because CF Industries Holdings’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.Can we expect growth from CF Industries Holdings?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. However, with an extremely negative double-digit change in profit expected over the next couple of years, near-term growth is certainly not a driver of a buy decision. It seems like high uncertainty is on the cards for CF Industries Holdings, at least in the near future.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? CF seems fairly priced right now, but given the uncertainty from negative returns in the future, this could be the right time to reduce the risk in your portfolio. Is your current exposure to the stock optimal for your total portfolio? And is the opportunity cost of holding a negative-outlook stock too high? Before you make a decision on the stock, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on CF for a while, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. The price seems to be trading at fair value, which means there’s less benefit from mispricing. Furthermore, the negative growth outlook increases the risk of holding the stock. However, there are also other important factors we haven’t considered today, which can help gel your views on CF should the price fluctuate below its true value.If you'd like to know more about CF Industries Holdings as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

This will provide sponsors with a broader range of financing options and, thereby, significantly boost Huntington's commercial capabilities by leveraging Huntington’s banking platform.""We are committed to enhancing our sponsor coverage and positioning Huntington for success as we respond to the growth of institutional ownership,"" remarked Tizu Menelik, executive managing director of Huntington Specialty and Corporate Banking.Scott Kleinman, president of Huntington Commercial Bank, noted, ""The addition of this team better positions Huntington to serve the full range of needs across commercial clients and is yet another example of our targeted strategic investments to expand our commercial expertise and capabilities.""HBAN’s expansion of the subscription finance business will offer greater fee opportunities across Middle Market, Corporate and Capstone businesses, per management. In first-quarter 2023, non-interest income moved up 3% year over year to $512 million. The rise mainly stemmed from the higher card and payment processing income, and capital market fees, partially offset by lower service charges on deposit accounts, mortgage banking and leasing revenues.Markedly, in June 2022, Huntington completed the acquisition of Capstone Partners, a top-tier middle-market investment bank and advisory firm. The acquisition has enhanced the complementary capabilities of the capital market business and is expected to drive fee income in the ongoing year.Fee income aside, HBAN’s top line is likely to be supported by higher net interest income (NII). The bank is one of the top 20 banks in the United States by deposits and it is focused on acquiring the industry's best deposit franchise. This has supported HBAN to be active on the lending front and strengthen its balance sheet.Story continuesHence, with strong loan growth and expectations of interest rates remaining high in the near term, Huntington’s NII and the yield on interest-earning assets are expected to witness decent growth. The company is projecting 2023 NII (excluding Paycheck Protection Program or PPP and Purchase Accounting Accretion) growth of 6-9%.In the past 30 days, shares of HBAN have gained 14.5% compared with the industry’s rise of 12.6%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

If you want to skip our discussion, you can see the top 5 Stocks Insiders and Billionaires Are Crazy About.On June 5 former Fed vice chairman, Roger Ferguson, appeared in an interview on CNBC where he shared his insights on the economy and how he expects the Fed to move forward. Ferguson noted that the jobs report for May showed that the economy remains strong, despite showing a few weaker-than-expected elements. However, he emphasized that the overall narrative remains the same and the question now is whether there will be a pause in rate hikes. Ferguson noted that even if there is a pause in rate hikes, it will be to reassess the situation rather than signaling the end of the tightening cycle.Regarding why the Fed might consider a pause despite the strong jobs report, Ferguson outlined three factors. First, the Fed has already implemented significant monetary tightening, which could prompt a pause to evaluate the impact and gather more information. Second, although the overall economy demonstrates strength, there is a slight uptick in the unemployment rate. While he cautioned against overemphasizing this development, it could contribute to the case for a pause. Lastly, with the debt ceiling issue resolved, the Treasury will be borrowing money, leading to rising interest rates and tighter financial conditions. Ferguson believes that these factors, in combination, may lead to a pause with a ""60-40, go versus pause discussion"".Ferguson commented about the possibility of a mild to moderate recession, or a soft landing, and expressed optimism in line with Fed chairman Jay Powell's comments. Despite previously leaning towards the likelihood of a recession, Ferguson acknowledged the economy's underlying strength which gives hope for withstanding rising interest rates and achieving a soft landing.Ferguson also spoke about consumer strength and acknowledged the concerns being raised by bankers about excessive consumer spending. He pointed out that the labor market remains tight and wages have gone up by 4% to 5%. He also noted that though consumer spending remains strong, it is occurring against the backdrop of rising wages and a tight labor market. Ferguson believes that wage growth is one of the primary drivers behind the Fed's decision to continue its hiking cycle.Story continuesRegarding the unemployment rate, Ferguson highlighted that a low unemployment rate of around 3.8% is inconsistent with the Fed's inflation target of 2% and restoring stability in the economy. He noted that in order to achieve a more balanced economy and bring inflation down to the Fed's target of 2%, the unemployment rate might need to rise above 4%. Ferguson stressed the significance of wage growth as a more accurate gauge for the Fed's concerns and noted that recent wage reports suggest that the current wage levels are still inconsistent with reaching the Fed's target of 2%.Moving forward, Ferguson expects one or two more rate hikes within the next three meetings before a potential pause. Additionally, he cautioned against perceiving a pause as an indication of the end of the tightening cycle. Instead, he emphasized that it will lead to a wait-and-see period, contingent upon incoming data.As we navigate through the Fed's decision-making process and its implications for the broader economy, it becomes increasingly important to consider insider activity in the stock market. The actions of insiders, including billionaires and individuals with in-depth knowledge of a company's operations, can offer a glimpse into market sentiment and confidence.

(NASDAQ:ZD) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Ziff Davis, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZD), is a leading internet and software services company, operating through two segments: business cloud services and digital media. The combined company has grown revenues for 25 consecutive years with high margins and attractive returns on invested capital. The cloud services business provides niche products to small and mid-sized businesses and enjoys a high percentage of recurring revenues, low churn, and high margins. Ziff Davis’ digital media business generates revenue through subscriptions to websites it owns, including tech, entertainment, and culture site Mashable, and through advertising on those sites. Ziff Davis’ advertising business model is unique in that it is almost entirely performance-based, as opposed to other sites that rely heavily on banner advertisements. Furthermore, while companies that rely on tracking users’ online behaviors to target advertising must navigate stronger privacy rules and regulations, Ziff Davis does not use tracking technology, so it has no exposure to the related operational and financial challenges presented by the tougher rules. In addition, part of our initial attraction to Ziff Davis was its successful track record of acquiring undermanaged companies and them to significantly increase profitability. In what has become an ideal market for acquirers, Ziff Davis has more than $600 million in cash and the patience to wait for acquisition opportunities that meet its recently increased threshold for potential returns. During the period, we slightly trimmed our position as the share price appreciated.”9. Genesco Inc.

Without it, the mission could not go forward,” said Achim Steiner, a UNDP administrator.Transferring the stored oil is expected to start later this month, according to David Gressly, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Yemen. After completing the transfer of oil, Safer would eventually be towed away and scrapped, he has said.“Work is progressing well,” Gressly told the Yemen International Forum on Monday at The Hague.The U.K.-based insurance broker Howden group, which was appointed by the UNDP to identify the insurable risks and arrange coverage, said Monday it secured “successful binding of insurance coverage that enables the UN to proceed with FSO Safer Ship-to-Ship transfer.”The first phase of the salvage operation would see oil being transferred from the Safer to the Nautica, a super tanker the U.N. purchased for the operation. In the second phase, the U.N. will facilitate the installation of a replacement storage vessel, according to a deal the U.N. struck with the Houthi rebels, who control the area where the tanker is moored.The tanker was built in Japan in 1980, and the Yemeni government purchased it in the 1980s to store up to 3 million barrels of oil pumped from fields in the eastern province of Marib.Story continuesYemen, the Arab world's most impoverished country, has been engulfed by civil war since 2014, when Iran-backed Houthi rebels seized the capital, Sanaa, and much of the country’s north, forcing the government to flee to the south, then to Saudi Arabia.The following year, a Saudi-led coalition entered the war to fight the Houthis and try to restore the internationally recognized government to power.The Safer is 360 meters (1,181 feet) long with 34 storage tanks. The vessel is moored 50 kilometers (31 miles) northeast of Yemen’s strategic port of Hodeida.The tanker has not been maintained since 2015, and in recent years, seawater entered its engine compartment, causing damage to pipes and increasing the risk of sinking. Experts have said maintenance is no longer possible because the damage to the ship is irreversible.Rust has covered parts of the tanker and the inert gas that prevents the tanks from gathering inflammable gases has leaked out, prompting the U.N. to warn that tanker could release four times more oil than the notorious Exxon Valdez disaster did, off Alaska in 1989.]"

Both contracts slumped between 3.5% and 4% on Monday.Focus was now squarely on U.S. consumer price index inflation data, due later in the day, which is in turn expected to factor into a Fed interest rate decision on Wednesday.While markets widely expect the Fed to pause its rate hike cycle, recent strength in the labor market and signs of relatively high inflation kept traders wary of any hawkish surprises from the central bank.Rising interest rates pressure economic activity, which in turn dents oil and fuel demand. Crude markets were sold off heavily this year on that notion.Even if the Fed pauses its rate hike cycle, U.S. rates are expected to remain higher for longer this year, pressuring activity. Strength in the dollar, amid high U.S. rates, is also expected to weigh on crude markets.Demand, supply uncertainty in playFears of worsening demand kept traders cautious over buying into crude, following a string of weak economic readings from major economies in the past few months.Concerns over China have weighed heavily on oil prices in recent months, as investors questioned whether a post-COVID economic rebound was running out of steam.Story continuesWeak economic prints from the U.S., coupled with signs of a recession in the euro zone also brewed more concerns over demand this year.On the other hand, the potential of a U.S.-Iran nuclear deal also kept traders cautious over increased supply, especially as Iran’s supreme leader signaled some openness to reaching an agreement.Still, both Tehran and Washington denied recent reports that a deal was close.Related ArticlesOil rises after bruising losses, Fed angst limits gainsGermany's photovoltaic system demand set for double-digit growth this year, lobby saysGold inches higher as CPI data, central bank meetings approach]"
27,a4029e96-227f-336d-897a-890ab3fe1443,O,2023-06-13,Brazil Gears Up To Become Fourth Largest Oil Producer,Oilprice.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brazil-gears-become-fourth-largest-220000512.html,1686607200,STORY,"['CL=F', 'NG=F', 'PBR-A']","[For nearly two decades, South America’s largest economy Brazil has been reaping a tremendous economic windfall from a massive oil boom that kicked off with the first offshore ultra deep-water pre-salt discovery in 2006. The boom nearly collapsed as corruption, mismanagement and malfeasance saw national oil company Petrobras laden with so much debt it was almost forced to declare bankruptcy. Since then, industry reforms and rationalization coupled with higher oil prices had reinvigorated the massive fossil fuel boom underway in Brazil, although it nearly faltered for a brief moment when left-wing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva assumed power. There are indications that Brazil, regardless of the naysayers, is on track to become the world’s fourth-largest oil producer, which will be a tremendous boon for the economy.Data from Brazil’s hydrocarbon regulator, the National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP – Portuguese initials), shows that for April 2023, the country pumped an average of 3.1 million barrels of oil per day. That number is almost 1% higher than a month earlier and 5% greater year over year. Total hydrocarbon output for April 2023 amounted to just over 4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day which was 1.1% higher month over month and 4.4% greater than a year earlier. Those numbers represent a modest recovery after a March 2023 slump because of rising industry concerns that Lula will take a more interventionist approach to Brazil’s oil industry. That growth indicates Brazil possesses the potential to become the world’s largest oil producer, especially when it is anticipated the country 2023 will add 300,000 barrels per day, taking production to 3.4 million barrels daily by the end of the year.During 2022, Brazil was ranked ninth globally by oil production, ahead of Kuwait and behind Iran, lifting an average of just over 3 million barrels per day. Suppose Latin America’s largest economy is to become the world’s fourth-largest oil producer. In that case, it will need to be pumping more than 4.5 million barrels of crude oil per day so as to overtake Canada, which currently holds that spot. Brazil’s energy ministry expects the country will be pumping 5.4 million barrels daily by 2029, which is a whopping 80% higher than the 3 million barrels of oil lifted daily during 2022. Consistent year-over-year growth in hydrocarbon production indicates that Brazil indeed possesses the potential to expand production and become the world’s fourth-largest oil producer.Story continuesAnother key aspect that will support those plans is Brazil’s copious hydrocarbon reserves. According to the ANP, at the end of 2022, Latin America’s largest oil producer held proven or 1P petroleum reserves totaling 14.9 billion barrels, of which 77% were categorized as pre-salt. There are also 21.9 billion barrels of proven and possible or 2P reserves and 27 billion barrels of 3P reserves, known as proven possible and probable reserves. This illustrates that Brazil possesses considerable hydrocarbon potential and the reserves required to support a significant increase in oil production. Those reserves will keep growing as exploration and development drilling gains momentum, with the Baker Hughes International Rig Count showing 17 active rigs at the end of May 2023 compared to 11 a year earlier.Such a massive leap in oil output will be driven by expanding pre-salt oil production, which Brazil’s energy ministry believes will eventually be responsible for 80% of the country’s hydrocarbon output compared to around 77% at this time. For that to occur, there must be a significant increase in production which can only occur if energy investment and drilling expand substantially. The energy ministry hopes to stimulate this through a plan called the Potencializa E&amp;P programme, the main tenets of which are to encourage investment in frontier, commercially marginal and mature oil basins. There is also a push to expand spending and activity on onshore drilling in Brazil, with news agency Reuters pointing out that small to medium-sized energy companies planning to invest $7.7 billion in onshore operations between now and 2029.While Brazil’s national oil company Petrobras will be the key driver of such a massive expansion of production volumes, committing to spending $78 billion over five years, it will take considerable investment and injections of technology from foreign energy majors to achieve that goal. The reasons for this are simple, such a significant expansion of hydrocarbon output must be supported by a solid increase in exploitable reserves and the deployment of enhanced recovery techniques. This includes plans by smaller energy companies to invest $7.7 billion in onshore oilfields in Brazil by 2029, which will broaden petroleum reserves and production.In January 2023, French supermajor TotalEnergies approved the $1 billion final investment decision, or FID, for Lapa South-west offshore oil project in the Santo Basin, Brazil. TotalEnergies is the operator of the operation, holding a 45% working interest, with partners Shell controlling 30% and Repsol Sinopec the remaining 25%. The project consists of developing three wells to be connected to the Lapa FPSO, which has been operating in the North-west of the Lapa field since 2016. Upon start-up, which is anticipated for 2025, the facility will pump 25,000 barrels of oil per day, lifting overall field production to 60,000 barrels daily.According to TotalEnergies, the project is a natural fit for its existing Brazilian assets and will boost a key growth lever for the company's pre-salt oil production. TotalEnergies Exploration and Production Senior Vice President David Mendelson stated: “This latest development is an important milestone for TotalEnergies in Brazil that will increase its operated production in the pre-salt Santos Basin, a key growth area for the Company."" He then went on to say: “With its efficient engineering approach and synergies with existing facilities, this project illustrates TotalEnergies’ strategy of focusing on low cost, low emissions assets.”In late-May 2023, TotalEnergies, which holds a 39% interest, and its partners, Petrobras with 30% and QatarEnergy as well as PETRONAS with a 20% interest each, signed a production sharing contract for the offshore Agua Marinha Block. The block is located in the prolific Campos Basin south of the pre-salt Marlim Sul oilfield and was awarded to TotalEnergies in December 2022. It is believed that the block has the potential to mirror Petrobras’ success with the 2017 Marlim Sul pre-salt oil discovery. TotalEnergies Senior Vice President Exploration said: “The signature of the PSC for Agua Marinha expands our presence in this promising area of the pre-salt Campos Basin alongside our three strategic partners, and we are looking forward looking to exploring the block and drilling the Touro prospect.”In early May 2023, Norwegian energy supermajor Equinor announced that it, along with partners Repsol Sinopec and Petrobras had approved the FID to proceed with the $9 billion development of the B-M-C-33 project in offshore Brazil. The operation covers three pre-salt natural gas and condensate discoveries with recoverable reserves of one billion barrels of oil equivalent. On start-up, which is anticipated to occur in 2028, the operation will pump 565 million cubic feet of natural gas per day, of which, an estimated 88% will be exported. Equinor, which is the operator, holds a 35% working interest, with Repsol Sinopec controlling 35% and the remaining 30% held by Petrobras.These events demonstrate that Brazil remains an attractive jurisdiction for foreign energy companies despite President Lula's hiking oil industry taxes and the growing risk of increased government intervention. Indeed, while he irked energy majors with the March 2023 introduction of a 9.2% levy on oil exports for three months, investment in offshore Brazil remains strong. As discussed, foreign energy supermajors are continuing to approve billion-dollar projects in the country, which will significantly boost production.

In fact, workplace financial benefits such as equity compensation, financial wellness, and retirement are playing an ever-more influential role as companies and employees alike face continued belt tightening. For example:According to Morgan Stanley at Work’s State of the Workplace 2023 report, the environment is having a significant impact on the workplace, with employees paying closer attention to financial benefits. There is a marked correlation between financial benefits and talent retention, yet companies have pulled back on offerings to prepare for a possible recession—even though HR leaders and employees agree that employers should step up support.2Additionally, volatility is playing out differently in various corners of the globe and the economy—for example, private companies face liquidity challenges and reduced valuations, while multinational companies must solve for employee needs and navigate differing regulations around the world.One common thread emerging across sectors is that many younger employees have never lived through this type of economic environment before and are seeking greater support and education regarding their benefits. Increasing education and awareness around the various streams of support is key.Therefore, companies are doubling down on their communication and education strategies amid concerns that benefits are not properly reaching employees going through financial challenges. For example, Morgan Stanley at Work saw an increase in client requests for support with participant education in 2023, and also saw employees increasingly raise their hands to ask an advisor for help with their financial goals.Even as automation and robotics tools help create faster, more streamlined workplace processes, the need for human solutions for complex situations isn’t going away. Service, the employee experience, and benefits education are growing more important as employees increasingly turn to their workplace benefits.Story continuesThe 2023 Thrive client conference was the largest ever, welcoming 714 equity compensation professionals from around the globe—including both private and public companies from the US and Canada. The conference also featured Client Advisory Board meetings, 75+ education sessions (85% offering CE), platform demos, and eight hands-on labs, taking place over three days at the JW Marriott Aventura Florida. In addition, attendees could speak live with a Financial Advisor through a hologram portal. This technology, which is also used by world leaders to connect with audiences around the globe, allowed over 100 attendees to have one on one consultations like they were right in the Advisor’s office.""Today’s environment is underscoring the power of a holistic approach to benefits, especially as many companies and their employees turn to their workplace as a ballast against economic challenges,"" said Brian McDonald, Head of Morgan Stanley at Work. ""We are being intentional about helping our clients and their employees maximize the value of their benefits to build resilience while navigating sometimes painful change. Coming out of our 2023 Thrive conference, the bottom line is that the stakes for companies and their employees are high, and we at Morgan Stanley at Work will continue to make the right investments in our offering to ensure we can continue to deliver for our clients when and how they need it—no matter what the markets or the economy may bring.""Statistics refer to equity compensation administration services for Shareworks and Equity Edge Online®.

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with ""A"" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment.One company to watch right now is Omnicom Group (OMC). OMC is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and an A for Value.Another valuation metric that we should highlight is OMC's P/B ratio of 5.19. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This company's current P/B looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/B of 12.53. Over the past 12 months, OMC's P/B has been as high as 5.28 and as low as 3.60, with a median of 4.65.Finally, investors should note that OMC has a P/CF ratio of 12.12. This figure highlights a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find firms that are undervalued when considering their impressive cash outlook. OMC's current P/CF looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 12.18. Within the past 12 months, OMC's P/CF has been as high as 12.48 and as low as 8.45, with a median of 10.56.Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that Omnicom Group is likely undervalued currently. And when considering the strength of its earnings outlook, OMC sticks out at as one of the market's strongest value stocks.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

After hearing him speak for just a few seconds, one of the artificial intelligence developer’s large language models (LLMs) was able to clone Benioff’s voice and produce audio of him delivering an entire speech once given by John F. Kennedy.Benioff says he asked Altman to show him where the file with his voice was stored. But there was no file. The AI generated output by “weighting” data in the hidden layers of its neural network; there was no way to see where the data lived.Read moreAll the sports that are part of Saudi Arabia's sportswashing planGoogle has officially changed its mind about remote workHow many UBI trials do we need to prove giving away money works?Relaying the anecdote at a June 12 analyst and press event in New York, where he revealed details of Salesforce’s new AI strategy, Benioff didn’t seem particularly concerned. But he thought his customers would be—especially those in regulated industries like banking. “They like to know exactly where that data is...and they want to audit those places,” Benioff said.AI and the pitfalls for data privacyIf you’ve heard about teachers and school administrators freaking out about AI chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT or Google’s Bard, it’s because they’re worried students will simply offload their work onto the technology.In the corporate world, where the quest for productivity gains is never-ending, the idea of AI taking over tasks is a more attractive one. What executives and boards and in-house legal teams are mostly freaking out about, though, is whether employees using AI chatbots will undermine data privacy mandates.They’re right to be concerned. Maintaining data privacy—by keeping personally identifying information secure, for example—is more difficult when a chatbot invites people to share all manner of information with it, so that it might draft an email, write a report, or fill out a customer service script tailored as closely as possible to the end recipient. The reasons for sharing such information may be benign, or even admirable. But that doesn’t make it any less dangerous for a company where data privacy is essential to trust.Story continuesAnd that’s not the only risk for companies making use of AI. Hallucinations, bias, toxicity—as Benioff noted, “those are not societal terms; those are actual, technical explanations of things happening inside these models.”Salesforce is pushing its trust layerLittle wonder, then, that Salesforce is making trust and data privacy a big part of its AI pitch to business customers. The company’s new “Einstein GPT Trust Layer” promises to separate sensitive customer data from the LLMs used in the creation of generative AI.Salesforce has made the promise of trust a key piece of its proposition since its founding in 1999, first with the controlled sharing of information in its original customer relationship management systems, and again with the 2016 advent of its private predictive training models, in which Salesforce platforms scoured customer data for patterns and used those patterns to make forecasts, all without compromising the data itself.Private generative training raises similar needs, Benioff says. But in the rush to make use of generative AI, “I think you’re going to see companies who have not taken proper precautions lose data inadvertently,” he said.If that’s a subtle plug for Salesforce’s new AI “starter pack” (priced at $360,000 a year with an annual contract), it’s also suggestive of a future in which data breaches multiply. Only, instead of companies accidentally leaking customer data to hackers, they will be exposing it to chatbots. It’s a reminder that generative AI is new territory for everyone—Salesforce included.More from QuartzWhat's next for student loans if SCOTUS knocks down Biden's debt forgiveness?How to manage ADHD—and leverage its benefits—at workSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

You Won’t Be Missed.Tucker Carlson's Fox Defense Crumbled When He Took MillionsBlinken Has ‘Candid’ Talks With China’s Qin on Trip to Mend TiesFewer stockholders backed a proposal suggesting the board be led by someone other than a current or former CEO than voted last year. The nonbinding proposal, which is effectively a referendum on whether Benioff should continue to hold the role of board chairman, received about 23% of the vote at the company’s annual meeting June 8, compared with just less than 37% a year ago, according to regulatory filings.Salesforce has been winning back shareholders after a tumultuous six months that included job cuts, executive departures and public pressure from activist investors. The software maker ratcheted up its focus on profit and ended a controversial acquisition strategy. The stock has jumped 61% this year, making it one of the top 10 gainers in the S&amp;P 500.Influential advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. recommended against the proposals, saying “the board has made several recent positive structural changes including the reduction of the complexity of its leadership structure.” The same firm supported a similar effort last year, adding that it can be difficult to balance a board led by a founder and longtime CEO.Salesforce on Monday held an event promoting its strategy to incorporate generative AI tools into its software products. Benioff has talked up the potential for generative AI to drive revenue expansion, saying it will “spark a massive new tech buying cycle.”Read more: Salesforce Touts AI Strategy, Doubles Investment in StartupsStory continuesBenioff became sole CEO again after the January departure of heir apparent Bret Taylor. One request from activist investor Elliott Investment Management that wasn’t accepted during negotiations with the company was better succession planning.Salesforce Chief Operating Officer Brian Millham has taken on some of Taylor’s previous duties and recently has been making more public appearances. When Benioff was asked at Monday’s event whether Millham would be the next co-CEO, he said, “I don’t think I have another co-CEO right now, but I couldn’t be more excited about Brian.”The proxy was submitted by the National Legal and Policy Center, a conservative group that took issue with Benioff’s support for causes like abortion access and diverse hiring. A similar initiative by the group aimed at Berkshire Hathaway Inc. failed last month.Still, the proposal was backed by advisory firm Glass Lewis for corporate governance reasons. An independent chair “eliminates the conflict of interest that inevitably occurs when a CEO is responsible for self-oversight,” Glass Lewis said in a report.(Updates with company event in the fifth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWhen a Huawei Bid Turned Into a Hunt for a Corporate MoleMicrosoft’s Sudden AI Dominance Is Scrambling Silicon Valley’s Power StructureAirlines Are Rankled About Pratt &amp; Whitney’s Jet Engine ProblemsIs AT&amp;T’s RTO Mandate a Mass Layoff in Disguise?Private Credit’s Quiet, Unstoppable Rise Comes With Unknown Risk©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

You Won’t Be Missed.Tucker Carlson's Fox Defense Crumbled When He Took MillionsBlinken Has ‘Candid’ Talks With China’s Qin on Trip to Mend TiesThe software maker’s venture capital fund focused on generative AI will increase to $500 million from the initial $250 million announced in March, the company said Monday in a statement. In addition, its portfolio of artificial intelligence tools will now be called AI Cloud, putting it on par with other major product lines such as Sales Cloud and Service Cloud.All the major technology companies are embracing generative AI and trying to add new tools after the introduction of OpenAI’s ChatGPT spurred intense interest from businesses across a swath of industries. Ahead of a Salesforce event focused on AI, the company is unveiling security standards for its technology, including preventing large language models from being trained on customer data.“Every client we talk to, this has been their biggest concern,” said Adam Caplan, senior vice president of AI, of the potential for confidential information to leak through the use of these models.Large language models are programmed to learn through trial-and-error using massive amounts of text and data. A type of these models is used for generative AI, which creates text and images from a user’s conversational prompts.After a difficult six months that included job cuts, executive departures and public pressure from activist investors, Salesforce has been winning back the faith of many shareholders, and the stock had jumped 62% this year through Friday’s close. Investors, however, are concerned about sales growth — particularly after the company on May 31 projected revenue in the current quarter would gain 10% from a year earlier. That would be the slowest jump on record and a significant dropoff from a time when 30% increases were routine.Story continuesExecutives have talked up the potential for AI to drive expansion. Like cloud computing and mobile apps before it, generative AI “is going to spark a massive new tech buying cycle,” Chief Executive Officer Marc Benioff said during an earnings call after the recent results. Underlining the company’s decision to prioritize AI is the decision last month to name Clara Shih as CEO of Salesforce AI. Shih once led Salesforce’s most lucrative product segment Service Cloud.Read More: A Cheat Sheet to AI Buzzwords and Their MeaningsCustomers will pay additional fees to use the new generative AI features across the company’s suite of software, Caplan said. Salesforce is still testing pricing levels, including whether it should be based on flat-rate subscriptions or use, he said. An AI Cloud “starter pack” with 50 licenses for unlimited use in Salesforce, Slack, and Tableau will cost $360,000 per year, the company said during the event in New York.The shares declined about 1% to $213.48 at 2:55 p.m. in New York, while most software peers gained. Salesforce said the AI tools will become generally available in products for sales and customer support this summer before being rolled out across the portfolio in coming months.Salesforce had previously introduced some generative AI tools using OpenAI’s technology, including a chatbot for its Slack business communication unit and for tasks such as drafting customer service responses.Bloomberg Intelligence analysts estimated earlier this month that generative AI may produce $1.3 trillion in sales of hardware, software, services and other tools by 2032.Caplan previously oversaw Salesforce’s Web3, or blockchain and cryptocurrency-related initiatives. He said the applications for generative AI are much clearer than Web3 and customers have expressed massive interest.Salesforce’s access to large amounts of customer data may be an ingredient for success in the new, highly hyped technology, Brad Zelnick, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, wrote Friday in a note to investors. “We see leading platforms such as Salesforce — with troves of trusted, high-quality data, connected processes, strong brands, distribution and ecosystems — as the natural winners in a generative AI world.”(Updates with pricing in the eighth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWhen a Huawei Bid Turned Into a Hunt for a Corporate MoleMicrosoft’s Sudden AI Dominance Is Scrambling Silicon Valley’s Power StructureAirlines Are Rankled About Pratt &amp; Whitney’s Jet Engine ProblemsIs AT&amp;T’s RTO Mandate a Mass Layoff in Disguise?Private Credit’s Quiet, Unstoppable Rise Comes With Unknown Risk©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Another comment that really resonated with me from a guest prior was that this would be-- if we are in a new bull market right now, this would be the most unloved bull market or a start to a bull market that we've seen in decades maybe ever.I went through a global financial crisis. Some of the big ones like the Dot-Com bubble as well and some of the smaller ones, even some of the smaller pullbacks. Typically, at the beginning of these things, and this would have been traced back to October because that's when we had the lows, everything goes up. And then you have a period of consolidation pullback, people don't believe this is a new bull market. And then, things start getting narrowed and more selective.Story continuesWhat we did this time is we started the opposite way. And this isn't-- and this is assuming that we're still in a bull market but the opposite way would be we're starting out with a few narrow names and now we're expanding. So it doesn't mean, this doesn't have to be the case. But historically, it would be very unusual.A couple more things I want to point out here. Indices are getting very stretched. Even the S&amp;P 500 which was not as stretched as the NASDAQ, if you take a look at the S&amp;P 500 relative to its 50-day moving average getting very well extended, bespoke has a couple of notes and graphics out on this. But basically, we could be due for a mean reversion and that would just mean the price either has to come down or price has to stay level and a correction in time has to occur.Haven't seen any of those either of those things panned out just yet. Bottom line market overall's probably due for a pause or a pullback or what could happen is if this rotation continues, we could just see select pockets of the market advance while other ones take pauses. So all in all, we do have some momentum to the upside.We have this huge CPI report due out tomorrow, going to be a lot of headline risk from that as well as the Fed report. So enjoy today because things get a little messy starting tomorrow morning.- We will see. Thanks so much, Jared. We'll brace ourselves.]"

Persistent weakness in the Safety and Productivity Solutions segment due to lower warehouse and workflow and productivity solutions volumes has been a drag on this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s operations. However, continued momentum in the Aerospace and Performance Materials and Technologies segments has largely offset the softness associated with the Safety and Productivity Solutions segment.Key Factors Likely to Aid HONEnd-Market Strength &amp; Pricing Actions: Strength in the cyber, industrial, aerospace and connected building end markets and solid operational execution augur well for HON’s growth. Despite cost inflation, pricing actions and cost-control measures are driving the company’s margin performance. For the first quarter of 2023, operating margin expanded 390 basis points (bps) to 19.1%. Segment margin expanded 90 bps in the quarter. For 2023, the company expects segment margin of 22.3%-22.6%, indicating a year-over-year rise of 60-90 bps (an increase of 50-90 bps was anticipated earlier).Amid a stable demand environment across its key end markets, Honeywell has provided bullish guidance for 2023. The company expects sales of $36.5-$37.3 billion for the current year compared with $36-$37 billion anticipated earlier. The company expects organic sales growth of 3-6% in the year compared with 2-5% estimated earlier. HON expects adjusted earnings per share of $9-9.25, suggesting a year-over-year rise of 3-6% (an increase of 0-5% was predicted earlier).Honeywell International Inc. Price and ConsensusHoneywell International Inc. Price and ConsensusHoneywell International Inc. price-consensus-chart | Honeywell International Inc. QuoteRobust Performance Across Most Segments: Strong commercial aftermarket demand owing to a recovery in commercial flight hours is aiding Honeywell’s Aerospace segment. While supply chain issues persist, the situation has improved substantially. Thanks to this improvement in supply chains and strength in the order book, the company expects organic sales to increase in low double digits for the Aerospace segment in 2023.Strong demand for flooring products, gas processing equipment and sustainable technology solutions is expected to drive the Performance Materials and Technologies segment’s growth in 2023. The company expects strength in projects and smart energy businesses to support the segment’s growth in 2023. It expects sales to increase in mid-single digits for the segment in 2023.Growth in Building Products and Solutions augurs well for the Building Technologies segment. Institutional demand in airports, healthcare and education is expected to drive growth of the segment in 2023. HON expects organic revenues to increase in the low single digits for the segment in the current year.Sound Financial Health: Honeywell’s sound financial health allows the company to effectively utilize its free cash flow to acquire assets, repurchase shares and pay dividends. In 2022, HON rewarded shareholders with $2.7 billion in dividends and $4.2 billion in share buybacks. The quarterly dividend rate was hiked by 5.1% in September 2022, marking its 13th increment since 2010. In the first quarter of 2023, the company paid dividends of $725 million and repurchased shares worth approximately $800 million. The company expects an operating cash flow of $4.9-$5.3 billion for 2023, while free cash flow is anticipated to be $3.9-$4.3 billion.Deal to Acquire Compressor Controls Corporation: Honeywell aims to strengthen its business through acquisitions. In April, HON entered into an agreement to acquire Compressor Controls Corporation from INDICOR, LLC. The acquisition will fortify HON’s expertise in industrial control, automation and process solutions while simultaneously bolstering its sustainability portfolio with new carbon capture control solutions. The acquired entity will be integrated into HON’s Process Solutions business. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2023.Story continuesKey PicksSome better-ranked industrial companies are as follows:Flowserve FLS currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Escalated SG&amp;A expenses are also hurting many companies in the space. Additionally, reduced discretionary spending due to an overall inflationary landscape has been a concern.  However, efforts to bolster store and digital operations, together with efficient brand enhancement endeavors, keep lululemon Athletica Inc. LULU, Ralph Lauren Corporation RL, Crocs, Inc. CROX and G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. GIII well-positioned.About the IndustryThe Zacks Textile - Apparel industry includes companies and lifestyle brands that manufacture, design, distribute, source, market and sell apparel, footwear and accessories for men and women. These include fashion apparel like dresses, pants, skirts, shorts, shirts, jackets, blouses and knitwear and intimate apparel like underwear and shapewear. The industry also comprises companies offering apparel for a healthy lifestyle and athletic activities, such as yoga, running and training, to name a few. Some companies also deal with fitness-related accessories like gloves, bags, headwear and sports masks. The industry participants operate through direct-to-consumer (brick-and-mortar and online), wholesale and licensing distribution channels. Most players operate through stores and digital networks in the United States and internationally.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Textile - Apparel IndustryEscalated Costs: Several industry players are bearing the brunt of input cost inflation. Companies have been grappling with supply-chain hurdles stemming from prolonged COVID-19-associated factors, congestion at ports and reduced airfreight capacity. These supply-chain issues are inducing delays and resulting in increased freight costs. Textile-apparel players have been witnessing higher SG&amp;A costs as well. Elevated marketing expenses and increased investments toward enhancing store and digital operations have been spiking up SG&amp;A costs. These factors pose threats to companies’ margins. Moreover, the impact of lower demand due to inflation and reduced discretionary spending is a major concern for the payers.International Exposure Poses Risks: Due to a vast international presence, textile-apparel companies are exposed to volatile foreign currency movements. Political unrest, like turmoil related to the current geopolitical events and related sanctions, restrictions or other responses, could also dent companies’ performance.Improved Store Traffic, Solid Digital Trends: Textile-apparel players are capitalizing on the importance of physical retail and the convenience of online engagement. Companies are focused on investments in enhancing the in-store experience. Meanwhile, consumers’ growing inclination toward online shopping has put e-commerce at the forefront for players in the textile-apparel industry. Companies in the space have long been investing in improving e-commerce sites, upgrading mobile apps, enhancing payment systems, linking online and store operations and increasing fulfillment capabilities. Buy online, pickup in-store and curbside delivery options are gaining traction for many industry players.Brand-Enhancing Endeavors: Efforts to bolster brands via marketing strategies, licensing deals, buyouts and alliances are likely to keep supporting textile-apparel players. New product launches are also an important part of their growth. Companies in the space regularly enhance products through innovation to remain competitive and tap evolving consumer preferences.

43,a1bf031a-210e-3934-bfa0-6180e21c66ef,ALGN,2023-06-13,10 Companies That Announced Huge Share Buybacks Recently,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-companies-announced-huge-share-154039378.html,1686584439,STORY,"['UPS', 'GLNG', 'MT', 'ALGN', 'GOOGL']","[In this article, we discuss the 10 companies that announced huge share buybacks recently. If you want to read about some more firms that just announced share buybacks, go directly to 5 Companies That Announced Huge Share Buybacks Recently.During a recession, companies may experience a decline in their stock prices due to economic uncertainties and market volatility. By engaging in share buybacks, companies can repurchase their own shares from the market, reducing the total number of outstanding shares. This reduction in supply can help support and stabilize the stock price, instilling confidence among investors and signaling that the company believes in its own long-term prospects. These buybacks provide an efficient way for companies to utilize their excess cash. Instead of hoarding cash reserves or making large capital expenditures during an economic downturn, companies can use their funds to repurchase shares. This action can enhance shareholder value by increasing earnings per share (EPS) and improving financial metrics such as return on equity (ROE).Furthermore, buybacks can be seen as a signal of financial strength and stability. Companies that have sufficient cash reserves to repurchase shares in a recession demonstrate their ability to weather economic downturns and generate future profits. This can attract investors and contribute to a positive perception of the company's financial health. Additionally, share buybacks can provide a tax-efficient way to distribute excess cash to shareholders. By repurchasing shares, companies can return value to shareholders without incurring the same tax liabilities as dividends. This can be particularly advantageous for investors in higher tax brackets. Buyback activity in the second quarter of 2022 in US was close to a record level as companies continued to utilize their buyback plans. A total of 1,323 companies reported repurchases, a 4% increase from the previous quarter. The breadth of buybacks has been consistently expanding for multiple quarters, reaching its highest level since the first quarter of 2020 when nearly 1,400 companies engaged in buybacks. In the second quarter of 2022, 58% of companies with open buyback authorizations repurchased shares, marking a continued upward trend. Additionally, 197 companies initiated new buyback plans, and 159 companies increased existing plans, resulting in a combined figure of 356, representing a downturn of 12.7% from the first quarter of 2022.  In terms of volume, buybacks by US companies experienced a sequential decrease of 15% in the second quarter of 2022, but still saw a year-over-year increase of 21%. Story continuesThe total buyback volume for US companies in Q2’22 amounted to $269.5 billion, which was a 14.9% decrease from the record-setting $316.9 billion in the first quarter of 2022. Despite the quarter-on-quarter drop, the dollar value of buybacks showed a significant increase of 20.6% compared to the same period in the previous year. Buyback volume reached new all-time highs in each quarter from the third quarter of 2021 through the first quarter of 2022, and the second quarter of 2022 figure slightly exceeded the third quarter of 2021 figure. However, it is worth noting that share buybacks can also be a subject of debate. Critics argue that companies should prioritize investments in research and development, employee wages, or capital expenditures instead of repurchasing shares. They claim that buybacks can artificially inflate stock prices and benefit shareholders, including executives with stock-based compensation, at the expense of long-term growth and job creation. Share buybacks have been a prevalent trend in the United States over the past few decades. Companies use share buybacks as a strategy to return capital to shareholders and manage their capital structure. The trend gained significant momentum after the implementation of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which imposed restrictions on dividend tax treatment but allowed for more favorable tax treatment of capital gains from stock sales. Another factor was the availability of low-cost debt due to historically low interest rates.  Companies took advantage of this opportunity to borrow funds and finance their share buyback programs. This approach became especially popular among large corporations, which had access to more favorable lending terms and greater financial resources. In recent years, share buybacks have attracted public and political scrutiny. Critics argue that buybacks primarily benefit shareholders, including top executives with stock-based compensation, rather than investing in long-term growth, increasing employee wages, or other capital expenditures. This debate has led to calls for stricter regulations on buybacks or alternative uses of corporate funds. Despite the criticism, share buybacks remain a significant feature of the US corporate landscape. Many companies continue to use buybacks as a means to enhance shareholder value, manage their capital structure, and signal confidence in their future prospects. The COVID-19 pandemic and associated economic uncertainties have impacted buyback activity, with some companies suspending or reducing their programs to conserve cash. However, as economic conditions stabilize, it is expected that share buybacks will resume their role as a key tool in capital allocation for US companies. Some of the stocks to monitor in this context include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). 10 Companies That Announced Huge Share Buybacks RecentlySpeedcurve Performance AnalyticsOur MethodologyFor this article, we selected stocks that have announced share buybacks this year and ranked them based on overall hedge fund sentiment. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the first quarter of 2023. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. Companies That Announced Huge Share Buybacks Recently10. ArcelorMittal (NYSE:MT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 19ArcelorMittal (NYSE:MT) operates as integrated steel and mining companies in the Americas, Europe, Asia, and Africa. On May 5, the company announced that it would be commencing a new share buyback program of up to 85 million shares. The program will be completed within two years, per the firm. The firm also said that the amount of shares repurchased through this program will depend on the level of post-dividend free cash flow generated over the period. In late March, investment advisory Morgan Stanley maintained an Overweight rating on ArcelorMittal (NYSE:MT) stock and lowered the price target to EUR 37.5 from EUR 38. Analyst Alain Gabriel issued the ratings update. At the end of the first quarter of 2023, 19 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $492 million in ArcelorMittal (NYSE:MT), up from 13 in the preceding quarter worth $580 million.Just like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), ArcelorMittal (NYSE:MT) is one of the stocks trending on the up after announcing share buybacks. 9. Golar LNG Limited (NASDAQ:GLNG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 33     Golar LNG Limited (NASDAQ:GLNG) is an LNG transportation firm. On May 23, Golar LNG announced a share buyback program worth up to $150 million.

Here is what the fund said:“This quarter we sold our entire stake in Golar LNG Limited (NASDAQ:GLNG). As we highlighted in our previous letter, the company engaged in the conversion of natural gas into liquefied natural gas (FLNG infrastructures), the storage of LNG and regasification through FSRU and the transportation of LNG (with its stake in Cool Company), has benefited greatly from the current tightness in the natural gas market, derived from the energy transition and, indeed, aggravated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the various sanctions and measures taken by the Western nations against the country led by Vladimir Putin. On the one hand, its market value relative to our intrinsic value estimate has considerably narrowed following its outstanding performance. On the other hand, our search for a more favorable riskreturn setup in the natural gas market led us to sell Golar LNG and to invest, as we will discuss below, in its spin-off Cool Company.”8. Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39   Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) designs, manufactures, and markets Invisalign clear aligners, and iTero intraoral scanners and services for orthodontists and general practitioner dentists.

Mean- while, the company is expected to increase distributions to shareholders in 2022, from both dividends and share buybacks.” 6. Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41 Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) is an energy and petrochemical firm. On May 4, Shell announced plans to buy back an additional $4 billion worth of shares as its profits exceeded estimates. The decision to repurchase shares comes as Shell seeks to distribute excess cash to shareholders and drive up returns. In the previous quarter, the firm had recorded $4 billion in share buybacks as well. The company posted a revenue of more than $86 billion in the first quarter of 2023, up over 3% compared to the revenue over the same period last year. On May 18, Piper Sandler analyst Ryan Todd maintained an Overweight rating on Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) stock and lowered the price target to $75 from $77, noting that energy stocks continue to struggle to regain traction coming out of Q1 earnings season. At the end of the first quarter of 2023, 41 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $2.7 billion in Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), compared to 40 in the previous quarter worth $3 billion.Alongside Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) is one of the stocks trending on the up after announcing share buybacks. In its Q4 2022 investor letter, Artisan Partners, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“We scaled back our weighting in clean energy this quarter, which is a part of the portfolio’s environment theme, to take profits after a successful run in 2022. We did so by trimming our position in Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), a stock we added to the portfolio in Q1 2022. As an integrated energy company, approximately one third of Shell’s revenues come from transition fuels, such as LNG, and another third comes from new energy sources such as green hydrogen. LNG is one of the cleanest fossil fuels and represents a potential bridge to the future by replacing higher carbon energy sources with lower carbon ones while renewable technologies mature. As the largest LNG supplier in the world, we believe Shell is particularly well-positioned to help Europe meet its energy needs as it looks for ways to replace imported Russian oil and gas with new sources after the embargo.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Companies That Announced Huge Share Buybacks Recently.Suggested Articles:11 Best Low Risk Dividend Stocks To Invest In15 Biggest Nanotechnology Companies in the World11 Best Pet Stocks To BuyDisclose.

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Currently, InterDigital has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Motorola has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that IDCC likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than MSI has recently. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.IDCC currently has a forward P/E ratio of 14.61, while MSI has a forward P/E of 24.74. We also note that IDCC has a PEG ratio of 1.05. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. MSI currently has a PEG ratio of 2.75.Another notable valuation metric for IDCC is its P/B ratio of 3.82. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, MSI has a P/B of 187.24.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to IDCC's Value grade of B and MSI's Value grade of C.Story continuesIDCC sticks out from MSI in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that IDCC is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The indicators include things like the clear labeling of opinion pieces, a code of practices and the attribution of sources.Most people who saw the list expressed greater confidence in their own ability to find reliable news while ferreting out misinformation — a promising finding that suggests media literacy can be a cheap and scalable solution to the daunting problem of online misinformation.“This was a bit of an experiment for us,” said Ginny Badanes, senior director of Microsoft's Democracy Forward Initiative, a unit at the company that focuses on efforts to strengthen democracy and online journalism. ""The world is changing very quickly and people need tools to equip themselves.”The stakes are high. Misinformation on sites like Twitter, Facebook and YouTube has been blamed for encouraging political polarization, undermining trust in democratic institutions and promoting vaccine opposition, election denialism and violent extremism.The speed and power of the internet can make online misinformation seem like an unresolvable problem. Journalistic fact checks are effective, but they’re labor intensive, aren’t read by everyone, and won’t convince those already distrustful of traditional journalism. Content moderation by tech companies is often inconsistent and only drives misinformation elsewhere, while prompting cries of censorship and bias. Efforts to regulate the internet are legally and politically challenging.Measures to promote critical thinking and media literacy, however, have shown remarkable success in helping people learn how to detect misinformation themselves. Google launched a series of videos on YouTube in Eastern Europe last year designed to teach people how misinformation works; the campaign was recently expanded to Germany.Story continuesOften, claims masquerading as reliable news don't cite their sources, mix opinion and fact and use slanted stories or headlines designed to exploit powerful emotions like fear, anger or disgust.Legitimate news organizations, by contrast, will identify their sources, invite feedback, include diverse voices and hold their journalists to a code of conduct, said Sally Lehrman, a journalist and chief executive at the Trust Project.The ads were seen by users of Microsoft products and systems, including email. Over the course of six months, the ads prompted twice as many people to visit the project's site; 62% of those who visited the site said it helped them feel more confident about assessing online information.“I'm very encouraged by our results,” Lehrman said, noting that short internet ads are a relatively cheap, easy solution compared to complicated and controversial government regulations or hit-or-miss efforts by tech companies.The need for media literacy has become more obvious as deepfakes and artificial intelligence makes misinformation easier than ever to spread, Lehrman said.But will people actually watch advertisements designed to help them become smarter consumers of news and information? Lehrman said the research shows that they will — especially when the ads are effective at grabbing people's attention.“Are we asking people to eat their broccoli? I always reject that because I think broccoli is delicious,” she said. “But we have to make it delicious.”]"

Elsewhere, Apple shares soar to a record-high close, while U.S. regulators ask a court to temporarily block Microsoft's mega-merger with Activision Blizzard.1. U.S. inflation data dueInvestors will be keeping a close eye on Tuesday on the latest U.S. inflation data, which could have a major influence over the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision later on in the week.Economists estimate that the May consumer price index (CPI) will rise by 4.1% on an annual basis, slowing from the prior level of 4.9%. Month-on-month, the gauge is seen increasing by 0.2%, decelerating slightly from 0.4% in April.Meanwhile, the annual and monthly core CPI readings, which strip out volatile items like food and energy, are projected to climb by 5.3% and 0.4%, respectively.The Fed has been raising interest rates for more than a year to combat elevated inflation, so today's CPI print is expected to play a pivotal role in whether the central bank chooses to pause its policy-tightening campaign or hike borrowing costs yet again.At 05:49 ET, there was more than 71% that policymakers will keep the fed funds rate steady at a range of 5.00% to 5.25%, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool. Meanwhile, the probability that the bank will unveil a 25 basis point increase stands at just over 28%.2. U.S. futures riseU.S. stock futures pointed higher on Tuesday as traders awaited the release of the all-important inflation print and the start of the Fed's rates meeting.By 05:14 ET (09:14 GMT), the S&amp;P 500 futures contract added 12 points or 0.28%, Dow futures gained 13 points or 0.04%, and Nasdaq 100 futures moved up by 87 points or 0.59%.Stocks surged in the previous session, fueled by an ongoing rush into tech shares with links to artificial intelligence. The benchmark S&amp;P 500 soared to its highest close in more than a year, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose by 1.53% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed by 0.56%.Story continuesAlthough not quite at the record highs seen at the beginning of 2022, the main indices have been supported by a spike in interest in AI that has sparked a rally in the semiconductor and software sectors.3. Apple shares touch record-highShares in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) edged down slightly in after-hours trading after the stock jumped to a record-high close of $183.79 on Monday.The surge comes after Apple unveiled its new Vision Pro mixed reality headset at its annual developers conference last week. The product was the company's first new hardware launch since 2014.Despite its eye-watering price tag of $3,499, the Vision Pro is widely seen as a key moment in the evolution of virtual reality headsets, with experts hoping that Apple's reputation for design and brand loyalty will help entice consumers.However, some analysts have flagged lingering problems for Apple. On Monday, analysts at UBS downgraded their rating of the stock, citing in part an expected slowdown in unit growth of the firm's iPhone device.4. FTC asks for halt to Microsoft-Activision mega-dealU.S. antitrust regulators have asked a California federal court to put a temporary block on Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) $69 billion purchase of Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), potentially placing a fresh legal hurdle before the gaming industry's biggest ever deal.The Federal Trade Commission is already set to carry out its own legal proceedings beginning in August. The FTC is now requesting that the court prevent the deal from being completed until a decision, in this case, is made.The FTC argued that the tie-up, which would see Microsoft take control of the maker of the popular video game title Call of Duty, would give the tech giant the ""ability and increased incentive to withhold or degrade Activision's content in ways that substantially lessen competition.""Meanwhile, Microsoft's president and vice-chair, Brad Smith, has said that he ""welcomes"" the chance to defend the merger in a federal court.5. China's central bank lowers short-term lending rateThe People's Bank of China (PBoC) slashed its key seven-day reverse repo rate by 10 basis points on Tuesday, as Beijing looks to support a flagging post-pandemic recovery in the world's second-largest economy.The move could be a signal that longer-term interest rates may begin to ease in the coming days in the face of weak demand and investor sentiment.Analysts quoted by Reuters said the rate cut shows that China's central bank is becoming increasingly concerned about the outlook for growth in the country. An economic rebound, following the end of harsh COVID-era rules, is beginning to show signs of fading, marked in part by slipping exports and manufacturing activity.Elsewhere, Bloomberg News reported that Beijing is mulling over new stimulus measures to help boost China's slumping property sector, which has been hit by a string of defaults and project suspensions.Related ArticlesU.S. CPI ahead, Apple shares hit record-high close - what's moving marketsWhy finding a camp for your kid is this summer's madnessJapan's Kishida unveils new child care plan amid election rumours]"

Operational efficiency and reduced expenses on the back of a successful work-from-home trend and the hybrid working model have been driving competitive advantage besides increasing innovation and speed to market. The buoyancy in the industry is further confirmed by its Zacks Industry Rank #70, which places it in the top 28% of more than 250 Zacks industries.However, rising data security issues, thanks to increased dependency on technology, are concerns for the industry.Given this backdrop, let’s focus on some outsourcing stocks — Automatic Data Processing, Inc. ADP and Paychex, Inc.

At the same time, they offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these companies have superior fundamentals like a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics.How to Pick Stocks With Solid Dividend Payouts?In order to choose some of the best dividend stocks from the aforementioned industry, we have run the Zacks Stock Screener to identify stocks with a dividend yield in excess of 2% and a sustainable dividend payout ratio of less than 60%.Automatic Data Processing: Headquartered in Roseland, NJ, Automatic Data Processing provides cloud-based human capital management solutions worldwide.

57,240ab3b4-8757-3d90-8999-422efd8bbd8c,PH,2023-06-13,Here's How Much a $1000 Investment in Parker-Hannifin Made 10 Years Ago Would Be Worth Today,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-much-1000-investment-parker-123005612.html,1686573005,STORY,['PH'],"[How much a stock's price changes over time is important for most investors, since price performance can both impact your investment portfolio and help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.Another factor that can influence investors is FOMO, or the fear of missing out, especially with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Parker-Hannifin (PH) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to PH for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Parker-Hannifin's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Parker-Hannifin's main business drivers.Parker-Hannifin Corporation is a global diversified manufacturer of motion &amp; control technologies and systems. The company provides precision engineered solutions for a wide variety of mobile, industrial and aerospace markets.Diversified Industrial Segment (73.4% of third-quarter fiscal 2023 sales): This segment is engaged in the production of a wide range of motion-control and fluid systems &amp; components. The products offered by this segment are used in transportation, mobile construction, refrigeration and air conditioning, agriculture and other markets.The segment sells its products through two main channels, namely, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and extensive distribution network to smaller OEMs and the aftermarket.Products offered include sealing devices (dynamic and static); filters, systems and instruments to monitor and remove contaminants from fuel, air, oil, water and other liquids and gases; fluid connectors that control, transmit and contain fluid; hydraulic components and systems for builders and users of industrial and mobile machinery and equipment; and high-quality flow control solutions.Aerospace Systems (23.6%): This segment supervises the designing and manufacturing of products and also provides aftermarket support for a broad range of aerospace products including commercial, business jet, military and general aviation aircraft and missile.Products offered include control actuation systems &amp; components, fluid metering, delivery &amp; atomization devices, fuel systems &amp; components, pneumatic control components, hydraulic systems &amp; components and lubrication components among others.The segment's products and services are offered to OEM and maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) customers throughout the world. Notably, the products are marketed by field sales employees and are sold to manufacturers as well as end customers.Story continuesBottom LineAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of a few things: research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Parker-Hannifin a decade ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in June 2013 would be worth $3,621.42, or a 262.14% gain, as of June 12, 2023, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 gained 161.59% and the price of gold went up 35.60% over the same time frame.Analysts are forecasting more upside for PH too.Parker-Hannifin is poised for growth on the back of synergies from the Meggitt buyout (September 2022) and benefits from the Win strategy. The Meggitt buyout has bolstered the company’s Aerospace Systems unit (revenues jumped 88.9% year over year in the fiscal third quarter). Benefits from the Win strategy are driving the company’s margins. The company’s measures to add shareholder value hold promise. In April, the company hiked its dividend by 11%. Backed by these tailwinds, shares of Parker-Hannifin have outperformed its industry in the year-to-date period. However, escalating cost of sales (up 20.5% year over year in the first nine months of fiscal 2023) poses a threat to the company’s bottom line. Foreign currency headwinds are weighing on its top line. Weak liquidity position is an added concern for Parker-Hannifin.Over the past four weeks, shares have rallied 9.92%, and there have been 9 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2023 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

58,cae568be-60dc-3d12-901b-ab3c2b3d7bc3,XEL,2023-06-13,"Time to buy these utility stocks with double-digit upside potential, says Goldman Sachs",TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/time-buy-utility-stocks-double-223855291.html,1686609535,STORY,"['GS', 'SRE', 'XEL', 'NEE']","[The U.S. electric grid is undergoing a huge transformation and renewables have steadily become more widely adopted over the past decade.Adoption is set to continue at a brisk pace, says Goldman Sachs analyst Carly Davenport. Looking ahead, Davenport reckons that by 2032, over 45% of the U.S.’s power generation capacity will come from renewable sources and 6% from coal. That compares to a mix of 30%/16% today and 17%/27% in 2012, making the ongoing change very clear.With this as backdrop, boosted by the Inflation Reduction Act, and as the power generation mix shifts and the Energy transition advances, Davenport believes utilities are “uniquely positioned to facilitate this shift and address associated challenges in a way that creates a cleaner power grid while maintaining reliability and customer affordability.”“This shift will require a significant amount of capital investment,” the analyst went on to add, “which we believe will contribute to attractive earnings and rate base growth in the coming years.”And investors can obviously take advantage of this development, too. With themes such as clean technology, nuclear power, LNG (liquefied natural gas) project additions, and “transmission build out” coming to the fore, investors stand to make use of an “attractive investment opportunity set.”Davenport has compiled a list of stocks, what she and her team call “Decarbonization Enablers,” that are well positioned to take advantage of this trend – and she sees three names posting double-digit growth over the coming months. We ran these picks through the TipRanks database to get a fuller view of their prospects. Let’s check the results.NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE)We’ll start with NextEra Energy, a Florida-based electric utility firm, which, with its $150 billion market cap, is one of the largest utility holding firms in the US utility landscape. NextEra’s chief subsidiary is Florida Power &amp; Light (FPL), which boasts more than 5.8 million customer accounts and provides power to more than 12 million people across Florida. The company generates power at seven utility-grade nuclear generation plants in Florida, making it a major provider of zero-emission power.Story continuesNextEra isn’t just depending on nuclear power for clean energy. The company is also moving into the hydrogen segment of the energy industry. In April of this year, the company announced an understanding between its renewable energy subsidiary NextEra Energy Resources and CF Industries, a major ammonia producer, for development of a hydrogen project at a CF Industries facility in Oklahoma.At the end of Q1, NextEra owned and operated approximately 4,600 megawatts of solar power generation capacity, a total that includes the 970 megawatts of solar capacity brought online during the quarter. This total makes NextEra the largest utility provider of solar power in the US. The company has more than 2,000 megawatts of renewable power and storage projects in its work backlog.This company has a history of beating the earnings expectations and has done so consistently for the past several years, as the case again in the last reported quarter – for 1Q23. Adj. EPS rose from $0.74 in the same period a year ago to $0.84, in turn beating the forecast by $0.11. Likewise on the top-line, revenue climbed by a big 132.5% y/y to $6.72 billion, coming in ahead of expectations by $1.5 billion.Turning to Goldman Sachs’ Carly Davenport, we find her putting a Buy rating on NEE shares, along with a $90 price target that implies a one-year gain of ~22%. (To watch Davenport’s track record, click here)In Davenport’s view, the company’s ability to grow earnings while expanding renewable generation capacity are key points. She writes: “Three key factors underpin our Buy rating: leverage to renewables growth, positive regulatory environment and a long track record of execution at FPL, and above average EPS growth with discounted valuation relative to history. We view NEE’s regulated utility Florida Power &amp; Light (FPL) as a premium regulated utility with a long runway for growth in a positive regulatory backdrop… NEE shares have underperformed the XLU by ~5% YTD, which we believe provides an attractive entry point for investors.”Overall, NEE gets a Strong Buy from the Street’s analyst consensus, based on 12 recent reviews that include 9 Buys and 3 Holds. The shares are trading for $73.98 and have an average price target of $89.45, suggesting ~21% gain on the one-year time frame. (See NEE stock forecast)Sempra Energy (SRE)Next up is Sempra Energy, a San Diego-based energy firm working to deliver power – electricity and natural gas – to some 40 million customers in California, Texas, and Mexico. Sempra is deeply involved in the shift toward cleaner energy technologies, including renewables, and is a major supplier and exporter of liquified natural gas (LNG), which generates significantly fewer carbon emissions than other fossil fuels.Sempra’s LNG operations are extensive. The company currently holds a large ownership stake in the 12 million ton per annum (Mtpa) export facility, Cameron LNG, located in Hackberry, Louisiana on the Gulf Coast. Befitting the firm’s home base in San Diego, Sempra is also working to develop LNG export terminals on the Pacific, at Energia Costa Azul in the northwest of Mexico’s Baja California peninsula. This facility offers potential to cut LNG export transit times to Asia from 21 days to 11 days.Natural gas is big business, and Sempra brought in $6.56 billion in total revenues during Q1 of this year. This was up 71.7% from the prior year, and beat the analysts’ forecast by over $2.5 billion. The company’s bottom line showed a solid profit; adjusted net earnings in 1Q23 came to $2.92 per share – 15 cents better than had been expected.Sempra is using its strong financial base to expand its infrastructure business. As noted, Sempra is building an LNG export facility in northwest Mexico – the company is working on additional LNG export terminals in Texas, to meet expanding global demand for LNG.Expansion of the infrastructure and further buildout of LNG export capabilities are prime points for investors to consider, in Carly Davenport’s opinion. The Goldman analyst writes of Sempra: “SRE has a significant project pipeline for LNG at its Sempra Infrastructure Business (SIP), with the potential for 62 mtpas of total capacity online if all proposed projects come to fruition, with SRE owning a portion of the capacity. While the projects will likely not come online until the late 2020s at the earliest, we expect progress towards reaching FID and beginning construction will serve as positive catalysts for SRE along the way… We view SRE’s business mix favorably and see SIP as a unique opportunity to gain exposure to LNG in the utility sector.”Davenport goes on to rate Sempra shares a Buy, with a $178 price target that shows her confidence in a 21% upside over the coming year.Overall, with 6 recent analyst reviews on file, including 4 Buys and 2 Holds, Sempra gets a Moderate Buy consensus rating from the Street. The shares are selling for $147.17, and their $172.17 average price target implies a 17% gain in the next 12 months. (See Sempra stock forecast)Xcel Energy (XEL)Last on our Goldman-backed energy list is Xcel Energy. This company is known for its commitment to clean, renewable power generation, and boasts a power generation portfolio that features wind, solar, and hydroelectric power, supplemented by natural gas, nuclear, and biomass generation.Power generation is useless without transmission, and Xcel boasts an extensive network of electricity transmission assets. This includes more than 1,200 substations and over 20,000 miles of transmission lines, capable of serving 22,000 megawatts of customer load. Xcel is working to expand this network, which is currently active across 10 states in two major regions of the country. Xcel has transmission networks in Texas-New Mexico-Colorado-Kansas-Oklahoma, as well as in the northern Plains and Great Lakes states of North and South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan.In addition to its power generation and transmission activity, Xcel has been promoting clean energy use and zero-emission vehicles. The company is involved in developing electric vehicle (EV) technology, and offers customers subscription services for renewable energy resources, including solar panel installations.On the financial side, Xcel’s 1Q23 results showed $4.08 billion in total revenues, a solid result that was up 8.8% year-over-year and beat the analyst estimates by $320 million. The bottom-line adj. EPS figure, of 76 cents per share, was up 8.5% y/y, and beat the forecast by 2 cents per share.For Goldman’s Carly Davenport, there are several reasons to back Xcel. She writes: “The primary drivers of our positive view are the accelerated coal replacement with regulated renewables, rate case activity that could drive improved earned vs. authorized ROEs, and leverage to the transmission build out opportunity. We view XEL’s wind and solar resource rich service territory as a key competitive advantage which should enable it to execute on its goals.”Putting some numbers where her mouth is, Davenport gives XEL shares a $75 price target, suggesting an 18% upside in the next 12 months, and supporting her Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating. (To watch Davenport’s track record, click here)Overall, XEL stock gets a Moderate Buy from the analyst consensus, based on 12 reviews with a breakdown of 5 Buys and 7 Holds. The shares have an average price target of $69.73 and a trading price of $63.57, implying upside potential of ~10% for the year ahead.

The company has been significantly progressing on its three strategic pillars — optimize, drive and growth. Also, it has been on track with the Readiness program.Driven by these initiatives and continued business momentum, the company has been witnessing a robust earnings surprise trend, which continued in first-quarter 2023. The top and bottom lines beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and advanced year over year. This marked the 15th straight quarter of an earnings beat. Results were bolstered by strong margins across the Ag Services &amp; Oilseeds and Carbohydrate Solutions segments, and a solid product portfolio.However, Archer Daniels has been witnessing a rising SG&amp;A expense trend for a while now. Also, the dismal performance in the Nutrition Unit has been concerning.Shares of Archer Daniels have lost 11.6% in the past year against the industry’s growth of 4.4%. Moreover, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock compared unfavorably with the sector’s rise of 3.9% and the S&amp;P 500’s improvement of 14.9%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Can Growth Initiatives Lift Stock?Archer Daniels looks poised for long-term growth, owing to its progress on the optimize, drive and growth pillars. Under the optimize pillar, the company revealed plans to expand alternative protein capabilities in Decatur, IL, and starch production in Marshall, MN. It concluded its alternative protein expansion in Serbia and is on track to launch the expanded probiotic capacity in Valencia, Spain.The company also expects to start operating its joint venture crush and refining facility in North Dakota by this year’s harvest. It continues to adapt to consumers’ changing nutritional preferences as part of optimizing growth.Under its drive pillar, ADM has been adapting its organizational structure to meet operational excellence and set goals. Notably, Archer Daniels inked an agreement with Benson Hill to process and commercialize a portfolio of proprietary ingredients derived from their ultra-high protein soybeans.In response to growing trends for all things sustainable, the company has been making efforts to expand its solutions portfolio, which forms part of its Carbohydrate Solutions unit. It collaborated with LG Chem to produce lactic and polylactic acids for bioplastics, which is a plant-based product.Also, ADM launched Biosolutions to expand its portfolio of sustainable higher-margin solutions, particularly for pharmaceuticals and personal care markets. Such endeavors are likely to help attain 10% revenue growth on an annual basis.In a recent development, Archer Daniels entered a joint venture with Gevo to help meet the demand for low-carbon, sustainable aviation fuel. It also decided to shut down its ethanol facility in Peoria by the end of October. The company is utilizing innovative technologies to develop products and boost operating capabilities.Additionally, Archer Daniels is likely to gain from the Readiness goals of driving business improvement, standardizing functions and enriching consumers’ experience, which are on track. As a part of readiness efforts, it introduced a company-wide simplification initiative. The company’s strategic pillars for growth and the aforementioned initiatives are guided and supported by the Readiness program focused on accelerating and enhancing competitiveness.Story continuesHurdles to OvercomeArcher Daniels is lately witnessing soft trends in its Nutrition segment, which is hurting investor sentiment.In first-quarter 2023, the company’s Nutrition segment witnessed a year-over-year revenue decline of 3.7%. The adjusted operating profit fell 23% from the year-ago quarter. The Human Nutrition unit was flat year over year.The Flavors unit was drab due to sluggish results in North America, while sturdy margins aided the Specialty Ingredients unit. The Health &amp; Wellness business remained weak year over year. Also, the Animal Nutrition unit was weak year over year due to lower margins in amino acids.However, management has been making efforts to help reduce destocking impacts in beverage, lower margins in amino acids and the broader demand fulfillment challenges. It expects 2023 operating profit growth of more than 10% on a constant-currency basis, led by Human Nutrition. Also, the company is likely to witness growth toward the back half of the year.In first-quarter 2023, Archer Daniels’ SG&amp;A expenses rose 6.3% to $881 million. The metric grew 14.1%, 13.6%, 10.1% and 16.7% in the fourth, third, second and first quarters of 2022, followed by increases of 4.9%, 13.2%, 15.8% and 12.8% in the fourth, third, second and first quarters of 2021, respectively. This can be attributed to higher performance-related compensation, project-related costs and shifting of costs from business segments into the centralized centers of excellence in supply chain and operations.Higher SG&amp;A expenses linked with higher performance-related compensation, project-related costs and shifting costs from business segments into the centralized centers of excellence in supply chain and operations have been other headwinds. The global impacts of inflation have been concerning. Any deleverage in SG&amp;A expenses has a direct bearing on the company’s profitability.Consumer Staple Stocks Worth a LookWe have highlighted three better-ranked stocks from the Consumer Staple sector, namely, Molson Coors TAP, Monster Beverage MNST and PepsiCo Inc.

With oil prices being supported in this way, some have called on biofuels to fill the gap. This includes the Biden Administration, which has called on more biofuel production to maintain energy independence. With oil prices elevated and electric cars still a minority on roads, biofuel companies have plenty of room to grow in America’s energy industry.Even as the electrification of transportation continues, biofuels still have a role to play as an energy of the future. Biofuels can use much of the same infrastructure as oil and burn more cleanly to boot. And many states already mandate gasoline use, while their use continues to expand into other areas as well. There are still certain types of transport for which electric vehicles probably won’t replace internal combustion for the foreseeable future. Biofuels will be needed to fuel those vehicles if we don’t want oil to do so.The bottom line is that nations want clean transportation, but electric vehicles aren’t ready to fulfill every role. If the nations of the world are going to meet their climate goals and maintain transport infrastructure, they will need biofuels, and biofuel companies, to be ready. So here are 3 of the best biofuel companies to invest in.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsArcher-Daniels-Midland (ADM)red tractor in yellow field with clouds behind itSource: ShutterstockArcher-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM) is a global agriculture and food company and a top-rated biofuel stock. ADM has produced biofuels for over a decade in both Europe and America and has a long history as a top-rated biofuel stock.ADM sits at the intersection of biofuel and agribusiness. In addition to biofuels, they produce food, feed, and various other industrial products. This diverse business model gives them a lot of leeway and means their stock isn’t so dependent on the oil price remaining high. For an investor who wants exposure to the biofuel industry but isn’t sure where oil will go, buying ADM lets you hedge your bets.Story continuesADM has also branched out into carbon capture and storage. This also makes ADM a good choice for an investor wanting to invest in a company that’s fighting climate change. Not only do their biofuels burn more cleanly than traditional fossil fuels, but they’re also working to capture much of the carbon by-products that are produced.ADM’s earnings show them to be a strong and stable company overall. In Q1 2023, they had $24.1 billion in revenue and $1.17 billion in net earnings. Those revenues and earnings are also growing, albeit slowly. Overall, ADM shows promise as a reliable investment that can take advantage of the world’s transition to biofuels. And that makes them one of the best biofuel stocks to invest in.Valero (VLO)A daytime picture of a Valero (VLO) gas station located in San Francisco bay and clear blue sky in the background.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comValero (NYSE:VLO) may be best known as an oil company, but it has emerged as a formidable player in the biofuel industry. As the world’s second-largest producer of corn ethanol, Valero is a top-rated biofuel stock that should be on any investor’s radar.Valero produces corn-ethanol, biodiesel, and hydrated vegetable oil production. They’ve also taken part in a joint venture with Darling Ingredients (NYSE:DAR) called Diamond Green Diesel, which has become one of the largest producers of biodiesel in the world. In fact, Diamond Green Diesel is also looking to produce jet fuel. This is key as large trucks and airplanes are a few areas that have struggled to transition from oil to electric power. Bio-fuels could prove necessary to bridge that gap.Valero’s biofuels division has experienced robust growth, particularly evident in its strong performance during Q1 2023. Revenue in both ethanol and biodiesel segments has grown far more rapidly than revenue from traditional hydrocarbons. This has allowed Valero to remain competitive where other oil companies struggle.Even as transportation becomes more and more electrified, there will still be a market for internal combustion engines in airplanes and trucks. And as nations struggle to reduce their carbon output, biofuels, especially biodiesel, will be seen as a better and better alternative to traditional fossil fuels. Valero has positioned itself well for this future, which makes it a top-rated biofuel company you won’t want to miss out on.Green Plains (GPRE)Ecology, alternative sustainable energy and environment protection saving business concept, GEVOSource: Oleksiy Mark / Shutterstock.comWhile Green Plains (NASDAQ:GPRE) may be a small cap, it has significant upside fueled by its partnerships.Green Plains has created a joint venture with United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) and Tallgrass Energy (privately held) to produce jet fuel from ethanol. With airplanes being a form of travel still innately tied to internal combustion engines, nations want to reduce their carbon cost as much as possible. Bio-jet fuel is a promising avenue, and by partnering directly with an airliner Green Plains has a direct path into this niche.Additionally, Ancora (privately held) is a large shareholder of Green Plains and has urged it to explore a potential sale, citing a possible buyout price of $50 per share. This represents a substantial upside from the current stock price of $29 per share. While the sale is no more than a suggestion now, some are clearly considering the idea. And such a sale could mean a swift return for investors.Green Plains is still a riskier prospect than some other biofuel companies. They are much smaller and less diversified than their peers, for one. And their Q1 2023 earnings show a net loss of $66 million, despite revenue growing to $832 million. Green Plains still has $354 million in cash and cash equivalents, so they aren’t at risk of bankruptcy. But they need to show profitability in addition to growing revenue to truly unlock their potential. Nevertheless, their partnerships and the potential of a sale give them a significant upside. So even if they’re volatile, you should keep Green Plains on your watchlist as a high-return biofuel stock.On the date of publication, John Blankenhorn did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The company has been significantly progressing on its three strategic pillars — optimize, drive and growth. Also, it has been on track with the Readiness program.Driven by these initiatives and continued business momentum, the company has been witnessing a robust earnings surprise trend, which continued in first-quarter 2023. The top and bottom lines beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and advanced year over year. This marked the 15th straight quarter of an earnings beat. Results were bolstered by strong margins across the Ag Services &amp; Oilseeds and Carbohydrate Solutions segments, and a solid product portfolio.However, Archer Daniels has been witnessing a rising SG&amp;A expense trend for a while now. Also, the dismal performance in the Nutrition Unit has been concerning.Shares of Archer Daniels have lost 11.6% in the past year against the industry’s growth of 4.4%. Moreover, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock compared unfavorably with the sector’s rise of 3.9% and the S&amp;P 500’s improvement of 14.9%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Can Growth Initiatives Lift Stock?Archer Daniels looks poised for long-term growth, owing to its progress on the optimize, drive and growth pillars. Under the optimize pillar, the company revealed plans to expand alternative protein capabilities in Decatur, IL, and starch production in Marshall, MN. It concluded its alternative protein expansion in Serbia and is on track to launch the expanded probiotic capacity in Valencia, Spain.The company also expects to start operating its joint venture crush and refining facility in North Dakota by this year’s harvest. It continues to adapt to consumers’ changing nutritional preferences as part of optimizing growth.Under its drive pillar, ADM has been adapting its organizational structure to meet operational excellence and set goals. Notably, Archer Daniels inked an agreement with Benson Hill to process and commercialize a portfolio of proprietary ingredients derived from their ultra-high protein soybeans.In response to growing trends for all things sustainable, the company has been making efforts to expand its solutions portfolio, which forms part of its Carbohydrate Solutions unit. It collaborated with LG Chem to produce lactic and polylactic acids for bioplastics, which is a plant-based product.Also, ADM launched Biosolutions to expand its portfolio of sustainable higher-margin solutions, particularly for pharmaceuticals and personal care markets. Such endeavors are likely to help attain 10% revenue growth on an annual basis.In a recent development, Archer Daniels entered a joint venture with Gevo to help meet the demand for low-carbon, sustainable aviation fuel. It also decided to shut down its ethanol facility in Peoria by the end of October. The company is utilizing innovative technologies to develop products and boost operating capabilities.Additionally, Archer Daniels is likely to gain from the Readiness goals of driving business improvement, standardizing functions and enriching consumers’ experience, which are on track. As a part of readiness efforts, it introduced a company-wide simplification initiative. The company’s strategic pillars for growth and the aforementioned initiatives are guided and supported by the Readiness program focused on accelerating and enhancing competitiveness.Story continuesHurdles to OvercomeArcher Daniels is lately witnessing soft trends in its Nutrition segment, which is hurting investor sentiment.In first-quarter 2023, the company’s Nutrition segment witnessed a year-over-year revenue decline of 3.7%. The adjusted operating profit fell 23% from the year-ago quarter. The Human Nutrition unit was flat year over year.The Flavors unit was drab due to sluggish results in North America, while sturdy margins aided the Specialty Ingredients unit. The Health &amp; Wellness business remained weak year over year. Also, the Animal Nutrition unit was weak year over year due to lower margins in amino acids.However, management has been making efforts to help reduce destocking impacts in beverage, lower margins in amino acids and the broader demand fulfillment challenges. It expects 2023 operating profit growth of more than 10% on a constant-currency basis, led by Human Nutrition. Also, the company is likely to witness growth toward the back half of the year.In first-quarter 2023, Archer Daniels’ SG&amp;A expenses rose 6.3% to $881 million. The metric grew 14.1%, 13.6%, 10.1% and 16.7% in the fourth, third, second and first quarters of 2022, followed by increases of 4.9%, 13.2%, 15.8% and 12.8% in the fourth, third, second and first quarters of 2021, respectively. This can be attributed to higher performance-related compensation, project-related costs and shifting of costs from business segments into the centralized centers of excellence in supply chain and operations.Higher SG&amp;A expenses linked with higher performance-related compensation, project-related costs and shifting costs from business segments into the centralized centers of excellence in supply chain and operations have been other headwinds. The global impacts of inflation have been concerning. Any deleverage in SG&amp;A expenses has a direct bearing on the company’s profitability.Consumer Staple Stocks Worth a LookWe have highlighted three better-ranked stocks from the Consumer Staple sector, namely, Molson Coors TAP, Monster Beverage MNST and PepsiCo Inc.

(PM): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-philip-morris-130007912.html,1686574807,STORY,['PM'],"[Philip Morris (PM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this seller of Marlboro and other cigarette brands have returned -2.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Tobacco industry, which Philip Morris falls in, has lost 4.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Philip Morris is expected to post earnings of $1.47 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -0.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.2%.The consensus earnings estimate of $6.20 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +3.7%. This estimate has changed -0.3% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.79 indicates a change of +9.4% from what Philip Morris is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.6%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Philip Morris.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Philip Morris, the consensus sales estimate of $8.71 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +11.2%. The $35.13 billion and $36.61 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +10.6% and +4.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPhilip Morris reported revenues of $8.1 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.6%. EPS of $1.38 for the same period compares with $1.56 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.08 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.3%. The EPS surprise was +3.76%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Philip Morris is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Philip Morris. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

66,0f234ee1-a07c-3596-88af-38f82c04ea00,ROP,2023-06-13,"Can Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP) Performance Keep Up Given Its Mixed Bag Of Fundamentals?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/roper-technologies-inc-nyse-rop-150441912.html,1686582281,STORY,['ROP'],"[Roper Technologies' (NYSE:ROP) stock is up by 5.5% over the past three months. Given that the stock prices usually follow long-term business performance, we wonder if the company's mixed financials could have any adverse effect on its current price price movement In this article, we decided to focus on Roper Technologies'  ROE.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for Roper Technologies How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Roper Technologies is:6.3% = US$1.0b ÷ US$16b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.06.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Roper Technologies' Earnings Growth And 6.3% ROEOn the face of it, Roper Technologies' ROE is not much to talk about. A quick further study shows that the company's ROE doesn't compare favorably to the industry average of 11% either. Given the circumstances, the significant decline in net income by 6.1% seen by Roper Technologies over the last five years is not surprising. We believe that there also might be other aspects that are negatively influencing the company's earnings prospects. For instance, the company has a very high payout ratio, or is faced with competitive pressures.Story continuesThat being said, we compared Roper Technologies' performance with the industry and were concerned when we found that while the company has shrunk its earnings, the industry has grown its earnings at a rate of 20% in the same period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for ROP? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Roper Technologies Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Despite having a normal three-year median payout ratio of 27% (where it is retaining 73% of its profits), Roper Technologies has seen a decline in earnings as we saw above. So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For example, the business has faced some headwinds.Moreover, Roper Technologies has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 18% over the next three years. As a result, the expected drop in Roper Technologies' payout ratio explains the anticipated rise in the company's future ROE to 9.3%, over the same period.ConclusionOverall, we have mixed feelings about Roper Technologies. While the company does have a high rate of profit retention, its low rate of return is probably hampering its earnings growth. Having said that, looking at current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings growth rate is expected to see a huge improvement.

PPG recently introduced PPG ENVIRO-PRIME EPIC 200R coatings, an array of electrocoat (e-coat) solutions for automotive manufacturers that cure at lower temperatures than rival technologies. Customers benefit from the product's sustainability features, such as lower energy consumption and CO2 emissions at production sites.Higher oven temperatures are often required for conventional e-coats to cure over thicker substrates and complex assemblies, resulting in uneven appearance and color variances.

The company has also outperformed its industry’s rise of 6.7% over the same time frame. It has also topped the S&amp;P 500’s roughly 11.3% rise over the same period.Let’s take a look into the factors behind the stock’s price appreciation. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Pricing &amp; Cost Actions Drive PPGPPG Industries, a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, is benefiting from higher pricing across its segments, manufacturing efficiencies, cost discipline and efforts to grow its business through acquisitions amid headwinds from demand weakness in Europe and China.The company is implementing a cost-cutting and restructuring strategy, as well as optimizing its working capital requirements. The cost savings generated by these restructuring initiatives will act as a tailwind for the company. PPG Industries has undertaken extensive restructuring efforts to reduce its cost structure, primarily focusing on regions and end markets with weak business conditions. The company expects to deliver incremental restructuring savings of roughly $10-$15 million in second-quarter 2023.PPG Industries is also raising selling prices across its business segments to offset the impact of cost inflation in raw materials, energy and logistics. The company witnessed a significant increase in its profits in the first quarter driven by pricing growth across segments, improved manufacturing efficiencies and overall cost discipline. Pricing measures are likely to continue to support its margins in the remainder of 2023.The company is also undertaking measures to grow business inorganically through value-creating acquisitions. Contributions from the acquisitions are expected to get reflected in its performance in 2023. Acquisitions, including Tikkurila, Worwag and Cetelon, are likely to contribute to its top line this year.PPG Industries also remains committed to boost shareholder returns with cash deployment. It has an impressive record of returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. It has raised the annual dividend payout for 51 consecutive years. In 2022, the company returned around $570 million to shareholders through dividends and about $190 million through share repurchases. It also paid dividends worth around $145 million in the first quarter.Story continuesEstimates Going UpOver the past two months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for PPG for second-quarter 2023 has increased around 8.7%. The consensus estimate for 2023 has also been revised 4.9% upward over the same time frame. The favorable estimate revisions instill investor confidence in the stock. PPG Industries, Inc.

A new study outlines how people who work or interact with artificial intelligence may suffer from loneliness and insomnia. From Barbie to McDonald's Grimace, companies are bringing back some of their most iconic mascots. Yahoo Finance Live breaks it all down.Video Transcript- All right, let's take a look at some of the top trending stories of the day. We've got Alexandra Canal, Josh Schafer here, as always, help us to break down what is trending with all of you. First up, we got to start with the latest with Elon Musk and Twitter. And Ali, we're learning a little bit more, just about what maybe his plans are going to be like for the platform.- Yeah, it seems like Musk wants to balance some of those more conservative voices with some liberal ones. In a tweet, he wrote, quote-- basically pleading to Rachel Maddow, Don Lemon, and others to put their shows on the platform. He said that those news anchors will receive Twitter's full support. ""The digital town square is for all.""So this seems to be what Musk has been trying to do, especially with Twitter spaces. In the span of two weeks, he hosted Republican presidential candidate, Ron DeSantis, along with Democratic nominee Robert F. Kennedy Jr. And it really seems like he wants to create this digital town hall.I think, personally, it's a good idea, considering when he first took over Twitter, there was a lot of concern, that there was chaos, and that there were just a lot of hate on the platform, especially from the advertising perspective. So perhaps, this could change the narrative?- Full support sounds good. I would give full support with some money if I was Elon. Why don't you start paying these people to use the platform, to come on the platform, so you promote Twitter more and then you can actually grow the platform through that and sell ads through that. But it reinvents the revenue model a little bit here, which they're clearly having problems with.Story continues- Yeah.- You're clearly having problems selling ads. So if you can create content, like a streaming service, it seems like they're trying to push Twitter almost a little bit more as a streaming service. Well, if you want me to be on your platform and create content on your platform, pay me like a content creator. That's what TikTok does.- Well, I suppose, yes. But he's going to look for these names. Like, I mean, he's making a play for Lemon, and Lemon certainly looking for something. Although, he said he's going to take the summer off. So it'll be the fall season that we're looking for something there.I mean-- and he had already made this, kind of, reach out to Don Lemon, you recall, right after he left CNN. So it's not surprising that he's, kind of, coming back with that today, especially to balance out the Conservative voices that you have there. And you have Tucker Carlson's show there now.- Yeah, he's trying to play both sides here. We'll see whether or not it is successful. In terms of this tweet, though, it is pinned at the top of his Twitter profile right now, so it shows that, at least, this initiative is a priority for now. We know that Musk does tend to change his mind pretty often, so we'll see how long he does stick with this.But to what you guys were saying, it's exactly right. Twitter, as it was before, Musk had gotten there this reliance on ad revenue. It's not working with him at the helm off. Just about 60% on a year-over-year basis. We know that was so critical in terms of the success of the company. So he is looking to other avenues in terms of diversifying that future revenue stream.I think he's still going to have the problem that Twitter has always had, and that's just the trust right now. In terms of people going back to the platform, knowing that they can trust and rely on the news that is being shared. Yes, obviously. It will be super helpful if you have recognizable names that are out there giving that news. You know exactly where it is coming from. But I think beyond that, that's a big question for Twitter.- Especially with AI, too, right? There's images that are unverified, and then you have the Twitter verification system all over the place right now. But he does seem to have the support from the Twitter leadership board. There was a tweet from the New CEO, Linda Yaccarino, she wrote in her own Twitter thread earlier today, quote, ""Have you ever been talking with someone particularly insightful and thought you should have the freedom to speak your mind? We all should. Enter Twitter 2.0."" So this free speech push is really the big story here for Twitter.- And speaking of AI, that's a good segue way. All right, a new study published today in the Journal of Applied Psychology found, people working with AI are more lonely and can suffer from insomnia. And the remedy, apparently, is more AI. One of the things that stuck out to me was one of the ways they thought that they could remedy this situation was like giving AI a human-like voice. So I was just struck by that. Like, why is the solution more technology to this problem?- Honestly, this report just strikes me as someone who doesn't like their job, right? Insomnia and comes home after work and wants a drink. Like, you could apply that to a lot of different jobs out there, not just AI. And I can see-- I mean, I go on social media sometimes.You fall in that rabbit hole. A couple of hours go by. And after you snap out of it, you are a little depressed, and you need to see other humans and see the sunshine. So I don't know if I buy this being totally pegged with AI.- It would be the same answers if you just overused your laptop.- Right.- Or if you overuse--- Technology across the board.- Right. The amount of things I read that say that I have insomnia because I'd use my phone right before you go to bed, right? I think that, sort of, is always, kind of, in line with that. So it wasn't too-too surprising to see. But I mean--- It's not too-too surprising, but the fact that we are in this AI revolution, I think they're trying to call out some of the issues and potential dangers with being just too consumed within this space. So again, definitely not surprising, especially about the insomnia piece. And so, this data matched up, whether we were talking about because they did the study in the US and in parts of Asia as well. So it matched up across the board.- Yeah, there was only 800 people surveyed in this. So I think it's kind of suggestive rather than conclusive of exactly what AI's impact is on workers out there. But I do think it brings up a good point, and that's the fact. And really, what we've talked about so much when it comes to AI, and that's the need to use it responsibly.And there are so many questions out there. Just because we are in the early stages of this adoption, what exactly it's going to do to employees whose employer is using AI on a more regular basis. Obviously, that is happening across the board and really points to the employer's responsibility to help their employees navigate this uncertain time.There was another recent survey from the Boston Consulting Group. And in that, they found that only 29%, so less than a third of workers out there say that their companies have enacted, quote, ""adequate measures"" to ensure the response will use of AI compared to nearly 70% of leaders who said the same.So certainly, there is a shortcoming out there, just in the part of the employer for what they have provided in their employees. But I also think this is what a learning process is all about. When you have a new technology, technology is going to take time to try and figure out all the risks out there and how to best protect yourself and others around you from AI and from those risks.- Maybe they'll set a similar limits, like the screen time limits that we give our kids.- We'll see.- But I don't know if it's possible with AI. That's the thing.- It becomes a loop, I think, at some point, right? Where if you're using it a lot, then you need to use it more because you're reliant on it. I think there are plenty of things in life that work like that, right? But it starts to work like that, and then like those other things, it can be detrimental to you.- Certainly. All right, well, let's end this on a lighter note. Because this summer, it seems like it's all about those retro remakes. We have movies like ""Little Mermaid"" and ""Barbie"". Also, McDonald's bringing back their mascot, the Grimace. It's making us ask if this summer is all about nostalgia.And guys, it certainly seems like that, even from the movie theaters to what McDonald's doing to what's in style right now. Ali, when it comes to retail. '90s baggy pants, bell bottom jeans are also making a comeback here, even the sneakers that Josh Rock said-- oh, you don't have them on today. Those are something that all of our dads wore years ago.- You got to ask me, if you're going to use me as a prop.- I know. I didn't think of it, so I was just talking right there.- I'm going to hold my hand as responsible for part of this, kind of, nostalgia kickback. Because I feel like this is partly Gen X/older millennials, so the end of Gen X-- the end. Like, this is our generation, you know? So the scrunchie, I was definitely-- I had a scrunchie on my hand earlier. And I'm like, oh, I got to take it off.- Well, I brought it just to show that I'm carrying the scrunchie. I own several bell bottom jeans. I actually just threw out a pair of white Skechers that I had for way too long because my mother was like, those are ugly. You need to get rid of them. But again, they were back in style.I think there are a few reasons why this is happening. I think a big thing is social media, right? TikTok, Instagram. You can make anything go viral. And if you have a couple older celebrities saying, hey, bring back Dunkaroos, that's an easy sell for the company.And then on the movie side, the fact that we have this strong IP, right? ""Transformers,"" ""Indiana Jones,"" ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles."" that's bankable content for these theaters. That has already has a built-in audience. That's why you see a lot of prequels, a lot of sequesl. So to me, this makes perfect sense.- ""Barbie Movie.""- I walked into the movie theater-- I walked into the movie thing a little bit because I was curious. Because I feel like it's always about the past, right? That's all we're always doing, right? Retro is always popular, and it's always popular in Hollywood. So I went back a decade. If we look at the top box office movies, in 2013, you'll see ""Iron Man 3,"" ""The Hunger Games,"" ""Despicable Me 2,"" ""Man of Steel,"" which is a Superman movie, and ""Monsters University,"" which is a ""Monster Inc."" remake.So those are all series, all remakes. And then when you take a look at 2023, and what the top grossing movies are through this year, it's really, kind of, the same story, right? You have ""Super Mario Bros,"" which is, obviously, a callback. And then, you have a lot of other series, and you have a lot of Disney series and a lot of cartoons.I think we're all always into old things. We're all always into whatever cartoon we grew up with. It's just that, that age gets a little bit older. So then, they get more money. So then, they buy a little bit of merchandise we put it in Hollywood.- And they're making the decisions. I think part of that is the decision makers in these boardrooms.- It's easy to say yes to something when you can point back to that data years ago and say, look how many people came, look at how many people are interested. You get the merch. You have the ""Star Wars"" content on Disney Plus. You have Baby Yoda selling out everywhere. So it makes sense. It's just this ecosystem that, I think, nostalgia is always going to win out in the end.- It certainly has, and it doesn't seem like that trend to stopping anytime soon, given how much hype everyone is given to ""Barbie,"" ""Little Mermaid,"" especially ""Barbie.""- I'm looking forward to real life ""Paw Patrol"" movie in 10 years. It's going to be good.- I mean, they already-- they have a live action ""Lion King,"" which was questionable how--- Live action ""Paw Patrol.""- Did you see how fast Josh tried to move us away from ""Barbie?"" Just now, he's like, it's not just ""Barbie.""- We to talk about ""Barbie a"" lot.- I don't know.- I think we all have to see it. Group trip.- Exactly.- Ali and Josh, thanks so much.]"

Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant. Schlumberger is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Valuation is also important, so investors should note that Schlumberger has a Forward P/E ratio of 15.78 right now. This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 14.73.Story continuesMeanwhile, SLB's PEG ratio is currently 0.54. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. Oil and Gas - Field Services stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 0.67 based on yesterday's closing prices.The Oil and Gas - Field Services industry is part of the Oils-Energy sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 218, putting it in the bottom 14% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.You can find more information on all of these metrics, and much more, on Zacks.com.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

78,15685c7e-8c08-3e68-b666-613577168dcb,SLB,2023-06-13,Is It Worth Investing in Schlumberger (SLB) Based on Wall Street's Bullish Views?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/worth-investing-schlumberger-slb-based-133007864.html,1686576607,STORY,['SLB'],"[Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Schlumberger (SLB) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Schlumberger currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.13, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 19 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.13 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 19 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 16 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 84.2% and 15.8% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for SLBBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for SLBCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Schlumberger here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Schlumberger, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Story continuesZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is SLB a Good Investment?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Schlumberger, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $3.01.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Schlumberger. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Schlumberger.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

79,2fff1ba4-c200-3f5f-92c1-d03db3eedec0,PKG,2023-06-13,The 7 Most Reliable Dividend Stocks to Buy Now,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-most-reliable-dividend-stocks-230207870.html,1686092527,STORY,"['CVX', 'VLO', 'BKE', 'SNY', 'MSM', 'MAN', 'PKG']","[Primarily, investors target the most reliable dividend stocks to widen their margin of safety. At the end of the day, no matter what system you run or how much you listen to market gurus (or think you are one yourself), no one knows what the market will do. If they did, no one would be selling that information for any price.However, because of the unpredictability of the market, top dividend stocks to buy make plenty of sense. For example, if your capital returns don’t quite measure up, you can rely on the passive income component of your portfolio to help lift total net performance. As well, some investors may depend on these payouts to pay for everyday living expenses, which may be the case for high-yield reliable dividend stocks. Another reason to consider enterprises that offer recurring shareholder returns is stability. Dividends must come from somewhere, which means that companies providing passive income typically command established businesses. At a time like this, the below trustworthy dividend stocks may be well worth their weight in gold.MSMMSC Industrial$92.82MANManpower Group$75.43CVXChevron$155.79VLOValero Energy$109.27SNYSanofi$51.49PKGPackaging Corp. of America$129.57BKEBuckle$32.69MSC Industrial (MSM)A photo of a young boy wearing sunglasses, jeans, a blazer, a white shirt and suspenders holding money in various denominations in one hand and sitting in a plush chair.Source: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.comA direct marketer and supplier of a broad range of metalworking and maintenance and repair supplies, MSC Industrial (NYSE:MSM) offers broad relevancies for industrial enterprises throughout the U.S. Presently, the company carries a market capitalization of $5.23 billion. Since the beginning of this year, MSM gained almost 15% of its equity value.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWhile certainly not the most exciting name among the most reliable dividend stocks, MSC brings plenty of fiscal substance to the table. Mainly, the company enjoys a stable balance sheet. In particular, its equity-to-asset ratio comes in at 0.56, ranked above 67.53% of enterprises in the industrial distribution industry. Also, its Altman Z-Score clocks in at 5.81, indicating high stability and low risk of bankruptcy.Story continuesRegarding passive income, MSC carries a forward yield of 3.38%. Its payout ratio sits at just over 50%, which is near the upper end of what most investors consider a sustainable yield. Adding to its relevance, MSC features 19 years of consecutive dividend increases. Thus, it’s one of the top dividend stocks to buy from a holistic perspective.Manpower Group (MAN)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large text.Source: iQoncept/shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, ManpowerGroup (NYSE:MAN) bills itself as the leading global workforce solutions firm. Per its public profile, the company helps organizations transform in a fast-changing world of work by sourcing, assessing, developing, and managing the talent that enables them to win. Featuring a market cap of $3.78 billion, MAN stock dipped 11% since the Jan. opener.Nevertheless, ManpowerGroup makes a strong case for the most reliable dividend stocks. Fundamentally, while workers may maintain some of the edges against employers when it comes to negotiating workplace environments, the pendulum may swing under a recession. From a financial perspective, the company isn’t remarkable. That said, it does enjoy consistent profitability.Surely, its resilience in the bottom line helps with its passive income profile. Presently, ManpowerGroup carries a forward yield of 3.93%. In addition, its payout ratio sits at 40.33%, fostering confidence in terms of yield sustainability. Also, management posts 13 years of consecutive dividend increases. Thus, it makes a case for relevant and stable dividend stocks to consider.Chevron (CVX)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comOne of the world’s leading integrated energy companies, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) is involved in virtually every facet of the energy industry. Put another way, it commands business units in exploration and production (upstream), storage and transportation (midstream), and refining and marketing (downstream). As of this writing, Chevron carries a market cap of nearly $294 billion. Since the Jan. opener, CVX lost more than 10%.At first glance, CVX might not seem a viable idea for the most reliable dividend stocks. Further, looking ahead, the electrification of mobility seems to challenge hydrocarbons for their dominance. Still, the issue is that in many cases, the electricity that electric vehicles use comes from hydrocarbon sources. So, even incorporating the EV argument, fossil fuels will probably be relevant well into the future.Sure, it’s not the popular argument. However, it’s important to deal with realities. Combined with Chevron’s stout growth and profitability, it’s a reasonable idea for high-yield reliable dividend stocks. Indeed, CVX carries a forward yield of 3.87%. As well, its payout ratio sits at 41.32%, which is very reasonable. Finally, Chevron features 37 years of consecutive dividend increases, making a case for trustworthy dividend stocks to buy.Valero Energy (VLO)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockBased in San Antonio, Texas, Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO) is an international manufacturer and marketer of transportation fuels and petrochemical products. Per its corporate profile, Valero operates 15 petroleum refineries with a combined throughput capacity of approximately 3.2 million barrels per day and 13 ethanol plants with a combined production capacity of approximately 1.68 billion gallons per year. Featuring a market cap of $39.5 billion, VLO dipped 9% year-to-date.Again, the hydrocarbon narrative might not sound politically relevant given the push for EVs and renewable energy infrastructure. However, it’s also important to note that because of the intermittency, renewables represent the least reliable energy sources. Therefore, VLO should be relevant for decades to come, adding to its case for the most reliable dividend stocks. Also, investors may appreciate how undervalued VLO is. Right now, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 5.17, ranking better than 72.21% of the competition.Turning to passive income, Valero carries a forward yield of 3.73%. To be fair, it doesn’t have a history of dividend increases. Still, its payout ratio sits at 30.08%, potentially making it one of the trustworthy dividend stocks.Sanofi (SNY)sheet of paper marked ""dividends"" with a $20 bill on top of it to represent dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockHailing from Paris, France, Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) engages in the research and development, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical drugs principally in the prescription market. As well, its public profile mentions that it develops over-the-counter medication. At the moment, Sanofi carries a market cap of almost $129 billion. Since the beginning of this year, SNY gained more than 4% of its equity value.Standing among the top pharmaceutical firms in the world, Sanofi commands strong relevancies, thus making SNY enticing as one of the most reliable dividend stocks. Significantly, the company rates highly in terms of profitability. For example, its trailing-year net margin clocks in at 18.44%, outflanking 87.26% of companies listed in the drug manufacturing industry.Also, it’s undervalued. Right now, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 11.59. As a discount to projected earnings, Sanofi ranks better than 70.31% of the competition. Finally, the company’s forward yield stands at 3.73%, above the healthcare sector’s average yield of 1.58%. Also, its payout ratio sits at just under 39%, making SNY one of the top dividend stocks to buy.Packaging Corp of America (PKG)dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Lake Forest, Illinois, Packaging Corp of America (NYSE:PKG) is the third-largest producer of containerboard products and the third-largest producer of uncoated freesheet paper in North America. Currently, the company carries a market cap of $11.52 billion. Since the beginning of this year, PKG dipped ever so slightly below parity.Nevertheless, moving forward, PKG represents a strong case for the most reliable dividend stocks. Fundamentally, e-commerce continues to represent an overall burgeoning segment of total retail sales. Unless you anticipate this trend reversing, Packaging Corp should be quite relevant. Also, the company features overall solid (though arguably unremarkable) financial statistics. However, where Packaging clearly shines is in profitability. With a trailing-year net margin of 11.61%, the enterprise blows past 88.74% of its sector rivals.Lastly, Packaging features a forward yield of 3.9%, conspicuously outpacing the material sector’s average yield of 2.82%. To be sure, its payout ratio of 59.76% is a bit on the high side but it’s still reasonable. As well, the company features 12 years of consecutive payout increases, making PKG one of the high-yield reliable dividend stocks to consider.Buckle (BKE)image of hands holding small money bag symbolizing dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockArguably the riskiest idea for most reliable dividend stocks on this list, Buckle (NYSE:BKE) is an American fashion retailer. Offering a unique mix of high-quality, on-trend apparel, accessories, and footwear per its corporate profile, Buckle caters to fashion-conscious young men and women. Presently, it features a market cap of $1.66 billion. However, BKE lost almost 28% of its equity value since the Jan. opener. Obviously, that’s not a great selling point for trustworthy dividend stocks. However, on a financial note, Buckle enjoys a solid cash balance relative to the underlying industry. Also, its Altman Z-Score clocks in at 5.69, indicating low bankruptcy risk.Moreover, Buckle resonates with its audience as evidenced by its three-year revenue growth rate of 13.7%. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period impresses at 30%. With all that, BKE remains undervalued, trading at a forward multiple of only 8.4.In closing, Buckle carries a forward yield of 4.27%. As well, its payout ratio sits at just under 33%. For those seeking top dividend stocks to buy with a contrarian twist, BKE might be interesting.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

AIG and G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. GIII.4 Stocks With Low Price-to-Cash Flow Ratio to Buy NowInvestment in stocks made on diligent value analysis is usually considered one of the best practices. In value investing, investors pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally sound. There are a number of ratios to identify value stocks but none alone can conclusively determine their inherent potential.Each ratio helps an investor understand a particular aspect of the company’s business. One such ratio, Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF), can work wonders in stock picking if used prudently. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis – the lower the number, the better. Unum Group, General Motors Company, American International Group, Inc. and G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. boast a low P/CF ratio.Why P/CF Ratio?You must be wondering why we are considering this when the most widely used valuation metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E). Well, an important factor that makes P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing a company’s financial health.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. Then again, cash flow is quite reliable. Net cash flow unveils how much money a company generates and how effectively management is deploying the same.A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company’s liquid assets. This gives the company the means to settle debt, meet its expenses, reinvest in the business, endure downturns and finally undertake shareholder-friendly moves. Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which, in turn, lowers its flexibility to support these endeavors.Story continuesHowever, an investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and take into account the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chances of falling into a value trap.Here are four of the 11 stocks that qualified the screening:Unum Group, which provides financial protection benefit solutions, sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has an expected EPS growth rate of 8.4% for three-five years.

CTLT reported third-quarter fiscal 2023 adjusted loss per share of 9 cents against earnings per share (EPS) of $1.04 in the year-over-year period.

However, the metric surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11.5%.At constant exchange rate or CER, revenues were down 17%.The top line was hampered by soft performances by both its segment in the reported quarter.Organic net revenues (excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and currency translation) decreased 19% year over year.Segments in DetailPer Catalent’s new organizational structure, it reports via two segments — Biologics and Pharma and Consumer Health.Revenues in the Biologics segment fell 32.1% year over year on a reported basis (down 32% at CER) to $475 million in the quarter under review.This compares to our projection of fiscal third-quarter segmental revenues of $485.4 million.Revenues in the Pharma and Consumer Health segment decreased 1.9% from the year-ago period (up 1% at CER) to $563 million.This compares to our projection of fiscal third-quarter segmental revenues of $449.2 million.Catalent, Inc.

QuoteOperational UpdateIn the quarter under review, Catalent’s gross profit fell 57.4% to $180 million.

Total debt at the end of third-quarter fiscal 2023 was $4.85 billion, flat compared with that at the end of the fiscal second quarter.Cumulative net cash provided by operating activities at the end of third-quarter fiscal 2023 was $58 million compared with $370 million a year ago.GuidanceCatalent has reduced its financial outlook for fiscal 2023 from the one it had provided during its presentation of its fiscal third-quarter business update in May.The company projects revenues within $4,225 million-$4,325 million, down from the previous outlook of $4,250 million-$4,350 million for the full year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2023 revenues is currently pegged at $4.28 billion.Our TakeCatalent exited the third quarter of fiscal 2023 with dismal overall top-line and bottom-line performances. The decline in both segments’ reported revenues during the period was disappointing as well. Rising operating costs leading to the contraction of gross margin in the quarter do not bode well. Catalent incurring adjusted operating loss also raises apprehension.On a positive note, Catalent’s better-than-expected results in the reported quarter and the year-over-year improvement in the Pharma and Consumer Health segment at CER were impressive. Catalent had undertaken some facility expansion activities during the reported quarter, besides launching some notable products over the past few months.

The innovative diamond tip of the EZ-IO Needle, a crucial part of the Arrow EZ-IO Intraosseous Vascular Access System, is made for rapid, exact and steady insertion.The recent development will bolster Teleflex’s Vascular Access segment.More on the NewsThe EZ-IO System can prove beneficial when intravenous access is difficult to obtain due to an emergency, an urgent situation or a medical necessity. The new labeling enables the practitioner to continue treating patients who need MRI scans without interrupting the vascular access site's operation. To enhance patient care, Clinical and Medical Affairs is dedicated to promoting the increased usage of Teleflex medical devices. Now, there is a second vascular access choice for patients who need an urgent or emergent MRI.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTeleflex continues developing technologies for physicians who want to offer enhanced and consistent care in urgent situations. The company is optimistic about the Arrow EZ-IO Needle receiving MR Conditional clearance and is eager to explore new avenues to provide patients and healthcare professionals with excellent treatment solutions.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Grand View Research, the global vascular access devices market size was valued at $1.77 billion in 2022 and is anticipated to witness a CAGR of 5% by 2030. Patient demographics — the aging global population, the rising cancer prevalence and the widespread metabolic, respiratory and cardiovascular disorders — are expected to fuel market growth.Progress Within Vascular Access SegmentFollowing the $976-million acquisition of Vascular Solutions, there has been accelerated growth within Teleflex’ vascular and interventional access product portfolios.During the reported quarter, the company introduced two new products intended to improve PICC insertion procedures and lower the risk of problems. First, the business introduced the next-generation Arrow VPS Rhythm DLX device, which uses a patient's cardiac electrical activity to offer real-time PICC catheter tip location information. Using the DLX eliminates the need for confirmatory x-rays that shortens the time it takes to start therapy and lowers the cost.Story continuesTeleflex introduced a new Arrow PICC that already has preloaded NaviCurve Stylet. A flexible tip and anatomical curb on the NaviCurve Stylet allow it to self-orient to the patient's anatomy for effective PICC insertion into the superior vena cava.Within interventional business, the company relaunched Langston catheter that progressed through the first quarter with product availability in the United States, Canada Australia and New Zealand. The Langston catheter continues to build value for the company’s customers, enhance its engagement with clinicians in TAVR and demonstrates its relevance in the structural heart space. Teleflex expects further product launches in the interventional business over the coming years, including complex catheters in the structural part market.In June 2023, Teleflex received the FDA clearance for Wattson Temporary Pacing Guidewire. The company will feature Wattson at TVT — The Structural Heart Summit between Jun 7-10 in Phoenix. The latest development will expand the Structural Heart Portfolio, with the first commercially-available bipolar temporary pacing guidewire designed specifically for use during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV).Price PerformanceShares of the company have dropped 11.2% in the past year compared with the industry’s fall of 4.5%.Zacks Rank and Key PicksTeleflex carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

It is on track with the execution of its Power Plan 2023 plan.An uptrend in the Zacks Consensus Estimate echoes the same sentiment. Earnings estimates for GPS’s current financial year have increased 4.9% to 64 cents over the past 30 days.Let’s Delve DeeperGap has long been gaining from the continued momentum across its Athleta brand. The Athleta brand’s value-driven active and lifestyle categories, increased digital marketing investments, and focus on product strategy have been aiding sales.Although net sales fell 11% in first-quarter fiscal 2023 for the Athleta brand, the metric grew 45% from the pre-pandemic levels. Segmental results gained from continued share gains. Increased focus on performance-active and active lifestyle products to capitalize on the evolving shopping trends bodes well. It has also emerged as one of the fastest-growing women's athleisure brands in North America. Driven by these factors, Athleta remains on track to reach $2 billion in net sales by fiscal 2023.The company remains on track with aggressively undertaking cost-management actions in the fiscal first quarter. It has been making efforts to simplify and optimize its operating model and structure, including increasing spans of control and decreasing management layers to improve the quality and speed of decision-making, as well as creating a consistent organizational structure across all four brands.These actions are expected to generate $300 million in annualized savings, of which half is expected to be realized in the latter half of fiscal 2023. Apart from these efforts, the company is expected to realize $250 million in annualized savings, as announced in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Gap revealed plans to further optimize its marketing spend and rationalize its technology investments over the next few years.The execution of its Power Plan 2023, which focuses on opening highly-profitable Old Navy and Athleta stores, while closing the underperforming Gap and Banana Republic stores, bodes well. As part of the plan, the company expects the Old Navy and Athleta brands to contribute about 70% of sales by 2023.As part of its 350 store closure plan, the company expects to close 50-55 Gap and Banana Republic stores this year. It is likely to fulfill its 350 store closure plan by the end of 2023. GPS has already achieved 90% of the target in 2022. With the closing of underperforming Gap and Banana Republic stores, the company expects to realize $100 million in EBITDA savings on an annualized basis by the end of 2023. It anticipates leveraging its powerful platform to deliver competitive omni capabilities to meet customers’ needs, all fueled by its scaled operations.GPS targets the e-commerce business to contribute 50% of sales by the end of 2023. Through the plan, the company expects to deliver consistent sales growth, margin expansion and strong operating cash flow.Such cost-saving efforts led to an adjusted SG&amp;A (as a percentage of sales) leverage of 60 basis points to 36.6%. Adjusted gross margin of 37.2% expanded 570 basis points (bps) year over year due to a 610-bps rise in adjusted merchandise margins, stemming from lower airfreight and improved promotions, offset by inflationary headwinds. The adjusted operating margin expanded 620 bps to 0.5%, driven by improved gross margin, stemming from reduced air freight expenses and improved promotional activity.Consequently, Gap’s bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved year over year. For the fiscal first quarter, adjusted earnings of a penny per share compared favorably against a loss of 44 cents reported in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Notably, the second quarter and fiscal 2023 gross margins are envisioned to expand year over year.Story continuesHeadwinds to OvercomeGap has been reeling under uncertain macro and consumer environments. This led to a year-over-year sales decline of 6%. Comparable sales (comps) fell 3% on a year-over-year basis. Management anticipates fiscal 2023 sales to decrease in the low to mid-single-digit range compared to our estimate of a 4.6% decline. For second-quarter fiscal 2023, it expects sales to decrease in the mid to high-single-digit range, whereas it reported $3.86 billion last year. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research ConclusionAlthough GPS shares have lost 7.3% in the past three months compared with the industry’s decline of 4.8%, strength in its Athleta brand, cost-saving efforts and the Power Plan 2023 are likely to aid. Topping it, a VGM Score of A and a long-term earnings growth rate of 12% raise optimism in this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked companies that investors may consider are Tecnoglass TGLS, Kroger KR and TJX Companies TJX.Tecnoglass manufactures and sells architectural glass and aluminum products for the residential and commercial construction industries.

96,bf8ad35a-0d08-3086-9cdc-7124ce790edc,TJX,2023-06-13,Buy These 4 Low-Leverage Stocks Amid Recent Market Optimism,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-4-low-leverage-stocks-121100271.html,1686571860,STORY,"['TJX', 'ATO']","[U.S. stocks soared on Jun 9, buoyed by growing optimism among investors over the economic outlook and anticipation that the Federal Reserve would not make another rate hike this time.This must encourage investors to buy stocks now, with an improved market scenario projected in the near term. However, considering the fact that the overall market situation might return to a state of volatility at any point of time due to some sudden uncertainty arising in the global market space, a prudent investor should go for stocks that are safe bets. To this end, we recommend stocks like Atmos Energy ATO, The TJX Companies TJX, Linde PLC LIN and MINISO Group Holding Limited MNSO, which bear low leverage. These can therefore shield investors from incurring losses in times of crisis.Now, before selecting low-leverage stocks, let’s explore what leverage is and how choosing a low-leverage stock helps investors.In finance, leverage is a term used to denote the practice of borrowing capital by companies to run their operations smoothly and expand the same. Such borrowings are done through debt financing. But there remains an option for equity finance. This is probably due to the cheap and easy availability of debt over equity financing.However, debt financing has its share of drawbacks. Particularly, it is desirable only as long as it successfully generates a higher rate of return compared to the interest rate. So, to avoid considerable losses in your portfolio, one should always avoid companies that resort to exorbitant debt financing.Therefore, the crux of safe investment lies in choosing a company that is not burdened with debt, as a debt-free stock is almost impossible to find.Such an event shows how volatile the equity market can be at times and as an investor if you don’t want to lose big time, we suggest you invest in stocks, which bear low leverage and are hence less risky.To identify such stocks, historically several leverage ratios have been developed to measure the amount of debt a company bears and the debt-to-equity ratio is one of the most common ratios.Story continuesAnalyzing Debt/EquityDebt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders’ EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A lower debt-to-equity ratio reflects improved solvency for a company.With the first-quarter earnings cycle behind us, investors must be eyeing stocks that have exhibited solid earnings growth in the recent past. But if a stock bears a high debt-to-equity ratio in times of economic downturn, its so-called booming earnings picture might turn into a nightmare.The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors, it is prudent to choose stocks with a low debt-to-equity ratio to ensure steady returns.Yet, an investment strategy based solely on the debt-to-equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome. To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns, we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors.Here are the other parameters:Debt/Equity less than X-Industry Median: Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers.Current Price greater than or equal to 10: The stocks must be trading at a minimum of $10 or above.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change in EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than X-Industry Median: Earnings growth adds to optimism, leading to a stock’s price appreciation.VGM Score of A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), offer the best upside potential.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than 5: This shows earnings growth expectation.Zacks Rank #1 or 2: Irrespective of market conditions, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 have a proven history of success.Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt-to-equity ratio, here we present our four picks that made it through the screen.Atmos Energy: It is engaged in regulated natural gas distribution and storage business. On May 3, 2023, the company released its second-quarter fiscal 2023.

If you wish to see the top ones, head straight to the Top 5 Most Profitable Pharmaceutical Companies In The World.Undoubtedly, the pharmaceutical industry stands as one of the most financially rewarding and essential sectors worldwide, leading the way in medical advancements and contributing to global health improvements. Within this expansive field, specific companies like Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), which is the world's top pharma company, have emerged as influential forces, consistently generating significant profits and transforming the healthcare landscape. You can also explore some of the most profitable drugs in the world manufactured by these companies.According to recent financial statistics, the top pharmaceutical companies in the world include Johnson &amp; Johnson, Pfizer, and Roche, each generating over $50 billion in revenue annually. These industry leaders have achieved their positions by developing breakthrough medications, leveraging cutting-edge research, and investing heavily in innovation and development. With the ongoing demand for effective and safe medical treatments, the future of these companies looks brighter than ever. Key Factors Influencing Profitability in the Pharmaceutical Industry The pharmaceutical industry is a highly competitive and lucrative field that requires careful consideration of several key factors to ensure profitability and success. These factors include research and development costs, patent protection, regulatory compliance, pricing strategies, and market demand. Effective management of these factors can lead to increased profits and sustained growth for pharmaceutical companies while failing to address them can result in financial losses and decreased market share.  According to recent financial statistics, the global pharmaceutical market was valued at $1250.24 billion in 2021 and is expected to reach $1700.97 billion by 2025, growing at a CAGR of 8%. Research and development costs account for a significant portion of a pharmaceutical company's expenses, with an estimated average price of $2.6 billion per drug.  The United States is the no. 1 country in the pharma industry, with Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and Johnson &amp; Johnson being the largest pharma companies in the US. The US accounts for approximately 41% of global pharmaceutical spending in 2021. China emerged as the second-largest market, capturing nearly 12% market share.Story continuesAdditionally, patent protection plays a crucial role in the industry, with a typical patent lasting 20 years from the date of application. Regulatory compliance is also essential for pharmaceutical companies, as non-compliance can result in costly fines and legal action. Pricing strategies must be carefully considered to balance profitability with affordability for patients.  Finally, understanding market demand and adapting to changing trends is crucial for sustained growth and success. By effectively managing these key factors, pharmaceutical companies can increase profits and maintain a strong market position in this highly competitive industry. Global Market Dynamics and Competitive Landscape in the Pharmaceutical Industry The global pharmaceutical industry is constantly evolving and facing new challenges as companies strive to stay ahead of the competition. Market dynamics play a significant role in shaping the industry, with factors such as changing regulations, emerging technologies, and shifting consumer preferences all impacting. In 2022, the global pharmaceutical industry generated $1.48 trillion in revenue.One of the biggest challenges facing pharmaceutical companies today is the rising cost of research and development. As new technologies emerge and regulatory requirements become more stringent, companies are investing more time and money in developing new drugs, driving up healthcare costs and putting pressure on pharmaceutical companies to find new ways to innovate and stay competitive. In 2019, the top pharmaceutical companies spent $83 billion on research and development.  The growing demand for personalized medicine is another critical factor shaping the pharmaceutical industry. Consumers are increasingly looking for treatments tailored to their individual needs and genetic makeup, which is driving companies to invest in new research and development strategies. In 2021, the global personalized medicine market was valued at $2.12 trillion and is expected to reach $5.7 trillion by 2030, as noted by Precedence Research.At the same time, competition in the pharmaceutical industry is fierce, with companies vying for market share and trying to outdo each other in terms of innovation and pricing, leading to a highly competitive landscape, with companies constantly looking for ways to gain an edge over their rivals. Despite these challenges, the pharmaceutical industry remains an important and highly profitable sector of the global economy. With the right strategies and a strong focus on innovation, companies can continue to thrive in this dynamic and ever-changing market.  Emerging Trends and Future Outlook for Profitable Pharmaceutical Companies The pharmaceutical industry is experiencing significant trends reshaping its landscape and profitability. Personalized medicine, which tailors treatments to individuals based on their genetics, is a key trend driving innovation but requires substantial investment in research and development. Specialty drugs for rare or complex conditions are also gaining prominence, offering higher profit potential for successful market entry. Looking ahead, technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning, and 3D printing are promising for identifying new drug targets, developing more effective treatments, and revolutionizing drug manufacturing. Staying abreast of these emerging trends is vital for pharmaceutical companies to maintain profitability in a rapidly evolving industry. Top 20 Most Profitable Pharmaceutical Companies In The Worldkurhan / shutterstock.comOur Methodology  For our methodology, we have ranked the top most profitable pharmaceutical companies in ascending order of high profit-revenue ratios as of 2022.Here is our list of the top most profitable pharmaceutical companies in the world: 20.

100,a66e8171-fb5c-3c1e-ad07-1ec18b7df823,M,2023-06-13,3 Cheap Blue-Chip Stocks Under $15 to Buy Now,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-cheap-blue-chip-stocks-184147435.html,1686076907,STORY,"['CHPT', 'DENN', 'M']","[In the last 18 months, many high-quality stocks took huge hits as investors waited for the recession that hasn’t come and that, in my opinion, will not arrive any time soon. Given the huge pullbacks that these names underwent, there are plenty of affordable blue-chip stocks under $15 to buy.The biggest reason I believe that a recession is not in the cards is the great condition of the labor market, which remains very strong according to the most recent data. And although the bears like to talk about “deteriorating consumer balance sheets” and “exploding credit card debt,” the fact is that, according to the Fed, the ratio of household debt to GDP at the end of last year was 76%, versus 78% at the end of 2018.Importantly, I used my usual definition of “blue-chip stocks,” which is perhaps somewhat atypical for this column. Specifically, I define “blue chip” as firms that are among the leaders of their sectors and that are profitable or are poised to enter the black within the next year or two.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMacy’s (M)macy's mall department store storefrontSource: digitalreflections / Shutterstock.comMacy’s (NYSE:M) stock is priced for disaster, as its forward price-earnings ratio is a tiny 4.7, and its price-sales ratio is an infinitesimal 0.16.And while its comparable sales did sink 7.2% last quarter, that’s far from a disaster, as it still managed to generate earnings per share, excluding certain items, of 56 cents.The company cut its full-year sales guidance slightly and lowered its adjusted EPS guidance range to $2.70 to $3.20 from $3.67 to $4.11. However, as I mentioned earlier, its valuation is still extremely attractive. What’s more, I expect the retailer to benefit from consumers’ increased spending on goods starting later this year.Research firm Gordon Haskett was also bullish on M stock in the wake of its Q1 results, which upgraded the shares to “buy,” citing valuation. Additionally, the firm reported that in May, Macy’s “same-store sales accelerated from April across all banners with a notable recovery in the…seasonal parts of the company’s business.”Story continuesAlso noteworthy is that according to Gordon Haskett, Macy’s “less weather sensitive categories..have remained healthy since February.”ChargePoint (CHPT)A close-up of an orange ChargePoint (CHPT) station.Source: JL IMAGES / Shutterstock.comChargePoint (NYSE:CHPT), which sells and services EV chargers, reported very impressive first-quarter results as its top line soared 59% versus the same period a year earlier to $130 million.And in another very positive development, CHPT reported that it intends to cut its EBITDA loss, excluding certain items, by “approximately two-thirds by the fourth quarter of [its current fiscal year]…compared to the first quarter.” Clearly, the company is rapidly closing in on profitability.The company reported a Q1 EBITDA loss of $48.9 million. So by the end of this year, its quarterly adjusted EBITDA loss will be down to a rather low $16 million.Wall Street was probably disappointed by the company’s Q2 revenue guidance which came in below analysts’ average estimate. However, if the company reaches the midpoint of the guidance range, ChargePoint’s sales will have surged 41% year-over-year.Denny’s (DENN)outside of a denny's restaurantSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comDenny’s (NYSE:DENN) reported strong first-quarter results on May 2, as its U.S. same-restaurant sales jumped 8.4% versus the same period a year earlier, and its operating income climbed to $16.1 million from $13.3 in Q1 of 2022.Denny’s reiterated its previous 2023 guidance, which calls for a U.S. same-restaurant sales increase of 3%-6% and the opening of 35-45 new restaurants. Additionally, Denny’s expects to generate EBITDA, excluding some items, of $86 million to $90 million.The company’s strong Q1 results and upbeat guidance increase my confidence in my positive thesis on Denny’s, which I described in a previous column. Specifically, I believe that Denny’s is benefiting from the migration of many Americans from the Northeast, where diners are prevalent, to the South, where there are many fewer diners. Given Denny’s wide-ranging menu and many breakfast choices, I believe that it can serve as a “diner substitute” for these migrants.DENN stock has a low forward price-earnings ratio of 17, making it one of the best blue-chip stocks under $15.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Larry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

101,2bce59c9-4d1f-3ad7-bade-428b3d2d68a5,ZTS,2023-06-13,Should We Be Delighted With Zoetis Inc.'s (NYSE:ZTS) ROE Of 46%?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/delighted-zoetis-inc-nyse-zts-110013322.html,1686654013,STORY,['ZTS'],"[Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS).Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. See our latest analysis for Zoetis How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Zoetis is:46% = US$2.1b ÷ US$4.5b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.46.Does Zoetis Have A Good Return On Equity?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, Zoetis has a superior ROE than the average (18%) in the Pharmaceuticals industry.roeThat is a good sign. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesZoetis' Debt And Its 46% ROEIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Zoetis, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.47. Its ROE is pretty impressive but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.SummaryReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.Of course Zoetis may not be the best stock to buy.

102,cae568be-60dc-3d12-901b-ab3c2b3d7bc3,NEE,2023-06-13,"Time to buy these utility stocks with double-digit upside potential, says Goldman Sachs",TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/time-buy-utility-stocks-double-223855291.html,1686609535,STORY,"['GS', 'SRE', 'XEL', 'NEE']","[The U.S. electric grid is undergoing a huge transformation and renewables have steadily become more widely adopted over the past decade.Adoption is set to continue at a brisk pace, says Goldman Sachs analyst Carly Davenport. Looking ahead, Davenport reckons that by 2032, over 45% of the U.S.’s power generation capacity will come from renewable sources and 6% from coal. That compares to a mix of 30%/16% today and 17%/27% in 2012, making the ongoing change very clear.With this as backdrop, boosted by the Inflation Reduction Act, and as the power generation mix shifts and the Energy transition advances, Davenport believes utilities are “uniquely positioned to facilitate this shift and address associated challenges in a way that creates a cleaner power grid while maintaining reliability and customer affordability.”“This shift will require a significant amount of capital investment,” the analyst went on to add, “which we believe will contribute to attractive earnings and rate base growth in the coming years.”And investors can obviously take advantage of this development, too. With themes such as clean technology, nuclear power, LNG (liquefied natural gas) project additions, and “transmission build out” coming to the fore, investors stand to make use of an “attractive investment opportunity set.”Davenport has compiled a list of stocks, what she and her team call “Decarbonization Enablers,” that are well positioned to take advantage of this trend – and she sees three names posting double-digit growth over the coming months. We ran these picks through the TipRanks database to get a fuller view of their prospects. Let’s check the results.NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE)We’ll start with NextEra Energy, a Florida-based electric utility firm, which, with its $150 billion market cap, is one of the largest utility holding firms in the US utility landscape. NextEra’s chief subsidiary is Florida Power &amp; Light (FPL), which boasts more than 5.8 million customer accounts and provides power to more than 12 million people across Florida. The company generates power at seven utility-grade nuclear generation plants in Florida, making it a major provider of zero-emission power.Story continuesNextEra isn’t just depending on nuclear power for clean energy. The company is also moving into the hydrogen segment of the energy industry. In April of this year, the company announced an understanding between its renewable energy subsidiary NextEra Energy Resources and CF Industries, a major ammonia producer, for development of a hydrogen project at a CF Industries facility in Oklahoma.At the end of Q1, NextEra owned and operated approximately 4,600 megawatts of solar power generation capacity, a total that includes the 970 megawatts of solar capacity brought online during the quarter. This total makes NextEra the largest utility provider of solar power in the US. The company has more than 2,000 megawatts of renewable power and storage projects in its work backlog.This company has a history of beating the earnings expectations and has done so consistently for the past several years, as the case again in the last reported quarter – for 1Q23. Adj. EPS rose from $0.74 in the same period a year ago to $0.84, in turn beating the forecast by $0.11. Likewise on the top-line, revenue climbed by a big 132.5% y/y to $6.72 billion, coming in ahead of expectations by $1.5 billion.Turning to Goldman Sachs’ Carly Davenport, we find her putting a Buy rating on NEE shares, along with a $90 price target that implies a one-year gain of ~22%. (To watch Davenport’s track record, click here)In Davenport’s view, the company’s ability to grow earnings while expanding renewable generation capacity are key points. She writes: “Three key factors underpin our Buy rating: leverage to renewables growth, positive regulatory environment and a long track record of execution at FPL, and above average EPS growth with discounted valuation relative to history. We view NEE’s regulated utility Florida Power &amp; Light (FPL) as a premium regulated utility with a long runway for growth in a positive regulatory backdrop… NEE shares have underperformed the XLU by ~5% YTD, which we believe provides an attractive entry point for investors.”Overall, NEE gets a Strong Buy from the Street’s analyst consensus, based on 12 recent reviews that include 9 Buys and 3 Holds. The shares are trading for $73.98 and have an average price target of $89.45, suggesting ~21% gain on the one-year time frame. (See NEE stock forecast)Sempra Energy (SRE)Next up is Sempra Energy, a San Diego-based energy firm working to deliver power – electricity and natural gas – to some 40 million customers in California, Texas, and Mexico. Sempra is deeply involved in the shift toward cleaner energy technologies, including renewables, and is a major supplier and exporter of liquified natural gas (LNG), which generates significantly fewer carbon emissions than other fossil fuels.Sempra’s LNG operations are extensive. The company currently holds a large ownership stake in the 12 million ton per annum (Mtpa) export facility, Cameron LNG, located in Hackberry, Louisiana on the Gulf Coast. Befitting the firm’s home base in San Diego, Sempra is also working to develop LNG export terminals on the Pacific, at Energia Costa Azul in the northwest of Mexico’s Baja California peninsula. This facility offers potential to cut LNG export transit times to Asia from 21 days to 11 days.Natural gas is big business, and Sempra brought in $6.56 billion in total revenues during Q1 of this year. This was up 71.7% from the prior year, and beat the analysts’ forecast by over $2.5 billion. The company’s bottom line showed a solid profit; adjusted net earnings in 1Q23 came to $2.92 per share – 15 cents better than had been expected.Sempra is using its strong financial base to expand its infrastructure business. As noted, Sempra is building an LNG export facility in northwest Mexico – the company is working on additional LNG export terminals in Texas, to meet expanding global demand for LNG.Expansion of the infrastructure and further buildout of LNG export capabilities are prime points for investors to consider, in Carly Davenport’s opinion. The Goldman analyst writes of Sempra: “SRE has a significant project pipeline for LNG at its Sempra Infrastructure Business (SIP), with the potential for 62 mtpas of total capacity online if all proposed projects come to fruition, with SRE owning a portion of the capacity. While the projects will likely not come online until the late 2020s at the earliest, we expect progress towards reaching FID and beginning construction will serve as positive catalysts for SRE along the way… We view SRE’s business mix favorably and see SIP as a unique opportunity to gain exposure to LNG in the utility sector.”Davenport goes on to rate Sempra shares a Buy, with a $178 price target that shows her confidence in a 21% upside over the coming year.Overall, with 6 recent analyst reviews on file, including 4 Buys and 2 Holds, Sempra gets a Moderate Buy consensus rating from the Street. The shares are selling for $147.17, and their $172.17 average price target implies a 17% gain in the next 12 months. (See Sempra stock forecast)Xcel Energy (XEL)Last on our Goldman-backed energy list is Xcel Energy. This company is known for its commitment to clean, renewable power generation, and boasts a power generation portfolio that features wind, solar, and hydroelectric power, supplemented by natural gas, nuclear, and biomass generation.Power generation is useless without transmission, and Xcel boasts an extensive network of electricity transmission assets. This includes more than 1,200 substations and over 20,000 miles of transmission lines, capable of serving 22,000 megawatts of customer load. Xcel is working to expand this network, which is currently active across 10 states in two major regions of the country. Xcel has transmission networks in Texas-New Mexico-Colorado-Kansas-Oklahoma, as well as in the northern Plains and Great Lakes states of North and South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan.In addition to its power generation and transmission activity, Xcel has been promoting clean energy use and zero-emission vehicles. The company is involved in developing electric vehicle (EV) technology, and offers customers subscription services for renewable energy resources, including solar panel installations.On the financial side, Xcel’s 1Q23 results showed $4.08 billion in total revenues, a solid result that was up 8.8% year-over-year and beat the analyst estimates by $320 million. The bottom-line adj. EPS figure, of 76 cents per share, was up 8.5% y/y, and beat the forecast by 2 cents per share.For Goldman’s Carly Davenport, there are several reasons to back Xcel. She writes: “The primary drivers of our positive view are the accelerated coal replacement with regulated renewables, rate case activity that could drive improved earned vs. authorized ROEs, and leverage to the transmission build out opportunity. We view XEL’s wind and solar resource rich service territory as a key competitive advantage which should enable it to execute on its goals.”Putting some numbers where her mouth is, Davenport gives XEL shares a $75 price target, suggesting an 18% upside in the next 12 months, and supporting her Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating. (To watch Davenport’s track record, click here)Overall, XEL stock gets a Moderate Buy from the analyst consensus, based on 12 reviews with a breakdown of 5 Buys and 7 Holds. The shares have an average price target of $69.73 and a trading price of $63.57, implying upside potential of ~10% for the year ahead.

The difference compared to a year ago, when the index recorded 4.72 — one of the highest levels of stress on global supply chains in two decades of data — is striking.Global demand for raw materials and components worsened during May, especially across Europe, showing fresh signs of economic weakness. Falling demand for raw materials and improved supply has drastically reduced the need for businesses to stockpile items, with companies continuing to de-stock after building up huge excesses of inventory between 2020 and 2022.Most telling, for the first time since August 2020, suppliers in Asia saw spare capacity rise. GEP's Supply Chain Volatility Index for Asia had avoided falling below zero up until May because of the bump in economic activity following China's reopening. It has since petered out and suppliers have caught up with their backlogs. In Europe and North America, vendor capacity went underutilized by an even larger degree than in April.Commenting on the May data, Pramod Gupta, vice president, supply chain consulting, GEP, said: ""As a result of the gradual managed slowdown in economies worldwide, companies continue to aggressively draw down inventories as they anticipate negotiating lower prices going forward. We expect this buyers' market to continue through at least the third quarter.""Story continuesMay 2023 Report Highlights DEMAND: Demand for raw materials, commodities and components weakened broadly in May. Purchasing activity in Europe remains the most depressed, although the North American trend worsened since April.INVENTORIES: Global businesses continue to demonstrate their lack of desire to stockpile items, with reports of firms building safety buffers running at historically typical levels.MATERIAL SHORTAGES: Reports of item shortages continue to fall and are now at their lowest level since August 2020, sitting just above their long-term average.LABOR SHORTAGES: Staffing capacity across global supply chains is sufficient to cope with current workloads.TRANSPORTATION: Global transportation costs are now running below historically average levels. This follows on from the rapid normalization seen throughout 2022 and indicates more competitive pricing of logistics from haulers and cargo handlers.REGIONAL SUPPLY CHAIN VOLATILITY: Global supply chain volatility in Europe and North America is falling markedly. Suppliers to Asian markets are seeing spare capacity for the first time since August 2020.For more information, visit www.gep.com/volatilityNote: Full historic data dating back to January 2005 is available for subscription.

It is derived from S&amp;P Global's PMI™ surveys, sent to companies in over 40 countries, totaling around 27,000 companies. The headline figure is a weighted sum of six sub-indices derived from PMI data, PMI Comments Trackers and PMI Commodity Price &amp; Supply Indicators compiled by S&amp;P Global.A value above 0 indicates that supply chain capacity is being stretched and supply chain volatility is increasing. The further above 0, the greater the extent to which capacity is being stretched.A value below 0 indicates that supply chain capacity is being underutilized, reducing supply chain volatility. The further below 0, the greater the extent to which capacity is being underutilized.A Supply Chain Volatility Index is also published at a regional level for Europe, Asia, North America and the U.K. For more information about the methodology, click here.About GEPGEP® delivers transformative supply chain solutions that help global enterprises become more agile and resilient, operate more efficiently and effectively, gain competitive advantage, boost profitability and increase shareholder value.

107,9344bda8-b6d6-31c6-8fab-dc1f849b0d07,SYF,2023-06-13,Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) shareholders have earned a 14% CAGR over the last three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/synchrony-financial-nyse-syf-shareholders-161106461.html,1686586266,STORY,['SYF'],"[You can receive the average market return by buying a low-cost index fund. But you can make better returns by buying undervalued shares. To wit, Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) shares are up 38% in three years, besting the market return. More recently the stock has gained 13% in a year, which isn't too bad.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. Check out our latest analysis for Synchrony Financial To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Synchrony Financial was able to grow its EPS at 11% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. This EPS growth is remarkably close to the 11% average annual increase in the share price. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthThis free interactive report on Synchrony Financial's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Synchrony Financial, it has a TSR of 49% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Synchrony Financial shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 17% over the last year. That's including the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 2% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

Conducted in partnership with Americas Market Intelligence (AMI), the report highlights that while most Latin Americans gained access to basic financial products between 2020 and 2023, 21% are still excluded.""Today, financial inclusion is a priority that goes beyond access. To be truly successful, financial services need to be widely utilized. Helping people and communities scale the financial inclusion ladder – from access to usage and beyond – is a critical component on the journey to reach new levels of economic prosperity,"" said Marcela Carrasco, Senior Vice President, Market Development, Financial Inclusion, Latin America and the Caribbean.What we learned three years since COVID:Most Latin Americans (79%) have access to basic financial products, but there is still a gap among these individuals to achieve more advanced forms of financial inclusion.Access to credit: While 58% of Latin Americans own a credit card, only 3 out of 10 of them have access to other forms of credit (loans, insurance, or investment products).Uneven distribution of financial inclusion: only 59% of low-income respondents and 40% of respondents living outside major cities, indicated having an account.National governments opened doors to financial inclusion: 15% of respondents indicated accessing their first savings/deposit account upon the digitalization of public assistance.Consumers continued to climb the financial inclusion ladder after COVID: adopting products such as investments, insurance and Buy Now Pay Later solutions at faster rates.Story continuesThe State of Digital Finance and Cash:While the use of cash for day-to-day expenses decreased in favor of digital payments methods, consumers are living in an era when cash is co-existing with digital payments methods. Before COVID, 25% of respondents indicated that they used cash for more than 75% of their monthly expenses, yet in 2023, this number fell to 15%.The use of cash: across countries, we can see a reduction in consumer’s use of cash for more than half of their monthly expenses. Specifically, Argentina reported a 20% reduction, Brazil and Mexico had the most significant reductions (-17%) and in Peru and El Salvador, which are known for being in earlier stages of digitization, the reduction was less drastic with reduction of 8% and 5%, respectively.The role of payment acceptance: Despite this encouraging decline, cash is still the most used daily payment method, reflecting the strong role small businesses and public transportation systems play in the acceptance of digital payments.The digital pivot by small businesses: A majority small businesses surveyed (92%) reported accepting some kind of digital payment. By far, the leading payment method accepted is P2P or bank transfer (82%), followed by online marketplace (33%) and QR code (32%) in third place. Yet, these numbers also suggest large levels of informality and the use of personal accounts, as the platforms mentioned do not require that the business be formalized.Ecosystem incentives: Dethroning cash requires a closer look by digital payment providers to build solutions that offer relevant incentives for payers, consumers, and merchants.Mobile phones: With smartphone penetration reaching 80% across the region, they are now an integral part of the payment process with 88% of respondents indicating that they use their mobile phones to make transactions and open a new account (55%).Access to different forms of credit remains an essential component in financial inclusion. Similarly, respondents highlighted that access to financial education is equally important, reinforcing that financial inclusion is not just about offering products, but also about understanding unbanked populations and communicating benefits according to their needs. Despite the gaps that still exist in Latin America, consumers report that financial inclusion has had a positive impact on their lives.Five Lessons for the Ecosystem:Payment providers in Latin America need to focus on five key areas to attract more users and increase financial inclusion.First, they must prioritize personalization by offering tailored solutions to specific delayed segments, using open finance and personal finance management tools to add value and relevance.Secondly, they need to focus product development on credit, creating better products that offer easier access to personal loans and credit card, and empowering innovative credit scoring or creative collateral.Providers also need to reconceptualize financial education, moving away from traditional courses and workshops, and providing invisible, gamified financial education that is tailored to each segment’s financial capability.Payment providers must leverage convenience and create incentives, focusing on time savings, embracing an ecosystem approach that solves several problems at once, and simple investment products that offers liquidity, to name a few.Lastly, ongoing collaboration among the private-public sector is essential for enhancing financial inclusion, and payments providers must prioritize collaboration subsidies, public transportation, and proactive financial policies for cash reduction.Because financial inclusion is multi-dimensional, correctly measuring inclusion rates requires a regularly modernized view that explores consumer access, usage, and value received, among other factors. This study examines these nuances further in surveys of more than 2,800 consumers, 25 interviews with financial service companies across the region, and analyses the shifts in consumer behavior since its first report in 2020.Through its ongoing collaboration among the public and private sector, Mastercard continues to play a central role in expanding digital access and ensuring affordability and quality for people and organizations.

Research took place between November 2022 and January 2023 and consisted of a review of data made available by governments and financial institutions, as well as in-depth interviews with 25 financial service providers and online surveys of 2,815 individuals within these seven markets.AMI conducted national online surveys with consumers from the general population who were 18+ years old. The surveys had equal numbers of each gender (male and female) and had quotas on representative distribution across all income groups and according to capital cities (60%) and rural cities (40%). These seven economies represent more than 74% of total GDP in the region and more than 75% of its population.About Mastercard (NYSE: MA)Mastercard is a global technology company in the payments industry.

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's 0.93% gain on the day. At the same time, the Dow added 0.56%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 1.71%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the online travel company had gained 23.51% over the past month. This has outpaced the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 3.91% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.61% in that time.Expedia will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $2.41, up 22.96% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $3.35 billion, up 5.46% from the prior-year quarter.EXPE's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $9.15 per share and revenue of $12.88 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +34.76% and +10.38%, respectively.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Expedia should also be noted by investors. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.7% lower. Expedia is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.Valuation is also important, so investors should note that Expedia has a Forward P/E ratio of 12.07 right now. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 19.04, so we one might conclude that Expedia is trading at a discount comparatively.Story continuesAlso, we should mention that EXPE has a PEG ratio of 1.21. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate.

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Kroger (KR) earns a Zacks Rank #2 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.48 a share, just three days from its upcoming earnings release on June 15, 2023.KR has an Earnings ESP figure of 4.14%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.48 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.42.KR is part of a big group of Retail-Wholesale stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Expedia (EXPE) as well.Slated to report earnings on August 3, 2023, Expedia holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $2.43 a share 52 days from its next quarterly update.For Expedia, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.41 is 0.53%.KR and EXPE's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Story continuesFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

The answers have been edited for length and clarity.Q: The question of the moment in the travel industry is whether demand is going to remain strong. What do you see?A: We see macro demand pretty strong. It depends where you are in the world, but by and large demand has remained robust, and it’s going to be a busy summer for sure.Q: Are high prices having any effect on travel spending?A: We’ve seen travel demand remain quite robust notwithstanding all the economic indicators in the world, and as far as we can tell it’s really that people are prioritizing travel over everything else. Even though travel is somewhat more expensive than it used to be, it’s still the thing that people miss the most and the thing people still want the most in terms of how they spend their money.Q: Despite record revenue, Expedia still lost money in the first quarter. What happened?A: That’s not unusual for us in the first quarter. Lots and lots of bookings take place, which means we spend a lot of money in marketing, but a much smaller percentage actually stay (in hotels or vacation rentals) in the first quarter. So you end up with this typical mismatch of lots of bookings, lots of marketing spend, but not that much actual revenue because revenue is really when people stay.Q: Expedia has suggested that margins will increase. Why should investors believe that will happen?Story continuesA: We have given the market some guidance in terms of what we expect on the year, and that does mathematically pencil out to further expansion of margins and growth. We haven’t set very specific numbers around that, but we’ve been investing ... in buying the right customers, investing in the long-term value of customers, and we’ve also been improving the product a lot. We've talked about all of the work we've done on technology to re-platform the whole company. Those are things you have to pay for in the short term, but they pay off in the longer term.Q: You just reported long-term debt of around $6.3 billion. Do you plan to reduce that in the near term? Or will that have to wait?A: We signaled to the market that our intent was to get to around two times leverage. (The company reported in May that leverage, or debt divided by EBITDA, was 2.7 times.) We may reduce debt if we feel like it makes sense to get to our goals, but that goal is not that we need to be there by September per se. It’s just a goal we want to get to. And of course, we’re buying back our own equity in a significant way because we believe our equity is very cheap.Q: You're launching a new loyalty program next month that combines the Expedia and Hotels.com programs and adds Vrbo. How big a boost will you get from One Key?A: We think it’s a big game-changer long-term in terms of just the customer experience. Now customers who rent a Vrbo will be able to use their points, their One Key cash, to buy an airline ticket or stay in a hotel or a cruise. We’ve had a lot of different brands over a long period of time. They were very discrete. They often have different loyalty programs or no loyalty programs. And what we’re trying to say is like, we want our customers to get the benefit of all our capabilities and stay in our ecosystem. So we think the benefit of that is substantial.Q: Speaking of Vrbo, Airbnb is putting new focus into renting individual rooms. Could they steal price-conscious customers from Vrbo?A: They skew to lower ADRs (average daily rates) than we do, partly because we do whole apartments or villas and they do shared spaces, which we have not wanted to get into. Depending on the mix of business, that may benefit them or us at any given time depending on where demand is moving.Q: Did Vrbo gain business from the complaints about Airbnb's cleaning fees, and even lists of chores for their guests?A: Those are funny stories, we enjoy those, but it's hard to detect those little bits of noise. It's a big marketplace for both of us.Q: Your 2021 compensation was eye-popping: The company valued it — with all the stock awards and options — at $296 million if the company does well. Is anyone worth that much?A: I can’t say if anybody’s worth a number or not worth a number. All of my economics are tied up in the success of the business. So whether I end up making that or less or more is entirely a function of how the business performs. I think a CEO should be closely tied to the performance of the company.Q: Before this job, you were CEO of Tribune Media until it was taken over by Nexstar. Are you happy to be out of the media business?A: The exciting thing about where I am now is we are a growth company, we service a $2 trillion-and-growing industry. It was very different in media. My friends there now are doing the not-so-fun part of the job, which is spending all their time worrying about costs and how to try to turn a business that appears to be slowly shrinking into something else.Q: How would you describe your management style?A: I try to put a great team in place and empower them and give them what they need to succeed. That’s what we’ve been doing. You're never going to see me write a management book.]"

LMT clinched a modification contract involving F-16 fighter aircraft. The award has been offered by the 338th Enterprise Sourcing Squadron, Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph, TX.Details of the DealValued at $74 million, the contract is projected to be completed by Mar 21, 2026. Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed will offer operational training capability for F-16 Block 70/72, F-16 upgrades and F-16V models.Work related to this deal will be executed in Orlando, FL, and several locations outside the continental United States. The contract involves Foreign Military Sales.Importance of the F-16 JetsOver the past decade, a rapid rise in global terrorism and adverse geopolitical situations across borders have boosted the demand for defense products. Combat aircraft constitute a major portion of this portfolio. It is imperative to mention here that the F-16 Falcon jets have significantly risen in importance on a global scale over the past few years.For the past couple of years, the F-16 has witnessed a significant development, with nations like Taiwan, Bulgaria, Morocco and Bahrain signing agreements to procure new F-16 aircraft.In order to make the most of this rising demand, Lockheed introduced F-16 Block 70/72 in 2020, the most advanced F-16 aircraft, combining numerous capabilities and structural upgrades. This model provides a new aircraft structure that lasts 50% longer than the previous F-16 version. Such advancements might have been ushering in contracts from Pentagon and other U.S. allies, like the latest one, thereby boosting Lockheed’s revenue prospects.Growth ProspectsWith rising security threats across the globe, emerging economies like the Asia Pacific, the Middle East and South America are spending a lot on enhancing their defense arsenals. Meanwhile, other nations like Europe and the United States have already been leading the defense market. With the United States being the largest weapons exporter worldwide, the nation has been spending significantly on defense products, including combat aircraft.Story continuesLockheed, being a prominent combat aircraft manufacturer in the United States, enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global fighter aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 3.95% during 2023-2028, with North America constituting the largest share of this market.Such growth can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities, and increased spending on defense. These projections should benefit Lockheed, along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Boeing BA, Northrop Grumman NOC and Textron TXT.Boeing’s Defense, Space &amp; Security segment engages in the research, development, production and modification of manned and unmanned military aircraft. This segment's primary products include military aircraft like F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15, P-8, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk aircraft.BA has a long-term earnings growth rate of 4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 sales implies a 18% increase from the 2022 reported figure.Since its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned combat aircraft. The company also has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance and aircraft self-protection systems. This helps warfighters in accomplishing missions anytime, anywhere and under any conditions.NOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 sales indicates a 4.7% increase from the previous year’s reported number.Textron’s business unit, Textron Aviation Defense designs, builds and supports versatile and globally-known military aircraft, preferred for training and attack missions.

The award has been offered by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Details of the DealValued at $887.9 million, the contract is expected to be completed by December 2026. Per the terms of the deal, Raytheon will procure spare parts, modules, support equipment/packaging handling shipping and transportation material as well as depot lay-in material for F135 propulsion system.The contract will serve the U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps, Navy, Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers and non-Department of Defense participants.Work related to this deal will be executed in East Hartford, CT.Raytheon’s Growth ProspectsCombat aircraft witnessed a surge in demand with the rapid rise in political risks and global terrorism. In this context, F-35 jets, built by America’s largest defense contractor, Lockheed Martin LMT, enjoy a lucrative position in the combat aircraft arena. These jets also witness a steady flow of orders from the U.S. Army, seven international partner countries and eight FMS customers.Lockheed has delivered 899 F-35 airplanes since the program's inception, with 340 jets in the backlog as of Mar 26, 2023.  This reflects the solid demand that this jet program enjoys in the defense space, resulting in multiple order wins for both LMT and RTX. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.The production of F-35 jets is expected to continue for several years, given the U.S. government's current inventory target of 2,456 aircraft for the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy.Consequently, Pratt &amp; Whitney, which builds F-35’s engine, is likely to witness more order inflows for the F-35 engine and its propulsion system in the coming days, like the latest one. This should significantly bolster this defense contractor’s top line.Peer GrowthApart from Lockheed and Raytheon, defense majors that stand to benefit from the expanding production rates of F-35 are:Northrop Grumman NOC: The company renders its expertise in carrier aircraft and low-observable stealth technology for the F-35 program.

It is to be noted that this Miami-based homebuilder surpassed earnings expectations in the trailing 16 quarters.On a year-over-year basis, fiscal first-quarter earnings decreased 21% but revenues grew 5%.The Trend in Estimate RevisionFor the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share has moved up to $2.32 from $2.31 in the past 30 days. The estimated figure indicates a decrease of 50.5% from $4.69 reported in the year-ago quarter. The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $7.28 billion, suggesting a 12.9% decline from the year-ago reported figure of $8.36 billion.Lennar Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Lennar Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseLennar Corporation price-eps-surprise | Lennar Corporation QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up for this company.Factors to NoteLennar’s fiscal second-quarter home sales are expected to have decreased from the year-ago level, owing to the ongoing challenges in the industry comprising a softer demand environment. The increase in mortgage rates since March 2022 and uncertain macroeconomic conditions are playing spoilsport.We expect home sales to decrease by 16.2% year over year to $6,675.4 million in the quarter. Homebuilding revenues are expected to be $6,775.7 million, down 15.1% year over year.On the fiscal first-quarter earnings call, LEN highlighted that it expects home deliveries of 15,000-16,000 units at an average price of $435,000-$445,000 (suggesting a decline from $483,000 a year ago).Meanwhile, the consensus estimate for deliveries for the to-be-reported quarter is currently pegged at 15,619 homes, indicating a decline from 16,549 units a year ago. The consensus mark for the average price is pegged at $442,000.Lennar expects new orders in the range of 16,000-17,000, pointing to a decrease from 17,792 reported in second-quarter fiscal 2022. The weakness in the overall market might have dented the fiscal second quarter’s order pattern. The consensus estimate for new orders is currently pegged at 16,653 homes, indicating a fall from 17,792 reported a year ago, owing to the softness in housing demand.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for backlog (units and values) is currently pegged at 20,415 homes or $9.7 billion compared with the year-ago quarter’s figures of 28,624 units or $14.69 billion.Unprecedented supply-chain issues, increased inflation and higher land, labor and raw material costs are expected to have put pressure on fiscal second-quarter margins. The company expects the homebuilding gross margin to be 21-21.5%, pointing to a decline from 29.5% a year ago.That said, Lennar has been focusing on continuous improvement of the homebuilding selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) line, owing to operating leverage and investments in technology. Yet, lower sales are expected to put pressure on operating leverage. The company expects SG&amp;A expenses, as a percentage of home sales, to be nearly 7.2-7.4%. A year ago, the metric was recorded at 6.1%.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Lennar this time around.

Another comment that really resonated with me from a guest prior was that this would be-- if we are in a new bull market right now, this would be the most unloved bull market or a start to a bull market that we've seen in decades maybe ever.I went through a global financial crisis. Some of the big ones like the Dot-Com bubble as well and some of the smaller ones, even some of the smaller pullbacks. Typically, at the beginning of these things, and this would have been traced back to October because that's when we had the lows, everything goes up. And then you have a period of consolidation pullback, people don't believe this is a new bull market. And then, things start getting narrowed and more selective.Story continuesWhat we did this time is we started the opposite way. And this isn't-- and this is assuming that we're still in a bull market but the opposite way would be we're starting out with a few narrow names and now we're expanding. So it doesn't mean, this doesn't have to be the case. But historically, it would be very unusual.A couple more things I want to point out here. Indices are getting very stretched. Even the S&amp;P 500 which was not as stretched as the NASDAQ, if you take a look at the S&amp;P 500 relative to its 50-day moving average getting very well extended, bespoke has a couple of notes and graphics out on this. But basically, we could be due for a mean reversion and that would just mean the price either has to come down or price has to stay level and a correction in time has to occur.Haven't seen any of those either of those things panned out just yet. Bottom line market overall's probably due for a pause or a pullback or what could happen is if this rotation continues, we could just see select pockets of the market advance while other ones take pauses. So all in all, we do have some momentum to the upside.We have this huge CPI report due out tomorrow, going to be a lot of headline risk from that as well as the Fed report. So enjoy today because things get a little messy starting tomorrow morning.- We will see. Thanks so much, Jared. We'll brace ourselves.]"

The broader index posted its fourth successive weekly gain. It’s the index’s longest winning run since August 2022. On Jun 8, the S&amp;P 500 finished 20% above 2022’s trough in October. This means that the index remained in the bear-market territory for the longest period since May 15, 1948.Investors, undoubtedly, cheered the index’s new milestone since a rise of 20% from the recent lows indicated the beginning of a bull market. Moreover, the index has more room to run as it is still 10.5% off from its record closing high. At the same time, historically, whenever the S&amp;P 500 Index exited the bear market, it had, on average, given a positive return of 9.3% over the subsequent one-year period, per Dow Jones Market Data, citing a MarketWatch article.So, what led the S&amp;P 500 to notch weekly gains and exit the bear-market territory? Market pundits for quite a while were concerned about how stubbornly high inflation, and consequently, an aggressive Federal Reserve would ravage economic growth, and derail the stock market’s growth trajectory. After all, the Fed’s initiative to hike interest rates to bring down inflation impacted consumer outlays and increased borrowing costs.However, with the rise in consumer prices easing year over year in April, it’s widely expected that the Fed may pause interest rate hikes soon. In reality, the Fed funds futures showed that there is a 71.2% chance that the central bank might declare a likely pause in further interest rate increases, in its June policy meeting, per CME FedWatch Tool.While a Fed rate hike pause bodes well for the economy, a resilient labor market has restored confidence that the economy is still in good shape, helping stocks climb northward. The U.S. economy saw an addition of more-than-anticipated new jobs in May, while job additions were also revised upward for the month of March and April. Hiring was broad-based, while the jobless rate continues to hover below the 4%-mark, indicating a buoyant labor market (read more: 5 Stocks to Gain From Stunning Jobs Growth in May).Story continuesTherefore, given these recent strengths, it’s judicious for investors to invest in sound stocks listed on the S&amp;P 500 Index that are positioned to scale upward along with the broader index.

123,bca71f44-21fd-36d1-83f8-1bc5c7ecf322,BAX,2023-06-13,An Intrinsic Calculation For Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) Suggests It's 38% Undervalued,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-baxter-international-inc-192339845.html,1686597819,STORY,['BAX'],"[Key InsightsThe projected fair value for Baxter International is US$67.33 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityCurrent share price of US$41.97 suggests Baxter International is potentially 38% undervalued Analyst price target for BAX is US$51.63 which is 23% below our fair value estimateIn this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for Baxter International The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$811.2mUS$1.91bUS$2.08bUS$2.43bUS$2.68bUS$2.88bUS$3.04bUS$3.18bUS$3.30bUS$3.41bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x3Analyst x5Analyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 7.13%Est @ 5.62%Est @ 4.57%Est @ 3.83%Est @ 3.32% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.5% US$741US$1.6kUS$1.6kUS$1.7kUS$1.7kUS$1.7kUS$1.6kUS$1.5kUS$1.5kUS$1.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$15bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 9.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.4b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (9.5%– 2.1%) = US$47bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$47b÷ ( 1 + 9.5%)10= US$19bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$34b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$42.0, the company appears quite undervalued at a 38% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Baxter International as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.241. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Baxter InternationalStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Medical Equipment market.OpportunityExpected to breakeven next year.Has sufficient cash runway for more than 3 years based on current free cash flows.Good value based on P/S ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Paying a dividend but company is unprofitable.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

If you wish to see the top ones, head straight to the Top 5 Most Profitable Pharmaceutical Companies In The World.Undoubtedly, the pharmaceutical industry stands as one of the most financially rewarding and essential sectors worldwide, leading the way in medical advancements and contributing to global health improvements. Within this expansive field, specific companies like Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), which is the world's top pharma company, have emerged as influential forces, consistently generating significant profits and transforming the healthcare landscape. You can also explore some of the most profitable drugs in the world manufactured by these companies.According to recent financial statistics, the top pharmaceutical companies in the world include Johnson &amp; Johnson, Pfizer, and Roche, each generating over $50 billion in revenue annually. These industry leaders have achieved their positions by developing breakthrough medications, leveraging cutting-edge research, and investing heavily in innovation and development. With the ongoing demand for effective and safe medical treatments, the future of these companies looks brighter than ever. Key Factors Influencing Profitability in the Pharmaceutical Industry The pharmaceutical industry is a highly competitive and lucrative field that requires careful consideration of several key factors to ensure profitability and success. These factors include research and development costs, patent protection, regulatory compliance, pricing strategies, and market demand. Effective management of these factors can lead to increased profits and sustained growth for pharmaceutical companies while failing to address them can result in financial losses and decreased market share.  According to recent financial statistics, the global pharmaceutical market was valued at $1250.24 billion in 2021 and is expected to reach $1700.97 billion by 2025, growing at a CAGR of 8%. Research and development costs account for a significant portion of a pharmaceutical company's expenses, with an estimated average price of $2.6 billion per drug.  The United States is the no. 1 country in the pharma industry, with Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and Johnson &amp; Johnson being the largest pharma companies in the US. The US accounts for approximately 41% of global pharmaceutical spending in 2021. China emerged as the second-largest market, capturing nearly 12% market share.Story continuesAdditionally, patent protection plays a crucial role in the industry, with a typical patent lasting 20 years from the date of application. Regulatory compliance is also essential for pharmaceutical companies, as non-compliance can result in costly fines and legal action. Pricing strategies must be carefully considered to balance profitability with affordability for patients.  Finally, understanding market demand and adapting to changing trends is crucial for sustained growth and success. By effectively managing these key factors, pharmaceutical companies can increase profits and maintain a strong market position in this highly competitive industry. Global Market Dynamics and Competitive Landscape in the Pharmaceutical Industry The global pharmaceutical industry is constantly evolving and facing new challenges as companies strive to stay ahead of the competition. Market dynamics play a significant role in shaping the industry, with factors such as changing regulations, emerging technologies, and shifting consumer preferences all impacting. In 2022, the global pharmaceutical industry generated $1.48 trillion in revenue.One of the biggest challenges facing pharmaceutical companies today is the rising cost of research and development. As new technologies emerge and regulatory requirements become more stringent, companies are investing more time and money in developing new drugs, driving up healthcare costs and putting pressure on pharmaceutical companies to find new ways to innovate and stay competitive. In 2019, the top pharmaceutical companies spent $83 billion on research and development.  The growing demand for personalized medicine is another critical factor shaping the pharmaceutical industry. Consumers are increasingly looking for treatments tailored to their individual needs and genetic makeup, which is driving companies to invest in new research and development strategies. In 2021, the global personalized medicine market was valued at $2.12 trillion and is expected to reach $5.7 trillion by 2030, as noted by Precedence Research.At the same time, competition in the pharmaceutical industry is fierce, with companies vying for market share and trying to outdo each other in terms of innovation and pricing, leading to a highly competitive landscape, with companies constantly looking for ways to gain an edge over their rivals. Despite these challenges, the pharmaceutical industry remains an important and highly profitable sector of the global economy. With the right strategies and a strong focus on innovation, companies can continue to thrive in this dynamic and ever-changing market.  Emerging Trends and Future Outlook for Profitable Pharmaceutical Companies The pharmaceutical industry is experiencing significant trends reshaping its landscape and profitability. Personalized medicine, which tailors treatments to individuals based on their genetics, is a key trend driving innovation but requires substantial investment in research and development. Specialty drugs for rare or complex conditions are also gaining prominence, offering higher profit potential for successful market entry. Looking ahead, technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning, and 3D printing are promising for identifying new drug targets, developing more effective treatments, and revolutionizing drug manufacturing. Staying abreast of these emerging trends is vital for pharmaceutical companies to maintain profitability in a rapidly evolving industry. Top 20 Most Profitable Pharmaceutical Companies In The Worldkurhan / shutterstock.comOur Methodology  For our methodology, we have ranked the top most profitable pharmaceutical companies in ascending order of high profit-revenue ratios as of 2022.Here is our list of the top most profitable pharmaceutical companies in the world: 20.

(NYSE:ABBV) expects price concessions to impact Humira in 2023, potentially leading to volume losses. Competition from BeiGene's Brukinsa caused a 16% decline in sales for AbbVie's Imbruvica. To address these changes, AbbVie may pursue more mergers and acquisitions. Aesthetics and neuroscience drugs in AbbVie's portfolio saw moderate sales growth in 2022. 9. Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)2022 Net Income: $6.24 billion2022 Revenue: $28.55 billion  In 2022, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) experienced a transition with declining revenues from COVID-19 antibodies but growth in critical drugs.

Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) also pledged to lower insulin prices in the U.S. and implemented a program to cap out-of-pocket costs. 8. Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN)2022 Net Income: $6.6 billion2022 Revenue: $26.32 billion  Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) experienced slow growth in 2022 but is anticipated to improve its performance through the acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics and the launch of its Humira biosimilar. While Lumakras sales declined and Mvasi and Kanjinti faced competition and price pressures, Amjevita, the Humira biosimilar, has obtained approval in Europe and holds a competitive advantage in the U.S. market.

(NASDAQ:AMGN) acquired Horizon Therapeutics for approximately $28 billion, expanding its portfolio with drugs such as Krystexxa, Tepezza, and Uplizna.7. Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)2022 Net Income: $14.52 2022 Revenue: $59.3 billion Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), known for its vaccines, faced setbacks in COVID-19 vaccine development but found success with the oral antiviral treatment Lagevrio, generating $5.68 billion in 2022.

If you wish to see the top ones, feel free to skip our detailed analysis of the pharma industry and head straight to the 5 Most Profitable Drugs In The World.The pharmaceutical industry has long been lucrative, with countless drugs generating substantial profits for pharmaceutical companies. However, within this realm, a select few medications stand out as the epitome of profitability. These exceptional drugs have revolutionized patient care and propelled the companies behind them to unprecedented financial success.From breakthrough treatments for chronic diseases to life-saving therapies, the world's most profitable drugs have reshaped the healthcare landscape and become integral to the global pharmaceutical market.Factors Driving Drug Profitability: Market Demand and Clinical NeedMarket demand and clinical need are crucial factors driving drug profitability in the pharmaceutical industry. Pharmaceutical companies analyze market trends and patient demographics to identify areas with high demand for specific medications. Diseases with a high prevalence or limited treatment options present opportunities for developing profitable drugs.Factors such as aging populations, changing lifestyles, and increased awareness of certain health conditions contribute to the market demand for specific drugs. In 2022, the global pharmaceutical market was valued at approximately $1.48 trillion.The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a surge in demand for antiviral medications and vaccines, resulting in a significant increase in profitability for pharmaceutical companies. The global antiviral drugs market is expected to reach $51.4 billion by 2027, with a compound annual growth rate of 4%.Additionally, sales of COVID-19 vaccines are anticipated to decline sharply by 64% in the current year, reaching $13.5 billion compared to the previous year's figure of $37.8 billion, as reported by CNBC. However, it is important to note that profitability is not the only factor driving drug development, as clinical needs and patient outcomes should always remain a top priority.Story continuesCompared to existing therapies, superior efficacy, safety, and convenience also contribute to a drug's profitability. Pharmaceutical companies use rigorous clinical trials to demonstrate effectiveness and obtain regulatory approvals. The average cost of developing a new prescription from discovery to market launch is approximately $2.6 billion, with a success rate of just 12%.However, successful drugs can generate substantial revenue, with the best-selling drugs of all time like Montekulas, Aspirin and Humira, among others generating over $50 billion in annual sales. By identifying unmet clinical needs and developing innovative solutions, companies can capitalize on the profitability of drugs that address critical healthcare challenges, benefiting the pharmaceutical industry financially and improving patient outcomes by providing effective treatments for previously unmet medical needs.Blockbuster Drugs: Unveiling the Top Profit-Generating MedicationsIn recent years, the pharmaceutical industry has witnessed a surge in top-selling drugs, with some medications generating billions of dollars in revenue for their manufacturers. For instance, Humira, one of the top selling drug, used to treat autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, generated over $21.23 billion in sales in 2022 alone. Similarly, Keytruda, a cure for various cancers, generated $20.93 billion in revenue in the same year.Enbrel, used to treat psoriasis and other inflammatory conditions, also caused over $4 billion in sales in 2022. These financial statistics are a testament to these drugs' effectiveness and the pharmaceutical industry's success in producing life-saving medications. Despite the challenges, the industry continues to innovate and invest heavily in research and development, undoubtedly leading to more breakthrough drugs and better health outcomes for patients worldwide.Future Trends: Innovations and Their Potential for ProfitabilityThe future of the drug market seems promising, with innovative changes driven by advancements in technology and research. Personalized medicine is gaining momentum and holds the potential for improved patient outcomes and reduced healthcare costs. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are revolutionizing drug development and clinical trial design, expediting the identification of promising candidates and reducing failure risks.In fact, according to a recent report by Grand View Research, the global AI in healthcare market size is expected to reach $31.3 billion by 2025, with drug development being one of the key applications of AI technology in the healthcare sector.Additionally, there is a growing focus on developing drugs that target specific disease pathways, which offers more effective treatments with fewer side effects. These trends are creating significant opportunities for businesses to capitalize on the profitability of innovative drugs in the evolving market.In fact, according to recent financial statistics, the global personalized medicine market is expected to reach $3.92 trillion by 2026, whereas the demand for AI-powered drug development is expected to reach $5.1 billion by 2025. Businesses that invest in these areas can expect to reap the benefits of this growing market.15 Most Profitable Drugs In The WorldCopyright: romastudio / 123RF Stock PhotoOur MethodologyFor our methodology, we ranked the most profitable drugs in the world in ascending order of sales in 2022 as a proxy for their profitability. To ensure the accuracy of the data, we relied on Drug Discovery Trends.Here is our list of the 15 most profitable drugs in the world:15. Trikafta/Kaftrio2022 Sales: $7.68 billion Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) has established its market dominance in treating cystic fibrosis with its top-selling drug, Trikafta. Trikafta generated $7.68 billion in sales in 2022 and continues to experience significant growth. Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) has secured reimbursement deals in multiple countries and plans to expand its base, aiming to reach an additional 25,000 cystic fibrosis patients who could benefit from the drug.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) emphasizes its commitment to outperform Trikafta's market dominance and highlights its focus on non-opioid pain management and gene editing therapies as part of its future market prospects.14. Darzalex2022 Sales: $7.97 billionJohnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s multiple myeloma drug, Darzalex, has become the company's second-largest product and experienced significant growth in 2022. Despite competition from Sanofi's CD38 drug, Sarclisa, Darzalex maintains an advantage with approvals in newly diagnosed diseases.However, Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY)'s combination trials with Sarclisa and other medicines may pose a challenge. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is defending its essential product with ongoing phase 3 trials and reported survival advantages. The expiration of patent protection for BMS Revlimid does not fundamentally impact the opportunity for Darzalex, as it is considered a foundational therapy.13. Opdivo2022 Sales: $8.24 billion Opdivo, developed by Bristol Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY), experienced sales growth in 2022, reaching $8.24 billion. Despite being outperformed by Merck's Keytruda, Opdivo holds unique positions in specific indications. It gained FDA approval for previously untreated stomach cancer and has indications in front-line kidney cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and metastatic melanoma.Patient volume across tumor types still lags behind pre-COVID levels, affecting Opdivo's performance. BMS's combination therapies, such as Opdivo-Yervoy for kidney cancer and Opdivo-relatlimab for metastatic melanoma, contribute to its market position. Opdivo by Bristol Myer Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) also approved early-stage NSCLC treatment, presenting the potential for solid uptake.12. Imbruvica2022 Sales: $8.35 billionImbruvica, co-developed by AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s Janssen, shows steady sales growth and the potential for continued success, with a total sales of $8.35 billion in 2022. AbbVie's patent strategy ensures exclusivity for Imbruvica until March 2032, giving it a competitive edge.As a first-in-class lymphoma drug, Imbruvica achieved blockbuster status quickly but now faces competition from AstraZeneca's Calquence and BeiGene's Brukinsa. However, Imbruvica's established position and ongoing clinical success make it a key revenue driver for AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), especially with the anticipated biosimilar competition for its immunology drug Humira.11. Stelara2022 Sales: $9.72 billionJohnson &amp; Johnson's Stelara, the first biologic treatment to inhibit the IL-12 and IL-23 pathways, has become the company's most extensive product, representing almost 10% of its total revenue. Despite recent competition from biosimilars and a loss to AbbVie, Inc. (NYSE:ABBV)'s Humira in Crohn's disease, Stelara experienced sales growth of over 20% in 2020. With its patent set to expire in September 2023, J&amp;J is focusing on marketing efforts and patient empowerment to maximize Stelara's potential before biosimilars enter the market.10. Revlimid2022 Sales: $9.97 billionBristol Myers Squibb's blockbuster blood cancer drug, Revlimid, faces a significant decline in sales due to the introduction of generic competitors. Sandoz and Stada Arzneimittel have launched their generic versions in multiple countries. BMS expected Revlimid's sales to drop from $12.8 billion in 2021 to around $9.5 billion to $10 billion in 2022.Several other companies, including Natco Pharma, Sun Pharma, Zydus Cadila, Cipla, and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, have launched or plan to launch their generic versions. Bristol Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) is focusing on other products like Opdivo, Yervoy, and Eliquis and upcoming launches to mitigate the impact of Revlimid's loss.9. Biktarvy2022 Sales: $10.39 billionGilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD)' HIV drug Biktarvy was the top-selling infectious disease pharmaceutical product until the impact of COVID-19. In 2022, Biktarvy's sales reached $10.39 billion, surpassing GlaxoSmithKline's HIV unit. It became the most successful HIV therapy globally, with a significant market share in the U.S. and Europe.However, GSK's dolutegravir-based portfolio attracted the most switch patients. Biktarvy faces competition from long-acting regimens like Cabenuva. Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) settled a patent infringement lawsuit with ViiV Healthcare, agreeing to pay $1.25 billion and 3% royalties for future sales of Biktarvy.8. Eylea2022 Sales: $12.72 billionEylea, a leading ophthalmology drug by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN), maintains its market leadership despite increasing competition. It is used to treat diabetic eye disease and age-related macular degeneration. Eylea's sales reached $5.79 billion in the U.S. in 2021, as reported by Fierce Pharma.Novartis' Beovu initially posed a challenge but faced safety concerns. Roche's Vabysmo is expected to provide intense competition. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) is developing a high-dose version of Eylea. Although biosimilar competition looms, Eylea is projected to remain dominant in the ophthalmology market.You can read more on Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) in our list of the largest biotech companies in the US.7. Dupixent2022 Sales: $17.41 billion Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) and Regeneron Pharmaceutical, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN)'s Dupixent, a leading immunology drug, exceeded expectations with sales growth of 46% in Q1 2022, reaching 1.61 billion euros ($1.79 billion). The drug's market penetration in adults with atopic dermatitis is currently at 8%, indicating significant growth potential.Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) aims to expand Dupixent's reach to at least 1.5 million more patients globally by 2025. The revised goal is to achieve peak sales surpassing 13 billion euros ($13.98 billion) , driven by its dominance in atopic dermatitis and FDA approvals for asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis, and eosinophilic esophagitis.6. Eliquis2022 Sales: $18.26 billionEliquis, the blood thinner jointly developed by Bristol Myers Squibb and Pfizer, Inc. (NYSE:PFE), has experienced remarkable sales growth. In 2022 alone, the drug generated $18.26 billion in sales. While Bristol Myers Squibb acknowledges the future challenges posed by patent expirations and the entry of generics, the company remains optimistic. It expects continued growth from existing drugs, including Eliquis, as well as from new product launches, which are projected to contribute significantly to the company's growth trajectory until 2029.Click to see and continue reading the 5 Most Profitable Drugs In The World. Suggested Articles:25 Most Prescribed Medication in the World.25 Best Hospitals for Cancer Treatment in the World.20 Most Used Prescription Drugs In The US.Disclosure.

(ROK) is an industrial automation and digital transformation company that’s posting strong top and bottom-line growth as it benefits from broader mega-trends across the economy, including reshoring and a never-ending push to streamline work through technological advancement.Rockwell aims to help companies throughout various sectors and industries improve via an array of smart manufacturing offerings. ROK shares have soared over the last year, including an impressive climb over the last month.Despite Rockwell’s market-crushing performance during the last 12 months and the last decade, ROK trades 10% below its own highs. And investors with a technical outlook might appreciate where ROK stands. Rockwell also pays a dividend and boasts other potentially attractive fundamentals right now.Smart ManufacturingRockwell is an industrial automation and digital transformation company that aims to create what it often refers to as the next generation of smart manufacturing. ROK is helping drive forward the tech-supported and constantly-connected economy to help its customers with all of their automation challenges.ROK operates three core business units: Intelligent Devices, Software &amp; Control, and Lifecycle Services. Rockwell’s products and solutions serve an array of industries including power generation, aerospace, infrastructure, semiconductors, life sciences, warehouse and fulfillment, and beyond.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRockwell’s product categories include connection devices, energy monitoring, human machine interface, motion control, industrial control, sensors &amp; switches, and much, much more. ROK’s software offerings broadly cover areas such as analytics and data management, design, industrial communications, and beyond.Growth and OutlookThe economic trends that have helped Rockwell thrive are almost certainly going to keep progressing. Rockwell is also benefitting from reshoring in places such as the U.S. as companies reevaluate their own supply chains and manufacturing following covid bottlenecks and geopolitical pressures.Story continuesCompanies are now diving headfirst into building semiconductors, EVs, solar panels, and much more in the U.S. and other places outside of China. Rockwell’s revenue climbed by roughly 11% in both FY21 and FY22. ROK most recently posted blowout Q2 FY23 results and provided upbeat guidance in late April.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks estimates call for Rockwell’s revenue to climb by over 14% in FY23 to $8.87 billion and then pop another 4% in FY24. Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings are projected to jump by 27% and 7%, respectively to hit $12.84 a share next year. ROK’s upward earnings revisions for FY23 and FY24 help it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now.Price, Technical Levels &amp; ValuationRockwell shares have soared roughly 1,200% in the last 20 years to blow away the S&amp;P 500’s 340% and its Zacks Industrial Products sector’s 230%. ROK’s total return over this stretch of around 1,900% also tops the benchmark’s 600%. Rockwell has posted a 255% run over the past 10 years to top the S&amp;P 500’s 175% and its sector’s 60%. ROK shares are closer to neck-and-neck with the benchmark in the past three years, with its recent surge helping Rockwell look slightly stronger. As we touched on up top, Rockwell has soared 55% in the last year as Wall Street jumps back into the beaten-down stock. ROK trades near its 52-week highs, but around 10% beneath its late 2021 records.   Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchROK’s year-long comeback helped it achieve the bullish golden cross back in November. Rockwell found support at its 50-day moving average at the end of May and has rebounded higher since then. ROK is coming up against the edge of overbought RSI levels on a 12-month basis, which means it could face some near-term selling pressure. But ROK remains closer to neutral on a five-year time scale.On the valuation side, ROK trades at a roughly 27% discount to its own 10-year highs at 24.3X forward 12-month earnings, while trading 10% below its peaks in terms of price. And Rockwell is trading not too far above its own five-year median even though its stock price has jumped 90% during this stretch.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineRockwell’s dividend currently yields around 1.5%. And the company closed last quarter with $1.1 billion remaining under its existing share repurchase authorization.Investors have shown their love for Rockwell given its ability to grow alongside crucial segments of the economy, and benefit from the never-ending need to automate and infuse tech into every aspect of the industrial ecosystem.Most recently, Rockwell is poised to ride the newfound wave and commitment to domestic manufacturing and reshoring in the U.S. and elsewhere for years, if not decades.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

134,f8570348-f327-3831-bf75-8d0b0e3c95ab,ROK,2023-06-13,Rockwell Automation (ROK) Upgraded to Strong Buy: What Does It Mean for the Stock?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rockwell-automation-rok-upgraded-strong-160006775.html,1686585606,STORY,['ROK'],"[Rockwell Automation (ROK) could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Rockwell Automation basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Rockwell Automation imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for Rockwell AutomationThis industrial equipment and software maker is expected to earn $12.04 per share for the fiscal year ending September 2023, which represents a year-over-year change of 26.9%.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Rockwell Automation. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 7.3%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Rockwell Automation to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Boeing (BA).Boeing currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.67, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 15 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.67 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 15 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 11 are Strong Buy, representing 73.3% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for BABroker Rating Breakdown Chart for BACheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Boeing here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Boeing, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness.

Yahoo Finance Live breaks down some of the trending stories of the day.Video Transcript- Let's take a look at some of those individual movers. First up, Illumina shares, gaining today, closing up just shy of 4%. The company, announcing that its CEO will be stepping down this coming after a lengthy proxy battle with activist investor Carl Icahn. Now Illumina saying that they will quote continue to execute on the company's goals while searching for a new CEO. And Diane, the Street was pretty upbeat just about this announcement that was made a new person potentially in charge here. But they do name that permanent CEO, the Street looking at that as a positive.- Yeah, they are looking at it as a positive. We know this has been in play for months, Carl Icahn kind of pushing for this change. Interestingly enough, he's going to stay on as an advisor through July. So I found that interesting, and he put out a note on LinkedIn over the weekend, so kind of making it seem like it was his choice. But we know this has been pushed forward for a while. And again, being received well on Wall Street. Meantime, we've got some deal news we're watching today hitting the NASDAQ. That stock down more than 11% on news that it will be acquiring Adenza, a financial software company for $10 and 1/2 billion.It's a combined cash and stock deal. Adenza make software for big banks and brokerages in the areas of risk management trading, trade processing. Now, the deal for the NASDAQ is the biggest in its history comes as the NASDAQ tries to carve out an even stronger tech footprint, but not surprising to see shares of NASDAQ getting hit today, because typically you see that in acquisition.- Yeah, and I think there's move here from NASDAQ, not necessarily a surprise. We've heard from CEO Dean Freeman over the last several years saying that the company is looking to diversify its business, not be so reliant on their exchange business. So this is just another avenue just in terms of diversifying their revenue streams. When it comes to what exactly this could do for the company as it stands right now, so the software business accounts for more than a third of NASDAQ's annualized recurring revenue.Story continuesSo they're looking to build on that trend here going forward. Let's also take a look at Tesla, because good news here, it keeps rolling in for the company, shares closing up for the 12th day in a row. Now that marks its longest winning streak on record at Tesla here, even getting some more positive headlines coming in today's action, EV charging companies-- ChargePoint and Blink also saying that they will have Chargers that are capable of working with Tesla's network and really just solidifying their position right now as a dominant player in the EV space, but more so their charging capabilities really coming out on top when it comes--- It kind of create-- right. To your point and coming together as really a single charging point, because of course, it follows that the GM, the Ford relationship, those announcements. And this is also not just for shares of Tesla. You saw a blank charge part climb with regard to this move them pairing up with Tesla. And I mean, just Elon Musk still continuing to respond to naysayers right when you think about these kind of deals that are happening within this space and being really that main point of charging connectivity for the EV space.- Yes. And we're seeing some of those gains today closing up another 2%]"

Yahoo Finance health care reporter Anjalee Khemlani breaks down the timeline of events, while also commenting on Novartis' $3.5 billion acquisition deal with Chinook Therapeutics.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: Illumina CEO Francis deSouza has officially stepped down that follows pressure from Carl Icahn to remove himself from the position after deSouza's push to acquire health care company Grail was shut down by regulators.""Yahoo Finance's"" Anjalee Khemlani joins us now with the details. Anja, even though there's been this pressure, this was still unexpected news, especially since it follows after earnings.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: That's right. Not only earnings, but also from the wind that Francis basically face not losing in that proxy battle back in May, which ousted the board chair, John Thompson, at the time. So what we saw then was shareholders voting for one of Icahn's three nominees for the board and CEO Francis deSouza surviving that. But now, stepping down as Carl Icahn continues to put pressure on the company to divest the Grail assets.So what happened with Grail? Just a recap on that. The company had first divested or rather spun it out back in 2016 for about $2 billion. The company then looked at re-acquiring it. Announcing that in 2021 for $8 billion. Regulatory decisions had not yet been complete by the time Illumina wrapped the deals, both in the US and the EU. They faced blocks concerns about market competition being the major point there.And it's really costing Illumina a lot of money, about $800 million a year just to hang on to according to reports. So that's where the concern comes in and where you've seen the pressure mounting from Carl Icahn. So this, essentially, ends that proxy battle and the pressure there. But they still face the decision of divesting Grail moving forward.BRAD SMITH: Anjalee, we're also watching another story in the health care space. Novartis, they've agreed to acquire Chinook in a $3.5 billion deal here. What can tell us about that?Story continuesANJALEE KHEMLANI: That's right. So Chinook is a kidney disease company. They have two treatments that they've got in the pipeline, clinical stage. This is really a good target for a company like Novartis. We know a lot of these large pharma companies are looking for the rare space as pressure mounts on them from things like the Medicare drug pricing negotiations.They've been looking at areas where they can really ramp up disease stages and assets that won't necessarily be targets of those negotiations. We know Novartis earlier this year announced that it was going to cut back on its pipeline. And that included on the cancer side. So this definitely builds up and bolsters its pipeline a little bit. And it'll be interesting to see what other moves it makes to make up for the cuts it announced earlier this year.BRAD SMITH: Anjalee, thanks so much for tracking these stories for us. Helping us break down the latest and greatest here in the health care landscape. Appreciate it.]"

The company gets set to report first quarter earnings after the bell today. Investors, they're going to be focused on how it's handling macroeconomic trends and if it's seeing success in its cloud business.Also worth noting a Wolfe Research upgrade to Outperform is helping the shares ahead of that quarterly earnings report. The Wolfe Research report actually anticipating a solid fourth quarter and also some AI tailwinds that Oracle could be the beneficiary of. Shares of Oracle up over 30% year to date.JULIE HYMAN: And shares of Illumina are also on the move today. That's after CEO Francis deSouza announced he will be stepping down unexpectedly. This, though, coming after pressure from Carl Icahn to remove deSouza from the position after Icahn pushed-- or I should say after deSouza pushed to acquire health care company Grail was shut down by regulators. Illumina says it will continue to execute on the company's goals while searching for a new CEO. But this does feel like potentially a victory for Icahn in his push there.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, spot on. We're also watching shares of NASDAQ here today. They are sinking this morning after announcing an acquisition of Adenza. This is a $10.5 billion even mix of cash and stock deal. This is the company's largest deal of its kind as it looks to expand its revenue beyond its exchange business here.Of course, it has several different businesses that it operates-- I would say that [? as ?] [? an ?] [? Alma ?] of NASDAQ as well-- across listings and IPOs that get kind of the flashy attention. But market technology more broadly internationally have helped the company also be able to expand. And also, of course, we've got some of the corporate solutions that they would look across, whether that's just deploying messages across the wire and other such elements of that business too. So this is the latest though.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, investors don't love it though.BRAD SMITH: They don't love it.]"

(NYSE:PWR). The company's stock saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NYSE over the last few months. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s examine Quanta Services’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. View our latest analysis for Quanta Services Is Quanta Services Still Cheap?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 11.53% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Quanta Services today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $163.93, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Quanta Services’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What kind of growth will Quanta Services generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Quanta Services. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in PWR’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on PWR, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing Quanta Services at this point in time.

The results showed that patients experienced better outcomes when the injection was administered in a home setting rather than a nonhome setting. The study was recently published in the Journal of Clinical Pathways.Cigna Healthcare logo""This study shows that we can help improve health outcomes by providing cancer patients with treatment such as infusions in a setting where many are most comfortable – home,"" said Dr. Scott Josephs, chief medical officer, Cigna Healthcare. ""These findings confirm that home infusion of complex and expensive specialty medications presents new opportunities to maximize access, improve effectiveness, increase affordability, and enhance convenience for patients.""The study, Pegfilgrastim Home Redirection Outcomes: Effectiveness and Timing of Administration in Primary Prophylaxis of Chemotherapy-Induced Neutropenia (Lavanya Raj, MBBS, MS; Pam McManus), examined the impact of Cigna's site-of-care home redirection program on pegfilgrastim effectiveness and timing of administration in preventing complications from chemotherapy among Cigna's commercial patients. Pegfilgrastim injections stimulate healthy white blood cell growth, which is critical for cancer patients who face an increased risk of infection due to cancer treatment.The study found that the incidence of neutropenia (abnormally low count of white blood cells), fever, pneumonia, and sepsis was 32% lower in patients who underwent home redirection compared with those who did not. Similarly, the odds of same-day pegfilgrastim administration were 43% lower in patients who underwent home redirection. This retrospective, real-world claims study presents significant evidence supporting favorable clinical outcomes associated with Cigna's site-of-care home-redirection program for pegfilgrastim.Story continuesCigna's site-of-care redirection program provides access to pegfilgrastim and other injected or infused treatments in a home setting when clinically appropriate, rather than a hospital, and where patients can have a home health nurse instruct them on self-administration. This program offers additional benefits, such as minimizing hospital visits for patients with cancer, who are at an increased risk of infection, the convenience of in-home administration, and avoidance of costs and logistics associated with traveling to another location 24 hours after chemotherapy administration. This program, which also often offers patients the option of infusions in their physician's office, emphasizes high-value care, optimizing patient outcomes, and enhancing the patient experience.About the studyThe study's sample consisted of 13,493 patients receiving chemotherapy between September 1, 2020, and August 31, 2022. Each of these patients had received pegfilgrastim or its biosimiliars for febrile neutropenia prophylaxis. These drugs were eligible for redirection under the Cigna Healthcare pro­gram and were redirected from a high-cost setting to a qual­ity, cost-effective clinically appropriate site of care, such as a contracted provider's office, customer's home with infusion nurses, or nonhospital-based ambulatory infusion center. Breast, colorectal, lung/ bronchus, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, pancreatic, ovarian, and uterine cancers comprised approximately 80% of patient can­cer types.About Cigna Healthcare Cigna Healthcare is a health benefits provider that advocates for better health through every stage of life.

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's 0.93% gain on the day. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.56%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 1.71%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the athletic apparel maker had lost 11.94% over the past month. This has lagged the Consumer Discretionary sector's gain of 0.39% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.61% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Nike as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be June 29, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Nike to post earnings of $0.66 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 26.67%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $12.57 billion, up 2.73% from the year-ago period.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Nike. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.48% lower. Nike currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Valuation is also important, so investors should note that Nike has a Forward P/E ratio of 26.58 right now. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 12.35, so we one might conclude that Nike is trading at a premium comparatively.Story continuesWe can also see that NKE currently has a PEG ratio of 2.5.

(NKE) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nike-inc-nke-attracting-investor-130007078.html,1686574807,STORY,['NKE'],"[Nike (NKE) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this athletic apparel maker have returned -11.9%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry, which Nike falls in, has lost 13.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Nike is expected to post earnings of $0.66 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -26.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1%.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.24 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -13.6%. This estimate has changed -0.5% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.98 indicates a change of +22.9% from what Nike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.5%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Nike.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Nike, the consensus sales estimate of $12.57 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +2.7%. The $50.96 billion and $54.54 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +9.1% and +7%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNike reported revenues of $12.39 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14%. EPS of $0.79 for the same period compares with $0.87 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.41 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +8.55%. The EPS surprise was +51.92%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nike is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nike. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you wish to see the top ones, head straight to the Top 5 Most Profitable Pharmaceutical Companies In The World.Undoubtedly, the pharmaceutical industry stands as one of the most financially rewarding and essential sectors worldwide, leading the way in medical advancements and contributing to global health improvements. Within this expansive field, specific companies like Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), which is the world's top pharma company, have emerged as influential forces, consistently generating significant profits and transforming the healthcare landscape. You can also explore some of the most profitable drugs in the world manufactured by these companies.According to recent financial statistics, the top pharmaceutical companies in the world include Johnson &amp; Johnson, Pfizer, and Roche, each generating over $50 billion in revenue annually. These industry leaders have achieved their positions by developing breakthrough medications, leveraging cutting-edge research, and investing heavily in innovation and development. With the ongoing demand for effective and safe medical treatments, the future of these companies looks brighter than ever. Key Factors Influencing Profitability in the Pharmaceutical Industry The pharmaceutical industry is a highly competitive and lucrative field that requires careful consideration of several key factors to ensure profitability and success. These factors include research and development costs, patent protection, regulatory compliance, pricing strategies, and market demand. Effective management of these factors can lead to increased profits and sustained growth for pharmaceutical companies while failing to address them can result in financial losses and decreased market share.  According to recent financial statistics, the global pharmaceutical market was valued at $1250.24 billion in 2021 and is expected to reach $1700.97 billion by 2025, growing at a CAGR of 8%. Research and development costs account for a significant portion of a pharmaceutical company's expenses, with an estimated average price of $2.6 billion per drug.  The United States is the no. 1 country in the pharma industry, with Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and Johnson &amp; Johnson being the largest pharma companies in the US. The US accounts for approximately 41% of global pharmaceutical spending in 2021. China emerged as the second-largest market, capturing nearly 12% market share.Story continuesAdditionally, patent protection plays a crucial role in the industry, with a typical patent lasting 20 years from the date of application. Regulatory compliance is also essential for pharmaceutical companies, as non-compliance can result in costly fines and legal action. Pricing strategies must be carefully considered to balance profitability with affordability for patients.  Finally, understanding market demand and adapting to changing trends is crucial for sustained growth and success. By effectively managing these key factors, pharmaceutical companies can increase profits and maintain a strong market position in this highly competitive industry. Global Market Dynamics and Competitive Landscape in the Pharmaceutical Industry The global pharmaceutical industry is constantly evolving and facing new challenges as companies strive to stay ahead of the competition. Market dynamics play a significant role in shaping the industry, with factors such as changing regulations, emerging technologies, and shifting consumer preferences all impacting. In 2022, the global pharmaceutical industry generated $1.48 trillion in revenue.One of the biggest challenges facing pharmaceutical companies today is the rising cost of research and development. As new technologies emerge and regulatory requirements become more stringent, companies are investing more time and money in developing new drugs, driving up healthcare costs and putting pressure on pharmaceutical companies to find new ways to innovate and stay competitive. In 2019, the top pharmaceutical companies spent $83 billion on research and development.  The growing demand for personalized medicine is another critical factor shaping the pharmaceutical industry. Consumers are increasingly looking for treatments tailored to their individual needs and genetic makeup, which is driving companies to invest in new research and development strategies. In 2021, the global personalized medicine market was valued at $2.12 trillion and is expected to reach $5.7 trillion by 2030, as noted by Precedence Research.At the same time, competition in the pharmaceutical industry is fierce, with companies vying for market share and trying to outdo each other in terms of innovation and pricing, leading to a highly competitive landscape, with companies constantly looking for ways to gain an edge over their rivals. Despite these challenges, the pharmaceutical industry remains an important and highly profitable sector of the global economy. With the right strategies and a strong focus on innovation, companies can continue to thrive in this dynamic and ever-changing market.  Emerging Trends and Future Outlook for Profitable Pharmaceutical Companies The pharmaceutical industry is experiencing significant trends reshaping its landscape and profitability. Personalized medicine, which tailors treatments to individuals based on their genetics, is a key trend driving innovation but requires substantial investment in research and development. Specialty drugs for rare or complex conditions are also gaining prominence, offering higher profit potential for successful market entry. Looking ahead, technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning, and 3D printing are promising for identifying new drug targets, developing more effective treatments, and revolutionizing drug manufacturing.

In 2022, Skyrizi and Rinvoq generated $7.69 billion in sales, while Humira brought in $21.24 billion despite biosimilar competition in Europe. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) expects price concessions to impact Humira in 2023, potentially leading to volume losses. Competition from BeiGene's Brukinsa caused a 16% decline in sales for AbbVie's Imbruvica. To address these changes, AbbVie may pursue more mergers and acquisitions. Aesthetics and neuroscience drugs in AbbVie's portfolio saw moderate sales growth in 2022. 9. Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)2022 Net Income: $6.24 billion2022 Revenue: $28.55 billion  In 2022, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) experienced a transition with declining revenues from COVID-19 antibodies but growth in critical drugs. Top-selling Trulicity, a Type 2 diabetes drug, grew by 15%, while Verzenio, a cancer drug, saw an 84% increase. However, revenues from top insulins and COVID-19 antibodies declined. The company has plans to launch new drugs in 2023, including donanemab for Alzheimer's, pirtobrutinib for mantel cell lymphoma, mirikizumab for ulcerative colitis, and lebrikizumab for atopic dermatitis. A setback occurred when the FDA required a traditional approval process for donanemab. Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) also pledged to lower insulin prices in the U.S. and implemented a program to cap out-of-pocket costs. 8. Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN)2022 Net Income: $6.6 billion2022 Revenue: $26.32 billion  Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) experienced slow growth in 2022 but is anticipated to improve its performance through the acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics and the launch of its Humira biosimilar. While Lumakras sales declined and Mvasi and Kanjinti faced competition and price pressures, Amjevita, the Humira biosimilar, has obtained approval in Europe and holds a competitive advantage in the U.S. market. Nplate sales saw an increase due to a significant order from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) acquired Horizon Therapeutics for approximately $28 billion, expanding its portfolio with drugs such as Krystexxa, Tepezza, and Uplizna.7. Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)2022 Net Income: $14.52 2022 Revenue: $59.3 billion Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), known for its vaccines, faced setbacks in COVID-19 vaccine development but found success with the oral antiviral treatment Lagevrio, generating $5.68 billion in 2022. However, Lagevrio recently failed a trial and received a negative assessment from Europe's drug regulator. Keytruda, Merck &amp; Co., Inc (NYSE:MRK)'s bell cow drug contributed to a 22% revenue increase in 2022 with sales of $20.9 billion. Sales of diabetes treatments, including Januvia, declined by 15% to $4.5 billion due to contaminant concerns. Gardasil sales reached $6.9 billion, driven by higher demand in China. Other blockbusters, such as Varivax, Bridion, Lynparza, and Lenvima, also grew sales.6. Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB)2022 Net Income: $3.04 billion 2022 Revenue: $10.1 billionBiogen Inc.

Shares of Chinook have gained significantly following the announcement.Per the terms, shareholders of Chinook would receive $3.2 billion ($40.00 per share) in cash upon closing, plus a contingent value right with a value of up to $0.3 billion ($4.00 per share), payable in cash upon the achievement of certain regulatory milestones. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2023.The deal has been unanimously approved by the boards of both companies.The acquisition will add Chinook’s pipeline, which includes two late-stage candidates, atrasentan and zigakibart (BION-1301), for immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN), to Novartis’ pipeline.IgAN is a progressive, rare kidney disease that generally affects young adults and currently lacks targeted treatment options. The disease affects up to 21 people per million per year in the United States, with a higher incidence in Asian populations. It is the most common cause of kidney failure in Caucasian young adults.Atrasentan, an oral endothelin A receptor antagonist (ERA), is currently in phase III development for IgAN, with a readout expected in the fourth quarter. The candidate has demonstrated a significant reduction in proteinuria versus baseline in a phase II study with good tolerability, including a favorable liver safety profile. The candidate is also in early-stage development for other rare kidney diseases.Zigakibart is a targeted biologic therapy with the potential to address the root cause of IgAN, the production of abnormal galactose-deficient IgA and preserve kidney function. Interim phase I/II data showed an impressive reduction in proteinuria versus baseline. A phase III study is expected to start in the next quarter.The acquisition is in line with Novartis’ strategy to focus on innovative medicines and will significantly expand its renal portfolio, complementing the existing pipeline.Story continuesShares of Novartis have gained 10.5% in the year so far compared with the industry’s 0.8% growth. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Novartis previously announced that it planned to spin off Sandoz into a new publicly traded standalone company following a strategic review. The planned spin-off of the Sandoz unit remains on track for the second half of 2023.

The company has been a shareholder of RHHBY since May 2001. Novartis was reportedly looking for strategic acquisitions in the pharma space using the cash proceeds from its stake sale in Roche.Mergers and Acquisitions (M&amp;A) are back in focus in this space.In March 2023, pharma giant Pfizer PFE announced that it will acquire oncology-focused biotech company Seagen Inc., for $229 in cash per share or a total enterprise value of $43 billion.Per Pfizer, Seagen’s medicines, late-stage development programs and pioneering expertise in antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) strongly complement its oncology portfolio.Novartis currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

(PFE) Worth Betting on Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/most-watched-stock-pfizer-inc-130012473.html,1686574812,STORY,['PFE'],"[Pfizer (PFE) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this drugmaker have returned +4.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.6% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, to which Pfizer belongs, has lost 1.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Pfizer is expected to post earnings of $0.63 per share, indicating a change of -69.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.3% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.35 points to a change of -49.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.33 indicates a change of -0.6% from what Pfizer is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.1%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Pfizer.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Pfizer, the consensus sales estimate of $14.01 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -49.5%. The $68.1 billion and $67.07 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -32.1% and -1.5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPfizer reported revenues of $18.28 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -28.8%. EPS of $1.23 for the same period compares with $1.62 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.96 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +7.82%. The EPS surprise was +23%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Pfizer is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Pfizer. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

These totals would mark changes of +1.97% and +2.25%, respectively, from last year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for IBM.

This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Marathon Petroleum is expected to post earnings of $4.77 per share, indicating a change of -55% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -14.2% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $19.10 points to a change of -27% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -5%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.84 indicates a change of -32.8% from what Marathon Petroleum is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +4.4%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Marathon Petroleum.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Marathon Petroleum, the consensus sales estimate of $31.93 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -41.1%. The $136.17 billion and $124.14 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -24.3% and -8.8%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMarathon Petroleum reported revenues of $35.08 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -8.6%. EPS of $6.09 for the same period compares with $1.49 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $32.45 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +8.11%. The EPS surprise was +6.1%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Marathon Petroleum is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Marathon Petroleum. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

That’s not bad considering that you don’t want to go convenience-store sushi with your retirement ideas. However, you will find that these ideas are all undervalued relative to their trailing-12-month earnings. In addition, the below enterprises feature powerful businesses that should be relevant for decades to come.

Per its public profile, Marathon operates the nation’s largest refining system. As well, the company’s marketing system includes branded locations across the U.S. Despite its broad relevance, since the beginning of this year, MPC slipped 2%. Nevertheless, the red ink provides an opportunity for cheap retirement stocks to buy.Fundamentally, downstream hydrocarbon energy specialists suffered deflated price action as millions of employees continue to operate remotely. However, with mass layoffs continuing to contradict the supposedly robust labor market, more companies may choose to recall their workers. Basically, the power pendulum has swung back toward employers. Also, existing infrastructures for combustion car suggests that the electric vehicle revolution may be more ambitious than viable.Whatever the case, MPC features an attractive valuation, making it a top idea for affordable stocks for retirement portfolio. Specifically, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 6.18.

The company has been significantly progressing on its three strategic pillars — optimize, drive and growth. Also, it has been on track with the Readiness program.Driven by these initiatives and continued business momentum, the company has been witnessing a robust earnings surprise trend, which continued in first-quarter 2023. The top and bottom lines beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and advanced year over year. This marked the 15th straight quarter of an earnings beat. Results were bolstered by strong margins across the Ag Services &amp; Oilseeds and Carbohydrate Solutions segments, and a solid product portfolio.However, Archer Daniels has been witnessing a rising SG&amp;A expense trend for a while now. Also, the dismal performance in the Nutrition Unit has been concerning.Shares of Archer Daniels have lost 11.6% in the past year against the industry’s growth of 4.4%. Moreover, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock compared unfavorably with the sector’s rise of 3.9% and the S&amp;P 500’s improvement of 14.9%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Can Growth Initiatives Lift Stock?Archer Daniels looks poised for long-term growth, owing to its progress on the optimize, drive and growth pillars. Under the optimize pillar, the company revealed plans to expand alternative protein capabilities in Decatur, IL, and starch production in Marshall, MN. It concluded its alternative protein expansion in Serbia and is on track to launch the expanded probiotic capacity in Valencia, Spain.The company also expects to start operating its joint venture crush and refining facility in North Dakota by this year’s harvest. It continues to adapt to consumers’ changing nutritional preferences as part of optimizing growth.Under its drive pillar, ADM has been adapting its organizational structure to meet operational excellence and set goals. Notably, Archer Daniels inked an agreement with Benson Hill to process and commercialize a portfolio of proprietary ingredients derived from their ultra-high protein soybeans.In response to growing trends for all things sustainable, the company has been making efforts to expand its solutions portfolio, which forms part of its Carbohydrate Solutions unit. It collaborated with LG Chem to produce lactic and polylactic acids for bioplastics, which is a plant-based product.Also, ADM launched Biosolutions to expand its portfolio of sustainable higher-margin solutions, particularly for pharmaceuticals and personal care markets. Such endeavors are likely to help attain 10% revenue growth on an annual basis.In a recent development, Archer Daniels entered a joint venture with Gevo to help meet the demand for low-carbon, sustainable aviation fuel. It also decided to shut down its ethanol facility in Peoria by the end of October. The company is utilizing innovative technologies to develop products and boost operating capabilities.Additionally, Archer Daniels is likely to gain from the Readiness goals of driving business improvement, standardizing functions and enriching consumers’ experience, which are on track. As a part of readiness efforts, it introduced a company-wide simplification initiative. The company’s strategic pillars for growth and the aforementioned initiatives are guided and supported by the Readiness program focused on accelerating and enhancing competitiveness.Story continuesHurdles to OvercomeArcher Daniels is lately witnessing soft trends in its Nutrition segment, which is hurting investor sentiment.In first-quarter 2023, the company’s Nutrition segment witnessed a year-over-year revenue decline of 3.7%. The adjusted operating profit fell 23% from the year-ago quarter. The Human Nutrition unit was flat year over year.The Flavors unit was drab due to sluggish results in North America, while sturdy margins aided the Specialty Ingredients unit. The Health &amp; Wellness business remained weak year over year. Also, the Animal Nutrition unit was weak year over year due to lower margins in amino acids.However, management has been making efforts to help reduce destocking impacts in beverage, lower margins in amino acids and the broader demand fulfillment challenges. It expects 2023 operating profit growth of more than 10% on a constant-currency basis, led by Human Nutrition. Also, the company is likely to witness growth toward the back half of the year.In first-quarter 2023, Archer Daniels’ SG&amp;A expenses rose 6.3% to $881 million. The metric grew 14.1%, 13.6%, 10.1% and 16.7% in the fourth, third, second and first quarters of 2022, followed by increases of 4.9%, 13.2%, 15.8% and 12.8% in the fourth, third, second and first quarters of 2021, respectively. This can be attributed to higher performance-related compensation, project-related costs and shifting of costs from business segments into the centralized centers of excellence in supply chain and operations.Higher SG&amp;A expenses linked with higher performance-related compensation, project-related costs and shifting costs from business segments into the centralized centers of excellence in supply chain and operations have been other headwinds. The global impacts of inflation have been concerning. Any deleverage in SG&amp;A expenses has a direct bearing on the company’s profitability.Consumer Staple Stocks Worth a LookWe have highlighted three better-ranked stocks from the Consumer Staple sector, namely, Molson Coors TAP, Monster Beverage MNST and PepsiCo Inc.

He predicted that if the EPA regulations are too tough, China will gain ""a stronger foothold in America’s electric vehicle battery supply chain and eventually our automotive market.""The EPA, which declined to comment, proposed in April cutting vehicle emissions by 56% over 2026 levels. EPA estimates would result in 60% of new vehicles by 2030 being electric and 67% by 2032.The trade group - which represents General Motors Co, Toyota Motor Corp, Honda Motor, Volkswagen , Hyundai MotorCo Ltd , Ford Motor Co , Stellantis NV and other major automakers - warned in May that automakers will struggle to meet those targets because of problems with the supply chain for EV batteries, motors and chargers as well as consumer resistance.Chinese automakers sell few vehicles in the United States, and only a small number of Chinese-made vehicles are imported by major automakers for sale in the U.S.Bozzella said Europe offers a warning of what could happen in the United States. ""With a 2035 ban on fossil fuel vehicles looming, Chinese manufacturers gained a foothold and entered the European market at a budget price point,"" he said.

Last Thursday, General Motors (NYSE: GM) has revealed it will be following its Detroit peer, Ford Motor (NYSE: F) in making an agreement with Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) to access its electric vehicle-charging infrastructure across North America. Today, a pioneer manufacturer of state-of-the art pickup tonneau cover manufacturer whose products hold a big EV promise, Worksport Ltd (NASDAQ: WKSP), revealed it will be reallocating its headquarters to the company’s West Seneca, NY facility to turbocharge its operations.GM Follows Ford’s Footsteps As It Enters The Tesla Charging UniverseAs of 2025, Ford and GM will be integrating Tesla charging tech into their next-generation EVs. Someone might say that Tesla has fueled an EV charging standards war, but just like when Tesla started discounting prices at the beginning of the year, there’s a much bigger picture in question and it’s all about accelerating the global EV shift.Turbocharging The World’s EV TransitionTesla Superchargers use a proprietary plug design, NACS, which stands for the North American Charging Standard. Other EVs and charging stations in the U.S. use the CCS plug standard, which stands for Combined Charging System. Currently, Tesla EVs can use CCS chargers with an adapter, but only Tesla EVs can use NACS chargers. With Tesla’s adapters, Ford and GM vehicles will be able to use Tesla’s supercharging network. When announcing the deal with GM, Rebecca Tinucci, Tesla senior director of charging infrastructure, stated that providing every EV owner with access to reliable charging is at the core of Tesla’s mission. Unarguably, the charging infrastructure is the prerequisite for global EV adoption.Worksport’s HQ Shift To The U.S.Worksport is entering a new era of turbocharged growth with its strategic HQ shift. By moving its headquarters from Ontario, Canada to the company’s 220,000 square-foot facility in West Seneca, NY, Worksport will be able to fuel its growth in many ways, from its strategy to its efficient execution. This geographic move is a strategic and transformative leap.Story continuesLast year, Worksport has partnered with the Hyundai America Technical Center to test its Solis solar tonneau cover and COR portable energy storage system on Hyundai Santa Cruz pickups. These two revolutionary products hold a big promise to the EV world. Last year, Workport announced that Solis will be able to generate 650 watts of power by simply being parked in the sun while COR energy system will come with a standard capacity of 1,500 Wh. Last week, Worksport proudly revealed it has fully redesigned and improved the COR system under the leadership of Dr. Rafael Olivera. Worksport has enhanced both the interface and increased the power capacity from 2kW to 3kW. Once Worksport’s proprietary SOLIS tonneau cover and COR come to lives across the globe, CEO Steven Rossi promises that no workplaces and campsites will be the same.  Samples of Worksport’s tonneau covers have already been approved by its U.S. customers, equipment has been received at the N.Y. facility and a highly skilled workforce has been hired. Worksport will be soon announcing an update regarging the anticipated production launch of SOLIS as it finalizes its proprietary COR system.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

It doesn't feel like a bull market.And that's probably good for the profit-seeking bulls. Be hated, and let markets climb that proverbial wall of worry quietly.Target's stock has been slapped with two high-profile Wall Street rating downgrades in as many weeks on fears of shoppers buying a lot less of things they don't need this summer.Definitely not a bullish signal.Campbell's Soup CEO conceded to me last week in a Yahoo Finance Live interview that cheaper private-label soups (yuck) are gaining traction.More customers trading down? Not bullish.morning brief imageI was just out to lunch with one prominent consumer CEO and he is more concerned with executing a major round of layoffs and planning for a cautious holiday shopping season than developing the next big widget.You guessed it, also not bullish.Jeweler Signet said people are buying cheaper engagement rings, in what was deemed a lackluster set of quarterly results last week.At least hotel chains such as Marriott and Hilton are seeing strong demand this summer, according to their respective top execs. Ditto United Airlines.But by and large, it doesn't feel like a rip-roaring bull market in stocks that has everyone out in the street jumping for joy and spending on frivolous nothings.Yet, the bull market has returned, technically speaking.The latest bull market is believed to have started on Oct. 13, 2022, a day after the S&amp;P 500 closed at a low of 3,577. Since then, the S&amp;P 500 has powered itself to a 21% gain — i.e. bull market territory.Pros think the gains could continue for a little while longer for a few reasons.For one, the bull market still has its chorus of haters who don't believe stocks deserve to trade at these levels because of higher interest rates and a meh economy.Story continuesAs the data likely keeps coming in contrary to their bearishness, they could toss in the towel and join the early bulls. That means stocks go higher.Meanwhile, there are fundamental drivers in place to support stocks at higher levels than they trade at today.""Investors have bought into a singular equity theme (AI) but a broader bull case for stocks can be made: we are off of ZIRP [zero interest rate policy] and real yields are positive again, volatility around rates and inflation has subsided, estimate dispersion (earnings uncertainty) has declined and companies have preserved margins by cutting costs and focusing on efficiency.

Ditto United Airlines.But by and large, it doesn't feel like a rip-roaring bull market in stocks that has everyone out in the street jumping for joy and spending on frivolous nothings.Yet, the bull market has returned, technically speaking.The latest bull market is believed to have started on Oct. 13, 2022, a day after the S&amp;P 500 closed at a low of 3,577. Since then, the S&amp;P 500 has powered itself to a 21% gain — i.e. bull market territory.Pros think the gains could continue for a little while longer for a few reasons.For one, the bull market still has its chorus of haters who don't believe stocks deserve to trade at these levels because of higher interest rates and a meh economy.Story continuesAs the data likely keeps coming in contrary to their bearishness, they could toss in the towel and join the early bulls.

Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer breaks down the reports.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: All right. Let's get a look at another big mover in today's action. And that's cruise lines at some bullish calls out on the street, really spreading that optimism just in terms of the demand story for some of these stocks. Here to discuss, we have Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer. And Josh, it was almost across the board here, just in terms of some of the strength that we're seeing.JOSH SCHAFER: Yes. So you saw upgrades from JP Morgan and Bank of America today, coming out and upgrading. That was Carnival Cruise Lines that they upgraded. That stock closed up nearly 13%. And part of the strength they're seeing is just overall demand in cruise lines. Bank of America writing that the cruise recovery is ""now stable."" They also highlight overall Bank of America card spending.I thought this was an interesting point. So Bank of America obviously aggregates their own credit or debit card spending. They said their travelers spent 17.3% more money in May than they did in that same month in 2019. So people spending more money on cruises now than they were pre-pandemic. And then when you take a look at Carnival specifically and why B of A likes Carnival, they also highlighted debt.So Carnival had a problem of increasing debt going back to the pandemic. But they said that now that that debt is actually more under control than it was before. Our Brian Sozzi actually recently spoke to Carnival CEO Josh Weinstein. I want to play a bite for you here.JOSH WEINSTEIN: Getting back a fortress balance sheet is incredibly important to us. We peaked at $35 billion of debt. I was very, very happy to say on our last earnings call two very important things. Number one, we have no intention of issuing any more equity. And number two, we are starting to pay down the debt.Story continuesJOSH SCHAFER: So, Diane, obviously the key point that you hear there, peaked at $35 billion, right? That debt peaking. They're now coming on the other side of that. Bank of America, after talking to management last week, sees that obviously as a positive to have that debt coming down.DIANE KING HALL: And I'm not surprised to see that, to see the upgrades. Last week, I spoke with Royal Caribbean CEO Jason Liberty. He talked about demand for this year and beyond. Let's quickly listen to that.JASON LIBERTY: Well, really, for the past couple of months and certainly right now, most of the bookings we're taking on is for 2024. So the demand trends that we've seen earlier in the year is very much flowing into 2024, and even into 2025.DIANE KING HALL: Yeah. So we're seeing that play out in the numbers and Wall Street reaction to that when I was on the ship last week. I mean, it was full. It was. They said they're at 100% subscribed, over 100%. I said, how can you be over 100%? Two people to a room, basically.JOSH SCHAFER: It's been interesting to see that also play out in these stocks to start the year, right? When you take a look at these three stocks, year to date, right now, you have Carnival up over 80%. You take a look at Royal Caribbean, up almost 100% to start this year. So people clearly bullish on what they're seeing for bookings sort of out to end the year, right?Because that's going to come in earnings when we think about the end of '23. And then obviously as you were just saying, '24, '25. So it seems like overall positive for the cruise line industry. I don't know if I'm going to be going on a cruise anytime soon, guys. Not exactly my thing, but someone's booking.SEANA SMITH: I know. And I've been talking to more and more people as we've just been talking about the fact that there's nothing stopping this demand for the cruise lines. You've heard from all the CEOs at this point that it's not just the people who are taking cruises before. They're able to attract new cruisers. I still, though, haven't talked to anyone that's been on a cruise. So maybe it's time for all of us to go.DIANE KING HALL: I haven't been on one. But I will say the experience of actually like being on the ship made me interested for the first time ever.SEANA SMITH: And they look pretty cool. They have everything onboard those ships these days. All right, Josh Schafer, good stuff. Thanks.]"

Yahoo Finance markets reporter Jared Blikre breaks down some of the index's biggest winners of the year so far.Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: So the S&amp;P 500 is in a technical bull market. So a good time to get technical with ""Yahoo Finance's"" Jared Blikre from the New York Stock Exchange. Hey, Jared.JARED BLIKRE: Well, technically speaking, yes, we are in a bull market. I want to examine some of the biggest winners this year. And we know a lot of those winners are in the AI category. We're talking about names we know, like, a-- excuse me, like Nvidia, like Alphabet, like Microsoft as well.But I was looking at the S&amp;P 500, some of the biggest winners this year. Tesla is in there, not as surprised, that's up almost 100%. AMD, not as surprised because that is a chip company, up about 90%. Royal Caribbean fills out the number five spot, that's up 85%. Then you have GE, that's been off my list for several years. That's up about 60% this year.Carnival, up over 60%. Salesforce, over 60%. And then, finally, PulteGroup. And I don't know if I'm saying that correctly, but P-U-L-T-E, residential construction name. It's this getting a little bit more broad-based.And so we're thinking back to that expansion of the rally last Friday-- not last Friday but the week before on that non-farm payroll. And is that going to stick? Another comment that really resonated with me from a guest prior was that this would be-- if we are in a new bull market right now, this would be the most unloved bull market or a start to a bull market that we've seen in decades maybe ever.I went through a global financial crisis. Some of the big ones like the Dot-Com bubble as well and some of the smaller ones, even some of the smaller pullbacks. Typically, at the beginning of these things, and this would have been traced back to October because that's when we had the lows, everything goes up. And then you have a period of consolidation pullback, people don't believe this is a new bull market. And then, things start getting narrowed and more selective.Story continuesWhat we did this time is we started the opposite way. And this isn't-- and this is assuming that we're still in a bull market but the opposite way would be we're starting out with a few narrow names and now we're expanding. So it doesn't mean, this doesn't have to be the case. But historically, it would be very unusual.A couple more things I want to point out here. Indices are getting very stretched. Even the S&amp;P 500 which was not as stretched as the NASDAQ, if you take a look at the S&amp;P 500 relative to its 50-day moving average getting very well extended, bespoke has a couple of notes and graphics out on this. But basically, we could be due for a mean reversion and that would just mean the price either has to come down or price has to stay level and a correction in time has to occur.Haven't seen any of those either of those things panned out just yet. Bottom line market overall's probably due for a pause or a pullback or what could happen is if this rotation continues, we could just see select pockets of the market advance while other ones take pauses. So all in all, we do have some momentum to the upside.We have this huge CPI report due out tomorrow, going to be a lot of headline risk from that as well as the Fed report. So enjoy today because things get a little messy starting tomorrow morning.- We will see. Thanks so much, Jared. We'll brace ourselves.]"

(NASDAQ:ADI), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 89% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).And as as result, institutional investors reaped the most rewards after the company's stock price gained 7.2% last week. One-year return to shareholders is currently 29% and last week’s gain was the icing on the cake.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Analog Devices. See our latest analysis for Analog Devices ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Analog Devices?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Analog Devices already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Analog Devices' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Analog Devices is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.1% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.1% and 4.1%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 24 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Analog DevicesThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Analog Devices, Inc.. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$333m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 11% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company.

It doesn't feel like a bull market.And that's probably good for the profit-seeking bulls. Be hated, and let markets climb that proverbial wall of worry quietly.Target's stock has been slapped with two high-profile Wall Street rating downgrades in as many weeks on fears of shoppers buying a lot less of things they don't need this summer.Definitely not a bullish signal.Campbell's Soup CEO conceded to me last week in a Yahoo Finance Live interview that cheaper private-label soups (yuck) are gaining traction.More customers trading down? Not bullish.morning brief imageI was just out to lunch with one prominent consumer CEO and he is more concerned with executing a major round of layoffs and planning for a cautious holiday shopping season than developing the next big widget.You guessed it, also not bullish.Jeweler Signet said people are buying cheaper engagement rings, in what was deemed a lackluster set of quarterly results last week.At least hotel chains such as Marriott and Hilton are seeing strong demand this summer, according to their respective top execs. Ditto United Airlines.But by and large, it doesn't feel like a rip-roaring bull market in stocks that has everyone out in the street jumping for joy and spending on frivolous nothings.Yet, the bull market has returned, technically speaking.The latest bull market is believed to have started on Oct. 13, 2022, a day after the S&amp;P 500 closed at a low of 3,577. Since then, the S&amp;P 500 has powered itself to a 21% gain — i.e. bull market territory.Pros think the gains could continue for a little while longer for a few reasons.For one, the bull market still has its chorus of haters who don't believe stocks deserve to trade at these levels because of higher interest rates and a meh economy.Story continuesAs the data likely keeps coming in contrary to their bearishness, they could toss in the towel and join the early bulls. That means stocks go higher.Meanwhile, there are fundamental drivers in place to support stocks at higher levels than they trade at today.""Investors have bought into a singular equity theme (AI) but a broader bull case for stocks can be made: we are off of ZIRP [zero interest rate policy] and real yields are positive again, volatility around rates and inflation has subsided, estimate dispersion (earnings uncertainty) has declined and companies have preserved margins by cutting costs and focusing on efficiency. After a fast hiking cycle, the Fed has latitude to ease.

Technology stocks were standout gainers in most markets. In Europe, shares in Hexagon rose by as much as 6.4% after the Swedish industrial group said it had signed a collaboration agreement with Nvidia.Nvidia shares have risen by nearly 200% this year, briefly pushing the company's market value above $1 trillion, as investor enthusiasm for anything exposed to artificial intelligence has lifted the entire sector.Anticipation of a flood of capital into chip-related companies also helped push Japan's Nikkei index to its highest in 33 years on Tuesday.On Monday, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq rallied to their highest closing levels since April 2022.The S&amp;P 500 has entered a technical bull market, as gains in market heavyweights Amazon, Apple and Tesla have lifted it by over 20% from its October 2022 lows. So far this year, the S&amp;P has gained 13%, but its equal-weight equivalent, which dilutes the impact of the largest companies in the index, has risen just 3%.The Fed is expected to take a break from raising rates, but surprise hikes from the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Bank of Canada last week have served as a reminder that a pause in a rate cycle is sometimes just that.""For me, it's 50/50 - they could hike - and I think they should, because it will give them more flexibility in July and for the rest of the year,"" CMC Markets chief markets strategist Michael Hewson said.""We are closer to 'peak Fed' than we are to anything else. So, for me, it’s a question of how much more juice has the dollar got before it rolls back down again,"" he said.Story continues""I can't say, with any degree of confidence, that the Fed has any more than 25 basis points to go, if that, and I can't say the same for the ECB, or the Bank of England,"" he added.The BoE meets next week and is forecast to raise interest rates by another quarter point, from 4.50% currently.A VERY BRITISH PROBLEMData on Tuesday that showed a rapid pickup in UK wage growth in the three months to April could complicate matters for the central bank, which is already grappling with inflation that is over four times its target of 2%.""The key takeaway here is, not only was unemployment not ticking higher, we've got strong jobs growth and also wage growth is just extremely high right now and that's going to be making the Bank of England feel very uncomfortable,"" City Index senior markets analyst Fiona Cincotta said.Money markets show traders now anticipate a peak in UK rates at around 5.6% by February, up from a terminal rate of 4.85% by November a month ago.The European Central Bank, meanwhile, is expected to raise rates by 25 basis points on Thursday and signal it has more room to tighten policy, while the Bank of Japan is expected to maintain its ultra-loose policy after it meets on Friday.In currencies, the dollar index, which measures the performance of the U.S. currency against six others, fell 0.2% to 103.32. Sterling rose 0.4% against the dollar to $1.2567 after the UK wage data, while the euro rose 0.4% to $1.0796.The dollar was flat against the yen at 139.57.In commodities, Brent crude futures, which are 40% below where they were this time last year, were last up 2% at $73.33 a barrel, while U.S. crude futures rose 1.8% to $68.31. Gold rose 0.5% to $1,967 an ounce.(Additional reporting by Farouq Suleiman in London and by Julie Zhu in Hong Kong; Editing by Christopher Cushing, Jamie Freed, Simon Cameron-Moore &amp; Conor Humphries)]"

She spoke following a keynote presentation in San Francisco during which Su showed an AI system on the MI300X chip writing a poem about the city.""The more memory that you have, the larger the set of models"" the chip can handle, Su said. ""We've seen in customer workloads that it runs much faster. We really do think it's differentiating.""But unlike past presentations where AMD has talked up a major customer for a new chip, AMD did not say who will adopt the MI300X or a smaller version called the MI300A. The company gave no details on how much the chip will cost or how it will bolster its sales.AMD's shares have doubled in price since the start of the year and touched a 16-month high earlier on Tuesday, but closed down 3.6% after the presentation on the AI strategy. Nvidia shares finished 3.9% higher at $410.22, making it the first chipmaker to close with a market capitalization above $1 trillion.""I think the lack of a (large customer) saying they will use the MI300 A or X may have disappointed the Street. They want AMD to say they have replaced Nvidia in some design,"" said Kevin Krewell, principal analyst at TIRIAS Research.Nvidia, whose shares have surged 170% so far this year, dominates the AI computing market with a market share of 80% to 95%, according to analysts.Story continuesNvidia has few competitors working at a large scale. While Intel Corp and several startups such as Cerebras Systems and SambaNova Systems have competing products, Nvidia's biggest sales threat so far is the internal chip efforts at Alphabet Inc's Google and Amazon.com's cloud unit, both of which rent their custom chips to outside developers.Aside from the AI market, AMD said it has started shipping high volumes of a general purpose central processor chip called ""Bergamo"" to companies such as Meta Platforms.Alexis Black Bjorlin, who oversees computing infrastructure at Facebook parent Meta, said the firm has adopted the Bergamo chip, which targets a different part of AMD's data center business that caters to cloud computing providers and other large chip buyers.But investors were searching for news on AI. Nvidia's lead there has come not only from its chips, but also from more than a decade of providing software tools to AI researchers and learning to anticipate what they will need in chips that take years to design.AMD on Tuesday provided updates to its Rocm software, which competes against Nvidia's Cuda software platform.Soumith Chintala, a Meta vice president who helped create open-source software for artificial intelligence, during the presentation said he has worked closely with AMD to make it easier for AI developers to use free tools to switch from the ""single dominating vendor"" of AI chips to other offerings like those from AMD.""You don't actually have to do that much work - or almost no work in a lot of cases - to go from one platform to the other,"" Chintala said.But analysts said just because sophisticated companies like Meta can wring good speeds from AMD chips, that was no promise of broader market traction with less sophisticated buyers.""People still aren't convinced that AMD's software solution is competitive with Nvidia's, even if it is competitive on the hardware performance side,"" said Anshel Sag, an analyst at Moor Insights &amp; Strategy.(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Leslie Adler, David Gregorio, Nick Zieminski and Mark Porter)]"

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the hydrogen and fuel cell market and check the top stocks in the sector, check out 5 Best Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Stocks To Buy. As per the International Energy Agency’s “Global Hydrogen Review 2022”, the demand for hydrogen reached 94 million tonnes in 2021, up from the pre-pandemic demand of 91 million tonnes in 2019. Majority of the higher hydrogen demand stems from traditional uses, such as refining and industrial applications. New steel projects are being declared swiftly, just one year after the successful demonstration of utilizing hydrogen in direct reduction of iron. Hydrogen fuel cell-powered trains are now running in Germany, and there are hundreds of on-going projects that are testing the use of hydrogen and hydrogen derivatives in shipping and the power sector. Hydrogen has the potential to create 3.5 GW power by 2030. IEA forecasts that hydrogen demand could skyrocket to 115 million tonnes by 2030, and about 2 million tonnes would be attributed to new applications. Around 200 million tonnes of hydrogen is required by 2030 to meet the net zero emissions goal by 2050.According to GlobalData, a renowned data and analytics company, the global production capacity of green hydrogen exceeded 109 kilo tons per annum (ktpa) in 2022. This indicates an impressive growth of 44% when compared to 2021. In February 2023, Andres Angulo, Energy Analyst at GlobalData, said: “During 2022, over 393 deals related to hydrogen were closed, representing a significant increase compared to 277 deals registered in 2021. This shows an upward trend in the low-carbon hydrogen market development, which could be decisive in achieving over 111 million tons per annum (mtpa) capacity worldwide by 2030. However, the partnerships represented 66% of the deals last year, and the number of deals decreased after Q2 2022 to numbers even below those seen in the same quarter in 2021. This could have been due to the companies trying to strengthen their core business and diversify the investment risk given the global economic situation.”Story continuesDon't Miss: Top 10 Green Hydrogen Companies in the WorldHydrogen fits seamlessly with the vision of the big oil companies, given their control and expertise over natural gas operations and a robust financial position after an extremely profitable year in 2022. Massive funding and experience in dynamic project management will allow the existing oil and gas giants to transition into hydrogen as an energy source. The most feasible plan is to manufacture portable liquid hydrogen and supply clean power to travel, logistics, steel, and chemical industries. Hydrogen is exceedingly popular in the aircraft industry, as they grapple to lower their carbon emissions and achieve net-zero carbon by 2050. CNBC cited Martha Neubauer, senior associate at AeroDynamic Advisory, who said: “Airbus has been looking at hydrogen for a long time and recently, within the last years, has increased that focus. Looking at both hydrogen fuel cells and hydrogen combustion.”Some of the best hydrogen stocks to invest in include Linde plc (NYSE:LIN), DuPont de Nemours, Inc. (NYSE:DD), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX).  Our Methodology We selected the following hydrogen and fuel cell stocks based on the hedge fund sentiment toward each stock.

Bloom Energy Corporation (NYSE:BE) is an electrical equipment company that makes solid-oxide fuel cell systems for on-site power generation, serving a variety of industries. Its fuel cells convert natural gas, biogas or hydrogen into baseload (non-intermittent) electricity without combustion, so there is low or no carbon emission. We expect significant upside through its ability to support the growing hydrogen economy, with a large opportunity for this in South Korea and meaningful policy support in the U.S. via the IRA, while other markets include biogas, carbon capture and marine transportation. Its natural gas energy server business is growing in the U.S. amid higher grid reliability concerns.”8. Cummins Inc. (NYSE:CMI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38Cummins Inc.

The movie is projected to debut with a modest $31 million to $41 million this weekend in the U.S., according to the Box Office Pro website. That is well shy of the recent $120.5 million haul for Sony’s critically acclaimed animated hit ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.""Pixar is looking to rebound from the box office disappointment of 2022 release ""Lightyear,"" the origin story of ""Toy Story"" hero Buzz Lightyear. The movie brought in an earthbound $226.7 million in global ticket sales, a fraction of the $1 billion take for 2019's ""Toy Story 4.""""Judging Pixar on the recent past, history would not be kind,"" said SVB MoffettNathanson media analyst Michael Nathanson.The director and producer of ""Lightyear"" were laid off last month, Reuters first reported, as parent company Walt Disney Co shed 7,000 jobs across the company in a cost-cutting effort.""Elemental"" director Peter Sohn acknowledged he feels pressure to deliver a box-office hit, particularly since his movie is among the few summer titles based on an original story. The film was inspired by Sohn's appreciation for his Korean immigrant parents, a theme he hopes will resonate with audiences. ""This whole film was made to connect, and we hope it does,"" Sohn said in an interview with Reuters Television.Meanwhile, rival studios are riding high with animated films.Comcast Corp's Universal Pictures raked in $1.3 billion in worldwide ticket sales with its video-game adaptation, ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie,"" and Sony Pictures Animation struck box-office gold with Spider-Man, one of Disney’s own characters.Story continues“It used to be that when a Pixar film was coming out, it could be an original title that didn't even need to be based on pre-existing (characters),"" said Box Office Pro senior analyst Shawn Robbins, ""and it could still open like a mini-blockbuster, if not a full-fledged blockbuster.""""I think that's changed now, especially because there's more competition,"" Robbins added.Pixar had no comment.The pandemic, and former Disney Chief Executive Bob Chapek’s response, dealt Pixar a double whammy.The COVID-19 outbreak undercut the theatrical run of March 2020 release ""Onward,"" which brought in an underwhelming $146.2 million worldwide. Pixar's ""Soul"" in December 2020, ""Luca"" in June 2021 and ""Turning Red"" in March 2022 all debuted on the Disney+ streaming service in the U.S.Disney said the direct-to-home strategy boosted sign-ups for Disney+ and put the movies in front of large audiences sheltering at home. ""Turning Red"" remains the most-watched film on Disney+ globally during its first three days.But the move dealt a blow to creatives who had hoped their films would be seen on the big screen, according to one Pixar director who spoke on condition of anonymity.""Elemental"" is set in Element City, where Fire, Water, Earth and Air characters live together. An unexpected friendship between Fire and Water borrows from director Sohn’s relationship with his Italian-American wife. Sohn initially hid the relationship from his parents. ""My grandmother’s dying words were literally, ‘Marry Korean!'"" Sohn recounted.Reviews of ""Elemental"" were mixed after it debuted at the Cannes Film Festival but have turned more positive. As of Monday, 76% of film critics gave the movie a positive review, according to the Rotten Tomatoes website.That message of racial harmony reaches theaters as a segment of the country has branded Disney's themes as too ""woke"" - being alert to racial and social injustice - posing a potential box-office challenge.Sohn said the movie, which was in the works for seven years, was inspired by a desire to honor his parents' experiences.""They came from another country, coming here with nothing, and made a life for us,"" he said.

A pioneer and heroine, Pat volunteered and joined the Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service (WAVES) program to perform shore-based duties for the U.S. Navy after U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Public Law 689 in 1942.LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (June 7, 2023) – World War II and U.S. Navy veteran, Dorothy “Pat” Rudd, visits Country Bear Jamboree in Frontierland at Magic Kingdom Theme Park at Walt Disney World Resort. Pat’s late husband and U.S. Navy veteran, Gerald Rudd, helped with the construction of Frontierland prior to the park opening on Oct. 1, 1971. (Photo credit: Disney)The law established the Women's Reserve as a branch of the Naval Reserve and authorized women to serve in the U.S. Navy for the duration of the war, plus six months. Stationed in Washington, DC, Pat became one of the first 200 WAVES to be deployed overseas – in her case, to the then Territory of Hawai'i. There, she served as an educator, teaching service members how to read and write and helped in the hospital attending the wounded.Pat met her husband, Gerald, at Pearl Harbor, who was active-duty Navy himself and were married for 71 years. Prior to participating in the Flag Retreat ceremony, Pat visited Frontierland in Magic Kingdom, which her late husband helped bring to reality. Gerald was part of the construction team that built the structures in this area of the theme park, as well as parts of EPCOT and the original resort hotels of Walt Disney World.""I was really happy the buildings he helped build in Frontierland are still there,"" said Rudd. ""I'm proud of him and that his work has brought so much joy to so many people here at Disney.""Honoring Pat during the day's events were members of Disney SALUTE, a veteran employee resource group, including Susan Finnigan, Lead Project Manager for Disney marketing and a U.S. Marine Corps veteran.""Pat's unwavering spirit and commitment to duty are an inspiration to fellow servicewomen,"" said Finnigan. ""It was an honor to be able to join my fellow veterans here at Disney to help celebrate a trailblazer and hero like Pat.""Story continuesOn June 12, 1948, three years after the end of World War II and Rudd's naval service, President Harry S. Truman signed the Women's Armed Services Integration Act into law, officially opening the door for women to serve as full, permanent members of all branches of the U.S. Armed Forces. The day is recognized annually as Women Veterans Day.Disney has long honored those who serve in the U.S. Armed Forces throughout the 100-year history of The Walt Disney Company. That tradition continues today with events like the daily Flag Retreat ceremony at Magic Kingdom, where an active-duty military member or veteran is selected from the park's daily visitors to be honored.Disney is honored to offer a heartfelt tribute to the unsung female military heroes of the past and all those who continue to serve today.About Disney Parks, Experiences and Products Disney Parks, Experiences and Products brings the magic of The Walt Disney Company's powerful brands and franchises — including Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, ESPN, Twentieth Century Studios and National Geographic — into the daily lives of families and fans around the world to create magical memories that last a lifetime.When Walt Disney opened Disneyland in Anaheim, California, on July 17, 1955, he created a unique destination built around storytelling and immersive experiences, ushering in a new era of family entertainment.

Entering through the Gift Shop: Attacks on Commerce finds that commerce remains the most targeted web attack vertical, accounting for over 14 billion (34 percent) of observed incursions.Akamai Technologies, Inc. logo (PRNewsfoto/Akamai Technologies, Inc.)As commerce organizations increasingly rely on web applications to drive customer experience and online conversions, adversaries target vulnerabilities, design flaws or security gaps to abuse web-facing servers and applications. Retail remains the most targeted subvertical within commerce, accounting for 62 percent of attacks on the sector. This impacts both organizations and consumers.The new Akamai research also finds that Local File Inclusion (LFI) attacks - that involve attackers exploiting vulnerabilities in how a web server stores or controls access to its files - increased by more than 300 percent between Q3 2021 and Q3 2022 and are now the most common attack vector used against the commerce sector. Just a few years ago, SQL injection (SQLi) was the most common incursion. This indicates an attack trend toward remote code execution and hackers leveraging LFI vulnerabilities to gain a foothold for data exfiltration.Other key findings of Entering through the Gift Shop: Attacks on Commerce include:Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI), and Server-Side Code Injection (SSCI) have emerged as critical attack techniques to defend against and pose great threats to commerce organizations.Half of the JavaScript that the commerce vertical uses comes from third-party vendors, and this introduces the increased threat of client-side attacks like web skimming and Magecart attacks. It is critical to put mechanisms in place that detect these attacks to remain compliant with new PCI DSS 4.0 requirements.Attackers could also abuse security gaps in scripts, enabling a pathway for criminals to infiltrate bigger, lucrative targets in supply chains.Akamai observed malicious bot requests surpassing 5 trillion events in 15 months, with assaults against commerce customers proliferating via credential stuffing attacks that can lead to fraud.Over 30 percent of phishing campaigns targeted commerce brands in Q1 2023.Attacks in Europe, Middle East, Asia and Africa (EMEA) are heavily skewed toward the retail subvertical, which accounts for 96.5 percent of attacks vs 3.3 percent for hotel and travel.Commerce is the second most frequently targeted web attack vertical in Asia-Pacific and Japan (APJ) at over 20 percent.Story continues""The commerce sector is characterized by a complex ecosystem that leverages web applications and APIs to drive business,"" said Rupesh Chokshi, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Application Security at Akamai. ""Entering through the Gift Shop: Attacks on Commerce examines various attack types that commerce organizations and their customers face. We highlight elements such as web applications, bots, phishing and the use of third-party scripts to gauge what is happening in this sector and to help both cybersecurity leaders and practitioners understand the critical threat trends impacting this industry.""For additional information, the security community can access, engage with, and learn from Akamai's threat researchers by visiting the Akamai Security Hub and following the team on Twitter at @Akamai_Research.About AkamaiAkamai powers and protects life online.

The ride-hailing company intends to launch the above service in the cities of Boston and Toronto.The service allows people to borrow vehicles from private car owners for an agreed number of hours or days. Uber’s car-sharing service is currently available in Australia. The service was launched in 2022, post-acquisition of the peer-to-peer car-sharing network Car Next Door.Car Next Door was founded in Australia in 2013. The objective was to do away with the “one person, one car” mentality apart from reducing the negative effects like air pollution. The car-sharing service, apart from generating revenues for car owners, makes it easy for any car to be turned into a shared car. Following its takeover, Car Next Door came to be known as Uber Carshare.Ever since its inception in 2013, more than 1.1 million trips have been booked with Car Next Door. Following its takeover by Uber, the platform has grown even further and changed the mindset of multiple Aussies regarding the functioning of car rentals.Given the success of the model, the decision to make it available in North America is a prudent move by Uber’s management. On being launched in the two cities, the car-sharing service is likely to augment Uber’s revenue stream significantly.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksUBER currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the same industry are Shopify SHOP and Akamai Technologies AKAM. Each stock is currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

(AKAM) is looking like an interesting pick from a technical perspective, as the company reached a key level of support. Recently, AKAM's 50-day simple moving average crossed above its 200-day simple moving average, known as a ""golden cross.""A golden cross is a technical chart pattern that can signify a potential bullish breakout. It's formed from a crossover involving a security's short-term moving average breaking above a longer-term moving average, with the most common moving averages being the 50-day and the 200-day, since bigger time periods tend to form stronger breakouts.A successful golden cross event has three stages. It first begins when a stock's price on the decline bottoms out. Then, its shorter moving average crosses above its longer moving average, triggering a positive trend reversal. The third and final phase occurs when the stock maintains its upward momentum.A golden cross contrasts with a death cross, another widely-followed chart pattern that suggests bearish momentum could be on the horizon.AKAM could be on the verge of a breakout after moving 8.4% higher over the last four weeks. Plus, the company is currently a #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank.Once investors consider AKAM's positive earnings outlook for the current quarter, the bullish case only solidifies. No earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months compared to 8 revisions higher, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased as well.With a winning combination of earnings estimate revisions and hitting a key technical level, investors should keep their eye on AKAM for more gains in the near future.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Yahoo Finance Live breaks down some of the trending stories of the day.Video Transcript- Let's take a look at some of those individual movers. First up, Illumina shares, gaining today, closing up just shy of 4%. The company, announcing that its CEO will be stepping down this coming after a lengthy proxy battle with activist investor Carl Icahn. Now Illumina saying that they will quote continue to execute on the company's goals while searching for a new CEO. And Diane, the Street was pretty upbeat just about this announcement that was made a new person potentially in charge here. But they do name that permanent CEO, the Street looking at that as a positive.- Yeah, they are looking at it as a positive. We know this has been in play for months, Carl Icahn kind of pushing for this change. Interestingly enough, he's going to stay on as an advisor through July. So I found that interesting, and he put out a note on LinkedIn over the weekend, so kind of making it seem like it was his choice. But we know this has been pushed forward for a while. And again, being received well on Wall Street. Meantime, we've got some deal news we're watching today hitting the NASDAQ. That stock down more than 11% on news that it will be acquiring Adenza, a financial software company for $10 and 1/2 billion.It's a combined cash and stock deal. Adenza make software for big banks and brokerages in the areas of risk management trading, trade processing. Now, the deal for the NASDAQ is the biggest in its history comes as the NASDAQ tries to carve out an even stronger tech footprint, but not surprising to see shares of NASDAQ getting hit today, because typically you see that in acquisition.- Yeah, and I think there's move here from NASDAQ, not necessarily a surprise. We've heard from CEO Dean Freeman over the last several years saying that the company is looking to diversify its business, not be so reliant on their exchange business.

And this is also not just for shares of Tesla. You saw a blank charge part climb with regard to this move them pairing up with Tesla. And I mean, just Elon Musk still continuing to respond to naysayers right when you think about these kind of deals that are happening within this space and being really that main point of charging connectivity for the EV space.- Yes.

This takes the annual payment to 2.5% of the current stock price, which is about average for the industry. View our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive Colgate-Palmolive's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsWe aren't too impressed by dividend yields unless they can be sustained over time. Before making this announcement, Colgate-Palmolive's dividend was higher than its profits, but the free cash flows quite comfortably covered it. Healthy cash flows are always a positive sign, especially when they quite easily cover the dividend.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 100.2% over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 51%, which would make us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend, despite the levels currently being quite high.historic-dividendColgate-Palmolive Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $1.24 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $1.92. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 4.5% per annum over that time. Slow and steady dividend growth might not sound that exciting, but dividends have been stable for ten years, which we think makes this a fairly attractive offer.Colgate-Palmolive May Find It Hard To Grow The DividendThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. However, things aren't all that rosy. Colgate-Palmolive has seen earnings per share falling at 4.1% per year over the last five years. Declining earnings will inevitably lead to the company paying a lower dividend in line with lower profits. However, the next year is actually looking up, with earnings set to rise. We would just wait until it becomes a pattern before getting too excited.Story continuesOur Thoughts On Colgate-Palmolive's DividendOverall, this is probably not a great income stock, even though the dividend is being raised at the moment. The company has been bring in plenty of cash to cover the dividend, but we don't necessarily think that makes it a great dividend stock. We would be a touch cautious of relying on this stock primarily for the dividend income.Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

These networking upgrades will enable the multiple departments in UTokyo to deliver a high-speed wireless network infrastructure to its 48,000 students and faculty actively engaged in learning and research across 10 faculties and 15 graduate schools.Established in 1877 as Japan's first national university, UTokyo has charted an illustrious history as one of the world’s leading universities, having produced 16 prime ministers, 13 Nobel Prize winners and five astronauts among its alumni.In alignment with the Japanese government’s 10-trillion-yen fund to develop research universities that meet the highest global standards, the university announced UTokyo Compass, a set of guiding principles designed to foster world-class innovation and excellence in education and research, by embracing dialogue, diverse perspectives and experiences in 2022.The UTokyo Compass initiative has prompted the university to enhance its Information and Communications Technology (ICT) strategy. This entails a comprehensive reassessment of the network infrastructure and the transformation of its operations to facilitate active communication throughout all campus locations.Embarking on this transformative journey, UTokyo established a cross-organizational UTokyo Wi-Fi Task Force focused on enhancing the wireless network infrastructure, reinforcing its pivotal role in improving students' and faculty's educational and research experiences. The team placed significant emphasis on building a reliable, secure, and high-performing wireless network capable of accommodating large numbers of users, with multiple devices per person on each campus.Story continuesA major focus was implementing a network solution that offered the team from different departments consolidated management across all departments while giving them appropriate management authority. This objective would be achieved through a single dashboard, enabling a unified view of the entire network, as well as the ability to observe and visualize faults and user experience. Juniper's solutions powered by Mist AI, with a successful track record in local and global implementations, proved to be the ideal choice, meeting all the required criteria for this transformative initiative.The deployment of Juniper® AP32 Wireless Access Points across its three main campuses in Hongō, Komaba and Kashiwa, has successfully streamlined network management and operations for the different departments and provided them with a unified view of the entire network on a single dashboard powered by Mist AI®. The team also utilizes the capabilities of the Juniper Mist™ rich API-centric architecture, which visualizes the necessary data for each site to improve operational efficiency.Since implementing a Juniper powered wireless network, the experience for the school's team and its students has significantly improved. Additionally, the network can seamlessly support the simultaneous connection of approximately 18,000 devices during peak usage period. The expansion is being carried out progressively, aiming to cover all campuses.As UTokyo looks towards the future, it is actively exploring the potential integration of Mist AI throughout its entire network, aiming to establish it as a fundamental component of its IT infrastructure.Supporting Quotes:""Since its establishment, the University of Tokyo has remained dedicated to providing a world-class research and education platform. The network plays a vital role in facilitating access to crucial resources and active communication for our students and faculty. An efficient and user-friendly network is equally important, enabling our team to address issues that may arise swiftly. With a Juniper powered wireless network, we can empower everyone within our campus to experience the best in connectivity and support, amplifying their potential for exceptional achievements.""- Junji Tamatsukuri, Associate Professor, Deputy General Manager, Information Systems Division, The University of Tokyo""The University of Tokyo is home to Japan's top medicine, law and engineering schools, and is a vital cornerstone of the country’s innovation-driven economy. It is an honor to partner with Japan’s leading university on the next phase of their ICT transformation journey. We recognized their need for a wireless network that offers consolidated management and visibility into the Wi-Fi user experience across departments and campuses. With an experience-first network, we can provide a seamless and more connected campus experience for their staff and students.

Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra.Story continuesSafra Ada CatzThanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. As you can see, Q4 was another fantastic quarter and the end of a great year. But before I get to the numbers, I'd like to go over our journey to get here. Three years ago, I shared with you that our own business transformation had reached a crossover point as our fast-growing businesses had eclipsed the size of our declining businesses.And as a result, this would inevitably drive revenue growth acceleration going forward. Now I don't blame you for not believing me at the time, fiscal year 2020 growth was 0. Well, as you can see, this has played out with organic revenue growth accelerating significantly, and that's despite the closure of our nearly $0.5 billion Russia business.Since fiscal year 2020 our strategic back-office SaaS business has more than doubled in size and consumption of our Gen 2 Cloud Infrastructure service is now 7x larger. And while competitors have seen their growth rates drop precipitously over the last year, our cloud infrastructure growth rate has essentially doubled from last year to 77% this quarter and with Gen 2 OCI growth even higher. And we're far from done. In fact, I just told my team, I think we're at about the middle of the beginning. Looking ahead, I see even more growth opportunities that should help power future growth acceleration in the future. We remain committed to the fiscal year 2026 target that we shared with you last fall at our Financial Analyst Meeting and our exploding AI demand leaves us significant upside. Our momentum has been driven by 2 fundamental differences from our competition, one, highly differentiated technology; and two, a much better customer experience. Firstly, our cloud applications are very popular with a growing base of customers in part because we are the most modern, comprehensive and innovative set of apps across back office, CX and industry applications. We implemented AI machine learning capabilities years before anyone was talking about it, and it helps our customers run their businesses every day. To complete the picture, we can serve customers of any size around the world from small businesses on NetSuite to global enterprise on Fusion in all industries, having the best cloud application technology has helped us grow the business to $11 billion in SaaS revenue while expanding gross margins.On the infrastructure side, we're seeing more and more media articles reporting on the unique capabilities of OCI and our database technologies. Larry will explain our unique differentiation in a moment. But the result is that customers are choosing to run on Oracle Infrastructure for all their requirements. Be they new services like AI training or services we're known for like database and Java? To complement the technology, we've changed our culture such that we are totally focused on our customers' success.That partnership spirit starts with engineering as we work hand in hand with companies as they try out our technology and continue all the way through their success with us. There's no question that this close partnership with our customers has led to our success. As part of that, we've also created an organization called Customer Success Services, or CSS. This group ensures the customers get the most value from their Oracle purchases from planning to activation, to implementation, to support to anything else they need to succeed.We think this unique approach, which customers already tell us they love ultimately drives overall customer satisfaction, and that results in higher renewal rates, expansion rates and referencing. Now I'll turn to Q4. As always, I'll discuss financials using constant currency growth rates and also provide a full picture -- and also provide a full picture. I'm going to share with you results including and some excluding Cerner, so that you have it all. Total cloud revenues, SaaS plus IaaS was $4.4 billion, up 55% with IaaS revenue of $1.4 billion, up 77% and SaaS revenue of $3 billion, up 47%. Excluding Cerner, total cloud revenue SaaS plus IaaS was up more than 33% at $3.8 billion. Total cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter was $9.4 billion, up 25%, driven again by our strategic cloud applications, autonomous database and our Gen 2 OCI. Application subscription revenues, which include product support were $4.4 billion, up 37%. Application-specific revenues, including support, but excluding Cerner were $3.4 billion, up 11%.SaaS cloud revenue, again, excluding Cerner was $2.4 billion, was up 17%. Our strategic back-office SaaS applications now have an annualized revenue of $6.6 billion and grew 24%, including Fusion ERP up 28% and NetSuite ERP up 24%. Together, our strategic back-office businesses are now larger and have grown faster than our local competitor for 4 straight years. Infrastructure subscription revenues, which also include support, were $5 billion, up 15%. As mentioned already, infrastructure cloud services revenue was up 77%. Excluding legacy hosting services, infrastructure, cloud services revenue grew 89% with an annualized revenue of $5.2 billion, including OCI consumption revenue, which was up 112%, Cloud at Customer consumption revenue was up 60% and autonomous database was up 47%.Database subscription revenues, which include database support, were up 6%, highlighted by cloud database services, which were up 41%. As on-premise databases migrate to the cloud and cloud and customer, we expect these cloud database services will be a third leg of revenue growth and revenue growth acceleration, alongside back-office SaaS and Gen 2 OCI cloud services.Software license revenues were $2.2 billion, down 14% following the 25% growth we saw a year ago in Q4. So all in, total revenues for the quarter, including Cerner's revenue contribution of $1.5 billion were $13.8 billion, up 18%.Shifting to margins. The gross margin percentage for cloud services and license support was 78% as a result of the mix between support and cloud. Last year, Oracle license support revenues with its mid-90s gross margins represented about 62% of cloud services and license support revenue. And now it's down to 53%. But this is happening because our cloud services are growing much, much faster than license support even as license support continues to grow. Most importantly, gross profit dollars of cloud services and license support grew 19% with Cerner, 10%, excluding Cerner in Q4.Additionally, I would note that IaaS gross margins improved substantially from last year, and I expect IaaS gross margins will continue to improve. We will -- while we have continued to build data center capacity, we've also seen our margins go higher as these new cloud regions fill up. Non-GAAP operating income was $6.2 billion, up 12% from last year. The operating margin was 44% as we continue to integrate Cerner as we drive Cerner profitability to Oracle standards and continue to benefit from economies of scale in the cloud, we will not only continue to grow operating income, but we will also grow the operating margin percentages.The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 9.2%, and the non-GAAP EPS was USD 1.47, up 8% in USD and 10% in constant currency. The GAAP EPS was $1.19. For the full fiscal year, total company revenue was $50 billion, up 22%, and excluding revenue, total revenue grew 7%. Total application subscriptions grew 35% and 10% excluding Cerner compared to 8% last year and total infrastructure grew 10% compared with 5% growth last year. Clearly, our revenue growth continued to accelerate again this year as investments into our cloud businesses are paying off. Total cloud services and license support revenue was $35.3 billion, up 21% and total cloud services by itself were up 50% to $15.9 billion, and excluding Cerner, total cloud services were up 29% to $13.6 billion and with revenue growth acceleration in both strategic back office cloud applications, which were up 27% for the year and cloud infrastructure services, which were up 63% for the year.Non-GAAP EPS was USD 5.12 , up 4% in USD and up 10% in constant currency. The full year operating margin percentage was 42%. At quarter end, we had nearly $10.2 billion in cash and marketable securities, and the short-term deferred revenue balance was $9 billion, up 9%.Operating cash flow for the quarter was up 42% at $5.6 billion, while free cash flow was up 46% at $3.7 billion. Now over the last 4 quarters, operating cash flow was $17.2 billion, up 80% from last year as we're now seeing cash flow benefits from our cloud transformation. With capital expenditures of $8.7 billion this year, free cash flow was $8.5 billion, up from $5 billion last year, and I expect that we will see very good results in our fiscal '24 free cash flow. The remaining performance obligations or RPO balance is $67.9 billion, up 47% in constant currency due to strong cloud bookings as well as Cerner. I would also note that organic RPO with 15% in constant currency as a result of our customers burning through their commitments at a heightened rate.I expect that you'll see this number run up as customers reload and new customers sign up. Approximately 49% of total RPO is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. CapEx was $1.9 billion in Q4 and $8.7 billion for fiscal year 2023 as we continue to build capacity for existing bookings and our customers' growing needs. Our investment strategy for adding capacity remains to build many, many identical cloud region. Our starting point is smaller, which allows us to go where competitors cannot and this continues to be an advantage for us. Given the demand we have and see in our pipeline, I've increased our CapEx projection, and I now expect the fiscal 2024 will be similar to this year's CapEx. I also expect our Gen 2 OCI business will have another excellent year of revenue growth as existing centers fill up and new centers come online.As always, we remain careful to pace our investments appropriately and in line with booking trends, which is why our gross margins are up in our cloud. We now have 42 public cloud regions around the world with another 7 being built, 12 of these public regions interconnect with Microsoft Azure, giving customers true multi-cloud capabilities.We have many, many cloud customer implementations, 10 dedicated regions and 9 more plans. And lastly, we have 9 national security regions live with immense demand for more. As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and the dividend.This year -- this fiscal year, we repurchased 17 million shares for a total of $1.3 billion. In addition, we paid out dividends of $3.7 billion over the last 12 months as the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share.Now to guidance. And as I've said before, our fundamental principle is to grow EPS while substantially increasing cloud revenue growth. Let me turn to my guidance for Q1, which I'll review on a non-GAAP basis, like everything else.If currency exchange rates remain as they are now, currency should have a 0% to 1% positive effect on total revenue and a $0.01 positive effect on EPS in Q1. However, actual currency impact may be different. Total revenues for Q1, including Cerner, are expected to grow from 7% to 9% in constant currency and are expected to grow from 8% to 10% in USD at today's exchange rate.Additional upside depends on how fast we can put out even more capacity to our customers. Total cloud revenue, again, excluding Cerner is expected to grow from 28% to 30% in constant currency and USD 29 to USD 31. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 8% to 12% and be between $1.11 and $1.15 in constant currency.Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 9% to 13% and be between USD 1.12 and USD 1.16. My EPS guidance assumes a base tax rate of 19.5%. However, as you see nearly every quarter, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates to vary. Now before I finish, let me also give you some initial thoughts on fiscal year 2024. As I described, and Larry will elaborate in depth. We are seeing unprecedented demand for our cloud services and especially our AI services. As a result, I expect cloud revenue, excluding Cerner, will continue growing at least similar rates to what we experienced in fiscal 2023 even though our base is much bigger and may be higher.As our high-growth cloud revenues are becoming a larger, larger portion of total revenue, we are seeing an acceleration of our total revenue growth. I expect this trend will continue in fiscal 2024. And of course, we also expect to deliver a higher non-GAAP operating margin percentage this coming year as well.Okay. Before I hand off to Larry, I want to take a moment to thank our customers for making fiscal year 2023, such an enormous success. You've been wonderful partners, and we thank you for your trust in us. And I want to thank our employees for being focused on advancing our customers' missions so spectacularly. Some of you are new, and many of you have been with us for years. In fact, even decades, and I think you all see that our best days are in fact ahead of us. Thank you for your loyalty and for your incredibly hard work. And thank you, Larry, our CTO, our Chairman and our Founder, for leading with brilliance determination and vision and allowing us to all be part of this incredible journey, which is just getting started. So thanks, Larry. And with that, I'll turn it over to you for your comments.Lawrence J. EllisonThank you, Safra. The hardware and software and Oracle's Gen 2 Cloud is fundamentally different than other hyperscalers clouds. The CPUs and GPUs we rent to customers are interconnected using an ultra-high-performance RDMA network, plus a dedicated set of cloud control computers that manage security and data privacy. Oracle's unique set of hardware and software building blocks enable our Gen 2 Cloud to deliver much higher performance than any of our cloud competitors. And in the cloud, since you pay by the minute, if you run twice as fast and we do, you pay half as much. What is especially interesting in today's world is that all of Oracle's cloud data centers have a high bandwidth, low latency RDMA network. That is perfectly optimized for building the large-scale GPU clusters that are used to train generative large language models. And NVIDIA themselves are doing AI development in the Oracle Gen 2 Cloud. And we are partnering with NVIDIA to build the world's largest high-performance computer and AI computer with 16,000 GPUs.The extreme high performance and related cost savings of running generative AI workloads in our Gen 2 Cloud has made Oracle the #1 choice among cutting-edge AI development companies, including MosaicML, Adept AI, Cohere, Model Lab, Character, hyperreal, [SliceX,] vector space bio, Falcon Ray, Respeecher, Altair, InfoWorld, Twelve Labs, Latent Space, plus many, many others. In the aggregate, our generative AI cloud customers have recently signed contracts to purchase more than $2 billion of capacity in Oracle's Gen 2 Cloud. One last thing, in partnership with Cohere, Oracle is launching a generative AI cloud service for Enterprise customers. This new service protects the privacy of our Enterprise customers' training data, enabling those customers to safely use their own private data to train their own private specialized large language models.Oracle's obligation development teams were early adopters of this new AI cloud service. We used our own private data to improve and extend the training of existing Cohere large language models. This supplementary training resulted in 2 new specialized large language models, one for medical professionals and one for first responders.Specialized large language models will be instrumental in helping highly trained professionals use their precious time more efficiently. As I said, Cohere and Oracle are working together to make it very, very easy for Enterprise customers to train their own specialized large language models while protecting the privacy of their training data.Over the next few years, lots of companies are going to train their own specialized large language models. Our partner Cohere is also using the Oracle Gen 2 Cloud for training their own large language models. In health care alone, specialized large language models will speed the discovery of new life-saving drugs, improve the quality of patient care and increase access to health care by lowering costs, a technology revolution is dawning. Back to you, Safra.Safra Ada CatzI think we're going to take some questions. Ken?Ken BondYes. Thank you, Safra. Thank you, Larry. Lisa, if we could please prepare the audience for Q&amp;A.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from John DiFucci with Guggenheim.John Stephen DiFucciMy question first, I think it's mainly for Safra, but maybe Larry has some thoughts too. It's somewhat surprising to see the acceleration across all your cloud businesses when others, whether that the other hyperscalers or even other cloud-based vendors are seeing just the opposite effects in this environment today, in today's environment, and that's important. We get the better performance at a lower price. That makes a lot of sense. But at least in I've been around quite a while, I guess. And usually, in tough environments, we see people just freeze. But that's not what's happening here. So the question in addition to what I just said, better performance at lower price. Why? Is there anything else outside of like Oracle even that would -- who would choose your cloud business accelerating when other pretty good companies are doing just the opposite?Safra Ada CatzLet me take a start at it and Larry, you add in here. First of all, the OCI -- the fact that OCI is just growing and accelerating is because customers want to spend less, and they also need to do more. They need to stay competitive, they need to stay agile.And so our technology, whether it's our application which allow them to spend a lot less and make better decisions running their business. So that's very, very natural. So our Fusion, there's just so many things about Fusion that is -- that are so compelling, it costs less, it just helps them run their business. But then you go to OCI, where some of these customers are coming from our competitors.And as Larry said, Imagine -- Larry talked about the workload being twice as fast on OCI. But imagine it's 10x as fast or 100x faster or as it is common in some cases, 1,000x faster. So imagine what that bill looks like. So we have compelling technology at a much lower price, and that's without a doubt, causing our customers to move to us more quickly. I don't know, Larry, if you want to add into that.Lawrence J. EllisonWell, I'm just going to be a little more specific because Safra says -- I said -- if we run twice as fast we cost twice as much. But no, we do cost half as much, half as much. We run twice as fast, we cost half as much. But sometimes, we do run a lot more than twice as fast. And we cost a lot less than half as much. We announced a new database, the new version of MySQL with a fast query processor called HeatWave. And we have customers moving from Amazon Aurora, where they're experiencing 1,000x speed versus Aurora. We're 1,000x faster in query processing than Amazon version of MySQL, an open source database that we added a fast query processor to.We're much, much cheaper. And that's one example. In a lot of cases, it's much more than 2:1. We can build GPUs that other people can't build because we have a fast network. We use this very fast RDMA network, and we started with that. In our Gen 2 Cloud, we had nothing but our entire network was a super fast network, which means most of the applications, most of the things you run in the Oracle Cloud are going to be much faster than our competitors' clouds because they don't use that kind of network.So we have huge cost advantages, huge cost advantages across a broad portfolio of applications. Let me throw one thing. It costed one-tenths to implement Fusion ERP versus SAP's new ERP system with HANA. So the cost of implementing our applications are dramatically lower than our competitors. So we have a lot of people moving to the AWS to our cloud for infrastructure services, a lot of people continuing to move from SAP to Fusion.We're seeing that migration and we're taking a lot of market share from our competitors. That's why we're doing better, and they're not doing quite as well.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank.Brad Alan ZelnickGreat. And congrats on a strong finish to the year. Larry, Oracle is somewhat unique and being a leader in both infrastructure and applications. And when we look back, I don't know, maybe 5 years from now, how much of the generative AI opportunity will have been captured on the infrastructure side of your business versus within apps? And I'm not just thinking strategic back-office apps, I'm thinking front office, Cerner and all these verticals as well.Lawrence J. EllisonYes, absolutely. It's very hard to answer that question. A long time ago, said the biggest difference between -- the biggest strategic difference between Oracle's Cloud and everyone else's cloud, is actually not be our RDMA network. That's a technical difference. The biggest strategic difference is that we do both -- we use our infrastructure and build applications with it.So we learn a lot about how we can improve our infrastructure by building lots of applications, enterprise-scale applications on top of our infrastructure. So we have this continuous feedback loop. We're building applications, obtaining insights, making imprudence in our productivity.We have a new programming language. We are the -- we have a Java and we love Java. We use it a lot for building applications, but we have this other low-code application development tool called APEX, and we're now building a lot of our applications in APEX. And our productivity gains are, again, a factor of 10, and we build the applications in 1/10 at a time or 1/10 the amount of people or at 1/10 the cost. But these are not typical low-code applications. These are applications that can scale to millions of users and all over the world.So those low-code applications are for small projects. We use them for application we've rolled out globally. And we've made our underlying infrastructure, the program -- the APEX development environment, the underlying APEX database, which is the Oracle Autonomous Database has made our application developers dramatically more productive. It's one of the reasons why we bought into the idea that we could rewrite a whole suite of medical applications in a very, very short period of time that we could redo Cerner very, very quickly because of these underlying tools.Let me close with one last thing. We're -- again, we use AI technology to make our database better and it's an autonomous database. You don't need DBAs. It recovers itself. It updates itself. It adds more space. It is -- it really is a self-driving database. We've use AI technology to do that. We've used AI technology throughout our cloud, where our cloud is self-healing.We repair bugs while the cloud is running. We have an autonomous Linux operating system that's different than all of the other Linuxes. You can patch it online, it patches itself online. It repairs itself online. So again, by being in those 2 businesses, applications and underlying infrastructure.We, again, use our infrastructure and make it better to make our applications better. And we gain insights as what we need to do with our -- what we need to add to our infrastructure to make the applications better. So infrastructures make the applications better, applications make the infrastructure better. We're the only company with that continuous feedback loop. And I think it gives us a huge competitive advantage in technology. It's why we have technologies that other people don't have.OperatorTake our next question from Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho.Sitikantha PanigrahiCongrats on a great quarter. I want to dig into the application part of the business, very impressive SaaS growth, especially in Fusion apps and cloud ERP in this macro environment. So what are you hearing from your customer in terms of migrating to the SaaS application and what's driving that? And also the cloud world last year, you talked about the opportunity in combining horizontal application with vertical offering. So how is that helping SaaS growth?Safra Ada CatzOkay. Well, I will tell you that there's no question, our secret weapon is the fact that we have vertical applications also. Many of our customers end up wanting to buy a vertical application and fusion together and it's industry by industry.We will be posting online probably some of our wins for the quarter, but what you'll see is when we have existing customers in a segment and a vertical application in that we truly are, without a doubt, the most popular whether it's health care with all of our existing customers, whether they be Cerner customers, the fact that we have ERP and -- the ERP and HCM, SCM, all of our horizontal application, CX, as well as the vertical applications, it makes us very tough to beat. And new health care wins are going to be listed many, many, many go-lives, the same in financial services, retail, hospitality, these whole segments end up wanting to buy their entire solution from us.And that really makes us also very sensitive to their needs, and we can fill them much better. So that's been a big winner for us. And I will tell you that our customers also when they move from on-premise, they realize that they're moving into the 21st century with a much better system but also a much lower cost system that also is kept current every 90 days, new capabilities become available. They'll never have to do that big implementation every 5 years like some of the older companies who say their cloud, but aren't actually cloud, they're just hosted. So our products are just so differentiated all around that there -- we're just building momentum around the world.Lawrence J. EllisonLet me just add one example to Safra's comments, which I think are right on. But -- there's an interesting example. We -- everyone knows, we compete with Workday in HCM or HR, whatever. When we bought Cerner, we decided that we were going to take our HCM system, our HR system, and specialize it, add features specifically for the health care industry.Now it turns out managing a workforce in a hospital is very complex because the nurses might be -- have private patients at home that they're seeing. They might work for 2 or 3 different hospitals. They might do some work in clinics as well. So scheduling these people who have multiple jobs. Doctors may have teaching assignments in universities. They -- obviously, they travel, and they also -- they have their own office hours, they have a private practice in addition to working at the hospital. Scheduling these professionals is very, very tricky. Recruiting the professionals is very, very tricky. Paying them when you're working 3 days a week, 1 away, 2 days, the next week, 6 days the following week,; paying them can be very complex.So we have had a major effort in our HCM system, the Oracle Fusion HCM system and adding all the features that hospitals need to manage their professional staff. Now there's no way we would have done that unless we had our focus in the health care industry.So we not only have all the Cerner health care apps for hospitals. We've specialized our ERP system for hospitals. We specialized our HCM. We're managing the hospital workforce. We've done a bunch of things around the health care industry. We are -- one of the things we want to do is we're the largest provider of clinical trial software. We -- but the clinical -- the results of the clinical trial goes to a government regulator. And we're now working with the government regulators to develop the software that allows them to take the clinical trial output in digital form and get it through the regulatory process much faster at a much lower cost.So we're looking at the entire health care ecosystem and trying to automate both sides of the transaction, the pharmaceutical company that's designing the drug, the hospitals that are testing the drug and the regulators that are approving the drug, should all be digitized, and we are well on our way to doing that because of our investment in Cerner. And now what it's blossomed into an investment across the entire health care ecosystem.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.Raimo LenschowCould I switch gear a little bit, a question for Safra. Safra, we now have Cerner as part of Oracle. Where are we on the cost on the synergy capture and cost takeout? And so are we -- do you see we were done there? Or are we kind of still at the beginning of a journey?Safra Ada CatzThank you. I actually feel like we're still at the beginning, if you want to know the truth. We wanted to stabilize the operation. We definitely didn't want to risk breaking anything. You will be seeing some more significant changes, and we have legal entity combination imminently, and that actually gives us a lot more flexibility regarding the way we operate the business. And we are just at the very beginning of it. Their margins are nowhere close to the way we run our company.And we are right at the -- I'd say we're at the beginning-ish sort of at the beginning of the middle at most. We've got a long way to go on just operationally, and we've got a lot of work going on, on the development side as we bring our technical capabilities into the product and move them into the Oracle Cloud, there are a lot of savings as we do that also.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research.Mark L. MoerdlerCongratulations on the quarter and, frankly, on the guidance. I'd like to get a better understanding about the underpinning of the OCI Gen 2 business. Specifically, can you give us some color on the customer concentration, industry concentration, both in the existing customer base as well as the pipeline and how you think that's going to change over time?Safra Ada CatzI don't know, Larry, if you want to take a stab at it. The reality is that our customers run from very small to very large. As a general matter, we've -- as a general matter, we are a small percentage of their IT costs when they get started and sometimes a small percentage of their cloud spending. And as they try us out, they move larger percentages of their business off of other clouds or from on-premise. We're at the very beginning of this movement, especially on the database side as more and more of our customers -- our big customers often have cloud customer or dedicated regions is sort of their ultimate goal for their most critical database workloads where the absolute beginning of that with most of our customers. With -- it's basically what we find is if you give us a chance, it is so much better, so much more cost effective, of course, so much more secure that customers very quickly realize how advantageous it is to move.It's all industries. Many -- as you -- some of you know, auto companies are doing their simulations with us. It's really -- it's across industries, across sizes. It's very, very diversified. Larry, I don't know if you have additional comments.Lawrence J. EllisonYes. I'll just like maybe the most interesting industry that's adopting the Oracle Cloud are people who are in the technology business. So the -- a lot of our customers are I mean, their business -- I mean, Zoom in the early day, Oracle. It wasn't long ago, we were talking about Zoom and still very excited about Zoom. And they came to us, one of our earliest very, very large customers.And a lot of their business is just running an app, if you will, an application on the cloud. And a huge amount of their expense is running that application in the cloud and doing it efficiently. And where we're most obvious, I mean NVIDIA is an extraordinary company, but -- Cohere is a great company.But a lot of their expense is running the AI training in the cloud. And when it's that much of your expense having -- if we're a lot faster, they do a lot of due diligence about the technology. The -- and it became very apparent. A lot of the early adopters, if you will, and this is -- we're still in the early stages. A lot of the early adopters at scale of the Oracle Cloud were highly technical companies like a Zoom or an NVIDIA, and I can name a bunch of others or a highly technical industry like phone companies, telecommunication companies where they see the advantages, not only -- by the way, the performance and cost advantages. Another thing that we're very proud of is we're -- because of our network we're highly reliable. And because of the autonomy, we're highly reliable. If -- for example, the Oracle Autonomous Database doesn't lose your data because you can't make a pilot. You usually use a lot of the data losses done is caused by pilot error. Well, with the Oracle Autonomous Database, there are no driver. The driver is the system. It's a self-driving database. So you can't make a human error that causes you to lose data. So it's very -- where a phone company has to be up 24 hours a day, where a bank really is not supposed to lose your data where a huge percentage of your expenses are your own cloud expenses, and you're a technology company delivering technology services from somebody else's cloud. All -- in those areas is where we've seen adoption of Oracle at scale.And the less technical companies are now beginning their journey of looking more closely at the Oracle Cloud. And when they do look closely, we compare very favorably with the other clouds.OperatorWe'll take the last question from Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI.Kirk MaterneJust a quick one for Safra, if I could. Safra, obviously, a very strong free cash flow quarter. We've gotten some questions from investors wondering about the CapEx this quarter, where you saw some efficiencies, how you're able to keep CapEx flat going into next year given the fact that you're going to seeing this great demand for OCI. Could you double-click on that a little bit for us?Safra Ada CatzYes. I mean this past year was a big CapEx number as compared to usual. And we put out a lot of capacity. It is getting filled up and getting used up. And I think we're getting real economies. In addition, one of the things you don't realize is that our underlying infrastructure -- for example, I'll give you one example, our underlying infrastructure becomes more and more efficient.Even under -- the best example actually is under Fusion as we've move to OCI, we are also moving to autonomous database serverless which, again, gives us added capacity. So we're only constantly, constantly becoming more efficient. Our original landing was 12 racks, we're moving to 10 racks to have all the services. We're just continuing to sort of miniaturize our capabilities and it's giving us enormous efficiencies and cost savings. So staying the same as this year. Again, if it just becomes overwhelming, it may go higher.But I think we've got it very much in hand. We've laid out a lot and this past year. And I think if we stay where we're at, we're going to be able to fit a lot more workloads in -- within that envelope straightforwardly.Ken BondThank you, Safra. Thank you, Kirk. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours on our Investor Relations website. Thank you for joining us on the call today. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Lisa for closing.OperatorThank you. And that does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.]"

(Nasdaq: MU), one of the world’s largest semiconductor companies and the only U.S.-based manufacturer of memory, today announced the Northwest University Semiconductor Network, a partnership focused on collectively developing the next generation of the U.S. semiconductor industry’s workforce. The network will drive foundational and emerging research to increase students’ opportunities for experiential learning across the semiconductor ecosystem, with equitable access for underrepresented students, including those in rural and tribal communities.The STEMM Opportunity Alliance (SOA) will hold its Northwest STEMM Summit: Achieving Equity and Excellence, hosted by Micron, in Boise today. At this summit, Erwin Gianchandani, National Science Foundation’s assistant director for technology, innovation and partnerships, and Travis York, SOA leader and director of inclusive STEMM ecosystems for equity and diversity at the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), will join Micron executives as they introduce the network, which includes 13 founding member institutions across six states.The SOA is a national initiative led by the AAAS, with support from the Doris Duke Foundation, more than a dozen funders and 110+ cross-sector partners that are focused on galvanizing stakeholders to build a STEMM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medicine) ecosystem rooted in equity, inclusion and scientific excellence. The SOA was launched at a White House summit in December 2022 alongside advisory council members, including April Arnzen, Micron senior vice president, chief people officer and president of the Micron Foundation. The SOA and Micron understand that diversity in STEMM is essential to excellence in the scientific ecosystem, which is critical for U.S. economic growth and competitiveness and necessary for building a better society that benefits all communities.Story continuesMicron and National Science Foundation (NSF) also announced today the next step in a previously disclosed $10 million partnership between the Micron Foundation and NSF. NSF will publish a Dear Colleague Letter with two NSF solicitations that are focused on educator equity and are aligned with the strategic vision laid out in the CHIPS and Science Act. The first of these solicitations, Research Experiences for Teachers (RET), looks to facilitate professional development of K-12 science teachers through research experience. And the second, the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce), addresses the critical need for recruiting, preparing and retaining highly effective elementary and secondary mathematics and science teachers in high-need school districts.“Partnerships between institutions of higher education, government and industry leaders like Micron are critical so that together, we can build an inclusive and robust talent pipeline equipped with the high-tech skills that will advance U.S. technology innovation and leadership,” Arnzen said. “Micron is proud to be expanding our university partnership model through the U.S., leveraging the regional proximity to our leading research and development center in Boise and reaching students that have been traditionally underrepresented in the semiconductor industry, including rural and tribal communities in the Northwest. Our partnership with NSF aims to increase diversity and equity among STEM professionals, helping more students from traditionally underrepresented groups see themselves in their educators, the STEM field and the semiconductor industry. We look forward to furthering the impact of Micron’s Northwest University Semiconductor Network and our NSF partnerships as we focus on building a workforce of the future.”Micron plans to invest approximately $15 billion through the end of the decade to construct a leading-edge memory manufacturing fab co-located with the company’s R&amp;D epicenter in Boise. This project will create over 17,000 new Idaho jobs, furthering the need for a diverse, highly-skilled workforce. To support the semiconductor industry at scale, Micron has prioritized building relationships with K-12 and higher education partners who can help train students in STEM disciplines, expand research in the broad field of semiconductors and retain a more diverse group of students as they complete their degrees.“Public-private partnerships help the U.S. stay competitive in key technology areas and grow access to high-wage, good-quality jobs in every part of the country,” Gianchandani said. “NSF is delighted to partner with Micron to catalyze new career pathways, including through practical experiences for learners of all backgrounds, ages and geographic locations. The new funding opportunity that we are releasing today will broaden participation in the semiconductor workforce and help create opportunities everywhere and unleash innovation anywhere.”“Both the Northwest University Semiconductor Network and the partnership between Micron and the NSF embody the kind of cross-sector and public-private collaboration necessary to achieving equity and excellence in STEMM,” York said. “Investing in the critical semiconductor industry and ensuring we have a diverse workforce that can meet the moment is paramount. SOA looks forward to continued work with our diverse group of partners to build a STEMM ecosystem that will maintain American competitiveness and better individual lives.”The founding partners of the Northwest University Semiconductor Network were identified based on their strong collective undergraduate and graduate programs in engineering and other STEM degrees, as well as on their vast R&amp;D expertise and hands-on learning opportunities for students. The network collectively offers access to teaching labs and cleanrooms, a strong foundation of collaboration across institutions, programs connecting to community colleges and strong diversity programs to increase equitable access to engineering education.The Northwest University Semiconductor Network will expand and prepare the next generation of talent through a framework centered on collaboration, innovation and problem-solving. Micron, in partnership with the network institutions and in alignment with the American Semiconductor Academy and the SEMI Foundation, will champion efforts to modernize and enhance curriculum by sharing best practices and industry-backed technical content, expanding experiential learning programs for greater access to cleanrooms and teaching labs, and bolstering research opportunities for students.“Boise State University is nationally recognized for innovative thinking, programming and partnerships that offer our students dynamic experiences that prepare them to not only contribute but lead when they enter Idaho’s workforce,” said President of Boise State University Marlene Tromp. “The Northwest University Semiconductor Network is an extraordinary opportunity to increase awareness and education in this important industry, further elevate opportunities for our students and collaborate across higher education to reach more students and increase our talent pipeline.”“We are meeting the region’s workforce needs for today and tomorrow,” said President of Idaho State University Kevin Satterlee. “As a founding partner of the Northwest University Semiconductor Network, we proudly support the innovative research and academic programs that meet the needs of the U.S. semiconductor industry. The network gives our faculty and students opportunities to engage in and contribute to innovative science and discovery.”“Oregon State University is proud to be a founding member of Micron’s Northwest University Semiconductor Network and is committed to work with other regional universities and Micron to fully serve the technical needs and demands of the semiconductor industry and expand STEM access to underrepresented rural and urban students, including women,” said President of Oregon State University Jayathi Y.

(NYSE:YUM) is heavily dominated by institutional owners",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/80-ownership-shares-yum-brands-130035143.html,1686574835,STORY,['YUM'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Yum! Brands' stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions51% of the business is held by the top 16 shareholders Analyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a businessA look at the shareholders of Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 80% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Yum! Brands, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Yum! Brands ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Yum! Brands?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Yum! Brands does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Yum! Brands, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Yum! Brands. Our data shows that Capital Research and Management Company is the largest shareholder with 9.3% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.2% and 7.5%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 16 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Yum! BrandsThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Yum! Brands, Inc. in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$42m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 20% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified   3 warning signs for Yum! Brands (2 are potentially serious)  that you should be aware of.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

A new study outlines how people who work or interact with artificial intelligence may suffer from loneliness and insomnia. From Barbie to McDonald's Grimace, companies are bringing back some of their most iconic mascots. Yahoo Finance Live breaks it all down.Video Transcript- All right, let's take a look at some of the top trending stories of the day. We've got Alexandra Canal, Josh Schafer here, as always, help us to break down what is trending with all of you. First up, we got to start with the latest with Elon Musk and Twitter. And Ali, we're learning a little bit more, just about what maybe his plans are going to be like for the platform.- Yeah, it seems like Musk wants to balance some of those more conservative voices with some liberal ones. In a tweet, he wrote, quote-- basically pleading to Rachel Maddow, Don Lemon, and others to put their shows on the platform. He said that those news anchors will receive Twitter's full support. ""The digital town square is for all.""So this seems to be what Musk has been trying to do, especially with Twitter spaces. In the span of two weeks, he hosted Republican presidential candidate, Ron DeSantis, along with Democratic nominee Robert F. Kennedy Jr. And it really seems like he wants to create this digital town hall.I think, personally, it's a good idea, considering when he first took over Twitter, there was a lot of concern, that there was chaos, and that there were just a lot of hate on the platform, especially from the advertising perspective. So perhaps, this could change the narrative?- Full support sounds good. I would give full support with some money if I was Elon. Why don't you start paying these people to use the platform, to come on the platform, so you promote Twitter more and then you can actually grow the platform through that and sell ads through that. But it reinvents the revenue model a little bit here, which they're clearly having problems with.Story continues- Yeah.- You're clearly having problems selling ads. So if you can create content, like a streaming service, it seems like they're trying to push Twitter almost a little bit more as a streaming service. Well, if you want me to be on your platform and create content on your platform, pay me like a content creator. That's what TikTok does.- Well, I suppose, yes. But he's going to look for these names. Like, I mean, he's making a play for Lemon, and Lemon certainly looking for something. Although, he said he's going to take the summer off. So it'll be the fall season that we're looking for something there.I mean-- and he had already made this, kind of, reach out to Don Lemon, you recall, right after he left CNN. So it's not surprising that he's, kind of, coming back with that today, especially to balance out the Conservative voices that you have there. And you have Tucker Carlson's show there now.- Yeah, he's trying to play both sides here. We'll see whether or not it is successful. In terms of this tweet, though, it is pinned at the top of his Twitter profile right now, so it shows that, at least, this initiative is a priority for now. We know that Musk does tend to change his mind pretty often, so we'll see how long he does stick with this.But to what you guys were saying, it's exactly right. Twitter, as it was before, Musk had gotten there this reliance on ad revenue. It's not working with him at the helm off. Just about 60% on a year-over-year basis. We know that was so critical in terms of the success of the company. So he is looking to other avenues in terms of diversifying that future revenue stream.I think he's still going to have the problem that Twitter has always had, and that's just the trust right now. In terms of people going back to the platform, knowing that they can trust and rely on the news that is being shared. Yes, obviously. It will be super helpful if you have recognizable names that are out there giving that news. You know exactly where it is coming from. But I think beyond that, that's a big question for Twitter.- Especially with AI, too, right? There's images that are unverified, and then you have the Twitter verification system all over the place right now. But he does seem to have the support from the Twitter leadership board. There was a tweet from the New CEO, Linda Yaccarino, she wrote in her own Twitter thread earlier today, quote, ""Have you ever been talking with someone particularly insightful and thought you should have the freedom to speak your mind? We all should. Enter Twitter 2.0."" So this free speech push is really the big story here for Twitter.- And speaking of AI, that's a good segue way. All right, a new study published today in the Journal of Applied Psychology found, people working with AI are more lonely and can suffer from insomnia. And the remedy, apparently, is more AI. One of the things that stuck out to me was one of the ways they thought that they could remedy this situation was like giving AI a human-like voice. So I was just struck by that. Like, why is the solution more technology to this problem?- Honestly, this report just strikes me as someone who doesn't like their job, right? Insomnia and comes home after work and wants a drink. Like, you could apply that to a lot of different jobs out there, not just AI. And I can see-- I mean, I go on social media sometimes.You fall in that rabbit hole. A couple of hours go by. And after you snap out of it, you are a little depressed, and you need to see other humans and see the sunshine. So I don't know if I buy this being totally pegged with AI.- It would be the same answers if you just overused your laptop.- Right.- Or if you overuse--- Technology across the board.- Right. The amount of things I read that say that I have insomnia because I'd use my phone right before you go to bed, right? I think that, sort of, is always, kind of, in line with that. So it wasn't too-too surprising to see. But I mean--- It's not too-too surprising, but the fact that we are in this AI revolution, I think they're trying to call out some of the issues and potential dangers with being just too consumed within this space. So again, definitely not surprising, especially about the insomnia piece. And so, this data matched up, whether we were talking about because they did the study in the US and in parts of Asia as well. So it matched up across the board.- Yeah, there was only 800 people surveyed in this. So I think it's kind of suggestive rather than conclusive of exactly what AI's impact is on workers out there. But I do think it brings up a good point, and that's the fact. And really, what we've talked about so much when it comes to AI, and that's the need to use it responsibly.And there are so many questions out there. Just because we are in the early stages of this adoption, what exactly it's going to do to employees whose employer is using AI on a more regular basis. Obviously, that is happening across the board and really points to the employer's responsibility to help their employees navigate this uncertain time.There was another recent survey from the Boston Consulting Group. And in that, they found that only 29%, so less than a third of workers out there say that their companies have enacted, quote, ""adequate measures"" to ensure the response will use of AI compared to nearly 70% of leaders who said the same.So certainly, there is a shortcoming out there, just in the part of the employer for what they have provided in their employees. But I also think this is what a learning process is all about. When you have a new technology, technology is going to take time to try and figure out all the risks out there and how to best protect yourself and others around you from AI and from those risks.- Maybe they'll set a similar limits, like the screen time limits that we give our kids.- We'll see.- But I don't know if it's possible with AI. That's the thing.- It becomes a loop, I think, at some point, right? Where if you're using it a lot, then you need to use it more because you're reliant on it. I think there are plenty of things in life that work like that, right? But it starts to work like that, and then like those other things, it can be detrimental to you.- Certainly. All right, well, let's end this on a lighter note. Because this summer, it seems like it's all about those retro remakes. We have movies like ""Little Mermaid"" and ""Barbie"". Also, McDonald's bringing back their mascot, the Grimace. It's making us ask if this summer is all about nostalgia.And guys, it certainly seems like that, even from the movie theaters to what McDonald's doing to what's in style right now. Ali, when it comes to retail. '90s baggy pants, bell bottom jeans are also making a comeback here, even the sneakers that Josh Rock said-- oh, you don't have them on today. Those are something that all of our dads wore years ago.- You got to ask me, if you're going to use me as a prop.- I know. I didn't think of it, so I was just talking right there.- I'm going to hold my hand as responsible for part of this, kind of, nostalgia kickback. Because I feel like this is partly Gen X/older millennials, so the end of Gen X-- the end. Like, this is our generation, you know? So the scrunchie, I was definitely-- I had a scrunchie on my hand earlier. And I'm like, oh, I got to take it off.- Well, I brought it just to show that I'm carrying the scrunchie. I own several bell bottom jeans. I actually just threw out a pair of white Skechers that I had for way too long because my mother was like, those are ugly. You need to get rid of them. But again, they were back in style.I think there are a few reasons why this is happening. I think a big thing is social media, right? TikTok, Instagram. You can make anything go viral. And if you have a couple older celebrities saying, hey, bring back Dunkaroos, that's an easy sell for the company.And then on the movie side, the fact that we have this strong IP, right? ""Transformers,"" ""Indiana Jones,"" ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles."" that's bankable content for these theaters. That has already has a built-in audience. That's why you see a lot of prequels, a lot of sequesl. So to me, this makes perfect sense.- ""Barbie Movie.""- I walked into the movie theater-- I walked into the movie thing a little bit because I was curious. Because I feel like it's always about the past, right? That's all we're always doing, right? Retro is always popular, and it's always popular in Hollywood. So I went back a decade. If we look at the top box office movies, in 2013, you'll see ""Iron Man 3,"" ""The Hunger Games,"" ""Despicable Me 2,"" ""Man of Steel,"" which is a Superman movie, and ""Monsters University,"" which is a ""Monster Inc."" remake.So those are all series, all remakes. And then when you take a look at 2023, and what the top grossing movies are through this year, it's really, kind of, the same story, right? You have ""Super Mario Bros,"" which is, obviously, a callback. And then, you have a lot of other series, and you have a lot of Disney series and a lot of cartoons.I think we're all always into old things. We're all always into whatever cartoon we grew up with. It's just that, that age gets a little bit older. So then, they get more money. So then, they buy a little bit of merchandise we put it in Hollywood.- And they're making the decisions. I think part of that is the decision makers in these boardrooms.- It's easy to say yes to something when you can point back to that data years ago and say, look how many people came, look at how many people are interested. You get the merch. You have the ""Star Wars"" content on Disney Plus. You have Baby Yoda selling out everywhere. So it makes sense. It's just this ecosystem that, I think, nostalgia is always going to win out in the end.- It certainly has, and it doesn't seem like that trend to stopping anytime soon, given how much hype everyone is given to ""Barbie,"" ""Little Mermaid,"" especially ""Barbie.""- I'm looking forward to real life ""Paw Patrol"" movie in 10 years. It's going to be good.- I mean, they already-- they have a live action ""Lion King,"" which was questionable how--- Live action ""Paw Patrol.""- Did you see how fast Josh tried to move us away from ""Barbie?"" Just now, he's like, it's not just ""Barbie.""- We to talk about ""Barbie a"" lot.- I don't know.- I think we all have to see it. Group trip.- Exactly.- Ali and Josh, thanks so much.]"

If you want to read about some more firms that just announced share buybacks, go directly to 5 Companies That Announced Huge Share Buybacks Recently.During a recession, companies may experience a decline in their stock prices due to economic uncertainties and market volatility. By engaging in share buybacks, companies can repurchase their own shares from the market, reducing the total number of outstanding shares. This reduction in supply can help support and stabilize the stock price, instilling confidence among investors and signaling that the company believes in its own long-term prospects. These buybacks provide an efficient way for companies to utilize their excess cash. Instead of hoarding cash reserves or making large capital expenditures during an economic downturn, companies can use their funds to repurchase shares. This action can enhance shareholder value by increasing earnings per share (EPS) and improving financial metrics such as return on equity (ROE).Furthermore, buybacks can be seen as a signal of financial strength and stability. Companies that have sufficient cash reserves to repurchase shares in a recession demonstrate their ability to weather economic downturns and generate future profits. This can attract investors and contribute to a positive perception of the company's financial health. Additionally, share buybacks can provide a tax-efficient way to distribute excess cash to shareholders. By repurchasing shares, companies can return value to shareholders without incurring the same tax liabilities as dividends. This can be particularly advantageous for investors in higher tax brackets. Buyback activity in the second quarter of 2022 in US was close to a record level as companies continued to utilize their buyback plans. A total of 1,323 companies reported repurchases, a 4% increase from the previous quarter. The breadth of buybacks has been consistently expanding for multiple quarters, reaching its highest level since the first quarter of 2020 when nearly 1,400 companies engaged in buybacks. In the second quarter of 2022, 58% of companies with open buyback authorizations repurchased shares, marking a continued upward trend. Additionally, 197 companies initiated new buyback plans, and 159 companies increased existing plans, resulting in a combined figure of 356, representing a downturn of 12.7% from the first quarter of 2022.  In terms of volume, buybacks by US companies experienced a sequential decrease of 15% in the second quarter of 2022, but still saw a year-over-year increase of 21%. Story continuesThe total buyback volume for US companies in Q2’22 amounted to $269.5 billion, which was a 14.9% decrease from the record-setting $316.9 billion in the first quarter of 2022. Despite the quarter-on-quarter drop, the dollar value of buybacks showed a significant increase of 20.6% compared to the same period in the previous year. Buyback volume reached new all-time highs in each quarter from the third quarter of 2021 through the first quarter of 2022, and the second quarter of 2022 figure slightly exceeded the third quarter of 2021 figure. However, it is worth noting that share buybacks can also be a subject of debate. Critics argue that companies should prioritize investments in research and development, employee wages, or capital expenditures instead of repurchasing shares. They claim that buybacks can artificially inflate stock prices and benefit shareholders, including executives with stock-based compensation, at the expense of long-term growth and job creation. Share buybacks have been a prevalent trend in the United States over the past few decades. Companies use share buybacks as a strategy to return capital to shareholders and manage their capital structure. The trend gained significant momentum after the implementation of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which imposed restrictions on dividend tax treatment but allowed for more favorable tax treatment of capital gains from stock sales. Another factor was the availability of low-cost debt due to historically low interest rates.  Companies took advantage of this opportunity to borrow funds and finance their share buyback programs. This approach became especially popular among large corporations, which had access to more favorable lending terms and greater financial resources. In recent years, share buybacks have attracted public and political scrutiny. Critics argue that buybacks primarily benefit shareholders, including top executives with stock-based compensation, rather than investing in long-term growth, increasing employee wages, or other capital expenditures. This debate has led to calls for stricter regulations on buybacks or alternative uses of corporate funds. Despite the criticism, share buybacks remain a significant feature of the US corporate landscape. Many companies continue to use buybacks as a means to enhance shareholder value, manage their capital structure, and signal confidence in their future prospects. The COVID-19 pandemic and associated economic uncertainties have impacted buyback activity, with some companies suspending or reducing their programs to conserve cash. However, as economic conditions stabilize, it is expected that share buybacks will resume their role as a key tool in capital allocation for US companies. Some of the stocks to monitor in this context include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). 10 Companies That Announced Huge Share Buybacks RecentlySpeedcurve Performance AnalyticsOur MethodologyFor this article, we selected stocks that have announced share buybacks this year and ranked them based on overall hedge fund sentiment. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the first quarter of 2023. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. Companies That Announced Huge Share Buybacks Recently10. ArcelorMittal (NYSE:MT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 19ArcelorMittal (NYSE:MT) operates as integrated steel and mining companies in the Americas, Europe, Asia, and Africa. On May 5, the company announced that it would be commencing a new share buyback program of up to 85 million shares. The program will be completed within two years, per the firm. The firm also said that the amount of shares repurchased through this program will depend on the level of post-dividend free cash flow generated over the period. In late March, investment advisory Morgan Stanley maintained an Overweight rating on ArcelorMittal (NYSE:MT) stock and lowered the price target to EUR 37.5 from EUR 38. Analyst Alain Gabriel issued the ratings update. At the end of the first quarter of 2023, 19 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $492 million in ArcelorMittal (NYSE:MT), up from 13 in the preceding quarter worth $580 million.Just like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), ArcelorMittal (NYSE:MT) is one of the stocks trending on the up after announcing share buybacks. 9. Golar LNG Limited (NASDAQ:GLNG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 33     Golar LNG Limited (NASDAQ:GLNG) is an LNG transportation firm. On May 23, Golar LNG announced a share buyback program worth up to $150 million.

Here is what the fund said:“This quarter we sold our entire stake in Golar LNG Limited (NASDAQ:GLNG). As we highlighted in our previous letter, the company engaged in the conversion of natural gas into liquefied natural gas (FLNG infrastructures), the storage of LNG and regasification through FSRU and the transportation of LNG (with its stake in Cool Company), has benefited greatly from the current tightness in the natural gas market, derived from the energy transition and, indeed, aggravated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the various sanctions and measures taken by the Western nations against the country led by Vladimir Putin. On the one hand, its market value relative to our intrinsic value estimate has considerably narrowed following its outstanding performance. On the other hand, our search for a more favorable riskreturn setup in the natural gas market led us to sell Golar LNG and to invest, as we will discuss below, in its spin-off Cool Company.”8. Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39   Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) designs, manufactures, and markets Invisalign clear aligners, and iTero intraoral scanners and services for orthodontists and general practitioner dentists. In February, the firm announced a new accelerated share buyback agreement with Citibank to repurchase $250 million of the company’s common stock. The deal is in line with Align’s $1 billion stock repurchase program announced back in 2021. On April 27, investment bank Piper Sandler maintained an Overweight rating on Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) stock and raised the price target to $370 from $360, appreciating the near-term revenue and earnings trajectory of the firm. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Chicago-based investment firm Citadel Investment Group is a leading shareholder in Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) with 1.3 million shares worth more than $451 million.7. United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39    United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) provides letter and package delivery, transportation, logistics, and related services. Earlier this year, the company announced that it had authorized a $5 billion share buyback plan to enhance growth prospects. The new program replaced existing share buyback authorizations. In addition to share buybacks that boost investor confidence, the firm also pays a handsome dividend to shareholders. On May 3, the firm announced a quarterly dividend of $1.62 per share, in line with previous. The forward yield was 3.69%. On June 2, investment advisory Barclays maintained an Equal Weight rating on United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) stock and lowered the price target to $172 from $180, noting that near-term UPS headwinds hinge on the outcome of Teamster labor negotiations. At the end of the first quarter of 2023, 39 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $476 million in United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS), compared to 36 in the previous quarter worth $514 million.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Mayar Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) has been a beneficiary of the pandemic-related shift to e-commerce. Revenues increased 15% in the year, with strong leverage in the business boosting operating profit by al- most 67%. Management is focusing on a ‘Better not Bigger’ strategy for the business and divested the UPS Freight business early in the year. Mean- while, the company is expected to increase distributions to shareholders in 2022, from both dividends and share buybacks.” 6. Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41 Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) is an energy and petrochemical firm. On May 4, Shell announced plans to buy back an additional $4 billion worth of shares as its profits exceeded estimates. The decision to repurchase shares comes as Shell seeks to distribute excess cash to shareholders and drive up returns. In the previous quarter, the firm had recorded $4 billion in share buybacks as well. The company posted a revenue of more than $86 billion in the first quarter of 2023, up over 3% compared to the revenue over the same period last year. On May 18, Piper Sandler analyst Ryan Todd maintained an Overweight rating on Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) stock and lowered the price target to $75 from $77, noting that energy stocks continue to struggle to regain traction coming out of Q1 earnings season. At the end of the first quarter of 2023, 41 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $2.7 billion in Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), compared to 40 in the previous quarter worth $3 billion.Alongside Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) is one of the stocks trending on the up after announcing share buybacks. In its Q4 2022 investor letter, Artisan Partners, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“We scaled back our weighting in clean energy this quarter, which is a part of the portfolio’s environment theme, to take profits after a successful run in 2022. We did so by trimming our position in Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), a stock we added to the portfolio in Q1 2022. As an integrated energy company, approximately one third of Shell’s revenues come from transition fuels, such as LNG, and another third comes from new energy sources such as green hydrogen. LNG is one of the cleanest fossil fuels and represents a potential bridge to the future by replacing higher carbon energy sources with lower carbon ones while renewable technologies mature. As the largest LNG supplier in the world, we believe Shell is particularly well-positioned to help Europe meet its energy needs as it looks for ways to replace imported Russian oil and gas with new sources after the embargo.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Companies That Announced Huge Share Buybacks Recently.Suggested Articles:11 Best Low Risk Dividend Stocks To Invest In15 Biggest Nanotechnology Companies in the World11 Best Pet Stocks To BuyDisclose.

277,b27e6d47-5a26-31cb-8dda-98fed9de19a4,MLM,2023-06-13,Martin Marietta (MLM) is a Great Momentum Stock: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/martin-marietta-mlm-great-momentum-160006448.html,1686585606,STORY,['MLM'],"[Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Martin Marietta (MLM), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Martin Marietta currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for MLM that show why this seller of granite, limestone, sand and gravel shows promise as a solid momentum pick.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor MLM, shares are up 2.93% over the past week while the Zacks Building Products - Concrete and Aggregates industry is up 1.93% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 6.13% compares favorably with the industry's 3.67% performance as well.While any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Over the past quarter, shares of Martin Marietta have risen 33.27%, and are up 32.79% in the last year. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 10.2% and 9.07%, respectively.Investors should also take note of MLM's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, MLM is averaging 344,618 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with MLM.Over the past two months, 10 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost MLM's consensus estimate, increasing from $14.84 to $16.06 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 10 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that MLM is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Martin Marietta on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Other companies that have announced boycotts include airline SAS, railway operator SJ, and shipping group Fjord Line.Coop Norge, Norway’s second-biggest grocery retailer, said it was considering dropping Mondelez products and requested advice from the government.Russia boycotts impact the literary worldCalls for boycotts haven’t been limited to multinationals.

If you wish to see the top ones, feel free to skip our detailed analysis of the pharma industry and head straight to the 5 Most Profitable Drugs In The World.The pharmaceutical industry has long been lucrative, with countless drugs generating substantial profits for pharmaceutical companies. However, within this realm, a select few medications stand out as the epitome of profitability. These exceptional drugs have revolutionized patient care and propelled the companies behind them to unprecedented financial success.From breakthrough treatments for chronic diseases to life-saving therapies, the world's most profitable drugs have reshaped the healthcare landscape and become integral to the global pharmaceutical market.Factors Driving Drug Profitability: Market Demand and Clinical NeedMarket demand and clinical need are crucial factors driving drug profitability in the pharmaceutical industry. Pharmaceutical companies analyze market trends and patient demographics to identify areas with high demand for specific medications. Diseases with a high prevalence or limited treatment options present opportunities for developing profitable drugs.Factors such as aging populations, changing lifestyles, and increased awareness of certain health conditions contribute to the market demand for specific drugs. In 2022, the global pharmaceutical market was valued at approximately $1.48 trillion.The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a surge in demand for antiviral medications and vaccines, resulting in a significant increase in profitability for pharmaceutical companies. The global antiviral drugs market is expected to reach $51.4 billion by 2027, with a compound annual growth rate of 4%.Additionally, sales of COVID-19 vaccines are anticipated to decline sharply by 64% in the current year, reaching $13.5 billion compared to the previous year's figure of $37.8 billion, as reported by CNBC. However, it is important to note that profitability is not the only factor driving drug development, as clinical needs and patient outcomes should always remain a top priority.Story continuesCompared to existing therapies, superior efficacy, safety, and convenience also contribute to a drug's profitability. Pharmaceutical companies use rigorous clinical trials to demonstrate effectiveness and obtain regulatory approvals. The average cost of developing a new prescription from discovery to market launch is approximately $2.6 billion, with a success rate of just 12%.However, successful drugs can generate substantial revenue, with the best-selling drugs of all time like Montekulas, Aspirin and Humira, among others generating over $50 billion in annual sales. By identifying unmet clinical needs and developing innovative solutions, companies can capitalize on the profitability of drugs that address critical healthcare challenges, benefiting the pharmaceutical industry financially and improving patient outcomes by providing effective treatments for previously unmet medical needs.Blockbuster Drugs: Unveiling the Top Profit-Generating MedicationsIn recent years, the pharmaceutical industry has witnessed a surge in top-selling drugs, with some medications generating billions of dollars in revenue for their manufacturers. For instance, Humira, one of the top selling drug, used to treat autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, generated over $21.23 billion in sales in 2022 alone. Similarly, Keytruda, a cure for various cancers, generated $20.93 billion in revenue in the same year.Enbrel, used to treat psoriasis and other inflammatory conditions, also caused over $4 billion in sales in 2022. These financial statistics are a testament to these drugs' effectiveness and the pharmaceutical industry's success in producing life-saving medications. Despite the challenges, the industry continues to innovate and invest heavily in research and development, undoubtedly leading to more breakthrough drugs and better health outcomes for patients worldwide.Future Trends: Innovations and Their Potential for ProfitabilityThe future of the drug market seems promising, with innovative changes driven by advancements in technology and research. Personalized medicine is gaining momentum and holds the potential for improved patient outcomes and reduced healthcare costs. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are revolutionizing drug development and clinical trial design, expediting the identification of promising candidates and reducing failure risks.In fact, according to a recent report by Grand View Research, the global AI in healthcare market size is expected to reach $31.3 billion by 2025, with drug development being one of the key applications of AI technology in the healthcare sector.Additionally, there is a growing focus on developing drugs that target specific disease pathways, which offers more effective treatments with fewer side effects. These trends are creating significant opportunities for businesses to capitalize on the profitability of innovative drugs in the evolving market.In fact, according to recent financial statistics, the global personalized medicine market is expected to reach $3.92 trillion by 2026, whereas the demand for AI-powered drug development is expected to reach $5.1 billion by 2025. Businesses that invest in these areas can expect to reap the benefits of this growing market.15 Most Profitable Drugs In The WorldCopyright: romastudio / 123RF Stock PhotoOur MethodologyFor our methodology, we ranked the most profitable drugs in the world in ascending order of sales in 2022 as a proxy for their profitability. To ensure the accuracy of the data, we relied on Drug Discovery Trends.Here is our list of the 15 most profitable drugs in the world:15. Trikafta/Kaftrio2022 Sales: $7.68 billion Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) has established its market dominance in treating cystic fibrosis with its top-selling drug, Trikafta. Trikafta generated $7.68 billion in sales in 2022 and continues to experience significant growth. Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) has secured reimbursement deals in multiple countries and plans to expand its base, aiming to reach an additional 25,000 cystic fibrosis patients who could benefit from the drug.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) emphasizes its commitment to outperform Trikafta's market dominance and highlights its focus on non-opioid pain management and gene editing therapies as part of its future market prospects.14. Darzalex2022 Sales: $7.97 billionJohnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s multiple myeloma drug, Darzalex, has become the company's second-largest product and experienced significant growth in 2022. Despite competition from Sanofi's CD38 drug, Sarclisa, Darzalex maintains an advantage with approvals in newly diagnosed diseases.However, Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY)'s combination trials with Sarclisa and other medicines may pose a challenge. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is defending its essential product with ongoing phase 3 trials and reported survival advantages. The expiration of patent protection for BMS Revlimid does not fundamentally impact the opportunity for Darzalex, as it is considered a foundational therapy.13. Opdivo2022 Sales: $8.24 billion Opdivo, developed by Bristol Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY), experienced sales growth in 2022, reaching $8.24 billion. Despite being outperformed by Merck's Keytruda, Opdivo holds unique positions in specific indications. It gained FDA approval for previously untreated stomach cancer and has indications in front-line kidney cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and metastatic melanoma.Patient volume across tumor types still lags behind pre-COVID levels, affecting Opdivo's performance. BMS's combination therapies, such as Opdivo-Yervoy for kidney cancer and Opdivo-relatlimab for metastatic melanoma, contribute to its market position. Opdivo by Bristol Myer Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) also approved early-stage NSCLC treatment, presenting the potential for solid uptake.12. Imbruvica2022 Sales: $8.35 billionImbruvica, co-developed by AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s Janssen, shows steady sales growth and the potential for continued success, with a total sales of $8.35 billion in 2022. AbbVie's patent strategy ensures exclusivity for Imbruvica until March 2032, giving it a competitive edge.As a first-in-class lymphoma drug, Imbruvica achieved blockbuster status quickly but now faces competition from AstraZeneca's Calquence and BeiGene's Brukinsa. However, Imbruvica's established position and ongoing clinical success make it a key revenue driver for AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), especially with the anticipated biosimilar competition for its immunology drug Humira.11. Stelara2022 Sales: $9.72 billionJohnson &amp; Johnson's Stelara, the first biologic treatment to inhibit the IL-12 and IL-23 pathways, has become the company's most extensive product, representing almost 10% of its total revenue. Despite recent competition from biosimilars and a loss to AbbVie, Inc. (NYSE:ABBV)'s Humira in Crohn's disease, Stelara experienced sales growth of over 20% in 2020. With its patent set to expire in September 2023, J&amp;J is focusing on marketing efforts and patient empowerment to maximize Stelara's potential before biosimilars enter the market.10. Revlimid2022 Sales: $9.97 billionBristol Myers Squibb's blockbuster blood cancer drug, Revlimid, faces a significant decline in sales due to the introduction of generic competitors. Sandoz and Stada Arzneimittel have launched their generic versions in multiple countries. BMS expected Revlimid's sales to drop from $12.8 billion in 2021 to around $9.5 billion to $10 billion in 2022.Several other companies, including Natco Pharma, Sun Pharma, Zydus Cadila, Cipla, and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, have launched or plan to launch their generic versions. Bristol Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) is focusing on other products like Opdivo, Yervoy, and Eliquis and upcoming launches to mitigate the impact of Revlimid's loss.9. Biktarvy2022 Sales: $10.39 billionGilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD)' HIV drug Biktarvy was the top-selling infectious disease pharmaceutical product until the impact of COVID-19. In 2022, Biktarvy's sales reached $10.39 billion, surpassing GlaxoSmithKline's HIV unit. It became the most successful HIV therapy globally, with a significant market share in the U.S. and Europe.However, GSK's dolutegravir-based portfolio attracted the most switch patients. Biktarvy faces competition from long-acting regimens like Cabenuva. Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) settled a patent infringement lawsuit with ViiV Healthcare, agreeing to pay $1.25 billion and 3% royalties for future sales of Biktarvy.8. Eylea2022 Sales: $12.72 billionEylea, a leading ophthalmology drug by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN), maintains its market leadership despite increasing competition. It is used to treat diabetic eye disease and age-related macular degeneration. Eylea's sales reached $5.79 billion in the U.S. in 2021, as reported by Fierce Pharma.Novartis' Beovu initially posed a challenge but faced safety concerns. Roche's Vabysmo is expected to provide intense competition. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) is developing a high-dose version of Eylea. Although biosimilar competition looms, Eylea is projected to remain dominant in the ophthalmology market.You can read more on Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) in our list of the largest biotech companies in the US.7. Dupixent2022 Sales: $17.41 billion Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) and Regeneron Pharmaceutical, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN)'s Dupixent, a leading immunology drug, exceeded expectations with sales growth of 46% in Q1 2022, reaching 1.61 billion euros ($1.79 billion). The drug's market penetration in adults with atopic dermatitis is currently at 8%, indicating significant growth potential.Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) aims to expand Dupixent's reach to at least 1.5 million more patients globally by 2025. The revised goal is to achieve peak sales surpassing 13 billion euros ($13.98 billion) , driven by its dominance in atopic dermatitis and FDA approvals for asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis, and eosinophilic esophagitis.6. Eliquis2022 Sales: $18.26 billionEliquis, the blood thinner jointly developed by Bristol Myers Squibb and Pfizer, Inc. (NYSE:PFE), has experienced remarkable sales growth. In 2022 alone, the drug generated $18.26 billion in sales. While Bristol Myers Squibb acknowledges the future challenges posed by patent expirations and the entry of generics, the company remains optimistic. It expects continued growth from existing drugs, including Eliquis, as well as from new product launches, which are projected to contribute significantly to the company's growth trajectory until 2029.Click to see and continue reading the 5 Most Profitable Drugs In The World. Suggested Articles:25 Most Prescribed Medication in the World.25 Best Hospitals for Cancer Treatment in the World.20 Most Used Prescription Drugs In The US.Disclosure.

LMT clinched a modification contract involving F-16 fighter aircraft. The award has been offered by the 338th Enterprise Sourcing Squadron, Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph, TX.Details of the DealValued at $74 million, the contract is projected to be completed by Mar 21, 2026. Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed will offer operational training capability for F-16 Block 70/72, F-16 upgrades and F-16V models.Work related to this deal will be executed in Orlando, FL, and several locations outside the continental United States. The contract involves Foreign Military Sales.Importance of the F-16 JetsOver the past decade, a rapid rise in global terrorism and adverse geopolitical situations across borders have boosted the demand for defense products. Combat aircraft constitute a major portion of this portfolio. It is imperative to mention here that the F-16 Falcon jets have significantly risen in importance on a global scale over the past few years.For the past couple of years, the F-16 has witnessed a significant development, with nations like Taiwan, Bulgaria, Morocco and Bahrain signing agreements to procure new F-16 aircraft.In order to make the most of this rising demand, Lockheed introduced F-16 Block 70/72 in 2020, the most advanced F-16 aircraft, combining numerous capabilities and structural upgrades. This model provides a new aircraft structure that lasts 50% longer than the previous F-16 version. Such advancements might have been ushering in contracts from Pentagon and other U.S. allies, like the latest one, thereby boosting Lockheed’s revenue prospects.Growth ProspectsWith rising security threats across the globe, emerging economies like the Asia Pacific, the Middle East and South America are spending a lot on enhancing their defense arsenals. Meanwhile, other nations like Europe and the United States have already been leading the defense market. With the United States being the largest weapons exporter worldwide, the nation has been spending significantly on defense products, including combat aircraft.Story continuesLockheed, being a prominent combat aircraft manufacturer in the United States, enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global fighter aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 3.95% during 2023-2028, with North America constituting the largest share of this market.Such growth can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities, and increased spending on defense. These projections should benefit Lockheed, along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Boeing BA, Northrop Grumman NOC and Textron TXT.Boeing’s Defense, Space &amp; Security segment engages in the research, development, production and modification of manned and unmanned military aircraft.

Most industry players are looking to drive their bottom line amid the headwinds through cost reduction.Partly due to these headwinds, the industry has declined 5.1% over the past six months against the S&amp;P 500 Index’s 7.9% appreciation. The broader Zacks Transportation sector has lost 0.3% in the said time frame.Despite the challenges surrounding the industry, some railroad companies like Union Pacific Corporation and Norfolk Southern Corporation have consistently announced dividend hikes, thus highlighting their pro-shareholder stance.Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these companies have superior fundamentals like a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics.How to Pick Stocks With Solid Dividend Payouts?In order to choose some of the best dividend stocks from the aforementioned industry, we have run the Zacks Stock Screener to identify stocks with a dividend yield in excess of 2% and a sustainable dividend payout ratio of less than 60%. Each of the two stocks mentioned below carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Story continuesUnion Pacific: Headquartered in Omaha, NE, Union Pacific, through its subsidiary, Union Pacific Railroad Company, operates in the railroad business in the United States.

This company’s payout ratio is 45% of its earnings at present. The five-year dividend growth rate is 12.02%. (Check Union Pacific’s dividend history here).Union Pacific’s consistent initiatives to reward its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases look encouraging. UNP hiked its dividend twice in 2021. In May 2022, UNP’s board of directors increased its quarterly cash dividend by 10% to $1.30 per share. Notably, Union Pacific has been paying dividends on its common stock for 123 consecutive years.During first-quarter 2023, UNP paid dividends worth $795 million and repurchased shares worth $575 million.

Currently, it has a market capitalization of $49.66 billion.NSC pays out a quarterly dividend of $1.35 ($5.40 annualized) per share, which gives it a 2.48% yield at the current stock price. This company’s payout ratio is 38% of its earnings at present. The five-year dividend growth rate is 11.95%. (Check Norfolk Southern’s dividend history here).Norfolk Southern's consistent initiatives to reward its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases are encouraging.

And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. For example, long term Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM) shareholders have enjoyed a 95% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 46% (not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 12% in the last year , including dividends .So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. View our latest analysis for Waste Management While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During five years of share price growth, Waste Management achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 3.4% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 14% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Waste Management has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Waste Management's TSR for the last 5 years was 113%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Waste Management shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 12% over one year. Of course, that includes the dividend. However, the TSR over five years, coming in at 16% per year, is even more impressive. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230612005008/en/Bloom Season 2 illustrations by Simone Noronha &amp; Paulina AlmiraLaunched in 2022, Bloom Season was brought to life by Mailchimp and the impact-focused creative company Kin to serve as a valuable resource for those given less visibility in business literature and fewer opportunities in the business world. It’s full of first-hand stories, resources, and actionable insights from people with lived experience starting businesses, enduring challenges, and refusing to give up.Where the first iteration of Bloom Season celebrated the entrepreneurial spirit of the BIPOC (Black, Indigenous and People of Color) individuals re-writing the small business playbook—Bloom Season 2 is focused on uplifting the voices within the LGBTQIA+ community, and continues to shine a light on the first-hand experiences, insights, and actionable possibilities for LGBTQIA+ identifying individuals in business.Bloom Season 2 continues to grow the platform as a place for everyone, of any identity, to find useful guidance for helping turn their plans into positive momentum for their businesses. Focusing on the LGBTQIA+ community was a natural step for Season 2.""We've woven together a powerful combination of voices and resources to celebrate this latest edition of Bloom Season,"" said Christina Humphrey, Senior Manager of Mailchimp Studios. ""With so many LGBTQIA+ entrepreneurs breaking the status quo, we moved to craft a digital space that shines a spotlight on their stories and experiences.""Story continuesIt was essential for Bloom Season’s second edition to allow communities to tell their own stories, so Mailchimp and Kin worked to ensure all business owners, writers, illustrators and photographers assembled identify as LGBTQIA+. Over 50+ collaborators are featured in Bloom Season 2, including:Lisa Cannistraci, owner of Henrietta Hudson, the oldest lesbian bar in the US. Now 32 years old, Henrietta Hudson has thrived by evolving with the communityCora Hamilton, founder of Uns*, a Berlin-based model and talent agency that exclusively represents LGBTQIA+ people, advocating for representation of all identities, ethnicities, bodies and abilitiesRobyn Exton, founder of the HER social app for all lesbian, bi, queer, non-binary, trans, and gender non-conforming folxsKelly Rakowski, of lex.app, an app to explore what's happening in your local LGBTQIA+ communitySarah Moore, co-founder of the London LGBTQ+ Community CentreRyan Lanji, founder of Hungama, a London-based collective for QBIPOCNolan Hanson of Trans Boxing, based in New York CityKin centered this edition on the creative concept Bloom River, to reflect the constant fluidity and movement within the community, or collection of communities that have come together to make something stronger. The visual identity is based on the many colors of the Pride flag, reimagined in a state of flow to represent the diversity of the community and embrace all walks of life.""The idea of a river worked in two ways,"" says Kin co-founder Kwame Taylor-Hayford. ""A river is historically a place that brings all people together—to drink, bathe, travel, play—and it’s simultaneously ancient and always changing. It encapsulates the community and constant evolution of being LGBTQIA+. It’s also fluid, like gender and sexual identity. We wanted to pull that into the visuals, bleeding the rainbow colors together. There are no hard lines. Everything is connected, intersectional and builds to represent growth and a future between binaries.""The magazine is divided into three focus areas, each targeting a different aspect of the entrepreneurial journey for LGBTQIA+ individuals—from starting and growing a business, to tackling mental health, to looking towards the future:Business: ​​A new resource with first-hand experiences for starting, running, and growing the business of your dreams.Building a Community for the Long HaulA Queer Guide To Raising CapitalDisrupting Convention and Championing Queer Values""I show up as my authentic self every day""Successful Founders Answer Your QuestionsHow Companies Can Celebrate Pride All Year LongHow to Take Your Business to the Next LevelBeing: A space for conversations on identity, mental health, building and nurturing connections, creating inclusive workplaces, and practicing self-care.HAGS: Rewriting the Rules of Your Industry10 Tips Businesses Can Use to Help Improve LGBTQ+ InclusionThe Challenge and Beauty of Creating Safe SpacesNew Models for Community Care in the WorkplaceRekindling Your Creative SparkBeyond: Innovative entrepreneurs reimagine the future of business and beyond.Empowering the Queer Community Through DesignReimagining the Future of HealthcareQueering the Tech IndustryThe new collection of content also includes the feature film Sirens, an award-winning documentary following the Middle East’s first all-women thrash metal band, produced by Natasha Lyonne and Maya Rudolph, and directed by Rita Baghdadi.

297,cae568be-60dc-3d12-901b-ab3c2b3d7bc3,SRE,2023-06-13,"Time to buy these utility stocks with double-digit upside potential, says Goldman Sachs",TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/time-buy-utility-stocks-double-223855291.html,1686609535,STORY,"['GS', 'SRE', 'XEL', 'NEE']","[The U.S. electric grid is undergoing a huge transformation and renewables have steadily become more widely adopted over the past decade.Adoption is set to continue at a brisk pace, says Goldman Sachs analyst Carly Davenport. Looking ahead, Davenport reckons that by 2032, over 45% of the U.S.’s power generation capacity will come from renewable sources and 6% from coal. That compares to a mix of 30%/16% today and 17%/27% in 2012, making the ongoing change very clear.With this as backdrop, boosted by the Inflation Reduction Act, and as the power generation mix shifts and the Energy transition advances, Davenport believes utilities are “uniquely positioned to facilitate this shift and address associated challenges in a way that creates a cleaner power grid while maintaining reliability and customer affordability.”“This shift will require a significant amount of capital investment,” the analyst went on to add, “which we believe will contribute to attractive earnings and rate base growth in the coming years.”And investors can obviously take advantage of this development, too. With themes such as clean technology, nuclear power, LNG (liquefied natural gas) project additions, and “transmission build out” coming to the fore, investors stand to make use of an “attractive investment opportunity set.”Davenport has compiled a list of stocks, what she and her team call “Decarbonization Enablers,” that are well positioned to take advantage of this trend – and she sees three names posting double-digit growth over the coming months. We ran these picks through the TipRanks database to get a fuller view of their prospects. Let’s check the results.NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE)We’ll start with NextEra Energy, a Florida-based electric utility firm, which, with its $150 billion market cap, is one of the largest utility holding firms in the US utility landscape. NextEra’s chief subsidiary is Florida Power &amp; Light (FPL), which boasts more than 5.8 million customer accounts and provides power to more than 12 million people across Florida. The company generates power at seven utility-grade nuclear generation plants in Florida, making it a major provider of zero-emission power.Story continuesNextEra isn’t just depending on nuclear power for clean energy. The company is also moving into the hydrogen segment of the energy industry. In April of this year, the company announced an understanding between its renewable energy subsidiary NextEra Energy Resources and CF Industries, a major ammonia producer, for development of a hydrogen project at a CF Industries facility in Oklahoma.At the end of Q1, NextEra owned and operated approximately 4,600 megawatts of solar power generation capacity, a total that includes the 970 megawatts of solar capacity brought online during the quarter. This total makes NextEra the largest utility provider of solar power in the US. The company has more than 2,000 megawatts of renewable power and storage projects in its work backlog.This company has a history of beating the earnings expectations and has done so consistently for the past several years, as the case again in the last reported quarter – for 1Q23. Adj. EPS rose from $0.74 in the same period a year ago to $0.84, in turn beating the forecast by $0.11. Likewise on the top-line, revenue climbed by a big 132.5% y/y to $6.72 billion, coming in ahead of expectations by $1.5 billion.Turning to Goldman Sachs’ Carly Davenport, we find her putting a Buy rating on NEE shares, along with a $90 price target that implies a one-year gain of ~22%. (To watch Davenport’s track record, click here)In Davenport’s view, the company’s ability to grow earnings while expanding renewable generation capacity are key points. She writes: “Three key factors underpin our Buy rating: leverage to renewables growth, positive regulatory environment and a long track record of execution at FPL, and above average EPS growth with discounted valuation relative to history. We view NEE’s regulated utility Florida Power &amp; Light (FPL) as a premium regulated utility with a long runway for growth in a positive regulatory backdrop… NEE shares have underperformed the XLU by ~5% YTD, which we believe provides an attractive entry point for investors.”Overall, NEE gets a Strong Buy from the Street’s analyst consensus, based on 12 recent reviews that include 9 Buys and 3 Holds. The shares are trading for $73.98 and have an average price target of $89.45, suggesting ~21% gain on the one-year time frame. (See NEE stock forecast)Sempra Energy (SRE)Next up is Sempra Energy, a San Diego-based energy firm working to deliver power – electricity and natural gas – to some 40 million customers in California, Texas, and Mexico. Sempra is deeply involved in the shift toward cleaner energy technologies, including renewables, and is a major supplier and exporter of liquified natural gas (LNG), which generates significantly fewer carbon emissions than other fossil fuels.Sempra’s LNG operations are extensive. The company currently holds a large ownership stake in the 12 million ton per annum (Mtpa) export facility, Cameron LNG, located in Hackberry, Louisiana on the Gulf Coast. Befitting the firm’s home base in San Diego, Sempra is also working to develop LNG export terminals on the Pacific, at Energia Costa Azul in the northwest of Mexico’s Baja California peninsula. This facility offers potential to cut LNG export transit times to Asia from 21 days to 11 days.Natural gas is big business, and Sempra brought in $6.56 billion in total revenues during Q1 of this year. This was up 71.7% from the prior year, and beat the analysts’ forecast by over $2.5 billion. The company’s bottom line showed a solid profit; adjusted net earnings in 1Q23 came to $2.92 per share – 15 cents better than had been expected.Sempra is using its strong financial base to expand its infrastructure business. As noted, Sempra is building an LNG export facility in northwest Mexico – the company is working on additional LNG export terminals in Texas, to meet expanding global demand for LNG.Expansion of the infrastructure and further buildout of LNG export capabilities are prime points for investors to consider, in Carly Davenport’s opinion. The Goldman analyst writes of Sempra: “SRE has a significant project pipeline for LNG at its Sempra Infrastructure Business (SIP), with the potential for 62 mtpas of total capacity online if all proposed projects come to fruition, with SRE owning a portion of the capacity. While the projects will likely not come online until the late 2020s at the earliest, we expect progress towards reaching FID and beginning construction will serve as positive catalysts for SRE along the way… We view SRE’s business mix favorably and see SIP as a unique opportunity to gain exposure to LNG in the utility sector.”Davenport goes on to rate Sempra shares a Buy, with a $178 price target that shows her confidence in a 21% upside over the coming year.Overall, with 6 recent analyst reviews on file, including 4 Buys and 2 Holds, Sempra gets a Moderate Buy consensus rating from the Street. The shares are selling for $147.17, and their $172.17 average price target implies a 17% gain in the next 12 months. (See Sempra stock forecast)Xcel Energy (XEL)Last on our Goldman-backed energy list is Xcel Energy. This company is known for its commitment to clean, renewable power generation, and boasts a power generation portfolio that features wind, solar, and hydroelectric power, supplemented by natural gas, nuclear, and biomass generation.Power generation is useless without transmission, and Xcel boasts an extensive network of electricity transmission assets. This includes more than 1,200 substations and over 20,000 miles of transmission lines, capable of serving 22,000 megawatts of customer load. Xcel is working to expand this network, which is currently active across 10 states in two major regions of the country. Xcel has transmission networks in Texas-New Mexico-Colorado-Kansas-Oklahoma, as well as in the northern Plains and Great Lakes states of North and South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan.In addition to its power generation and transmission activity, Xcel has been promoting clean energy use and zero-emission vehicles. The company is involved in developing electric vehicle (EV) technology, and offers customers subscription services for renewable energy resources, including solar panel installations.On the financial side, Xcel’s 1Q23 results showed $4.08 billion in total revenues, a solid result that was up 8.8% year-over-year and beat the analyst estimates by $320 million. The bottom-line adj. EPS figure, of 76 cents per share, was up 8.5% y/y, and beat the forecast by 2 cents per share.For Goldman’s Carly Davenport, there are several reasons to back Xcel. She writes: “The primary drivers of our positive view are the accelerated coal replacement with regulated renewables, rate case activity that could drive improved earned vs. authorized ROEs, and leverage to the transmission build out opportunity. We view XEL’s wind and solar resource rich service territory as a key competitive advantage which should enable it to execute on its goals.”Putting some numbers where her mouth is, Davenport gives XEL shares a $75 price target, suggesting an 18% upside in the next 12 months, and supporting her Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating. (To watch Davenport’s track record, click here)Overall, XEL stock gets a Moderate Buy from the analyst consensus, based on 12 reviews with a breakdown of 5 Buys and 7 Holds. The shares have an average price target of $69.73 and a trading price of $63.57, implying upside potential of ~10% for the year ahead.

298,59a2d791-fc3f-360a-9e3c-30451f489989,VMC,2023-06-13,3 Reasons Why Growth Investors Shouldn't Overlook Vulcan (VMC),Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-reasons-why-growth-investors-164506167.html,1686588306,STORY,['VMC'],"[Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Our proprietary system currently recommends Vulcan Materials (VMC) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this construction materials company a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Vulcan is 7.2%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 27.6% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 16.3%.Cash Flow GrowthCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Vulcan is 17.3%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -7.3%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 13.3% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 9%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Vulcan. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1.9% over the past month.Bottom LineVulcan has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #1 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that Vulcan is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Yahoo Finance markets reporter Jared Blikre breaks down some of the index's biggest winners of the year so far.Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: So the S&amp;P 500 is in a technical bull market. So a good time to get technical with ""Yahoo Finance's"" Jared Blikre from the New York Stock Exchange. Hey, Jared.JARED BLIKRE: Well, technically speaking, yes, we are in a bull market. I want to examine some of the biggest winners this year. And we know a lot of those winners are in the AI category. We're talking about names we know, like, a-- excuse me, like Nvidia, like Alphabet, like Microsoft as well.But I was looking at the S&amp;P 500, some of the biggest winners this year. Tesla is in there, not as surprised, that's up almost 100%. AMD, not as surprised because that is a chip company, up about 90%. Royal Caribbean fills out the number five spot, that's up 85%. Then you have GE, that's been off my list for several years. That's up about 60% this year.Carnival, up over 60%. Salesforce, over 60%. And then, finally, PulteGroup. And I don't know if I'm saying that correctly, but P-U-L-T-E, residential construction name. It's this getting a little bit more broad-based.And so we're thinking back to that expansion of the rally last Friday-- not last Friday but the week before on that non-farm payroll. And is that going to stick? Another comment that really resonated with me from a guest prior was that this would be-- if we are in a new bull market right now, this would be the most unloved bull market or a start to a bull market that we've seen in decades maybe ever.I went through a global financial crisis. Some of the big ones like the Dot-Com bubble as well and some of the smaller ones, even some of the smaller pullbacks. Typically, at the beginning of these things, and this would have been traced back to October because that's when we had the lows, everything goes up. And then you have a period of consolidation pullback, people don't believe this is a new bull market. And then, things start getting narrowed and more selective.Story continuesWhat we did this time is we started the opposite way. And this isn't-- and this is assuming that we're still in a bull market but the opposite way would be we're starting out with a few narrow names and now we're expanding. So it doesn't mean, this doesn't have to be the case. But historically, it would be very unusual.A couple more things I want to point out here. Indices are getting very stretched. Even the S&amp;P 500 which was not as stretched as the NASDAQ, if you take a look at the S&amp;P 500 relative to its 50-day moving average getting very well extended, bespoke has a couple of notes and graphics out on this. But basically, we could be due for a mean reversion and that would just mean the price either has to come down or price has to stay level and a correction in time has to occur.Haven't seen any of those either of those things panned out just yet. Bottom line market overall's probably due for a pause or a pullback or what could happen is if this rotation continues, we could just see select pockets of the market advance while other ones take pauses. So all in all, we do have some momentum to the upside.We have this huge CPI report due out tomorrow, going to be a lot of headline risk from that as well as the Fed report. So enjoy today because things get a little messy starting tomorrow morning.- We will see. Thanks so much, Jared. We'll brace ourselves.]"

This move lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 0.93%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.56%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 1.71%.Heading into today, shares of the oil refiner had gained 2.6% over the past month, outpacing the Oils-Energy sector's gain of 2.37% and lagging the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.61% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Valero Energy as it approaches its next earnings report date. The company is expected to report EPS of $5.54, down 51.23% from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $35.58 billion, down 31.11% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $22.26 per share and revenue of $143.07 billion. These totals would mark changes of -23.66% and -18.89%, respectively, from last year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Valero Energy should also be noted by investors. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988.

This valuation marks a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 6.93.Story continuesWe can also see that VLO currently has a PEG ratio of 0.85. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account.

303,2fff1ba4-c200-3f5f-92c1-d03db3eedec0,VLO,2023-06-13,The 7 Most Reliable Dividend Stocks to Buy Now,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-most-reliable-dividend-stocks-230207870.html,1686092527,STORY,"['CVX', 'VLO', 'BKE', 'SNY', 'MSM', 'MAN', 'PKG']","[Primarily, investors target the most reliable dividend stocks to widen their margin of safety. At the end of the day, no matter what system you run or how much you listen to market gurus (or think you are one yourself), no one knows what the market will do. If they did, no one would be selling that information for any price.However, because of the unpredictability of the market, top dividend stocks to buy make plenty of sense. For example, if your capital returns don’t quite measure up, you can rely on the passive income component of your portfolio to help lift total net performance. As well, some investors may depend on these payouts to pay for everyday living expenses, which may be the case for high-yield reliable dividend stocks. Another reason to consider enterprises that offer recurring shareholder returns is stability. Dividends must come from somewhere, which means that companies providing passive income typically command established businesses. At a time like this, the below trustworthy dividend stocks may be well worth their weight in gold.MSMMSC Industrial$92.82MANManpower Group$75.43CVXChevron$155.79VLOValero Energy$109.27SNYSanofi$51.49PKGPackaging Corp. of America$129.57BKEBuckle$32.69MSC Industrial (MSM)A photo of a young boy wearing sunglasses, jeans, a blazer, a white shirt and suspenders holding money in various denominations in one hand and sitting in a plush chair.Source: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.comA direct marketer and supplier of a broad range of metalworking and maintenance and repair supplies, MSC Industrial (NYSE:MSM) offers broad relevancies for industrial enterprises throughout the U.S. Presently, the company carries a market capitalization of $5.23 billion. Since the beginning of this year, MSM gained almost 15% of its equity value.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWhile certainly not the most exciting name among the most reliable dividend stocks, MSC brings plenty of fiscal substance to the table. Mainly, the company enjoys a stable balance sheet. In particular, its equity-to-asset ratio comes in at 0.56, ranked above 67.53% of enterprises in the industrial distribution industry. Also, its Altman Z-Score clocks in at 5.81, indicating high stability and low risk of bankruptcy.Story continuesRegarding passive income, MSC carries a forward yield of 3.38%. Its payout ratio sits at just over 50%, which is near the upper end of what most investors consider a sustainable yield. Adding to its relevance, MSC features 19 years of consecutive dividend increases. Thus, it’s one of the top dividend stocks to buy from a holistic perspective.Manpower Group (MAN)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large text.Source: iQoncept/shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, ManpowerGroup (NYSE:MAN) bills itself as the leading global workforce solutions firm. Per its public profile, the company helps organizations transform in a fast-changing world of work by sourcing, assessing, developing, and managing the talent that enables them to win. Featuring a market cap of $3.78 billion, MAN stock dipped 11% since the Jan. opener.Nevertheless, ManpowerGroup makes a strong case for the most reliable dividend stocks. Fundamentally, while workers may maintain some of the edges against employers when it comes to negotiating workplace environments, the pendulum may swing under a recession. From a financial perspective, the company isn’t remarkable. That said, it does enjoy consistent profitability.Surely, its resilience in the bottom line helps with its passive income profile. Presently, ManpowerGroup carries a forward yield of 3.93%. In addition, its payout ratio sits at 40.33%, fostering confidence in terms of yield sustainability. Also, management posts 13 years of consecutive dividend increases. Thus, it makes a case for relevant and stable dividend stocks to consider.Chevron (CVX)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comOne of the world’s leading integrated energy companies, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) is involved in virtually every facet of the energy industry. Put another way, it commands business units in exploration and production (upstream), storage and transportation (midstream), and refining and marketing (downstream). As of this writing, Chevron carries a market cap of nearly $294 billion. Since the Jan. opener, CVX lost more than 10%.At first glance, CVX might not seem a viable idea for the most reliable dividend stocks. Further, looking ahead, the electrification of mobility seems to challenge hydrocarbons for their dominance. Still, the issue is that in many cases, the electricity that electric vehicles use comes from hydrocarbon sources. So, even incorporating the EV argument, fossil fuels will probably be relevant well into the future.Sure, it’s not the popular argument. However, it’s important to deal with realities. Combined with Chevron’s stout growth and profitability, it’s a reasonable idea for high-yield reliable dividend stocks. Indeed, CVX carries a forward yield of 3.87%. As well, its payout ratio sits at 41.32%, which is very reasonable. Finally, Chevron features 37 years of consecutive dividend increases, making a case for trustworthy dividend stocks to buy.Valero Energy (VLO)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockBased in San Antonio, Texas, Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO) is an international manufacturer and marketer of transportation fuels and petrochemical products. Per its corporate profile, Valero operates 15 petroleum refineries with a combined throughput capacity of approximately 3.2 million barrels per day and 13 ethanol plants with a combined production capacity of approximately 1.68 billion gallons per year. Featuring a market cap of $39.5 billion, VLO dipped 9% year-to-date.Again, the hydrocarbon narrative might not sound politically relevant given the push for EVs and renewable energy infrastructure. However, it’s also important to note that because of the intermittency, renewables represent the least reliable energy sources. Therefore, VLO should be relevant for decades to come, adding to its case for the most reliable dividend stocks. Also, investors may appreciate how undervalued VLO is. Right now, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 5.17, ranking better than 72.21% of the competition.Turning to passive income, Valero carries a forward yield of 3.73%. To be fair, it doesn’t have a history of dividend increases. Still, its payout ratio sits at 30.08%, potentially making it one of the trustworthy dividend stocks.Sanofi (SNY)sheet of paper marked ""dividends"" with a $20 bill on top of it to represent dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockHailing from Paris, France, Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) engages in the research and development, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical drugs principally in the prescription market. As well, its public profile mentions that it develops over-the-counter medication. At the moment, Sanofi carries a market cap of almost $129 billion. Since the beginning of this year, SNY gained more than 4% of its equity value.Standing among the top pharmaceutical firms in the world, Sanofi commands strong relevancies, thus making SNY enticing as one of the most reliable dividend stocks. Significantly, the company rates highly in terms of profitability. For example, its trailing-year net margin clocks in at 18.44%, outflanking 87.26% of companies listed in the drug manufacturing industry.Also, it’s undervalued. Right now, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 11.59. As a discount to projected earnings, Sanofi ranks better than 70.31% of the competition. Finally, the company’s forward yield stands at 3.73%, above the healthcare sector’s average yield of 1.58%. Also, its payout ratio sits at just under 39%, making SNY one of the top dividend stocks to buy.Packaging Corp of America (PKG)dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Lake Forest, Illinois, Packaging Corp of America (NYSE:PKG) is the third-largest producer of containerboard products and the third-largest producer of uncoated freesheet paper in North America. Currently, the company carries a market cap of $11.52 billion. Since the beginning of this year, PKG dipped ever so slightly below parity.Nevertheless, moving forward, PKG represents a strong case for the most reliable dividend stocks. Fundamentally, e-commerce continues to represent an overall burgeoning segment of total retail sales. Unless you anticipate this trend reversing, Packaging Corp should be quite relevant. Also, the company features overall solid (though arguably unremarkable) financial statistics. However, where Packaging clearly shines is in profitability. With a trailing-year net margin of 11.61%, the enterprise blows past 88.74% of its sector rivals.Lastly, Packaging features a forward yield of 3.9%, conspicuously outpacing the material sector’s average yield of 2.82%. To be sure, its payout ratio of 59.76% is a bit on the high side but it’s still reasonable. As well, the company features 12 years of consecutive payout increases, making PKG one of the high-yield reliable dividend stocks to consider.Buckle (BKE)image of hands holding small money bag symbolizing dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockArguably the riskiest idea for most reliable dividend stocks on this list, Buckle (NYSE:BKE) is an American fashion retailer. Offering a unique mix of high-quality, on-trend apparel, accessories, and footwear per its corporate profile, Buckle caters to fashion-conscious young men and women. Presently, it features a market cap of $1.66 billion. However, BKE lost almost 28% of its equity value since the Jan. opener. Obviously, that’s not a great selling point for trustworthy dividend stocks. However, on a financial note, Buckle enjoys a solid cash balance relative to the underlying industry. Also, its Altman Z-Score clocks in at 5.69, indicating low bankruptcy risk.Moreover, Buckle resonates with its audience as evidenced by its three-year revenue growth rate of 13.7%. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period impresses at 30%. With all that, BKE remains undervalued, trading at a forward multiple of only 8.4.In closing, Buckle carries a forward yield of 4.27%. As well, its payout ratio sits at just under 33%. For those seeking top dividend stocks to buy with a contrarian twist, BKE might be interesting.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

304,c99b0389-b3e3-305d-981e-8283e3d98fc2,VLO,2023-06-13,The 3 Best Biofuel Stocks to Buy Now,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-best-biofuel-stocks-buy-141957967.html,1686061197,STORY,"['GPRE', 'VLO', 'ADM']","[In April of this year, OPEC announced surprise oil production cuts to maintain higher prices, which had fallen since the pandemic’s end. With oil prices being supported in this way, some have called on biofuels to fill the gap. This includes the Biden Administration, which has called on more biofuel production to maintain energy independence. With oil prices elevated and electric cars still a minority on roads, biofuel companies have plenty of room to grow in America’s energy industry.Even as the electrification of transportation continues, biofuels still have a role to play as an energy of the future. Biofuels can use much of the same infrastructure as oil and burn more cleanly to boot. And many states already mandate gasoline use, while their use continues to expand into other areas as well. There are still certain types of transport for which electric vehicles probably won’t replace internal combustion for the foreseeable future. Biofuels will be needed to fuel those vehicles if we don’t want oil to do so.The bottom line is that nations want clean transportation, but electric vehicles aren’t ready to fulfill every role. If the nations of the world are going to meet their climate goals and maintain transport infrastructure, they will need biofuels, and biofuel companies, to be ready. So here are 3 of the best biofuel companies to invest in.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsArcher-Daniels-Midland (ADM)red tractor in yellow field with clouds behind itSource: ShutterstockArcher-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM) is a global agriculture and food company and a top-rated biofuel stock. ADM has produced biofuels for over a decade in both Europe and America and has a long history as a top-rated biofuel stock.ADM sits at the intersection of biofuel and agribusiness. In addition to biofuels, they produce food, feed, and various other industrial products. This diverse business model gives them a lot of leeway and means their stock isn’t so dependent on the oil price remaining high. For an investor who wants exposure to the biofuel industry but isn’t sure where oil will go, buying ADM lets you hedge your bets.Story continuesADM has also branched out into carbon capture and storage. This also makes ADM a good choice for an investor wanting to invest in a company that’s fighting climate change. Not only do their biofuels burn more cleanly than traditional fossil fuels, but they’re also working to capture much of the carbon by-products that are produced.ADM’s earnings show them to be a strong and stable company overall. In Q1 2023, they had $24.1 billion in revenue and $1.17 billion in net earnings. Those revenues and earnings are also growing, albeit slowly. Overall, ADM shows promise as a reliable investment that can take advantage of the world’s transition to biofuels. And that makes them one of the best biofuel stocks to invest in.Valero (VLO)A daytime picture of a Valero (VLO) gas station located in San Francisco bay and clear blue sky in the background.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comValero (NYSE:VLO) may be best known as an oil company, but it has emerged as a formidable player in the biofuel industry. As the world’s second-largest producer of corn ethanol, Valero is a top-rated biofuel stock that should be on any investor’s radar.Valero produces corn-ethanol, biodiesel, and hydrated vegetable oil production. They’ve also taken part in a joint venture with Darling Ingredients (NYSE:DAR) called Diamond Green Diesel, which has become one of the largest producers of biodiesel in the world. In fact, Diamond Green Diesel is also looking to produce jet fuel. This is key as large trucks and airplanes are a few areas that have struggled to transition from oil to electric power. Bio-fuels could prove necessary to bridge that gap.Valero’s biofuels division has experienced robust growth, particularly evident in its strong performance during Q1 2023. Revenue in both ethanol and biodiesel segments has grown far more rapidly than revenue from traditional hydrocarbons. This has allowed Valero to remain competitive where other oil companies struggle.Even as transportation becomes more and more electrified, there will still be a market for internal combustion engines in airplanes and trucks. And as nations struggle to reduce their carbon output, biofuels, especially biodiesel, will be seen as a better and better alternative to traditional fossil fuels. Valero has positioned itself well for this future, which makes it a top-rated biofuel company you won’t want to miss out on.Green Plains (GPRE)Ecology, alternative sustainable energy and environment protection saving business concept, GEVOSource: Oleksiy Mark / Shutterstock.comWhile Green Plains (NASDAQ:GPRE) may be a small cap, it has significant upside fueled by its partnerships.Green Plains has created a joint venture with United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) and Tallgrass Energy (privately held) to produce jet fuel from ethanol. With airplanes being a form of travel still innately tied to internal combustion engines, nations want to reduce their carbon cost as much as possible. Bio-jet fuel is a promising avenue, and by partnering directly with an airliner Green Plains has a direct path into this niche.Additionally, Ancora (privately held) is a large shareholder of Green Plains and has urged it to explore a potential sale, citing a possible buyout price of $50 per share. This represents a substantial upside from the current stock price of $29 per share. While the sale is no more than a suggestion now, some are clearly considering the idea. And such a sale could mean a swift return for investors.Green Plains is still a riskier prospect than some other biofuel companies. They are much smaller and less diversified than their peers, for one. And their Q1 2023 earnings show a net loss of $66 million, despite revenue growing to $832 million. Green Plains still has $354 million in cash and cash equivalents, so they aren’t at risk of bankruptcy. But they need to show profitability in addition to growing revenue to truly unlock their potential. Nevertheless, their partnerships and the potential of a sale give them a significant upside. So even if they’re volatile, you should keep Green Plains on your watchlist as a high-return biofuel stock.On the date of publication, John Blankenhorn did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: UnitedHealth Group Incorporated UNH, Johnson Controls International plc JCI, Casey's General Stores, Inc. CASY and TotalEnergies SE TTE.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:4 Stocks to Watch on Dividend Hikes as Economic Worries WorsenWall Street has been going through a turbulent phase over the past couple of months despite starting the year on a high. Although all three major indexes closed higher last week, the volatility continues over growing concerns of the economy slipping into a recession later this year.The Nasdaq had an impressive May, ending 5.8% higher, driven by a rally in tech stocks. The S&amp;P 500 also ended 0.2% higher but the Dow suffered throughout the month, ending 3.5% down.This is because stocks are struggling for direction as market participants have so far been unable to gauge the Fed’s future interest rate hike path.Investors are now looking forward to the Fed’s next policy meeting scheduled for this month. Expectations are high that the Fed might finally pause hiking interest rates in this meeting but the picture isn’t clear yet. The central bank has already hiked interest rates on 10 consecutive occasions, with interest rates currently in the range of 5.00-5.25% range.Inflation has lately started showing signs of easing but it is still a lot higher than the Fed’s target range of 2%. There are multiple other concerns that have been unsettling stocks. Although the unemployment rate rose to 3.7% in May, the highest in several years, the labor market continues to be resilient.According to the latest jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, nonfarm payrolls increased by 339,000 in May against expectations of 190,000. The strong labor market has raised concerns that the Fed might be forced to continue with its aggressive interest rate hike stance.Story continuesBesides, market participants are also closely watching the global economy, which has further raised concerns. On Jun 8, the Eurozone slipped into recession after the 20-nation block’s economy declined 0.1% in the first quarter of 2023, after contracting in the final quarter of 2022.Last month, Germany said that its economy entered recession after shrinking 0.3% between January and March. Also, China, which is considered the global manufacturing hub, has been witnessing a contraction in economic activity. Factory activity shrunk at the fastest pace in the first five months of the year in China, while service activity has advanced at its slowest pace in the past four months.Stocks in FocusGiven this situation, betting on dividend-paying stocks would be a wise decision.

308,cd236d64-ab0c-3b4a-93fe-2272b8afd1d7,DHI,2023-06-13,What You Need to Note Ahead of Lennar's (LEN) Q2 Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/note-ahead-lennars-len-q2-170300269.html,1686589380,STORY,"['LEN', 'DHI', 'LEN-B', 'KBH', 'PHM']","[Lennar Corporation LEN is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2023 results (ended May 31) after the closing bell on Jun 14.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings and revenues topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 35.9% and 8.1%, respectively. It is to be noted that this Miami-based homebuilder surpassed earnings expectations in the trailing 16 quarters.On a year-over-year basis, fiscal first-quarter earnings decreased 21% but revenues grew 5%.The Trend in Estimate RevisionFor the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share has moved up to $2.32 from $2.31 in the past 30 days. The estimated figure indicates a decrease of 50.5% from $4.69 reported in the year-ago quarter. The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $7.28 billion, suggesting a 12.9% decline from the year-ago reported figure of $8.36 billion.Lennar Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Lennar Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseLennar Corporation price-eps-surprise | Lennar Corporation QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up for this company.Factors to NoteLennar’s fiscal second-quarter home sales are expected to have decreased from the year-ago level, owing to the ongoing challenges in the industry comprising a softer demand environment. The increase in mortgage rates since March 2022 and uncertain macroeconomic conditions are playing spoilsport.We expect home sales to decrease by 16.2% year over year to $6,675.4 million in the quarter. Homebuilding revenues are expected to be $6,775.7 million, down 15.1% year over year.On the fiscal first-quarter earnings call, LEN highlighted that it expects home deliveries of 15,000-16,000 units at an average price of $435,000-$445,000 (suggesting a decline from $483,000 a year ago).Meanwhile, the consensus estimate for deliveries for the to-be-reported quarter is currently pegged at 15,619 homes, indicating a decline from 16,549 units a year ago. The consensus mark for the average price is pegged at $442,000.Lennar expects new orders in the range of 16,000-17,000, pointing to a decrease from 17,792 reported in second-quarter fiscal 2022. The weakness in the overall market might have dented the fiscal second quarter’s order pattern. The consensus estimate for new orders is currently pegged at 16,653 homes, indicating a fall from 17,792 reported a year ago, owing to the softness in housing demand.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for backlog (units and values) is currently pegged at 20,415 homes or $9.7 billion compared with the year-ago quarter’s figures of 28,624 units or $14.69 billion.Unprecedented supply-chain issues, increased inflation and higher land, labor and raw material costs are expected to have put pressure on fiscal second-quarter margins. The company expects the homebuilding gross margin to be 21-21.5%, pointing to a decline from 29.5% a year ago.That said, Lennar has been focusing on continuous improvement of the homebuilding selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) line, owing to operating leverage and investments in technology. Yet, lower sales are expected to put pressure on operating leverage. The company expects SG&amp;A expenses, as a percentage of home sales, to be nearly 7.2-7.4%. A year ago, the metric was recorded at 6.1%.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Lennar this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. This is the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of +2.46%.

Horton (DHI) Benefit from Multi-Year Recovery in Residential Construction?,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-d-r-horton-dhi-122705977.html,1686572825,STORY,"['DHI', 'LEN-B']","[Third Avenue Management, an investment management company based in New York City, released its “Real Estate Value Fund” first quarter 2023 investor letter. A copy of the same can be downloaded here. In the quarter the fund returned +1.99% (net fees) compared to +1.04% (before fees) for the Fund’s most relevant benchmark, the FTSE EPRA NAREIT Developed Index. Holdings in US-based homebuilders, UK-centric real estate, and Industrial and Logistics REITs were the leading contributors of the fund in the quarter while, investments in certain Real Estate Operating Companies and the Preferred Equity of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were detracted. In addition, you can check the top 5 holdings of the fund to know its best picks in 2023.Third Avenue Real Estate Value Fund highlighted stocks like D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) in the first quarter 2023 investor letter. Headquartered in Arlington, Texas, D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) is a homebuilding company. On June 9, 2023, D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) stock closed at $114.01 per share. One-month return of D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) was 4.99%, and its shares gained 61.97% of their value over the last 52 weeks. D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) has a market capitalization of $38.886 billion.Third Avenue Real Estate Value Fund made the following comment about D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:""The primary contributors to performance during the quarter included the Fund’s investments in leading US-based homebuilders (Lennar Corp. and D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI)), UK-centric real estate holdings (Berkeley Group and Savills plc), and Industrial and Logistics REITs (Prologis, First Industrial and Segro plc).The Fund’s other activity during the period was modest in nature and included slight reductions to certain holdings for portfolio management purposes (Lennar Corp., D.R. Horton, FNF Group, Wharf Holdings, and AMH).After factoring in this activity, the Fund had 41% of its capital invested in Residential Real Estate companies with strong ties to the U.S. and U.K. residential markets—where there remain supply deficits after years of under-building. In conjunction with near record-low inventory levels, there also remains significant demand for new products at affordable price points (both for-sale and for-rent). Therefore, these Fund holdings seem positioned to benefit from a multi-year recovery in residential construction and ancillary activities, particularly as mortgage rates stabilize for conforming loans. At the end of the quarter, these holdings included a diversified set of businesses including homebuilding (Lennar Group and DR Horton), timberland ownership and management (Weyerhaeuser and Rayonier), planned development (Berkeley Group and Five Point Holdings), the ownership and development of rental properties (AMH, Grainger plc, and Ingenia Communities), as well as other ancillary businesses (Lowe’s and Trinity Place Holdings).""Story continuesBest Housing Homebuilder Stocks To Buy NowD.R.

Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study Principal Financial Group's  ROE in this article.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. Check out our latest analysis for Principal Financial Group How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Principal Financial Group is:42% = US$4.4b ÷ US$11b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.42 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Principal Financial Group's Earnings Growth And 42% ROETo begin with, Principal Financial Group has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 9.8% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. As a result, Principal Financial Group's exceptional 21% net income growth seen over the past five years, doesn't come as a surprise.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Principal Financial Group's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 14% in the same period, which is great to see.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is PFG fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Principal Financial Group Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Principal Financial Group has a three-year median payout ratio of 38% (where it is retaining 62% of its income) which is not too low or not too high. By the looks of it, the dividend is well covered and Principal Financial Group is reinvesting its profits efficiently as evidenced by its exceptional growth which we discussed above.Besides, Principal Financial Group has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 39%. Still, forecasts suggest that Principal Financial Group's future ROE will drop to 13% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with Principal Financial Group's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. With that said, on studying the latest analyst forecasts, we found that while the company has seen growth in its past earnings, analysts expect its future earnings to shrink.

If you want to read about some more mining companies, go directly to Top 5 Mining Countries in the World.The mining industry is a key player in the global economy, providing essential raw materials that fuel various industries and contribute to economic growth. From precious metals to fossil fuels, minerals extracted from the earth's crust are integral to manufacturing, construction, energy production, and technological advancements. In this article, we delve into the top 20 mining countries in the world, exploring their mineral wealth, production capabilities, and the significant role they play in shaping the global mining landscape.Mining has been an essential human activity for centuries, driving exploration and extraction in pursuit of valuable resources. Today, mining operations span across continents, with countries harnessing their geological advantages to access and utilize mineral reserves. These resources serve as the backbone of industrial development, enabling nations to meet domestic demands, stimulate exports, and foster economic prosperity.Mining is the process of extracting minerals and other valuable resources from the earth. It involves several stages, beginning with exploration to identify potential mineral deposits. Once a deposit is discovered, feasibility studies are conducted to assess the viability of extraction. If deemed economically viable, mining operations commence, involving excavation, blasting, and transportation of ore to processing facilities. Finally, the processed minerals are refined and prepared for distribution and use in various industries.The mining industry operates on a global scale, with countries around the world participating in mineral extraction. Each country possesses a unique geological composition, leading to variations in the types of minerals available for mining. Some countries are rich in mineral resources, while others have limited reserves. These disparities contribute to the formation of mining countries that are distinguished by their mineral wealth and their ability to exploit and process those resources.Story continuesSome of the top firms working in the mining sector around the world include Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE), Wheaton Precious Metals Corp.

The total value of mineral and metal exports for each country is calculated by multiplying the exported volume of each commodity by its corresponding market price. The export values of all relevant minerals and metals are summed up to obtain the total export value.Countries can be compared and ranked based on both the mineral production volume and the export value. Typically, countries with high production volumes and significant export values rank higher in the list. The specific weight or importance given to each metric may vary depending on the methodology used or the specific ranking criteria. The rankings should be analyzed and interpreted in the context of the global mining industry. Factors such as the diversity of commodities, the value-added processing of minerals and the stability of export markets can also influence a country's ranking. Additional factors or metrics, such as reserves or investment attractiveness, may be considered to provide a more comprehensive assessment.It's worth noting that rankings based on these metrics are subject to data availability, accuracy, and variations in methodology used by different organizations or reports. Therefore, it's important to refer to reliable sources and consider multiple metrics when assessing the top mining countries.

Despite being outperformed by Merck's Keytruda, Opdivo holds unique positions in specific indications. It gained FDA approval for previously untreated stomach cancer and has indications in front-line kidney cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and metastatic melanoma.Patient volume across tumor types still lags behind pre-COVID levels, affecting Opdivo's performance. BMS's combination therapies, such as Opdivo-Yervoy for kidney cancer and Opdivo-relatlimab for metastatic melanoma, contribute to its market position. Opdivo by Bristol Myer Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) also approved early-stage NSCLC treatment, presenting the potential for solid uptake.12. Imbruvica2022 Sales: $8.35 billionImbruvica, co-developed by AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s Janssen, shows steady sales growth and the potential for continued success, with a total sales of $8.35 billion in 2022. AbbVie's patent strategy ensures exclusivity for Imbruvica until March 2032, giving it a competitive edge.As a first-in-class lymphoma drug, Imbruvica achieved blockbuster status quickly but now faces competition from AstraZeneca's Calquence and BeiGene's Brukinsa. However, Imbruvica's established position and ongoing clinical success make it a key revenue driver for AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), especially with the anticipated biosimilar competition for its immunology drug Humira.11. Stelara2022 Sales: $9.72 billionJohnson &amp; Johnson's Stelara, the first biologic treatment to inhibit the IL-12 and IL-23 pathways, has become the company's most extensive product, representing almost 10% of its total revenue. Despite recent competition from biosimilars and a loss to AbbVie, Inc. (NYSE:ABBV)'s Humira in Crohn's disease, Stelara experienced sales growth of over 20% in 2020. With its patent set to expire in September 2023, J&amp;J is focusing on marketing efforts and patient empowerment to maximize Stelara's potential before biosimilars enter the market.10. Revlimid2022 Sales: $9.97 billionBristol Myers Squibb's blockbuster blood cancer drug, Revlimid, faces a significant decline in sales due to the introduction of generic competitors. Sandoz and Stada Arzneimittel have launched their generic versions in multiple countries. BMS expected Revlimid's sales to drop from $12.8 billion in 2021 to around $9.5 billion to $10 billion in 2022.Several other companies, including Natco Pharma, Sun Pharma, Zydus Cadila, Cipla, and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, have launched or plan to launch their generic versions. Bristol Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) is focusing on other products like Opdivo, Yervoy, and Eliquis and upcoming launches to mitigate the impact of Revlimid's loss.9. Biktarvy2022 Sales: $10.39 billionGilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD)' HIV drug Biktarvy was the top-selling infectious disease pharmaceutical product until the impact of COVID-19. In 2022, Biktarvy's sales reached $10.39 billion, surpassing GlaxoSmithKline's HIV unit. It became the most successful HIV therapy globally, with a significant market share in the U.S. and Europe.However, GSK's dolutegravir-based portfolio attracted the most switch patients. Biktarvy faces competition from long-acting regimens like Cabenuva. Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) settled a patent infringement lawsuit with ViiV Healthcare, agreeing to pay $1.25 billion and 3% royalties for future sales of Biktarvy.8. Eylea2022 Sales: $12.72 billionEylea, a leading ophthalmology drug by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN), maintains its market leadership despite increasing competition. It is used to treat diabetic eye disease and age-related macular degeneration. Eylea's sales reached $5.79 billion in the U.S. in 2021, as reported by Fierce Pharma.Novartis' Beovu initially posed a challenge but faced safety concerns. Roche's Vabysmo is expected to provide intense competition. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) is developing a high-dose version of Eylea. Although biosimilar competition looms, Eylea is projected to remain dominant in the ophthalmology market.You can read more on Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) in our list of the largest biotech companies in the US.7. Dupixent2022 Sales: $17.41 billion Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) and Regeneron Pharmaceutical, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN)'s Dupixent, a leading immunology drug, exceeded expectations with sales growth of 46% in Q1 2022, reaching 1.61 billion euros ($1.79 billion). The drug's market penetration in adults with atopic dermatitis is currently at 8%, indicating significant growth potential.Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) aims to expand Dupixent's reach to at least 1.5 million more patients globally by 2025. The revised goal is to achieve peak sales surpassing 13 billion euros ($13.98 billion) , driven by its dominance in atopic dermatitis and FDA approvals for asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis, and eosinophilic esophagitis.6. Eliquis2022 Sales: $18.26 billionEliquis, the blood thinner jointly developed by Bristol Myers Squibb and Pfizer, Inc. (NYSE:PFE), has experienced remarkable sales growth. In 2022 alone, the drug generated $18.26 billion in sales. While Bristol Myers Squibb acknowledges the future challenges posed by patent expirations and the entry of generics, the company remains optimistic. It expects continued growth from existing drugs, including Eliquis, as well as from new product launches, which are projected to contribute significantly to the company's growth trajectory until 2029.Click to see and continue reading the 5 Most Profitable Drugs In The World. Suggested Articles:25 Most Prescribed Medication in the World.25 Best Hospitals for Cancer Treatment in the World.20 Most Used Prescription Drugs In The US.Disclosure.

From the heady days of the pandemic when companies were racing to develop a vaccine against Covid-19, the industry is now enduring a hangover as both demand and sales decline. This means there’s more than a couple biotech stocks to sell. The iShares US Pharmaceuticals ETF (NYSEARCA:IHE) that tracks the industry is down 10% over the last 12 months and major players such as Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) have seen their share price decline 25% so far in 2023.The downtrend continues, showing no signs of reversal. Investors should avoid the biotechnology sector for now. If already involved, it’s time to exit. Biotech and pharmaceutical makers face strong bearish sentiment. Here’s your guide to three biotech stocks. Sell them in June. Dodge the crash and burn.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsRegeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN)pregnant woman visit gynecologist doctor at hospital or medical clinic for pregnancy consultant.Source: Blue Planet Studio / Shutterstock.comWhat little gains Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN) had achieved this year were largely wiped out over the past month as the company’s share price fell 8%. The brand is now up only 2% on the year and trending lower.The stock did well during the pandemic when its antibody treatment was used to treat Covid-19, including in former President Donald Trump when he caught the respiratory disease.The U.S. government propped up Regeneron. It spent billions on the company’s Covid-19 antiviral treatment. But now, those sales have dwindled. The stock price is falling. Regeneron still sells a popular vision-loss treatment, “Eylea,” and an eczema medication, “Dupixent”. However, its pipeline for potential new products looks thin. The Covid-19 sales have virtually evaporated. This makes the company one of those biotech stocks to sell.Moderna (MRNA)Moderna logo is seen at the entrance to its headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Moderna, Inc., (MRNA) is an American pharmaceutical and biotechnology company.Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comAnother pandemic star whose fortunes have dimmed is Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA). Year to date, Moderna is down 27%. The share price is now 70% lower than its all-time high of $450 reached in September 2021.Story continuesThe stock skyrocketed during the pandemic as its Covid-19 vaccine was one of the first to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The company sold more than $18.4 billion of Covid-19 vaccines globally in 2022.The company’s 2022 vaccine sales didn’t hit the projected $22 billion. The situation worsened with the Covid-19 vaccine sales forecast for 2023. It’s a mere $5 billion, a 73% drop from the previous year. This sent traders and investors scrambling to sell. MRNA stock went into a prolonged decline. Moderna’s other product line-up looks bleak. Its Covid-19 vaccine is the company’s only successful commercial product. This leaves investors questioning, “What’s next?”Novavax (NVAX)Novavax (NVAX) research laboratory logotype enlarged with a magnifying glass.This laboratory has developed a vaccine against the covid-19 virus. NVAX price predictions.Source: pixinoo / Shutterstock.comThe last, and arguably worst, biotech stock that investors should consider selling in June before it crashes and burns is Novavax (NASDAQ:NVAX). The reality is that NVAX stock has already crashed and burned, having declined 83% over the past 12 months and now in danger of falling into penny stock territory. Sadly, it doesn’t appear that the share price has yet reached a bottom. As with the other names on this list, Novavax’s troubles stem from its focus on developing a treatment for Covid-19.When the pandemic hit, Novavax pivoted from developing treatments for infectious diseases to developing a Covid-19 vaccine. However, repeated delays and problems cost the company dearly as its Covid-19 vaccine did not receive FDA approval until late last year. By then, the pandemic was in its final innings and Novavax was left to sell its treatment as a booster shot in developed countries and focus on sales to emerging nations in Africa and Asia. The company most recently reported revenue of only $81 million and cut 25% of its workforce.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Joel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

Most industry players are looking to drive their bottom line amid the headwinds through cost reduction.Partly due to these headwinds, the industry has declined 5.1% over the past six months against the S&amp;P 500 Index’s 7.9% appreciation. The broader Zacks Transportation sector has lost 0.3% in the said time frame.Despite the challenges surrounding the industry, some railroad companies like Union Pacific Corporation and Norfolk Southern Corporation have consistently announced dividend hikes, thus highlighting their pro-shareholder stance.Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these companies have superior fundamentals like a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics.How to Pick Stocks With Solid Dividend Payouts?In order to choose some of the best dividend stocks from the aforementioned industry, we have run the Zacks Stock Screener to identify stocks with a dividend yield in excess of 2% and a sustainable dividend payout ratio of less than 60%. Each of the two stocks mentioned below carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Story continuesUnion Pacific: Headquartered in Omaha, NE, Union Pacific, through its subsidiary, Union Pacific Railroad Company, operates in the railroad business in the United States. Currently, it has a market capitalization of $122.94 billion.UNP pays out a quarterly dividend of $1.30 ($5.20 annualized) per share, which gives it a 2.58% yield at the current stock price. This company’s payout ratio is 45% of its earnings at present. The five-year dividend growth rate is 12.02%. (Check Union Pacific’s dividend history here).Union Pacific’s consistent initiatives to reward its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases look encouraging. UNP hiked its dividend twice in 2021. In May 2022, UNP’s board of directors increased its quarterly cash dividend by 10% to $1.30 per share. Notably, Union Pacific has been paying dividends on its common stock for 123 consecutive years.During first-quarter 2023, UNP paid dividends worth $795 million and repurchased shares worth $575 million. In 2022, UNP paid dividends worth $3,159 million and repurchased shares worth $6,282 million. For 2023, management continues to anticipate a dividend payout of approximately 45% (of earnings).Norfolk Southern: Headquartered in Atlanta, GA, Norfolk Southern engages in the rail transportation of raw materials, intermediate products and finished goods in the United States. Currently, it has a market capitalization of $49.66 billion.NSC pays out a quarterly dividend of $1.35 ($5.40 annualized) per share, which gives it a 2.48% yield at the current stock price. This company’s payout ratio is 38% of its earnings at present. The five-year dividend growth rate is 11.95%. (Check Norfolk Southern’s dividend history here).Norfolk Southern's consistent initiatives to reward its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases are encouraging. In January 2023, the company's board announced a dividend hike of 9%, thereby raising its quarterly dividend payout from $1.24 per share to $1.35. In first-quarter 2023, Norfolk Southern paid dividends worth $307 million and repurchased and retired 0.6 million shares for $163 million.In 2022, Norfolk Southern paid dividends worth $1,167 million and repurchased and retired common stock worth $3,110 million.

It is on track with the execution of its Power Plan 2023 plan.An uptrend in the Zacks Consensus Estimate echoes the same sentiment. Earnings estimates for GPS’s current financial year have increased 4.9% to 64 cents over the past 30 days.Let’s Delve DeeperGap has long been gaining from the continued momentum across its Athleta brand. The Athleta brand’s value-driven active and lifestyle categories, increased digital marketing investments, and focus on product strategy have been aiding sales.Although net sales fell 11% in first-quarter fiscal 2023 for the Athleta brand, the metric grew 45% from the pre-pandemic levels. Segmental results gained from continued share gains. Increased focus on performance-active and active lifestyle products to capitalize on the evolving shopping trends bodes well. It has also emerged as one of the fastest-growing women's athleisure brands in North America. Driven by these factors, Athleta remains on track to reach $2 billion in net sales by fiscal 2023.The company remains on track with aggressively undertaking cost-management actions in the fiscal first quarter. It has been making efforts to simplify and optimize its operating model and structure, including increasing spans of control and decreasing management layers to improve the quality and speed of decision-making, as well as creating a consistent organizational structure across all four brands.These actions are expected to generate $300 million in annualized savings, of which half is expected to be realized in the latter half of fiscal 2023. Apart from these efforts, the company is expected to realize $250 million in annualized savings, as announced in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Gap revealed plans to further optimize its marketing spend and rationalize its technology investments over the next few years.The execution of its Power Plan 2023, which focuses on opening highly-profitable Old Navy and Athleta stores, while closing the underperforming Gap and Banana Republic stores, bodes well. As part of the plan, the company expects the Old Navy and Athleta brands to contribute about 70% of sales by 2023.As part of its 350 store closure plan, the company expects to close 50-55 Gap and Banana Republic stores this year. It is likely to fulfill its 350 store closure plan by the end of 2023. GPS has already achieved 90% of the target in 2022. With the closing of underperforming Gap and Banana Republic stores, the company expects to realize $100 million in EBITDA savings on an annualized basis by the end of 2023. It anticipates leveraging its powerful platform to deliver competitive omni capabilities to meet customers’ needs, all fueled by its scaled operations.GPS targets the e-commerce business to contribute 50% of sales by the end of 2023. Through the plan, the company expects to deliver consistent sales growth, margin expansion and strong operating cash flow.Such cost-saving efforts led to an adjusted SG&amp;A (as a percentage of sales) leverage of 60 basis points to 36.6%. Adjusted gross margin of 37.2% expanded 570 basis points (bps) year over year due to a 610-bps rise in adjusted merchandise margins, stemming from lower airfreight and improved promotions, offset by inflationary headwinds. The adjusted operating margin expanded 620 bps to 0.5%, driven by improved gross margin, stemming from reduced air freight expenses and improved promotional activity.Consequently, Gap’s bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved year over year. For the fiscal first quarter, adjusted earnings of a penny per share compared favorably against a loss of 44 cents reported in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Notably, the second quarter and fiscal 2023 gross margins are envisioned to expand year over year.Story continuesHeadwinds to OvercomeGap has been reeling under uncertain macro and consumer environments. This led to a year-over-year sales decline of 6%. Comparable sales (comps) fell 3% on a year-over-year basis. Management anticipates fiscal 2023 sales to decrease in the low to mid-single-digit range compared to our estimate of a 4.6% decline. For second-quarter fiscal 2023, it expects sales to decrease in the mid to high-single-digit range, whereas it reported $3.86 billion last year. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research ConclusionAlthough GPS shares have lost 7.3% in the past three months compared with the industry’s decline of 4.8%, strength in its Athleta brand, cost-saving efforts and the Power Plan 2023 are likely to aid. Topping it, a VGM Score of A and a long-term earnings growth rate of 12% raise optimism in this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked companies that investors may consider are Tecnoglass TGLS, Kroger KR and TJX Companies TJX.Tecnoglass manufactures and sells architectural glass and aluminum products for the residential and commercial construction industries. TGLS currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

She shares more about her early connection with nature, the evolution of her career at Cisco over the past 20 years, and how digitization can go hand-in-hand with sustainability.When did your interest in sustainability begin?Jutta: My interest in sustainability has been with me my entire life because I grew up on a farm in Germany that was a four-generation household. We had cows, sheep, pigs, rabbits, cats and dogs of course. It was a small farm, but it was lovely, and I had a beautiful childhood. Nature and animals have been with me since I started to breathe, walk, think, and act, so it is always close to my heart.From a business perspective, I think about how we are embedding sustainability across Cisco operations, and how our products and solutions can support our customers in reaching their net-zero goals. About two years ago, a colleague was tasked with setting up a tiger team to enhance our sustainability strategy for our Europe, Middle East, and Africa region. She reached out and asked if I wanted to join that community, and I was happy to say yes.Story continuesFrom that moment on, I was diving in, embracing, and inhaling the topic of sustainability for Cisco in Germany. A significant task is bringing our corporate approach, our products, and our solutions closer to our customers, partners and other stakeholders.Tell us more about what brought you to Cisco and your current job responsibilities.Jutta: I started working at Cisco in January 2000, so I have been here for over 23 years. At that time, I worked for an IT distributor, and somebody from Cisco reached out to me. So, I came to Cisco and started as a marketing manager for Cisco's small and medium business (SMB).Over the years, I held various marketing and communications-related roles, first in Germany and then in Central Europe where the sales region consisted of 19 countries at the time. In 2015 I went back to Germany to lead Cisco's Channels and Partner Organization for over five and a half years, which offers solutions, training, tools, and support to help value-added resellers (VARs). I'm also part of Cisco Germany's Management Board.Now I am the Director for Sustainability, CDA and the Country Plan in Germany. Importantly, we are seeing that sustainability can help with digitization, including as far as solutions are concerned, and vice versa. They are tightly connected.You led Cisco's Channels and Partner Organization. How did your work with partners prepare you for your role in CDA?Jutta: Leading a partner organization is challenging, and I loved it. It requires a lot of resiliency, agility, and persistence. Those competencies are also needed for sustainability. Sustainability is being integrated across our company, and it is increasingly important for the business organization we drive, our portfolio and customer landscape. Having that established network and persistence in moving the topic forward is essential, especially since it is a rapidly developing topic from a sales perspective. Further, Cisco has been reporting on sustainability since 2005. So, I can build on that knowledge, and on the other side, I have those relationships with our partners and a good entrance point for sustainability in our conversations. The doors are open; I have to go through them and raise further awareness about our sustainability journey.Can you tell us more about the sustainability initiatives that CDA is leading and the impact you hope to make?Jutta: As mentioned earlier, sustainability and digitization are tightly interconnected, and sustainability is becoming important for businesses.One example is one of our customers and partners in Germany - Deutsche Telekom (DT). DT deployed the Cisco 8000 Series based on Cisco Silicon One, the router with transmission speed of 260 terabits per second (Tbps). DT has reported that the move from the Cisco CRS-X multi-chassis system to the Cisco 8000 Series routers has reduced power consumption by up to 92 percent per 100 gigabits per second (Gbps). In addition, DT has also reported that the high connection density of the routers leads to a reduction in space requirements from eight racks to one rack per system. We see that companies can save energy and space with innovations developed by Cisco.Currently we are working with one of the biggest global sports retailers. With the support of CDA we are investing in the development of a sustainability dashboard to monitor and visualize in real-time various parameters like energy consumption, climate, oxygen, and heating. Initially, the dashboard is expected to be implemented in one of the company's new pilot retail stores. Of course, the goal is a global scale implementation.CDA is a wonderful program to support our customers and accelerate their digitization and sustainability efforts.Why is it important for corporations and people to care about a sustainable and regenerative future?Jutta: We see, hear, and experience global climate change. Depending on where you are living in the world, it is with different intensity. Companies can play a key role in taking action, and Cisco is making this a priority.And, not to forget each one of us. As employees and as private citizens, we can start taking action. For example, calculating your personal carbon footprint can help you get transparency on your impact and identify your own private actions to reduce it.I heard you're passionate about animal welfare. Can you tell us more about that?Jutta: From a sustainability perspective, I can touch on biodiversity and how important animals are for our survival as humans. If you don't plant trees, the insects will not have a home. The bees won't be around to pollinate plants on the farm, and we will not be able to produce food for us human beings. As humans, we depend more on animals than they need us. We should treat them well and ensure they survive.To bring it down to the most personal level, I simply love animals. It gives me a good feeling to be surrounded by animals and they are part of our big family. They give love, belonging, and make me laugh. Petting animals makes people feel good, and research shows that interacting with animals has health benefits.My pets are part of my family, and I love to care for them. We got our first dog six years ago, and during the pandemic we opened our home to a rescue cat. Seeing the situation in Ukraine and how blessed we are, we decided to adopt another small, elderly dog from Kyiv, Ukraine. She fits in perfectly with our first dog and our cat. And, in our greenhouse, I have two hedgehogs living there over the winter. Once it is warm enough, they will wake up and we will return them to the wilderness.As part of our ""Time2Give"", which is a benefit at Cisco where you get paid time off to volunteer, I organized a one-day building project with a woodworker and 10 Cisco employees. We built hedgehog houses together for an animal nonprofit, so they could sell them to get funding for medicine and other things to care for the hedgehogs. It was a great give-back activity with our colleagues, and the next build is scheduled for the end of June.View original content hereView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/760662/People-Behind-Purpose-at-Cisco-How-a-Life-Long-Love-for-Animals-Led-to-a-Career-in-Sustainability]"

(NASDAQ:CSCO) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 75% of the company",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cisco-systems-inc-nasdaq-csco-120019109.html,1686571219,STORY,['CSCO'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Cisco Systems' stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions43% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Insiders have sold recently To get a sense of who is truly in control of Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 75% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Cisco Systems, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Cisco Systems ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Cisco Systems?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.Cisco Systems already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Cisco Systems, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Cisco Systems. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.4% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.4% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.5% by the third-largest shareholder.A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Cisco SystemsWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that Cisco Systems, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$54m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 24% stake in Cisco Systems. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company.
