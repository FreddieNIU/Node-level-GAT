Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Unum Group (NYSE:UNM). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. View our latest analysis for Unum Group How Quickly Is Unum Group Increasing Earnings Per Share?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Unum Group managed to grow EPS by 8.3% per year, over three years. That's a good rate of growth, if it can be sustained.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. Our analysis has highlighted that Unum Group's revenue from operations did not account for all of their revenue in the previous 12 months, so our analysis of its margins might not accurately reflect the underlying business. Despite the relatively flat revenue figures, shareholders will be pleased to see EBIT margins have grown from 11% to 15% in the last 12 months. Which is a great look for the company.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-historyYou don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this free report showing analyst forecasts for Unum Group's future profits.Are Unum Group Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Unum Group, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Given insiders own a significant chunk of shares, currently valued at US$59m, they have plenty of motivation to push the business to succeed. This would indicate that the goals of shareholders and management are one and the same.Is Unum Group Worth Keeping An Eye On?As previously touched on, Unum Group is a growing business, which is encouraging. If that's not enough on its own, there is also the rather notable levels of insider ownership. The combination definitely favoured by investors so consider keeping the company on a watchlist. You still need to take note of risks, for example - Unum Group has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

They had tumbled in March due to the bank crisis.The move is a ""precautionary measure aimed at supporting the stability of the oil market,"" per Saudi Arabia.The banking crisis in March hammered crude oil prices so much that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, stepped in with massive production cuts to stem the bleeding.Saudi Arabia — the de facto leader of the OPEC — said on Sunday it will cut crude production by 500,000 barrels a day from May till the end of 2023 as a ""precautionary measure aimed at supporting the stability of the oil market,"" according to the state-owned Saudi Press Agency.On the same day, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria, and Oman, also announced their own production cuts totaling 649,000 barrels a day through their state media outlets, per the Associated Press. Alexander Novak, the deputy prime minister of Russia, said on Sunday the country will be extending its 500,000 barrel-a-day production cut until the end of 2023, per TASS state news agency.Thanks to the shock production cuts totaling around 1.15 million barrels per day, crude oil prices rose sharply on Monday.

13,15b03f86-c5db-334d-b14b-c67762c5fe8d,O,2023-04-03,Column: California's evolution on Big Oil — in the state Capitol and my own family,LA Times,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/column-californias-evolution-big-oil-120048410.html,1680523248,STORY,['CL=F'],"[Pumpjacks on the McKittrick oil field in California. (Carolyn Cole / Los Angeles Times)What’s striking about passage of Gov. Gavin Newsom’s legislation to penalize Big Oil’s alleged greed is the sea change it represents in California policy.A century ago and well past World War II, the oil industry could do no wrong in California. It was encouraged to drill, baby, drill. And this burgeoning state reaped the economic benefits.In fact, California is still the only major oil-producing state that doesn’t impose an extraction tax for pumping the goo out of the ground. Oil companies do pay property taxes on underground reserves. But it’s a much lighter hit than an extraction tax.In 2006, voters rejected a ballot measure that would have taxed extraction and raised $1 billion annually. The oil industry waged a $95-million opposition campaign. Three years later, the Legislature passed an extraction tax but Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed it.Now, California’s governor rails about “greedy” oil companies “fleecing” motorists — ”lying and gouging Californians to line their own pockets.”The bill Newsom signed last week authorizes the California Energy Commission, which he appoints, to regulate oil refinery profits. It can establish a cap on profits and sock refineries that exceed it with what he calls a “price-gouging penalty.”This governor brags about bringing “Big Oil to their knees.”Newsom’s scorn — and the Democratic-dominated Legislature’s — is in sharp contrast to the hospitable cheering-on that the oil industry heard from Sacramento throughout most of the 20th century.Only one Democratic lawmaker voted against Newsom’s bill and she was promptly punished by Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon (D-Lakewood). New Assemblymember Jasmeet Bains presumably represented her oil-rich Kern County district’s views by opposing the measure. The speaker then yanked her off the influential Business and Professions Committee.That wouldn’t have happened in the past on an anti-oil bill.But today, bashing and voting against the oil industry apparently plays well with Democratic voters in deep blue California.Story continuesFirst, people are concerned about climate change and planet-altering greenhouse gas emissions spewed by gasoline automobiles.In a poll last year by the Public Policy Institute of California, about half the people surveyed said they’d considered buying an electric vehicle. And by 3-to-1, they prioritized developing alternative energy — wind, solar, hydrogen — over expanding oil and gas production.Second, there’s greater public angst over oil company actions that hit motorists directly. We pay far more than the national average for a gallon of gasoline — $2.61 more at one point last year when our cost at the pump exceeded $6.Compare that with the 25 cents or so I initially paid for a gallon of gas in the 1950s when oil was a welcomed job producer in California.Part of the difference between what we and the rest of the country pay is attributable to state and local taxes. There are also fees to fund environmental programs, mostly to fight climate change. And there’s the cost of mixing a special anti-smog blend of fuel.But those costs don’t account for all the extra price at the pump. Now, the Energy Commission will have the legal authority to dig into refineries’ books and discover the mystery.And maybe it can find out why just before every three-day weekend — especially during highly traveled summer months — the pump price suddenly escalates. But I think we already know that answer: Oil companies can get away with it because we need to fill up.Back in the day, oil played a huge role in developing California and boosting workers into the middle class.In 1903, California became the No. 1 oil-producing state in the nation. We traded that position back and forth with Oklahoma up until the Great Depression when a glut developed because people didn’t drive so much. Oil production slowed, then escalated again during World War II. But today we’re only the seventh-largest producer of crude oil.In the 1920s, much of the Los Angeles Basin was covered with a forest of wooden oil derricks. Many of us still remember an active oil well on the Beverly Hills High School campus. Derricks dotted the Summerland Beach area just south of Santa Barbara.California pumped 36% of the nation’s oil in 1923. Today, 100 years later, it’s down to 3%. Those in power can hardly wait, it seems, to rid the state of its remaining production.My own family has directly experienced the dramatic change in public policy and attitudes toward oil.My dad left his family’s depressed Tennessee farm in the 1920s because he heard there were decent paying jobs in California’s booming oil fields. There were.A large Skelton clan came with him — his dad, brother, two uncles and some cousins. Most went back to Tennessee farming when oil companies laid off workers during the Depression. Fortunately, my dad stayed and I was born in exquisite Santa Barbara.With only an eighth-grade education — there was no high school near his isolated farm — Dad supported a family on an oil worker’s pay, rising through the ranks from roustabout to toolpusher and finally assistant foreman at Shell’s Ventura lease. We were proud of him.I even became an oil worker my first summer out of high school. But I took a 33% pay cut to work for the Ventura Star-Free Press the next summer. My best investment ever.I’ve had my own evolution on oil: Moving from strong support of offshore drilling to adamant opposition because of repeated, calamitous spills.Today, one of my dad’s granddaughters — my daughter — is trying to rid California and the world of fossil fuel because, she believes, it threatens to destroy the planet. She’d like to eliminate her grandpa’s occupation.She’s a Biden administration advisor trying to find clean-energy jobs for fossil-fuel workers.Dad probably would have been fine with that, but cautioned her not to be rambunctious. Gas cars are going to be around for a while yet.This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

Oil gained more than 6% on Monday, with WTI crude oil — the U.S. benchmark — trading north of $80 a barrel while the international benchmark price, Brent crude oil, was trading near $85 a barrel.A 4% gain in shares of Chevron (CVX) helped the Blue Chip Dow lead markets to start the week. UnitedHealthcare (UNH) gained nearly 5% to lead the Dow.On Sunday, the OPEC+ oil cartel — which includes OPEC members plus Russia — announced it would cut daily production by more than 1 million barrels of oil beginning in May and running through the end of the year.""Even though, like OPEC, we expect only subdued demand growth this year, the scale of supply cuts will send the oil market balance into a deficit in 2023, with an even larger deficit in Q4,"" wrote Caroline Bain, chief commodities economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients on Monday.Last month, the price of oil dropped to an 18-month low as a glut of supply and fears over the global economy shook the oil market. Additionally, a surge in the dollar as investor concern rose over the banking crisis pressured oil.But as worries over an acute financial crisis worldwide have ebbed, the dollar has eased and WTI rose by nearly $10/barrel over the final two weeks of March.Used oil barrels are stacked at a storage facility in Seattle, Washington February 12, 2015 REUTERS/Jason Redmond (JASON REDMOND / reuters)A renewed surge in oil prices also potentially complicates the task ahead for the Federal Reserve, which has raised interest rates in a bid to lower inflation. Although the Fed's preferred inflation measures strip out the costs of food and gas, a marked rise in so-called ""headline"" inflation — which includes energy prices — could complicate the messaging on a pause in interest rate increases later this year.Story continuesData out on Friday showed headline inflation as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Index rose 5% over the prior year in February; core PCE showed prices rose 4.6% over last year in February.The more widely followed Consumer Price Index showed headline inflation clocked in at 6% over the prior year in February. The Fed targets 2% inflation.On the economic data front, Monday brought investors two key readings on the U.S. manufacturing sector with data from both S&amp;P Global and Institute for Supply Management showing a contraction in activity during March.Both gauges indicated activity in the manufacturing sector contracted during March, with the ISM's index dropping for the fifth-straight month and reaching a level of 46.3, the lowest since May 2020. Any reading below 50 for this index indicates contraction in the sector; readings above 50 indicate expansion.""The March ISM Manufacturing report indicates that factory activity weakened through the end of last quarter,"" wrote Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, in a note to clients on Monday.""We expect the sector to have its worst year since the global financial crisis — aside from the precipitous fall at the start of the pandemic — as weak demand and tighter credit conditions cause activity to contract.""Monday's drop in the ISM PMI marked the fifth-straight monthly declined and the fourth month in a row the index pointed to a contraction in manufacturing activity.The ISM Manufacturing index has dropped steadily since early 2021. (Source: Wells Fargo)Elsewhere in markets on Monday, a merger in the entertainment world will draw investor attention after Endeavor (EDR), parent company of UFC, announced a deal to merge with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) to form a new company that will trade under the ticker ""TKO.""Endeavor will own 51% of the new company, with WWE holding a 49% interest.The new company will have an enterprise value north of $21 billion while the companies recognized 2022 revenues of $2.4 billion with a 10% annual revenue growth rate since 2019, the companies said in a press release.Endeavor CEO Ari Emanuel will lead the new company, with Dana White serving as President of UFC and Nick Khan overseeing WWE. WWE founder Vince McMahon will serve as executive chairman of the new company.Shares of WWE, which had gained more than 30% this year through Friday's close amid persistent speculation about a takeover, fell 2.1% on Monday. Endeavor shares lost 5.8% on the session.Tesla (TSLA) shares were also in focus early Monday after the company announced first quarter delivery numbers that set a new record for the electric carmaker as a cut in prices boosted overall demand for Tesla vehicles.The company delivered more than 422,000 cars in the first quarter and made more than 440,000 new vehicles during the first three months of the year.Tesla stock fell 6.1% to start the week.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

(NYSE:OMC) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Omnicom Group What's The Estimated Valuation?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.49bUS$1.77bUS$1.80bUS$1.69bUS$1.79bUS$1.79bUS$1.81bUS$1.83bUS$1.86bUS$1.89bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x5Analyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 0.37%Est @ 0.88%Est @ 1.24%Est @ 1.49%Est @ 1.66% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.7% US$1.4kUS$1.5kUS$1.4kUS$1.3kUS$1.2kUS$1.1kUS$1.1kUS$1.0kUS$951US$897(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$12bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.9b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.7%– 2.1%) = US$34bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$34b÷ ( 1 + 7.7%)10= US$16bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$28b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$94.3, the company appears quite good value at a 32% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Omnicom Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.954. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Omnicom GroupStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Media market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Omnicom Group, there are three additional items you should further examine:Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with Omnicom Group , and understanding it should be part of your investment process.Management:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for OMC's future outlook?

At least one local authority in London stopped its staff from using a critical Capita service on Friday, The Telegraph understands, over fears of a cyber attack spreading onto its own network.Other media reports suggested call centres for telecoms companies went down as a result of the outage, with employees at those being unable to log into back-end systems provided by Capita.A Cabinet Office spokesman confirmed the National Cyber Security Centre was aware of the situation at Capita and said there had been “minimal effect on internal processes and central government services”.]"

But that doesn't undermine the rather lovely longer-term return, if you measure over the last three years. In fact, the share price is up a full 130% compared to three years ago. So the recent fall in the share price should be viewed in that context. The thing to consider is whether the underlying business is doing well enough to support the current price.On the back of a solid 7-day performance, let's check what role the company's fundamentals have played in driving long term shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for Archer-Daniels-Midland While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Archer-Daniels-Midland was able to grow its EPS at 48% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. The average annual share price increase of 32% is actually lower than the EPS growth. Therefore, it seems the market has moderated its expectations for growth, somewhat. We'd venture the lowish P/E ratio of 10.03 also reflects the negative sentiment around the stock.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Archer-Daniels-Midland has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? If you are thinking of buying or selling Archer-Daniels-Midland stock, you should check out this FREE detailed report on its balance sheet.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Archer-Daniels-Midland, it has a TSR of 147% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveThe total return of 11% received by Archer-Daniels-Midland shareholders over the last year isn't far from the market return of -11%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 16%, each year, over five years. If the stock price has been impacted by changing sentiment, rather than deteriorating business conditions, it could spell opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Archer-Daniels-Midland better, we need to consider many other factors.

Fundamentally, these enterprises cater to needs, not wants. In this manner, the below companies benefit from a captive audience catalyst.As well, the offering of passive income gives investors some confidence to ride out any storms. True, these consumer staples stocks don’t necessarily represent the most generous enterprises. However, with a payout ratio sitting between 20% to 50%, the underlying yields should be sustainable. Anyways, what good is an extremely high yield if the company will be forced to cut it soon? Plus, enterprises that offer consistent dividends imply that they operate stout, dependable businesses. With storm clouds on the horizon, these are the consumer staples stocks to buy.KRKroger$49.08ADMArcher-Daniels-Midland$79.18GISGeneral Mills$84.49INGRIngredion$100.92TSNTyson Foods$58.18AGROAdecoagro$8.16VLGEAVillage Super Market$22.59InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsKroger (KR)A photo of a young boy wearing sunglasses, jeans, a blazer, a white shirt and suspenders holding money in various denominations in one hand and sitting in a plush chair.Source: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.comA retail company that operates supermarkets and multi-department stores, Kroger (NYSE:KR) effectively enjoys a hostage audience to put it cynically. At the end of the day, we all need to eat. Further, no matter what happens in the economy, people will sacrifice every other budget item to survive. Therefore, KR represents a powerful case among consumer staples stocks to buy.Financially, it’s not the greatest enterprise ever if we’re being honest. Perhaps most noticeably, Kroger carries a significant amount of debt relative to its cash account. That said, it does enjoy an Altman Z-Score of 3.66, reflecting low bankruptcy risk over the next two years. Also, its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 10.3%, above 75% of the retail defensive industry.For passive income, it’s not going to make you rich with a forward yield of 2.13%. Still, it features an ultra-low payout ratio of 23.16%. Also, the company commands 16 years of consecutive annual dividend increases.Story continuesArcher-Daniels-Midland (ADM)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comA multinational food processing and commodities trading firm, Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) operates more than 270 plants and 420 crop procurement facilities worldwide, according to its public profile. Despite its broad relevancies, ADM suffered noticeable hits to its previously robust market performance. For example, ADM lost more than 12% of its equity value since the Jan. opener.Although the red ink may be distracting, Archer definitely ranks among the consumer staples stocks to buy. First, it enjoys decent stability in the balance sheet, with an Altman Z-Score of 3.51 indicating a relatively safe enterprise. Operationally, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate pings at 16.4%, above 81.7% of the industry.Additionally, the market prices ADM at a forward multiple of 11.65. As a discount to projected earnings, ADM ranks better than 72.25% of the field. Regarding passive income, Archer’s forward yield pings at 2.29%. Its payout ratio is likewise super low at 26.77%. However, it features 51 years of consecutive dividend increases, making it a dividend king.General Mills (GIS)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large textSource: iQoncept/shutterstock.comA multinational manufacturer and marketer of branded processed consumer foods, General Mills (NYSE:GIS) is one of the most popular consumer staples stocks. Better yet, that popularity translates into contextually robust market performance. Since the beginning of this year, GIS gained nearly 2% of its equity value. In the past 365 days, it moved up over 25%.Financially, though, General Mills may require some patience among prospective investors. For one thing, the company features only middling strength in the balance sheet, with a greater-than-desired debt load. Also, GIS doesn’t particularly rate as attractive based on pricing relative to earnings (trailing and projected).On the plus side, General Mills offers a consistently profitable enterprise. For instance, its net margin stands at 14%, above nearly 88% of the industry. Finally, the company carries a forward yield of 2.55%. Here, the payout ratio is a bit elevated. However, at 48.33%, it’s within the spectrum of likely-to-be sustainable yields.Ingredion (INGR)sheet of paper marked ""dividends"" with a $20 bill on top of it to represent dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockAn American multinational ingredient provider, Ingredion (NYSE:INGR) produces mainly starches, non-GMO sweeteners, stevia, and pea protein. Further, the company turns corn, tapioca, potatoes, plant-based stevia, grains, fruits, gums, and other vegetables into ingredients for the food, beverage, brewing, and pharmaceutical industries and numerous industrial sectors. Since the start of the year, INGR gained over 4% of its equity value.Overall, Ingredion benefits from solid financial metrics. To start with the less-than-ideal stats, Ingredion features a cash-to-debt ratio of only 0.09 times. This ranks worse than 81.5% of the consumer-packaged goods industry. However, its Altman Z-Score of 3.32 reflects low bankruptcy risk.On the decidedly positive front, Ingredion’s three-year revenue growth rate pings at 8.8%, outpacing 63.46% of the competition. Also, its net margin of 6.19% exceeds 67.49% of sector peers. Lastly, the company carries a forward yield of 2.8%. Here, the payout ratio sits at a very acceptable 31.63%. Also, Ingredion commands 12 years of consecutive dividend increases. Thus, it makes for an ideal investment among consumer staples stocks.Tyson Foods (TSN)The word ""dividend"" highlighted in a dictionary.Source: ShutterstockBased in Springdale, Arkansas, Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) is the world’s second-largest processor and marketer of chicken, beef, and pork, according to its corporate profile. Further, it annually exports the largest percentage of beef out of the U.S. Unfortunately, this relevance isn’t translating to robust market performance. Since the Jan. opener, TSN faded to the tune of 9%.Nevertheless, contrarians interested in bidding up an overall solid name among consumer staples stocks may want to target TSN. Financially, one of the more glaring vulnerabilities centers on its cash-to-debt ratio of 0.08. Here, the company ranks worse than almost 83% of the field. However, it enjoys an Altman Z-Score of 3.41, reflecting relative stability. Operationally, Tyson prints a three-year revenue growth rate of 8.2%, above 61.1% of sector peers. Also, its book growth rate during the same period pings at 12.8%.For passive income, Tyson carries a forward yield of 3.32%. Of note, its payout ratio is only 35% and it commands 11 years of consecutive dividend increases.Adecoagro (AGRO)dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockBased in Luxembourg, Adecoagro (NYSE:AGRO) focuses on the development of a sustainable model to produce food and renewable energy. Better yet, the relevance of this enterprise translates to superior market performance. Since the start of the year, AGRO gained over 7% of its equity value. However, over the long run, it’s a tougher narrative. In the past 365 days, shares dropped 30%.Still, daring contrarian investors of consumer staples stocks may enjoy taking a shot at Adecoagro. Mainly, the company’s vulnerability centers on its balance sheet. It features a greater-than-desired debt load. Also, its Altman Z-Score of 1.28 sits in the middle of the distressed zone.That said, Adecoagro features a three-year revenue growth rate of 17.5%, beating out 83.12% of its rivals. On the bottom line, the company’s net margin is 8.13%, above 74.56% of sector peers. Also, the market prices AGRO at a trailing multiple of 8.23, which is undervalued. Finally, Adecoagro carries a forward yield of 3.95%, which is quite generous. As well, its payout ratio is only 33.26%, indicating confidence in sustainability.Village Super Market (VLGEA)Glass jar of coins marked ""dividends"" to represent dividend stocks. stocks with dividendsSource: ShutterstockBased in New Jersey, Village Super Market (NASDAQ:VLGEA) is a grocery specialist focused on high-quality food at affordable prices. Although an attractive business at this juncture, it’s a bit on the soft side in terms of market performance. Since the start of the year, VLGEA lost nearly 3% of its equity value. However, it’s not terrible against the trailing-year framework, down almost 7%.For those that want to roll the dice on consumer staples stocks, VLGEA could be interesting. First, the company features an Altman Z-Score of 3.29, indicating low bankruptcy risk. Operationally, Village Super Market prints a three-year revenue growth rate of 7.5%, beating out 65% of its peers. As well, the enterprise benefits from consistent and frequent profitability.Moreover, the market prices VLGEA at a trailing multiple of 10.25. As a discount to earnings, Village Super Market ranks better than 77.16% of the competition. Lastly, the company carries a forward yield of 4.38%.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance in the past, and go directly to read 5 Best April Dividend Stocks To Buy. Dividend stocks remain on investors' radar in 2023 amid rising inflation and recession fears. According to a report by Ned Davis Research, dividend-paying stocks in the S&amp;P 500 outperformed non-dividend stocks by an average of 1.9% per year between 1972 and 2018.Dividend-paying stocks have provided higher long-term returns to shareholders than non-dividend stocks. Last year, dividend equities emerged as winners amid fluctuating market conditions. Quality companies that have rewarded shareholders with decades-long dividend growth become top choices for investors. The S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index declined by 6.21% in 2022, compared with an 18% drop in the S&amp;P 500. A report by ProShares revealed that Russell 2000 Dividend Growth Index plunged by 5.44% last year as compared with a negative 20.44 return of the Russell 2000 Index.In addition to offering long-term returns to shareholders, dividend growers tend to be less volatile than other stocks, which can help reduce overall portfolio risks. We previously reported that dividend growers and initiators delivered an annual average return of 11.6% from 1972 to 2014, with an annual risk of 15.9%, while dividend cutters exhibited a 25.1% risk during this period while delivering an annual average return of 3.4%. To learn more about dividend growth stocks, readers can have a look at 12 High Growth Forever Dividend Stocks. Some of these companies include Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX).One of the main reasons for picking dividend stocks over other equities is to maintain and increase income over time. For this reason, investors may turn to a dividend capture strategy, which involves buying shares of a stock just before its ex-dividend date. By purchasing the stock at that time and selling it shortly thereafter, the investor can collect the dividend payment without holding the stock for an extended period of time. Our article titled Dividend Capture Strategy Stocks To Buy covers nearly all aspects of this investment strategy.Story continuesBest April Dividend StocksPhoto by Karolina Grabowska: https://www.pexels.com/photo/hands-holding-us-dollar-bills-4968630/Our Methodology:For this list, we selected dividend stocks that will trade ex-dividend in April.

(NYSE:ROP)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/now-opportune-moment-examine-roper-105439026.html,1680519279,STORY,['ROP'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP). The company's stock saw its share price hover around a small range of US$420 to US$452 over the last few weeks. But is this actually reflective of the share value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Roper Technologies’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for Roper Technologies Is Roper Technologies Still Cheap?According to my valuation model, the stock is currently overvalued by about 39%, trading at US$441 compared to my intrinsic value of $316.22. Not the best news for investors looking to buy! If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Since Roper Technologies’s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What kind of growth will Roper Technologies generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Roper Technologies' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 57%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in ROP’s positive outlook, with shares trading above its fair value. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe ROP should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on ROP for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there’s no upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for ROP, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Diving deeper into the forecasts for Roper Technologies mentioned earlier will help you understand how analysts view the stock going forward.

But in contrast you can make much more than 100% if the company does well. For instance the TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG) share price is 155% higher than it was three years ago. How nice for those who held the stock! It's also good to see the share price up 18% over the last quarter. But this move may well have been assisted by the reasonably buoyant market (up 7.4% in 90 days).On the back of a solid 7-day performance, let's check what role the company's fundamentals have played in driving long term shareholder returns. Check out our latest analysis for TransDigm Group There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.TransDigm Group was able to grow its EPS at 14% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. In comparison, the 37% per year gain in the share price outpaces the EPS growth. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did three years ago. It is quite common to see investors become enamoured with a business, after a few years of solid progress. This favorable sentiment is reflected in its (fairly optimistic) P/E ratio of 47.18.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that TransDigm Group has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this free report showing consensus revenue forecasts.A Dividend LostIt's important to keep in mind that we've been talking about the share price returns, which don't include dividends, while the total shareholder return does. Many would argue the TSR gives a more complete picture of the value a stock brings to its holders. Over the last 3 years, TransDigm Group generated a TSR of 162%, which is, of course, better than the share price return. Although the company had to cut dividends, it has paid cash to shareholders in the past.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that TransDigm Group shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 13% over the last year. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 23% a year, is even better. The pessimistic view would be that be that the stock has its best days behind it, but on the other hand the price might simply be moderating while the business itself continues to execute. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand TransDigm Group better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 3 warning signs for TransDigm Group (2 don't sit too well with us!) that you should be aware of before investing here.But note: TransDigm Group may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with past earnings growth (and further growth forecast).Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

""Our stronger sales volume performance compared to our guidance was led by the aerospace and automotive original equipment manufacturer coatings businesses. In addition, we delivered higher year-over-year earnings across most of our business portfolio including Europe.""The company also noted stronger-than-expected demand in PPG Comex, along with U.S. architectural coatings where the company benefitted from a recent customer win that aided quarterly results. Sales volumes were also better in China due to fewer pandemic disruptions than initially forecast.In addition, the company reported that in March 2023, PPG purchased group annuity contracts that transferred pension benefit obligations for certain of the company’s retirees in the U.S. to third-party insurance companies, resulting in an estimated non-cash pension settlement charge of approximately $191 million, or $0.61 per share. The expected first quarter 2023 adjusted EPS noted above excludes the impact of this pension settlement charge. A reconciliation of expected adjusted EPS to expected reported EPS is included below.The company will announce detailed first quarter 2023 financial results and provide full-year 2023 guidance on April 20, 2023, after U.S. stock markets close.

These matters within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, involve risks and uncertainties that may affect PPG’s operations, as discussed in the company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Sections 13(a), 13(c) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Accordingly, many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained herein. Such factors include statements related to the expected effects on our business of the COVID-19 pandemic and the pace of recovery from the pandemic, global economic conditions, increasing price and product competition by our competitors, fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials, the ability to achieve selling price increases, the ability to recover margins, customer inventory levels, the ability to maintain favorable supplier relationships and arrangements, the timing of realization of anticipated cost savings from restructuring and other initiatives, the ability to identify additional cost savings opportunities, the timing and expected benefits of our acquisitions, difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and achieving expected synergies therefrom, economic and political conditions in international markets, the ability to penetrate existing, developing and emerging foreign and domestic markets, foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in such rates, fluctuations in tax rates, the impact of future legislation, the impact of environmental regulations, unexpected business disruptions, the unpredictability of existing and possible future litigation, including asbestos litigation, and governmental investigations. However, it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, while the list of factors presented here and in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K are considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward-looking statements. Consequences of material differences in results compared with those anticipated in the forward-looking statements could include, among other things, lower sales or earnings, business disruption, operational problems, financial loss, legal liability to third parties and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on PPG’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.All information in this release speaks only as of April 3, 2023, and any distribution of this release after that date is not intended and will not be construed as updating or confirming such information.

(Carolyn Cole / Los Angeles Times)What’s striking about passage of Gov. Gavin Newsom’s legislation to penalize Big Oil’s alleged greed is the sea change it represents in California policy.A century ago and well past World War II, the oil industry could do no wrong in California. It was encouraged to drill, baby, drill. And this burgeoning state reaped the economic benefits.In fact, California is still the only major oil-producing state that doesn’t impose an extraction tax for pumping the goo out of the ground. Oil companies do pay property taxes on underground reserves. But it’s a much lighter hit than an extraction tax.In 2006, voters rejected a ballot measure that would have taxed extraction and raised $1 billion annually. The oil industry waged a $95-million opposition campaign. Three years later, the Legislature passed an extraction tax but Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed it.Now, California’s governor rails about “greedy” oil companies “fleecing” motorists — ”lying and gouging Californians to line their own pockets.”The bill Newsom signed last week authorizes the California Energy Commission, which he appoints, to regulate oil refinery profits. It can establish a cap on profits and sock refineries that exceed it with what he calls a “price-gouging penalty.”This governor brags about bringing “Big Oil to their knees.”Newsom’s scorn — and the Democratic-dominated Legislature’s — is in sharp contrast to the hospitable cheering-on that the oil industry heard from Sacramento throughout most of the 20th century.Only one Democratic lawmaker voted against Newsom’s bill and she was promptly punished by Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon (D-Lakewood). New Assemblymember Jasmeet Bains presumably represented her oil-rich Kern County district’s views by opposing the measure. The speaker then yanked her off the influential Business and Professions Committee.That wouldn’t have happened in the past on an anti-oil bill.But today, bashing and voting against the oil industry apparently plays well with Democratic voters in deep blue California.Story continuesFirst, people are concerned about climate change and planet-altering greenhouse gas emissions spewed by gasoline automobiles.In a poll last year by the Public Policy Institute of California, about half the people surveyed said they’d considered buying an electric vehicle. And by 3-to-1, they prioritized developing alternative energy — wind, solar, hydrogen — over expanding oil and gas production.Second, there’s greater public angst over oil company actions that hit motorists directly. We pay far more than the national average for a gallon of gasoline — $2.61 more at one point last year when our cost at the pump exceeded $6.Compare that with the 25 cents or so I initially paid for a gallon of gas in the 1950s when oil was a welcomed job producer in California.Part of the difference between what we and the rest of the country pay is attributable to state and local taxes. There are also fees to fund environmental programs, mostly to fight climate change. And there’s the cost of mixing a special anti-smog blend of fuel.But those costs don’t account for all the extra price at the pump. Now, the Energy Commission will have the legal authority to dig into refineries’ books and discover the mystery.And maybe it can find out why just before every three-day weekend — especially during highly traveled summer months — the pump price suddenly escalates. But I think we already know that answer: Oil companies can get away with it because we need to fill up.Back in the day, oil played a huge role in developing California and boosting workers into the middle class.In 1903, California became the No. 1 oil-producing state in the nation. We traded that position back and forth with Oklahoma up until the Great Depression when a glut developed because people didn’t drive so much. Oil production slowed, then escalated again during World War II. But today we’re only the seventh-largest producer of crude oil.In the 1920s, much of the Los Angeles Basin was covered with a forest of wooden oil derricks. Many of us still remember an active oil well on the Beverly Hills High School campus. Derricks dotted the Summerland Beach area just south of Santa Barbara.California pumped 36% of the nation’s oil in 1923. Today, 100 years later, it’s down to 3%. Those in power can hardly wait, it seems, to rid the state of its remaining production.My own family has directly experienced the dramatic change in public policy and attitudes toward oil.My dad left his family’s depressed Tennessee farm in the 1920s because he heard there were decent paying jobs in California’s booming oil fields. There were.A large Skelton clan came with him — his dad, brother, two uncles and some cousins. Most went back to Tennessee farming when oil companies laid off workers during the Depression. Fortunately, my dad stayed and I was born in exquisite Santa Barbara.With only an eighth-grade education — there was no high school near his isolated farm — Dad supported a family on an oil worker’s pay, rising through the ranks from roustabout to toolpusher and finally assistant foreman at Shell’s Ventura lease. We were proud of him.I even became an oil worker my first summer out of high school. But I took a 33% pay cut to work for the Ventura Star-Free Press the next summer. My best investment ever.I’ve had my own evolution on oil: Moving from strong support of offshore drilling to adamant opposition because of repeated, calamitous spills.Today, one of my dad’s granddaughters — my daughter — is trying to rid California and the world of fossil fuel because, she believes, it threatens to destroy the planet. She’d like to eliminate her grandpa’s occupation.She’s a Biden administration advisor trying to find clean-energy jobs for fossil-fuel workers.Dad probably would have been fine with that, but cautioned her not to be rambunctious. Gas cars are going to be around for a while yet.This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

Oil gained more than 6% on Monday, with WTI crude oil — the U.S. benchmark — trading north of $80 a barrel while the international benchmark price, Brent crude oil, was trading near $85 a barrel.A 4% gain in shares of Chevron (CVX) helped the Blue Chip Dow lead markets to start the week. UnitedHealthcare (UNH) gained nearly 5% to lead the Dow.On Sunday, the OPEC+ oil cartel — which includes OPEC members plus Russia — announced it would cut daily production by more than 1 million barrels of oil beginning in May and running through the end of the year.""Even though, like OPEC, we expect only subdued demand growth this year, the scale of supply cuts will send the oil market balance into a deficit in 2023, with an even larger deficit in Q4,"" wrote Caroline Bain, chief commodities economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients on Monday.Last month, the price of oil dropped to an 18-month low as a glut of supply and fears over the global economy shook the oil market. Additionally, a surge in the dollar as investor concern rose over the banking crisis pressured oil.But as worries over an acute financial crisis worldwide have ebbed, the dollar has eased and WTI rose by nearly $10/barrel over the final two weeks of March.Used oil barrels are stacked at a storage facility in Seattle, Washington February 12, 2015 REUTERS/Jason RedmondA renewed surge in oil prices also potentially complicates the task ahead for the Federal Reserve, which has raised interest rates in a bid to lower inflation. Although the Fed's preferred inflation measures strip out the costs of food and gas, a marked rise in so-called ""headline"" inflation — which includes energy prices — could complicate the messaging on a pause in interest rate increases later this year.Story continuesData out on Friday showed headline inflation as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Index rose 5% over the prior year in February; core PCE showed prices rose 4.6% over last year in February.The more widely followed Consumer Price Index showed headline inflation clocked in at 6% over the prior year in February. The Fed targets 2% inflation.On the economic data front, Monday brought investors two key readings on the U.S. manufacturing sector with data from both S&amp;P Global and Institute for Supply Management showing a contraction in activity during March.Both gauges indicated activity in the manufacturing sector contracted during March, with the ISM's index dropping for the fifth-straight month and reaching a level of 46.3, the lowest since May 2020. Any reading below 50 for this index indicates contraction in the sector; readings above 50 indicate expansion.""The March ISM Manufacturing report indicates that factory activity weakened through the end of last quarter,"" wrote Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, in a note to clients on Monday.""We expect the sector to have its worst year since the global financial crisis — aside from the precipitous fall at the start of the pandemic — as weak demand and tighter credit conditions cause activity to contract.""Monday's drop in the ISM PMI marked the fifth-straight monthly declined and the fourth month in a row the index pointed to a contraction in manufacturing activity.The ISM Manufacturing index has dropped steadily since early 2021.

Term buyers of Saudi crude expressed some concern about their ability to get the volume and type of oil they want from Aramco next month after the announcement of a 500,000 barrel-a-day curb by the kingdom.Given the turmoil in the market, some Chinese refiners are starting to mull spot purchases from suppliers including Latin America, the US and West Africa to make up for a shortfall should OSPs from Saudi Aramco and other producers become too expensive, according to people familiar with trading strategies.That’s likely good news for West African crude suppliers who are sitting on a glut of unwanted crude that has struggled to find buyers because of strikes at French oil refineries and seasonal plant maintenance in Europe.Oil futures surged as the week opened following the supply cut. The plan was announced in piecemeal fashion at the weekend, with Saudi Arabia unveiling a plan for lower production that was followed by smaller moves by other nations. Riyadh, along with Moscow, are the de-facto leaders of OPEC+, as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies are known.Persian Gulf nations such as Saudi Arabia and Iraq sell the bulk of their oil to Asia, with China, India, Japan and South Korea being the biggest buyers. Aramco typically releases OSPs in the first five days of the month, and they are used as a benchmark by others. In a Bloomberg survey last week, six refiners and traders predicted a cut for Aramco’s OSP for its flagship Arab Light grade.Story continues“The imminent Saudi OSP is probably a key variable,” said Jianan Sun, a London-based analyst with Energy Aspects Ltd., adding that if Saudis don’t lower or even raise the prices, Asian refiners will need to “actively look for alternative grades,” whereas if the OSP is lowered, the situation is not so pressing.In Europe, the situation has been complicated by a strike at French oil-processing plants and terminals that has curtailed the nation’s demand by about 1 million barrels a day.OPEC+’s decision to tighten supplies globally may lead to increased costs to secure barrels, further weighing on the region’s crimped consumption, according to traders buying and selling cargoes in the European market. Traders also said that lackluster growth means that purchasing activities have slowed for the current cycle so far, but they were still taking stock of the OPEC+ agreement.If Asian buyers start to compete for barrels from the Atlantic Basin, though, then that could help clear up some of the neglected barrels for their counterparts in Europe. A glut of unsold crude — more than 20 cargoes for prompt April loading — had built up in west Africa, and that may now attract an increasing number of bidders with the output curb, said traders.The surprise move boosted Brent futures by more than 8% as the week’s trading began. It comes at a complicated juncture in the market, with concerns about weaker consumption in the US and Europe gathering pace should a recession coincide with a wave of demand-sapping refinery strikes in France and, on the upside, expectations that consumption in China will pick up.China’s state-owned PetroChina Co. had already been tapping supplies from Canada, Colombia and Ecuador even before the cut, buying at least 8 million barrels that will load this month as a new mega-refinery starts production officially in Guangdong, Bloomberg News reported last week.In India, another major consumer of Middle Eastern barrels, Mukesh Surana, chief executive officer of Ratnagiri Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd., which is building a refinery, said that OPEC+ may have decided on a supply reduction as it foresaw a weaker market.“The market is well-supplied, so there is no concern on availability,” said Surana, who’s also the ex-chairman of Hindustan Petroleum Corp. “OPEC+ must be expecting a fall in prices or dip in demand, so this is probably a preemptive move to provide floor to prices. But I don’t see prices rising above $90.”--With assistance from Alfred Cang, Serene Cheong, Sherry Su, Sharon Cho and Bill Lehane.(Updates with Europe’s reaction in fourth, eighth paragraphs.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Undercover Organizers Behind America’s Union WinsDungeons &amp; Dragons’ Epic Quest to Finally Make MoneyThe Texas Preacher’s $24 Million Ponzi SchemeJohn Wick’s Blowout Opening Lifts Lions Gate, But It Won’t Fix StarzUS and Europe Wrangle Over Green Subsidies to Avoid a Trade War©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Moscow said it would lower output by half a million barrels per day until June.Oil prices climbed more than 6pc on Monday after surprise production cuts led by Saudi Arabia that risk causing pain for motorists at the pumps and stoking inflation.Brent Crude climbed 6.17pc to $84.82 (£68) a barrel by Monday evening, having closed at $79.89 per barrel on Friday, with analysts warning the market is now heading towards $100 per barrel.Saudi Arabia, Russia, Algeria and other allies in the Opec-plus cartel of oil exporting countries announced on Sunday they will slash production in a bid to prop up prices amid concerns demand is not rebounding fast enough.The move risks harming efforts to cool persistent global inflation, with traders on Monday increasing their bets that the US Federal Reserve will now have to increase interest rates again in May.It is also a sign of what some see as an ominous strategy from Opec to defend a reasonably high oil price, with its grip on world oil markets strengthening as the US shale boom slows.""Today's surprise cut is consistent with the new Opec-plus doctrine to act pre-emptively because they can without significant losses in market share,"" analysts at Goldman Sachs said.""While surprising, this cut reflects important economic and likely political considerations.""Oil prices feed directly into prices at the petrol pump for UK motorists, with generally about a one pence increase for every sustained $2 increase in the price of oil.That implies an increase of 3p-5p per litre in the price of petrol if the current jump in the oil price is sustained, according to the AA.The Saudis' production cuts announced on Sunday will take more than one million barrels per day off the market from May.Story continuesThey are on top of previously announced production cuts, with 3.66 million barrels per day of production cut by Opec and allies since November, according to Reuters. That amounts to 3.7pc of global demand.The move risks tensions between Opec and the US, where President Joe Biden has been calling for production increases to help bring down prices.They are also a sign of ongoing cooperation between Opec and Russia, which needs to bolster its revenues from oil sales to help fund its war against Ukraine.The White House said the cuts were “inadvisable”. However, on Monday John Kirby, coordinator for strategic communications at the US National Security Council, downplayed tensions, highlighting the long-running relationship between the US and Saudi Arabia.""We're not always going to agree ... with everything that Saudi Arabia does or says any more than they're always going to agree with everything that we do or say,” he said. “But that doesn't take away from the fact that it is a strategic partnership.”08:23 PMSigning offThat's all from me.

Industrial REIT, home to tenants including Thames Water, JD Sports and Siemens, has a portfolio of around 7.1m sq ft.The warehouse sector has contracted post-Covid as several large occupiers have had to reconsolidate their space after rapidly expanding during the ecommerce boom brought on by the pandemic. Companies including Amazon and Asos, which benefited hugely from the lockdown shoppers, have reduced their warehouse footprint, and smaller warehouse occupiers including New Look have done the same.Vacancy rates in warehouses have increased in the first quarter of this year, reaching 5pc, up from 4pc recorded at the end of last year. The sector has also been hit by the largest dip in property values which plunged by 47.4pc in the six months to December, according to Colliers, but Blackstone remains confident that rising rents will offset the impact of higher borrowing costs.Kevin Mofid, head of industrial and logistics research at Savills said: “Occupier requirements have fallen from the abnormally high levels seen during the Covid-19 pandemic.“We have seen a rise in occupier controlled space coming back to the market, indeed 17pc of the total supply is occupier controlled. For the most part this is space that online retailers took during the pandemic and is now surplus to requirements.”Blackstone intends to make a firm offer by April 14 and Industrials REIT’s executives have committed to sell the roughly 6.3pc of the company’s shares they own.Blackstone and Industrial REIT did not comment as the transaction is yet to be completed.04:24 PMUniversities face a further six months of strikes over pay, contracts and pensionsThe University and College Union (UCU) has renewed its strike mandate in a dispute over pay, contracts and pensions.A majority of UCU members have voted to continue strike action, meaning universities could face a futher six month of industrial action.In the pay and working condition ballot, the Yes vote for strike action among UCU members was 85.6pc and the turnout was 56.4pc.In the pension ballot, the Yes vote for strike action among UCU members was 89pc and the turnout was 58.4pc.UCU general secretary Jo Grady said: ""Members will now be consulted on proposals in both disputes and employers know strike action can be called again at will.""The UCU represents over 120,000 workers across universities, colleges, prisons, adult education and training organisations across the UK.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.04:11 PMCredit Suisse AT1 bondholders instruct lawyers for possible litigationCredit Suisse AT1 bondholders have officially hired law firm Quinn Emanuel for possible litigation arising out of the UBS rescue.Lawyers across the firm's London, Switzerland and US offices are now representing a ""growing bondholder group"" which hold a ""significant percentage of the total notional value of the AT1 instruments"", Quinn Emanuel has announced.The potential lawsuit seeks to recover losses suffered after $17bn worth of AT1 bonds were wiped out by the UBS' emergency takeover of Credit Suisse last month. Here's an explanation of what happened.The disputes specialist firm will also represent the bondholders in discussions with Swiss authorities.Thomas Werlen, managing partner of Quinn Emanuel's Swiss office, said:There is still a chance that the various actors will recognize and correct the mistakes made in hastily orchestrating this merger.While we are certainly prepared to pursue whatever proceedings are necessary, a potential constructive engagement with the relevant stakeholders could prevent years of litigation.

Any value below 50 signals a contraction.The decline was driven by a fall in new export orders, low demand and tough market conditions.Many manufacturers were nonetheless optimistic that their output would rebound over the coming year as gas prices fall back and inflation eases, leaving households with more headroom.Nearly 60pc of manufacturers expected their sales to pick up, the highest proportion in 13 months.There were also signs of slowing inflation, with the lowest rise in input prices since June 2020.While a wide range of materials is still becoming more expensive, more availability, smoother supply chains and lower costs for some commodities helped bring prices down.03:01 PMBroadband suppliers face watchdog inquiry over switching delaysBroadband suppliers are being investigated by the industry watchdog after failing to introduce a simpler switching service for consumers hit by sky-high bills, Matt Oliver writes.Ofcom had ordered internet providers to implement the so-called “one touch switch” service by Monday. But the communications regulator said they had missed this deadline and “let their customers down” at a time when millions of homes are facing bill rises of as much as 17pc.As a result, Ofcom is launching an industry-wide investigation into what went wrong, with broadband companies potentially facing fines.The new service would have allowed customers to more easily switch between broadband providers that use different networks, including those run separately by BT Openreach, Virgin Media and Cityfibre.Under this process, customers would have only needed to contact their new supplier to arrange a switch, whereas currently they also need to contact their old one. Changing providers would also be quicker, taking just a day where possible, according to Ofcom.Ahead of the April 3 deadline, Ofcom said it had pressured companies to speed up the implementation but they had so far failed to put the new system in place.It formally announced the rules a year and a half ago but said that suppliers had been given almost four years’ notice via consultations and notices of proposals.Cristina Luna-Esteban, Ofcom’s director of telecoms consumer protection, said: “Industry has had plenty of warning, plenty of time and plenty of support to get this done. It’s extremely disappointing and frustrating, and providers have let their customers down.”02:55 PMTesla shares dip 4.5pc despite record deliveriesShares in Tesla dropped more than 4pc in early trading in New York despite posting record deliveries.Stock in Elon Musk's electric car company dipped even as the company met Wall Street expectations, but were shy of Mr Musk's aim of achieving 50pc annual growth.Analysts at Morgan Stanley said Tesla's 423,000 deliveries were in-line with analyst consensus, but below the hopes of some investors who had pushed up the car company's share price in recent weeks.02:46 PMEY banned from German audit work after Wirecard scandalEY has been banned from taking on new audits for listed companies in Germany after it failed to raise the alarm about a major scandal at disgraced payments company Wirecard. Simon Foy has the story:The German accounting regulator has banned the ""big four"" accounting firm from accepting new audit contracts for all German listed companies, banks and insurers for two years. It has also been fined €500,000 (£440,000).It comes after the firm’s auditors gave Wirecard a clean bill of health just months before a major accounting fraud was uncovered at the company.Wirecard filed for insolvency in June 2020 in one of Europe’s biggest accounting scandals, which dealt a major blow to the reputation of Germany’s financial regulator. The payments company collapsed after it admitted that €1.9bn of cash was missing.Before the scandal emerged, EY had given the Munich-based unqualified audits for more than a decade. Germany’s audit watchdog APAS said EY breached its professional duty when auditing the payments company’s annual reports for 2016, 2017 and 2018.Since the accounting scandal unravelled, EY has lost several large audit clients in Germany, including Commerzbank, DWS and KfW.A spokesman for EY said: “We regret that the collusive fraud at Wirecard was not uncovered earlier and we have learned important lessons from the case.""02:13 PMJohn Lewis wins court case over ‘Excitable Edgar’ sneezing dragonJohn Lewis has won a court battle after a children’s author claimed the retailer had copied one of her designs for a Christmas advert, Matt Oliver reports.Fay Evans, a self-published author from Macclesfield, Cheshire, claimed the company’s two-and-a-half minute “Excitable Edgar” advert which was aired in 2019 bore “striking” resemblances to her own work “Fred The Fire-Sneezing Dragon”.She sued John Lewis as well as creative agency adam&amp;eveDDB, which first developed the Christmas advert concept.But a High Court judge on Monday dismissed her claim, saying the idea of a sneezing dragon was ""very old indeed"".A John Lewis spokesman said: “We take great pride and care with our Christmas adverts and we're glad the judge recognised the originality of Excitable Edgar.

She said: ""The Parisians who spoke overwhelmingly spoke out against self-service scooters.""Scooters in the city are provided via smartphone apps by companies such as Tier, Lime and Dott. The scooters already have a speed limit cap of around 20kmph, but locals have grown frustrated by the scooters cluttering pavements.A spokesman for Voi, the Swedish e-scooter company, said: ""This is a sad day, not only for the citizens of Paris who have come to rely on shared micromobility services in their everyday lives but also for the whole micromobility industry. It’s regrettable that Paris, a city that has inspired the world by investing heavily in the 15-minute city concept, has now taken several steps back in the fight against car dependency.""In this file photo taken on September , 2021, free floating rental electric scooters are seen on a sidewalk in Paris - AFP11:06 AMNatWest sell-off extended by government to 2026The government has extended plans to sell-off shares of NatWest by two years, meaning it will offload its entire stake in the bank by 2026.The taxpayer still owns a 41.5pc stake in the lender as a result of the £45bn bailout of Royal Bank of Scotland at the height of the financial crisis.The deal handed the British state a majority shareholding in NatWest, which the government has gradually been selling off since 2015.

Readings below 50 indicate that manufacturing is falling.The fall is the eighth time in nine months that manufacturing production has fallen, according to ratings agency S&amp;P, although optimism for the months ahead rose.“UK manufacturing production fell back into contraction at the end of the opening quarter, as companies scaled back production in response to subdued market conditions,"" S&amp;P said.""Although total new orders saw a fractional increase, this followed on from a nine-month sequence of contraction and suggests that order book levels remain low overall.

However, that tailwind is likely to be tempered by weaker demand outside China as the global economy cools. Plus, demand could also soften if there are further fears of contagion from the banking sector volatility.”09:00 AMFTSE marches higherThe FTSE 100 has hit its highest level in a month on the back of rocketing oil prices, pulled higher by a surging energy sector.London’s blue-chip index rose 0.6pc in early trading to stand at 7,674.2 points, with BP and Shell up 4.3pc and 4.1pc respectively.Meanwhile, theatre chain Cineworld neared record lows after failing to find a buyer for its US, UK and Ireland businesses.In the eurozone, the Paris CAC 40 index advanced 0.4pc, with TotalEnergies joining its UK counterparts to record a rise of 4pc.Germany's DAX index added 0.1pc.07:34 AMGood morningOil prices soared after oil producers’ unexpected cuts to crude output threatened to deliver a fresh jolt of inflation to the world’s markets.West Texas Intermediate (WTI) soared as much as 8pc in early trading and stood above $79 per barrel at 7am, while Brent crude shot up almost 5pc to come close to $84.5 things to start your day1)  JCB chief demands rethink of net zero ban on cars: Lord Bamford says internal combustion engine has a future following climbdown by Brussels2) Bank of England demands cyber crackdown after Russia-linked attacks: Threadneedle Street orders lenders to bolster defences against hackers3) Home working deals blow to defence companies in race with Russia and China: Boss of Cobham and Ultra warns of war for talent with big tech companies that offer more flexibility4) Tony Blair’s son wins backing of America’s richest family: Euan Blair secures support from Waltons for his company Multiverse5) 3,000 City jobs at risk as UBS prepares cuts after Credit Suisse rescue: Swiss lender expected to cut a third of staff worldwideWhat happened overnightOil prices jumped on Monday after Saudi Arabia and other OPEC+ oil producers announced a surprise round of output cuts, a potentially ominous sign for global inflation.Brent oil futures spiked $5.16 to $85.05 a barrel on news output would be cut by around 1.16 million barrels per day, while US crude climbed $4.88 to $80.55.Meanwhile, Hong Kong stocks opened slightly lower following a strong rally last week, as the big cut in oil output added to inflation concerns.The Hang Seng Index shed 0.10pc to 20,379.50, but the Shanghai Composite Index added 0.14pc to 3,277.34 and the Shenzhen Composite Index on China's second exchange rose 0.11pc to 2,127.10.Tokyo shares opened higher, with the benchmark Nikkei 225 index climbing 0.58pc to 28,203.35 at the open, and the broader Topix index rising 0.57pc to 2,015.01.]"

That would generally be considered a positive, so we'd expect the share price to be up.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that NOV has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of NOV, it has a TSR of 91% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveWhile it's never nice to take a loss, NOV shareholders can take comfort that , including dividends,their trailing twelve month loss of 7.5% wasn't as bad as the market loss of around 11%. What is more upsetting is the 8% per annum loss investors have suffered over the last half decade. While the losses are slowing we doubt many shareholders are happy with the stock. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

Fundamentally, these enterprises cater to needs, not wants. In this manner, the below companies benefit from a captive audience catalyst.As well, the offering of passive income gives investors some confidence to ride out any storms. True, these consumer staples stocks don’t necessarily represent the most generous enterprises. However, with a payout ratio sitting between 20% to 50%, the underlying yields should be sustainable. Anyways, what good is an extremely high yield if the company will be forced to cut it soon? Plus, enterprises that offer consistent dividends imply that they operate stout, dependable businesses. With storm clouds on the horizon, these are the consumer staples stocks to buy.KRKroger$49.08ADMArcher-Daniels-Midland$79.18GISGeneral Mills$84.49INGRIngredion$100.92TSNTyson Foods$58.18AGROAdecoagro$8.16VLGEAVillage Super Market$22.59InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsKroger (KR)A photo of a young boy wearing sunglasses, jeans, a blazer, a white shirt and suspenders holding money in various denominations in one hand and sitting in a plush chair.Source: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.comA retail company that operates supermarkets and multi-department stores, Kroger (NYSE:KR) effectively enjoys a hostage audience to put it cynically. At the end of the day, we all need to eat. Further, no matter what happens in the economy, people will sacrifice every other budget item to survive. Therefore, KR represents a powerful case among consumer staples stocks to buy.Financially, it’s not the greatest enterprise ever if we’re being honest. Perhaps most noticeably, Kroger carries a significant amount of debt relative to its cash account. That said, it does enjoy an Altman Z-Score of 3.66, reflecting low bankruptcy risk over the next two years. Also, its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 10.3%, above 75% of the retail defensive industry.For passive income, it’s not going to make you rich with a forward yield of 2.13%. Still, it features an ultra-low payout ratio of 23.16%. Also, the company commands 16 years of consecutive annual dividend increases.Story continuesArcher-Daniels-Midland (ADM)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comA multinational food processing and commodities trading firm, Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) operates more than 270 plants and 420 crop procurement facilities worldwide, according to its public profile. Despite its broad relevancies, ADM suffered noticeable hits to its previously robust market performance. For example, ADM lost more than 12% of its equity value since the Jan. opener.Although the red ink may be distracting, Archer definitely ranks among the consumer staples stocks to buy. First, it enjoys decent stability in the balance sheet, with an Altman Z-Score of 3.51 indicating a relatively safe enterprise. Operationally, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate pings at 16.4%, above 81.7% of the industry.Additionally, the market prices ADM at a forward multiple of 11.65. As a discount to projected earnings, ADM ranks better than 72.25% of the field. Regarding passive income, Archer’s forward yield pings at 2.29%. Its payout ratio is likewise super low at 26.77%. However, it features 51 years of consecutive dividend increases, making it a dividend king.General Mills (GIS)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large textSource: iQoncept/shutterstock.comA multinational manufacturer and marketer of branded processed consumer foods, General Mills (NYSE:GIS) is one of the most popular consumer staples stocks. Better yet, that popularity translates into contextually robust market performance. Since the beginning of this year, GIS gained nearly 2% of its equity value. In the past 365 days, it moved up over 25%.Financially, though, General Mills may require some patience among prospective investors. For one thing, the company features only middling strength in the balance sheet, with a greater-than-desired debt load. Also, GIS doesn’t particularly rate as attractive based on pricing relative to earnings (trailing and projected).On the plus side, General Mills offers a consistently profitable enterprise. For instance, its net margin stands at 14%, above nearly 88% of the industry. Finally, the company carries a forward yield of 2.55%. Here, the payout ratio is a bit elevated. However, at 48.33%, it’s within the spectrum of likely-to-be sustainable yields.Ingredion (INGR)sheet of paper marked ""dividends"" with a $20 bill on top of it to represent dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockAn American multinational ingredient provider, Ingredion (NYSE:INGR) produces mainly starches, non-GMO sweeteners, stevia, and pea protein. Further, the company turns corn, tapioca, potatoes, plant-based stevia, grains, fruits, gums, and other vegetables into ingredients for the food, beverage, brewing, and pharmaceutical industries and numerous industrial sectors. Since the start of the year, INGR gained over 4% of its equity value.Overall, Ingredion benefits from solid financial metrics. To start with the less-than-ideal stats, Ingredion features a cash-to-debt ratio of only 0.09 times. This ranks worse than 81.5% of the consumer-packaged goods industry. However, its Altman Z-Score of 3.32 reflects low bankruptcy risk.On the decidedly positive front, Ingredion’s three-year revenue growth rate pings at 8.8%, outpacing 63.46% of the competition. Also, its net margin of 6.19% exceeds 67.49% of sector peers. Lastly, the company carries a forward yield of 2.8%. Here, the payout ratio sits at a very acceptable 31.63%. Also, Ingredion commands 12 years of consecutive dividend increases. Thus, it makes for an ideal investment among consumer staples stocks.Tyson Foods (TSN)The word ""dividend"" highlighted in a dictionary.Source: ShutterstockBased in Springdale, Arkansas, Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) is the world’s second-largest processor and marketer of chicken, beef, and pork, according to its corporate profile. Further, it annually exports the largest percentage of beef out of the U.S. Unfortunately, this relevance isn’t translating to robust market performance. Since the Jan. opener, TSN faded to the tune of 9%.Nevertheless, contrarians interested in bidding up an overall solid name among consumer staples stocks may want to target TSN. Financially, one of the more glaring vulnerabilities centers on its cash-to-debt ratio of 0.08. Here, the company ranks worse than almost 83% of the field. However, it enjoys an Altman Z-Score of 3.41, reflecting relative stability. Operationally, Tyson prints a three-year revenue growth rate of 8.2%, above 61.1% of sector peers. Also, its book growth rate during the same period pings at 12.8%.For passive income, Tyson carries a forward yield of 3.32%. Of note, its payout ratio is only 35% and it commands 11 years of consecutive dividend increases.Adecoagro (AGRO)dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockBased in Luxembourg, Adecoagro (NYSE:AGRO) focuses on the development of a sustainable model to produce food and renewable energy. Better yet, the relevance of this enterprise translates to superior market performance. Since the start of the year, AGRO gained over 7% of its equity value. However, over the long run, it’s a tougher narrative. In the past 365 days, shares dropped 30%.Still, daring contrarian investors of consumer staples stocks may enjoy taking a shot at Adecoagro. Mainly, the company’s vulnerability centers on its balance sheet. It features a greater-than-desired debt load. Also, its Altman Z-Score of 1.28 sits in the middle of the distressed zone.That said, Adecoagro features a three-year revenue growth rate of 17.5%, beating out 83.12% of its rivals. On the bottom line, the company’s net margin is 8.13%, above 74.56% of sector peers. Also, the market prices AGRO at a trailing multiple of 8.23, which is undervalued. Finally, Adecoagro carries a forward yield of 3.95%, which is quite generous. As well, its payout ratio is only 33.26%, indicating confidence in sustainability.Village Super Market (VLGEA)Glass jar of coins marked ""dividends"" to represent dividend stocks. stocks with dividendsSource: ShutterstockBased in New Jersey, Village Super Market (NASDAQ:VLGEA) is a grocery specialist focused on high-quality food at affordable prices. Although an attractive business at this juncture, it’s a bit on the soft side in terms of market performance. Since the start of the year, VLGEA lost nearly 3% of its equity value. However, it’s not terrible against the trailing-year framework, down almost 7%.For those that want to roll the dice on consumer staples stocks, VLGEA could be interesting. First, the company features an Altman Z-Score of 3.29, indicating low bankruptcy risk. Operationally, Village Super Market prints a three-year revenue growth rate of 7.5%, beating out 65% of its peers. As well, the enterprise benefits from consistent and frequent profitability.Moreover, the market prices VLGEA at a trailing multiple of 10.25. As a discount to earnings, Village Super Market ranks better than 77.16% of the competition. Lastly, the company carries a forward yield of 4.38%. Further, its payout ratio, while elevated at 43%, is still within reason.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

They had tumbled in March due to the bank crisis.The move is a ""precautionary measure aimed at supporting the stability of the oil market,"" per Saudi Arabia.The banking crisis in March hammered crude oil prices so much that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, stepped in with massive production cuts to stem the bleeding.Saudi Arabia — the de facto leader of the OPEC — said on Sunday it will cut crude production by 500,000 barrels a day from May till the end of 2023 as a ""precautionary measure aimed at supporting the stability of the oil market,"" according to the state-owned Saudi Press Agency.On the same day, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria, and Oman, also announced their own production cuts totaling 649,000 barrels a day through their state media outlets, per the Associated Press. Alexander Novak, the deputy prime minister of Russia, said on Sunday the country will be extending its 500,000 barrel-a-day production cut until the end of 2023, per TASS state news agency.Thanks to the shock production cuts totaling around 1.15 million barrels per day, crude oil prices rose sharply on Monday. The US West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude oil futures jumped as much as 8% and were both 5.6% and 5.4% higher at $79.89 and $84.23 a barrel respectively.The two benchmark oil grades were last above $80 a barrel earlier in March before the banking crisis sent prices down sharply.The cuts are seen as a move to boost the oil markets, as prices posted their worst first-quarter performance since 2020, per Bloomberg records. Oil prices have been under pressure since the second half of 2022 due to fears over a global downturn that would, in turn, cut energy demand.The surprise production cuts could further strain US-Saudi ties.The surprise oil production cut is expected to put further strain on US-Saudi ties after the Biden administration's lobbying failed to stop OPEC's last round of production cuts in October 2022.Story continues""Resultant intensification of geo-political risks may be disproportionately large given that Saudi not only inadvertently aligns with Russia but is also observed to be cozying up with China.""

(Carolyn Cole / Los Angeles Times)What’s striking about passage of Gov. Gavin Newsom’s legislation to penalize Big Oil’s alleged greed is the sea change it represents in California policy.A century ago and well past World War II, the oil industry could do no wrong in California. It was encouraged to drill, baby, drill. And this burgeoning state reaped the economic benefits.In fact, California is still the only major oil-producing state that doesn’t impose an extraction tax for pumping the goo out of the ground. Oil companies do pay property taxes on underground reserves. But it’s a much lighter hit than an extraction tax.In 2006, voters rejected a ballot measure that would have taxed extraction and raised $1 billion annually. The oil industry waged a $95-million opposition campaign. Three years later, the Legislature passed an extraction tax but Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed it.Now, California’s governor rails about “greedy” oil companies “fleecing” motorists — ”lying and gouging Californians to line their own pockets.”The bill Newsom signed last week authorizes the California Energy Commission, which he appoints, to regulate oil refinery profits. It can establish a cap on profits and sock refineries that exceed it with what he calls a “price-gouging penalty.”This governor brags about bringing “Big Oil to their knees.”Newsom’s scorn — and the Democratic-dominated Legislature’s — is in sharp contrast to the hospitable cheering-on that the oil industry heard from Sacramento throughout most of the 20th century.Only one Democratic lawmaker voted against Newsom’s bill and she was promptly punished by Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon (D-Lakewood). New Assemblymember Jasmeet Bains presumably represented her oil-rich Kern County district’s views by opposing the measure. The speaker then yanked her off the influential Business and Professions Committee.That wouldn’t have happened in the past on an anti-oil bill.But today, bashing and voting against the oil industry apparently plays well with Democratic voters in deep blue California.Story continuesFirst, people are concerned about climate change and planet-altering greenhouse gas emissions spewed by gasoline automobiles.In a poll last year by the Public Policy Institute of California, about half the people surveyed said they’d considered buying an electric vehicle. And by 3-to-1, they prioritized developing alternative energy — wind, solar, hydrogen — over expanding oil and gas production.Second, there’s greater public angst over oil company actions that hit motorists directly. We pay far more than the national average for a gallon of gasoline — $2.61 more at one point last year when our cost at the pump exceeded $6.Compare that with the 25 cents or so I initially paid for a gallon of gas in the 1950s when oil was a welcomed job producer in California.Part of the difference between what we and the rest of the country pay is attributable to state and local taxes. There are also fees to fund environmental programs, mostly to fight climate change. And there’s the cost of mixing a special anti-smog blend of fuel.But those costs don’t account for all the extra price at the pump. Now, the Energy Commission will have the legal authority to dig into refineries’ books and discover the mystery.And maybe it can find out why just before every three-day weekend — especially during highly traveled summer months — the pump price suddenly escalates. But I think we already know that answer: Oil companies can get away with it because we need to fill up.Back in the day, oil played a huge role in developing California and boosting workers into the middle class.In 1903, California became the No. 1 oil-producing state in the nation. We traded that position back and forth with Oklahoma up until the Great Depression when a glut developed because people didn’t drive so much. Oil production slowed, then escalated again during World War II. But today we’re only the seventh-largest producer of crude oil.In the 1920s, much of the Los Angeles Basin was covered with a forest of wooden oil derricks. Many of us still remember an active oil well on the Beverly Hills High School campus. Derricks dotted the Summerland Beach area just south of Santa Barbara.California pumped 36% of the nation’s oil in 1923. Today, 100 years later, it’s down to 3%. Those in power can hardly wait, it seems, to rid the state of its remaining production.My own family has directly experienced the dramatic change in public policy and attitudes toward oil.My dad left his family’s depressed Tennessee farm in the 1920s because he heard there were decent paying jobs in California’s booming oil fields. There were.A large Skelton clan came with him — his dad, brother, two uncles and some cousins. Most went back to Tennessee farming when oil companies laid off workers during the Depression. Fortunately, my dad stayed and I was born in exquisite Santa Barbara.With only an eighth-grade education — there was no high school near his isolated farm — Dad supported a family on an oil worker’s pay, rising through the ranks from roustabout to toolpusher and finally assistant foreman at Shell’s Ventura lease. We were proud of him.I even became an oil worker my first summer out of high school. But I took a 33% pay cut to work for the Ventura Star-Free Press the next summer. My best investment ever.I’ve had my own evolution on oil: Moving from strong support of offshore drilling to adamant opposition because of repeated, calamitous spills.Today, one of my dad’s granddaughters — my daughter — is trying to rid California and the world of fossil fuel because, she believes, it threatens to destroy the planet. She’d like to eliminate her grandpa’s occupation.She’s a Biden administration advisor trying to find clean-energy jobs for fossil-fuel workers.Dad probably would have been fine with that, but cautioned her not to be rambunctious. Gas cars are going to be around for a while yet.This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

Oil gained more than 6% on Monday, with WTI crude oil — the U.S. benchmark — trading north of $80 a barrel while the international benchmark price, Brent crude oil, was trading near $85 a barrel.A 4% gain in shares of Chevron (CVX) helped the Blue Chip Dow lead markets to start the week. UnitedHealthcare (UNH) gained nearly 5% to lead the Dow.On Sunday, the OPEC+ oil cartel — which includes OPEC members plus Russia — announced it would cut daily production by more than 1 million barrels of oil beginning in May and running through the end of the year.""Even though, like OPEC, we expect only subdued demand growth this year, the scale of supply cuts will send the oil market balance into a deficit in 2023, with an even larger deficit in Q4,"" wrote Caroline Bain, chief commodities economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients on Monday.Last month, the price of oil dropped to an 18-month low as a glut of supply and fears over the global economy shook the oil market. Additionally, a surge in the dollar as investor concern rose over the banking crisis pressured oil.But as worries over an acute financial crisis worldwide have ebbed, the dollar has eased and WTI rose by nearly $10/barrel over the final two weeks of March.Used oil barrels are stacked at a storage facility in Seattle, Washington February 12, 2015 REUTERS/Jason RedmondA renewed surge in oil prices also potentially complicates the task ahead for the Federal Reserve, which has raised interest rates in a bid to lower inflation. Although the Fed's preferred inflation measures strip out the costs of food and gas, a marked rise in so-called ""headline"" inflation — which includes energy prices — could complicate the messaging on a pause in interest rate increases later this year.Story continuesData out on Friday showed headline inflation as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Index rose 5% over the prior year in February; core PCE showed prices rose 4.6% over last year in February.The more widely followed Consumer Price Index showed headline inflation clocked in at 6% over the prior year in February. The Fed targets 2% inflation.On the economic data front, Monday brought investors two key readings on the U.S. manufacturing sector with data from both S&amp;P Global and Institute for Supply Management showing a contraction in activity during March.Both gauges indicated activity in the manufacturing sector contracted during March, with the ISM's index dropping for the fifth-straight month and reaching a level of 46.3, the lowest since May 2020. Any reading below 50 for this index indicates contraction in the sector; readings above 50 indicate expansion.""The March ISM Manufacturing report indicates that factory activity weakened through the end of last quarter,"" wrote Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, in a note to clients on Monday.""We expect the sector to have its worst year since the global financial crisis — aside from the precipitous fall at the start of the pandemic — as weak demand and tighter credit conditions cause activity to contract.""Monday's drop in the ISM PMI marked the fifth-straight monthly declined and the fourth month in a row the index pointed to a contraction in manufacturing activity.The ISM Manufacturing index has dropped steadily since early 2021. (Source: Wells Fargo)Elsewhere in markets on Monday, a merger in the entertainment world will draw investor attention after Endeavor (EDR), parent company of UFC, announced a deal to merge with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) to form a new company that will trade under the ticker ""TKO.""Endeavor will own 51% of the new company, with WWE holding a 49% interest.The new company will have an enterprise value north of $21 billion while the companies recognized 2022 revenues of $2.4 billion with a 10% annual revenue growth rate since 2019, the companies said in a press release.Endeavor CEO Ari Emanuel will lead the new company, with Dana White serving as President of UFC and Nick Khan overseeing WWE. WWE founder Vince McMahon will serve as executive chairman of the new company.Shares of WWE, which had gained more than 30% this year through Friday's close amid persistent speculation about a takeover, fell 2.1% on Monday. Endeavor shares lost 5.8% on the session.Tesla (TSLA) shares were also in focus early Monday after the company announced first quarter delivery numbers that set a new record for the electric carmaker as a cut in prices boosted overall demand for Tesla vehicles.The company delivered more than 422,000 cars in the first quarter and made more than 440,000 new vehicles during the first three months of the year.Tesla stock fell 6.1% to start the week.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

This makes sense, given that companies with high dividend yields are typically paying out a large portion of their earnings as a dividend, leaving little capital to fund growth. That said, there are quite a few stocks that, while not exactly “high-yield,” have annual yields above that of the S&amp;P 500 (1.69%), plus offer the opportunity for growth. Hitting this “sweet spot,” these dividend stocks could be a path to generating solid long-term total returns for your portfolio.How? First, their above-average yields provide a consistent baseline of returns. Then, over an extended timeframe, shares move steadily higher, in tandem with earnings growth. That’s the story here with these seven dividend-paying growth stocks. Each of them has a forward yield of at least 2%, plus the strong potential to report strong earnings growth in the coming years.ADPAutomatic Data Processing$219.90ARCOArcos Dorados$7.62AZNAstraZeneca$68.64FFord Motor$12.05QCOMQualcomm$125.09TXRHTexas Roadhouse$107.92WELLWelltower$69.96InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAutomatic Data Processing (ADP)A photo of a young boy wearing sunglasses, jeans, a blazer, a white shirt and suspenders holding money in various denominations in one hand and sitting in a plush chair.Source: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.comAdmittedly, Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) may not be what first comes to mind when you think of “growth stock.” The payroll processing and outsourced HR services company is generally regarded as a blue-chip. As I’ve discussed before, the stock is also a year away from attaining “dividend aristocrat” status.But besides dividend growth, ADP stock has strong potential to continue delivering further earnings growth. Sell-side forecasts call for ADP’s earnings to grow by nearly 16% this fiscal year (ending June 2023), by 10.6% next fiscal year, and by 11.3% the fiscal year after that.This earnings growth could enable ADP to rise by double-digits annually over the next few years. Add in ADP’s 2.33% dividend, which has itself grown by double-digits on average annually over the past five years,  and it’s easy to see why Automatic Data Processing is a strong candidate for any growth-focused portfolio.Story continuesArcos Dorados (ARCO)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large textSource: iQoncept/shutterstock.comArcos Dorados (NYSE:ARCO), which means “Golden Arches” in Spanish, is the master franchisee for McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) throughout much of Latin America and the Caribbean. The Uruguay-based company operates in over 20 markets.ARCO stock is a name that offers investors not only a solid dividend yield (2.12%) and the prospect of earnings growth but value as well. Shares today trade for only 11.2 times earnings. Arcos’ profitability has been bouncing back since the pandemic. Per analyst estimates, earnings per share (or EPS) could keep climbing over the next few years. There may be big upside potential if this plays out for ARCO. Renewed confidence in Arcos Dorados’ earnings growth may result in a re-rating for the stock. Instead of trading for 11 times earnings, shares may have room to climb to much higher earnings multiple, like, say, 15 or even 20 times earnings.AstraZeneca (AZN)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockAstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) is another established company that’s one of the best dividend-paying growth stocks. The U.K.-based pharma firm reported strong growth during 2022, however, the company reported declining growth last quarter, due to falling demand for its Covid-19 vaccine and treatment.That said, according to the company’s latest guidance, further earnings growth is on the menu for AZN stock this year. Management has guided for high single-digit to low double-digit earnings growth in 2023, as growth from drugs such as cancer treatment Calquence and diabetes treatment Farxiga, outweigh a further drop in sales for its Covid offerings.Alongside promising earnings growth prospects, AZN pays its investors around $1.45 per share in dividends annually. This gives the stock a forward yield of around 2.1%. Although dividend growth has been non-existent in recent years, a resurgence in earnings growth may lead to larger payouts down the road.Ford (F)7 Safe Dividend Stocks for Investors to Buy Right NowSource: ShutterstockLike with ADP, Ford (NYSE:F) is another “old school” company that on the surface may not seem like it is a growth stock. Worse yet, unlike recession-resistant ADP, Ford is a cyclical automaker, and in theory, could be hit hard by a possible 2023 recession.Still, you may not want to dismiss the potential for F stock to become an unexpected growth play. It’s not definite that Ford experiences declining sales and heavy losses during this year. Pent-up demand from last year’s chip shortage may result in solid sales during 2023, despite all the recession talk. More specific to Ford’s bona fides as a growth play, the company’s pivot towards electric vehicles (or EVs), if successful, could put it on the path to earnings growth through the end of the decade. While waiting for this to take shape, sit back and collect the stock’s 4.74% dividend.Qualcomm (QCOM)dividend stocks: A calculator projecting the word ""DIVIDEND"" rests on a pile of gold and silver coins.Source: ShutterstockWith a 2.47% forward yield, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is clearly a dividend stock, but does it belong in the dividend-paying growth stocks category? Many would say no. Largely, because for the mobile chip maker, there’s the overhang of key customer Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) moving modem chip production in-house.However, while this factor has resulted in the market taking a “wait and see” approach with QCOM stock, the company may be able to do more than makeup for the loss of Apple. How? As I discussed back in January, Qualcomm is making a big move into fast-growing areas such as advanced automotive chips.Although earnings are set to slide this fiscal year (ending September 2023), earnings growth may be poised to re-accelerate in FY2024 and FY2025. A return to growth could spark a big move higher for shares, which today trade for just 11.7 times earnings.Texas Roadhouse (TXRH)The word ""dividend"" highlighted in a dictionary.Source: ShutterstockRallying by nearly 30% over the past year, Texas Roadhouse (NASDAQ:TXRH) has managed to stay in bull market mode, even as the broad market has struggled during this time frame. Of course, this strong performance isn’t entirely surprising.The steakhouse chain has continued to report above-average growth. Revenue and earnings both grew by double-digits, during Q4 and the full year of 2022. Based on earnings forecasts for TXRH stock, expect this to carry on in 2023, 2024, and 2025. Even with this strong level of organic growth, the company manages to pay a generous dividend.Shares currently yield 2.07%, with TXRH’s rate of payout more than doubling since 2018. Future dividend growth may be more modest by comparison, but with a sustainable payout ratio of 46.35% at present, Texas Roadhouse may have the ability to raise the payout in line with earnings growth.Welltower (WELL)sheet of paper marked ""dividends"" with a $20 bill on top of it to represent dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockWelltower (NYSE:WELL) is a real estate investment trust (REIT). This REIT owns a portfolio of senior living, post-acute care, and outpatient medical facilities. WELL currently has a forward dividend yield of 3.55%.Affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, Welltower continues to struggle to move back towards prior levels of occupancy, revenue, and earnings. However, a massive tailwind could help Welltower return to its operational high-water mark, then go on to experience continued growth. That would be the “Grey Wave,” or the big expected increase in the U.S. senior citizen population.As InvestorPlace’s Chris Markoch argued earlier this year, earnings could grow by an average of 38% over the next five years, in large part due to this trend. Besides propelling WELL stock to higher prices, this will also likely result in increased dividend payouts. With this in mind, consider WELL one of the best dividend-paying growth stocks.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Thomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayIt doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

To Dexcom COO Jake Leach, though CGM's opportunities are immense, the tech itself in many ways is still in its early days.“Insulin has been around for over 100 years, but CGM has only been around for two decades and it’s only really become the standard of care in the last five years,” said Leach. “So, we’re still sometimes letting people know it exists, because we even still get physicians who aren’t aware of it in primary care settings, where diabetes is a small portion of the concerns they’re trying to manage… When it comes to building awareness, we’re just beginning and there’s still plenty of ways to go.”Still, for Jonas, CGM has changed the way he lives his day-to-day life, and he's gotten to watch as respond as the technology has evolved.AUSTIN, TEXAS - MARCH 13: (L-R) Thomas Grace, Jake Leach, Nick Jonas, Mireya Martinez and Leslie Herod speak onstage at ""Featured Session: Crushing: The Burden of Diabetes on Patients"" during the 2023 SXSW Conference and Festivals at Austin Convention Center on March 13, 2023 in Austin, Texas. (Photo by Chris Saucedo/Getty Images for SXSW)“It’s incredible to see, from my early days of living with the disease back when I was 13 to where we are now,” he told Yahoo Finance. “So much has changed in that 17-year period. It’s really encouraging and I’m now basically able to live my life in a much more free way, because I have the ability to see those numbers in real time, and make those changes as needed to live a happier, healthier life.”Jonas continued: “In those 17 years, so much has changed, and yet awareness about the technologies available I think is still so low. We did a show of hands [at SXSW] of people who either know someone with diabetes or have it themselves, and nearly every hand went up. When we asked about whether people know about CGM, it was a fraction of a fraction, a couple of hands. That’s kind of the spot we’re at, even though there’s a growing conversation around it.”Story continues'We really believe CGM is a technology that's scalable'Though technological innovation is barreling forward, working on making CGM available to as many people as possible is just as important.""We're actually not far away from, for example, something like a hands-free artificial pancreas, but I actually think we are still far away from access to that type of technology for everybody. I fear it will never happen, so the idea is that we need to make CGM available to everyone who can benefit from it. There are still so many people who don’t have access to CGM, and luckily we’ve seen improvements on insulin pricing. I also think we’ll be able to see CGM applications for CGM outside [Type 1, Type 2 and gestational] diabetes, for instance, for pre-diabetes,” Leach said.To be sure, Dexcom has a number of competitors, including Roche, Medtronic, and Abbott. However, the size and necessary scale CGM needs to reach – more than 500 million adults have diabetes globally makes for a lot of space in the sector.“We really believe CGM is a technology that’s scalable,"" said Leach. “I remember when our first product shipped to our first customer in 2006. It was our very first approved product that got out the door from a shipping area that was smaller than this room, and it was one guy packing. Now, the scale of what we’ve already been able to achieve with multiple manufacturing facilities – that kind of scale helps with cost and accessibility around the globe, and we’re going to keep driving for that on the innovation side.”For Jonas, ultimately, CGM has been a tool that's helped him in his daily life, yes, but it's also helped him better communicate with his loved ones and better plan out his life.“Many times I’ve been backstage before a show, and I know that in 20 minutes’ time, when I’m right in the middle of one of our songs, I’m going to have a low blood sugar crash,” said Jonas. “I’ve got a really supportive group of friends and family and team members on the road that are all aware, and know what to do in those situations… I know that a lot of people don’t want to open up that circle too wide, but I think that if someone is comfortable, it’s really helpful to lean on the people that love and support you through what’s a pretty intense disease.”Allie Garfinkle is a Senior Tech Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Medtronic What's The Estimated Valuation?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$5.68bUS$4.92bUS$5.60bUS$5.67bUS$6.20bUS$6.54bUS$6.83bUS$7.08bUS$7.31bUS$7.52bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x6Analyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 5.49%Est @ 4.46%Est @ 3.75%Est @ 3.24%Est @ 2.89% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.3% US$5.2kUS$4.1kUS$4.3kUS$4.0kUS$4.0kUS$3.8kUS$3.7kUS$3.5kUS$3.3kUS$3.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$39bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 9.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$7.5b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (9.3%– 2.1%) = US$107bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$107b÷ ( 1 + 9.3%)10= US$44bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$83b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$80.6, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Medtronic as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.005. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for MedtronicStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Medical Equipment market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance in the past, and go directly to read 5 Best April Dividend Stocks To Buy. Dividend stocks remain on investors' radar in 2023 amid rising inflation and recession fears. According to a report by Ned Davis Research, dividend-paying stocks in the S&amp;P 500 outperformed non-dividend stocks by an average of 1.9% per year between 1972 and 2018.Dividend-paying stocks have provided higher long-term returns to shareholders than non-dividend stocks. Last year, dividend equities emerged as winners amid fluctuating market conditions. Quality companies that have rewarded shareholders with decades-long dividend growth become top choices for investors. The S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index declined by 6.21% in 2022, compared with an 18% drop in the S&amp;P 500. A report by ProShares revealed that Russell 2000 Dividend Growth Index plunged by 5.44% last year as compared with a negative 20.44 return of the Russell 2000 Index.In addition to offering long-term returns to shareholders, dividend growers tend to be less volatile than other stocks, which can help reduce overall portfolio risks. We previously reported that dividend growers and initiators delivered an annual average return of 11.6% from 1972 to 2014, with an annual risk of 15.9%, while dividend cutters exhibited a 25.1% risk during this period while delivering an annual average return of 3.4%. To learn more about dividend growth stocks, readers can have a look at 12 High Growth Forever Dividend Stocks. Some of these companies include Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX).One of the main reasons for picking dividend stocks over other equities is to maintain and increase income over time. For this reason, investors may turn to a dividend capture strategy, which involves buying shares of a stock just before its ex-dividend date. By purchasing the stock at that time and selling it shortly thereafter, the investor can collect the dividend payment without holding the stock for an extended period of time. Our article titled Dividend Capture Strategy Stocks To Buy covers nearly all aspects of this investment strategy.Story continuesBest April Dividend StocksPhoto by Karolina Grabowska: https://www.pexels.com/photo/hands-holding-us-dollar-bills-4968630/Our Methodology:For this list, we selected dividend stocks that will trade ex-dividend in April.

Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for TE Connectivity What's The Estimated Valuation?We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value.

The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.9b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.9%– 2.1%) = US$44bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$44b÷ ( 1 + 8.9%)10= US$19bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$35b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$131, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at TE Connectivity as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.143. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for TE ConnectivityStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Electronic market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?""

But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. Long term ANSYS, Inc. (NASDAQ:ANSS) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 116% in five years. Also pleasing for shareholders was the 39% gain in the last three months.The past week has proven to be lucrative for ANSYS investors, so let's see if fundamentals drove the company's five-year performance. Check out our latest analysis for ANSYS In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over half a decade, ANSYS managed to grow its earnings per share at 15% a year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 17% per year. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. Indeed, it would appear the share price is reacting to the EPS.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that ANSYS has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.A Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that ANSYS has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 3.0% in the last twelve months. However, the TSR over five years, coming in at 17% per year, is even more impressive. Potential buyers might understandably feel they've missed the opportunity, but it's always possible business is still firing on all cylinders. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

Meanwhile, the flow of deposits from small banks to large banks “has slowed to a trickle in recent days, CNBC reported on March 25. The latter data indicate that the banking sector is quickly returning to normal after the mini-crisis. As a result, the mini-crisis is unlikely to trigger a recession and almost certainly won’t result in a credit crunch.Further, the Fed is poised to finally take its foot off the brake, as most Fed officials expect to raise rates minimally for the rest of this year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsOn the economic front, the labor market continues to be very strong, and the central bank expects the economy to grow at a scintillating, annualized pace of 3.2% this quarter.Here are seven undervalued stocks to buy that will enable investors to take advantage of these favorable macro conditions.Undervalued Growth Stocks: Roku (ROKU)Logo for Roku, Inc. (ROKU) displayed on a glass buildingSource: Michael Vi / ShutterstockAs I’ve pointed out in past columns, Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) provides the leading operating system for streaming TV, which has become consumers’ favorite way to watch television. And I’ve noted that the supply chain and ad issues that have plagued the company in recent years should ebb as supply chains continue to improve.Now the Street is catching on to ROKU stock’s strong, positive catalysts. That’s because investment bank Susquehanna raised its rating on ROKU to “positive” from “neutral.” The firm thinks the company’s financial results are “bottoming,” It will benefit over the long term as marketers move more ads to streaming channels.Story continuesThe firm reported that the ad market appears to be improving, while Roku could soon start selling ads to other digital platforms. According to the investment bank, the latter initiative could enable Roku to collect additional “high margin revenue.”ROKU is currently changing hands at a relatively low forward price-sales ratio of 2.35. Given Roku’s tremendous growth potential, I think the shares are meaningfully undervalued at current levels.Plug Power (PLUG)Plug Power logo on computer screen. PLUG stock.Source: Postmodern Studio / ShutterstockPlug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) continues to progress toward becoming a green-hydrogen giant. Specifically, the company announced on March 21 that it had found a way to make hydrogen-powered forklifts economical for the first time “for warehouses that operate fewer than 100 electric forklifts.”According to PLUG, such warehouses buy “more than 25% of all forklifts sold in the U.S.”Moreover, Plug provided hydrogen fuel cells for a recent successful test flight of a small plane that was partially powered by hydrogen. The plane is owned by Universal Hydrogen, which carried out the test and has made a deal to supply hydrogen to American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) “by 2025.” And America’s smaller, main planes are expected to start utilizing hydrogen around 2029.Since PLUG is a major supplier of green hydrogen and is working with Universal Hydrogen, the latter company will likely buy a great deal of green hydrogen from Plug Power, lifting Plug’s financial results and PLUG stock in the process.Plug Power is trading for just 1.3 times its 2026 revenue guidance of $5 billion, making the shares’ valuation quite attractive.Darden (DRI)an Olive Garden sign on the front of the restaurantSource: ShutterstockDarden (NYSE:DRI), which owns and operates many casual-dining restaurants, delivered beat-and-raise quarterly results on March 23.Specifically, the company’s revenue soared 14% year-over-year, while its same-store sales climbed 11.7%. Meanwhile, Darden’s earnings per share came in at $2.34, and it increased its fiscal 2023 EPS estimate to $7.85-$8 from $7.60-$8.Bank of America responded to the news by raising its price target on DRI stock to $172 from $170. The firm is upbeat on the company’s low-price strategy, and it thinks that DRI could beat its same-restaurant-sales-growth guidance of 3%-5% for the current quarter. The bank maintained a “buy” rating on the shares.And calling Darden’s Q3 results “solid,” RBC Capital raised its price target on the shares to $165 from $160. The bank says that commodity prices are trending downwards, which maintained an “outperform” rating on DRI stock.Given Darden’s strong growth, its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 16.8 times is quite attractive regarding undervalued growth stocks.Air Products &amp; Chemicals (APD)Air Products (APD) logo on the Arts Quest building, Air Products is a sponsor of Air Products Town Square at Arts Quest in Bethlehem, PASource: Andy Borysowski / Shutterstock.comInvestorPlace columnist Chris Markoch recently reported that Air Products &amp; Chemicals (NYSE:APD) plans to spend “over $15 billion by 2027 to deliver large amounts of clean hydrogen.”Thus, over the long term, APD will likely deliver strong growth as the demand for green hydrogen by trucking companies, airlines, and many other companies surges tremendously.Supporting my theory, APD CEO Seifi Ghasemi said in February, “We continue to see significant opportunities…to bring green hydrogen to consumers around the world,”And as Markoch points out, the company has low debt and a stable gas business, making the shares appealing to conservative investors. Also noteworthy is that APD expects its earnings per share, excluding certain items, to soar 9%-12% this year to $11.20-$11.50.On March 7, investment bank Evercore added APD to its “Tactical Outpeform” list, citing the company’s favorable valuation and the strong outlook of its industrial gases business.At the midpoint, that equates to a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 23.7 for APD stock. That valuation is very attractive, given the company’s strong profitability and a huge opportunity in green hydrogen.Canadian Solar (CSIQ)A Canadian Solar (CSIQ) display booth at a convention in Bangkok, Thailand.Source: Shutter B Photo / Shutterstock.comCanadian Solar (NASDAQ:CSIQ) reported very strong fourth-quarter results, showing that it’s benefiting a great deal from the very rapid proliferation of solar energy. Specifically, the company’s shipments of solar modules soared 68% year-over-year, while its net income jumped almost 300% to $77.8 million. Moreover, its gross margin came in at nearly 17.7%, near the upper end of its guidance range. And analysts, on average, expect its EPS to soar 69% in 2023.Importantly CEO Shawn Qu, speaking on the company’s Q4 earnings call, stated that he thinks gross margins can reach “20% to 30%..in [the] mid to long term.”And impressively, CSIQ stock has a Composite Rating of 89 from IBD, including an RS score of 90,. The latter score indicates that CSIQ stock has meaningfully outperformed the market in the last year.CSIQ should continue to benefit from the quickly increasing use of solar energy in many parts of the world, especially China and Europe, and from the electrification of transportation.The stock’s forward price-to-earnings ratio of 5.75x is extremely low, making it one of the top undervalued growth stocks.PayPal (PYPL)PayPal logo and front of headquarters. PYPL stockSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is clearly continuing to benefit from the ongoing growth of e-commerce and digital payments, along with strong consumer spending trends. Last quarter, its free cash flow climbed 4%, while it expects its earnings per share, excluding some items, to rise around 24% this quarter versus the same period a year earlier.Going forward, the company may also get a boost from the accusations made by Hindenburg Research against Block (NYSE:SQ). First, some investors who have sold SQ stock because of the accusations could look to buy PayPal instead. And secondly, PayPal does compete with Block to some extent, and some small businesses could give up Block and turn to PayPal in the wake of Hindenburg’s charges.Also noteworthy is that outgoing CEO Dan Schulman, on March 9, said that “I think across our business, we’re seeing strength that’s beyond what we expected.” Schulman said that a rebound of e-commerce, or “discretionary spending,” may be responsible for the rebound.Alternatively, PayPal could be gaining market share, he stated.PYPL stock has a very attractive forward price-to-earnings ratio of 15x.Volkswagen (VWAGY)A Volkswagen (VWAGY) logo on a sign in Turkey.Source: multitel / Shutterstock.comVolkswagen’s (OTCMKTS:VWAGY) revenue climbed 11.6% last year, and it is second when it comes to global sales of automobiles. Additionally, the company’s earnings before taxes jumped 9.5% last year to 22 billion euros. And in the fourth quarter, its global auto sales climbed 11% compared to a year earlier.Going forward, the automaker should benefit from improving economic trends in the EU. Indeed, the number of “new car registrations” in the bloc jumped 11.5% year-over-year last month.Moreover, Volkswagen is a leader in the rapidly growing EV sector. Last quarter, its global EV sales jumped 24% year-over-year to 118,000. In the EU, overall EV sales soared 40% YOY last month, so Volkswagen’s leadership in the EV sector should boost its growth within Europe. And with the automaker planning to invest a great deal in its EV transformation going forward, it should benefit tremendously from the continued proliferation of EVs in Europe, the U.S., and China.Despite all of these positive catalysts, Volkswagen has a tiny forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 4.9x. That makes it among the best undervalued growth stocks in my book.As of the date of publication, Larry Ramer owned shares of PLUG.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance in the past, and go directly to read 5 Best April Dividend Stocks To Buy. Dividend stocks remain on investors' radar in 2023 amid rising inflation and recession fears. According to a report by Ned Davis Research, dividend-paying stocks in the S&amp;P 500 outperformed non-dividend stocks by an average of 1.9% per year between 1972 and 2018.Dividend-paying stocks have provided higher long-term returns to shareholders than non-dividend stocks. Last year, dividend equities emerged as winners amid fluctuating market conditions. Quality companies that have rewarded shareholders with decades-long dividend growth become top choices for investors. The S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index declined by 6.21% in 2022, compared with an 18% drop in the S&amp;P 500. A report by ProShares revealed that Russell 2000 Dividend Growth Index plunged by 5.44% last year as compared with a negative 20.44 return of the Russell 2000 Index.In addition to offering long-term returns to shareholders, dividend growers tend to be less volatile than other stocks, which can help reduce overall portfolio risks. We previously reported that dividend growers and initiators delivered an annual average return of 11.6% from 1972 to 2014, with an annual risk of 15.9%, while dividend cutters exhibited a 25.1% risk during this period while delivering an annual average return of 3.4%. To learn more about dividend growth stocks, readers can have a look at 12 High Growth Forever Dividend Stocks. Some of these companies include Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX).One of the main reasons for picking dividend stocks over other equities is to maintain and increase income over time. For this reason, investors may turn to a dividend capture strategy, which involves buying shares of a stock just before its ex-dividend date. By purchasing the stock at that time and selling it shortly thereafter, the investor can collect the dividend payment without holding the stock for an extended period of time. Our article titled Dividend Capture Strategy Stocks To Buy covers nearly all aspects of this investment strategy.Story continuesBest April Dividend StocksPhoto by Karolina Grabowska: https://www.pexels.com/photo/hands-holding-us-dollar-bills-4968630/Our Methodology:For this list, we selected dividend stocks that will trade ex-dividend in April.

Even though the dividend went up, the yield is still quite low at only 1.9%. See our latest analysis for McCormick McCormick's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsWhile yield is important, another factor to consider about a company's dividend is whether the current payout levels are feasible. The last dividend was quite comfortably covered by McCormick's earnings, but it was a bit tighter on the cash flow front. The business is earning enough to make the dividend feasible, but the cash payout ratio of 89% indicates it is more focused on returning cash to shareholders than growing the business.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 33.9%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 50% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendMcCormick Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $0.62, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $1.56. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 9.7% per annum over that time. The growth of the dividend has been pretty reliable, so we think this can offer investors some nice additional income in their portfolio.McCormick May Find It Hard To Grow The DividendInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. However, initial appearances might be deceiving. Over the past five years, it looks as though McCormick's EPS has declined at around 4.6% a year. If the company is making less over time, it naturally follows that it will also have to pay out less in dividends. Earnings are predicted to grow over the next year, but we would remain cautious until a track record of earnings growth is established.Story continuesIn SummaryOverall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think McCormick will make a great income stock. The company hasn't been paying a very consistent dividend over time, despite only paying out a small portion of earnings. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks.Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock.

However, the focus has shifted to the banking sector because of multiple major banking failures in March sending throughout the financial world.The turn of events could be a silver lining for growth stocks, as analysts predict a more dovish stance from the Federal Reserve. Moreover, many growth stocks offer comparable value to defensive stocks. Some companies are trading at just a few times earnings due to margin compression and lackluster year-over-year results compared to 2021. But as the business climate eventually pivots towards a conducive environment, and companies no longer have to compete against tough comparable metrics, there’s potential for significant upside.Keeping this in mind, let’s dive into seven growth stocks poised to boom, offering savvy investors a chance to seize long-term opportunities.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsVVisa$222.41ADBEAdobe$380.64DDOGDatadog$68.06SQMSociedad Química y Minera de Chile$81.13FVRRFiverr$33.40TSMTaiwan Semiconductor$92.46NVDANvidia$273.08Visa (V)Stacks of coins with trading graph, quantitative finance investment conceptSource: Tendo / ShutterstockVisa (NYSE:V) is a dominant credit card player with a leadership position in financial transactions.

However, the one door closing, the other opened for Visa in the form of resurgent travel and tourism. The robust profit margins on cross-border payments helped the firm to post incredible top and bottom-line growth in the past few quarters.Story continuesThough growth rates are expected to normalize, forward estimates are at an eye-catching 14.2%, more than 30% higher than its 5-year averages. Moreover, according to analysts at Tipranks, V stock is trading at an 18% discount to its intrinsic value.Adobe (ADBE)Hand of woman watering small plant in pot shaped like growing graph representing growth stocksSource: Khakimullin Aleksandr / ShutterstockAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) has established itself as a juggernaut in the graphics space with industry-leading software tools, including Premiere Pro and PhotoShop. Its software stack is virtually irreplaceable in fields like graphic design, video editing, marketing, and others. In recent years, the firm has widened its moat by buying other pieces of software to build its content cloud for creative professionals. Last year, creative cloud subscribers grew by nearly 30 million, a run rate of one million subscriptions per quarter.Additionally, Adobe is looking to cash in on the artificial intelligence (AI) trend, having released a Beta version of its art generator called Firefly. The editing software allows content creators to effectively improve their photos and videos using the help of AI. With the proliferation of AI, the tool could prove to be another money-spinner down the line.Datadog (DDOG)A businessman holding a coin with a tree that grows and a tree that grows on a pile of money representing growth stocksSource: MEE KO DONG / ShutterstockDatadog (NASDAQ:DDOG) offers cloud monitoring and security features via a software-as-a-service model.

Having these functions in place significantly reduces blind spots and vulnerabilities.The firm has been one of the most talked-about success stories in its niche, growing its revenues from $101 million in 2017 to a whopping $1.7 billion in 2022. Moreover, analysts expect the firm to continue growing by over 30% for the foreseeable future. Though it continues to invest heavily in its business each year, the scale at which its growing points to a break-even scenario in the not-so-distant future.The stock market rout last year saw DDOG stock losing over 50% of its value. It trades at around 13 times trailing-twelve-month sales, roughly 64% lower than its 5-year average.Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (SQM)A hand reaches up on a red ladder pointing to the sky.Source: ShutterstockSociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (NYSE:SQM) is a specialty chemical giant establishing itself as the world’s leading lithium producer. That’s reflected in its recent results, which show triple-digit growth in lithium sales. Across virtually every metric, SQM offers robust value. Its A-graded profitability profile is a sight to behold, more so in the past year, with double-digit growth over historical metrics. Its earnings per share grew by a whopping 585% last year, with a 730% bump in free cash flows. Based on higher sales volumes and average prices, expect SQM stock to continue performing remarkably well over the long run.Having said that, SQM stock trades at just 2.3 times forward sales estimates, a 50% discount to its 5-year average. Therefore, investing in this growth stock seems like a no-brainer.Fiverr International (FVRR)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comFiverr International (NYSE:FVRR) is a popular online freelancer marketplace that has taken off in line with the burgeoning gig economy. Its top-line growth has averaged more than 50% over the past five years, an incredible feat, to say the least. However, it’s only scratching the surface with its $337 million revenue base, considering how the worldwide freelancer marketplace is expected to reach $18.3 billion by 2031.Fiverr boasts a highly sticky user base that continues to deliver double-digit revenue growth for the business in the current economic climate. During the fourth quarter, spending-per-buyer reached $262, compared to $242 last year. As we advance, it remains in an excellent position to continue tapping into powerful workplace trends. Its stock dipped over 50% last year, and investing at current levels is mighty attractive.Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM)trainSource: ShutterstockTaiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) is a bellwether in the semiconductor space, generating multi-bagger returns for its investors over the past decade. Bloomberg Intelligence data shows that TSM has over 57% market share in the semiconductor market, head, and shoulders above its competition.TSM saw record growth in its top line due to a robust chip pricing environment last year. Revenue growth is over 42.6% on a year-over-year basis, almost 170% higher than its five-year average. However, it expects revenues to slow down in the first half of the year due to the softness in the market. It should pick up the pace again in the second half of 2023, though, because of a strong recovery in the semiconductor market. Analysts expect the firm to generate 20%+ growth in 2024, following a relatively anemic 2023.Nvidia (NVDA)growth stocksSource: REDPIXEL.PL / Shutterstock.comTech powerhouse Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is arguably the pick of the growth stocks to buy. The California-based GPU giant never ceases to amaze in having its finger on the pulse of virtually every popular tech trend over the past several years.

A Look At Its Intrinsic Value",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marriott-international-inc-nasdaq-mar-141906760.html,1680445146,STORY,['MAR'],"[Key InsightsUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Marriott International fair value estimate is US$134Marriott International's US$166 share price signals that it might be 24% overvalued The US$181 analyst price target for MAR is 35% more than our estimate of fair valueToday we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) as an investment opportunity by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Marriott International The ModelWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.38bUS$2.85bUS$3.46bUS$3.94bUS$3.54bUS$3.32bUS$3.20bUS$3.14bUS$3.11bUS$3.11bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x7Analyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ -6.20%Est @ -3.72%Est @ -1.98%Est @ -0.77%Est @ 0.08% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.7% US$2.2kUS$2.4kUS$2.7kUS$2.8kUS$2.3kUS$2.0kUS$1.8kUS$1.6kUS$1.5kUS$1.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$21bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.1b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.7%– 2.1%) = US$48bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$48b÷ ( 1 + 8.7%)10= US$21bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$41b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$166, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Marriott International as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.123. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Marriott InternationalStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Hospitality market.OpportunityAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a premium to intrinsic value?

Meanwhile, the flow of deposits from small banks to large banks “has slowed to a trickle in recent days, CNBC reported on March 25. The latter data indicate that the banking sector is quickly returning to normal after the mini-crisis. As a result, the mini-crisis is unlikely to trigger a recession and almost certainly won’t result in a credit crunch.Further, the Fed is poised to finally take its foot off the brake, as most Fed officials expect to raise rates minimally for the rest of this year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsOn the economic front, the labor market continues to be very strong, and the central bank expects the economy to grow at a scintillating, annualized pace of 3.2% this quarter.Here are seven undervalued stocks to buy that will enable investors to take advantage of these favorable macro conditions.Undervalued Growth Stocks: Roku (ROKU)Logo for Roku, Inc. (ROKU) displayed on a glass buildingSource: Michael Vi / ShutterstockAs I’ve pointed out in past columns, Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) provides the leading operating system for streaming TV, which has become consumers’ favorite way to watch television. And I’ve noted that the supply chain and ad issues that have plagued the company in recent years should ebb as supply chains continue to improve.Now the Street is catching on to ROKU stock’s strong, positive catalysts. That’s because investment bank Susquehanna raised its rating on ROKU to “positive” from “neutral.” The firm thinks the company’s financial results are “bottoming,” It will benefit over the long term as marketers move more ads to streaming channels.Story continuesThe firm reported that the ad market appears to be improving, while Roku could soon start selling ads to other digital platforms. According to the investment bank, the latter initiative could enable Roku to collect additional “high margin revenue.”ROKU is currently changing hands at a relatively low forward price-sales ratio of 2.35. Given Roku’s tremendous growth potential, I think the shares are meaningfully undervalued at current levels.Plug Power (PLUG)Plug Power logo on computer screen. PLUG stock.Source: Postmodern Studio / ShutterstockPlug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) continues to progress toward becoming a green-hydrogen giant. Specifically, the company announced on March 21 that it had found a way to make hydrogen-powered forklifts economical for the first time “for warehouses that operate fewer than 100 electric forklifts.”According to PLUG, such warehouses buy “more than 25% of all forklifts sold in the U.S.”Moreover, Plug provided hydrogen fuel cells for a recent successful test flight of a small plane that was partially powered by hydrogen. The plane is owned by Universal Hydrogen, which carried out the test and has made a deal to supply hydrogen to American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) “by 2025.” And America’s smaller, main planes are expected to start utilizing hydrogen around 2029.Since PLUG is a major supplier of green hydrogen and is working with Universal Hydrogen, the latter company will likely buy a great deal of green hydrogen from Plug Power, lifting Plug’s financial results and PLUG stock in the process.Plug Power is trading for just 1.3 times its 2026 revenue guidance of $5 billion, making the shares’ valuation quite attractive.Darden (DRI)an Olive Garden sign on the front of the restaurantSource: ShutterstockDarden (NYSE:DRI), which owns and operates many casual-dining restaurants, delivered beat-and-raise quarterly results on March 23.Specifically, the company’s revenue soared 14% year-over-year, while its same-store sales climbed 11.7%. Meanwhile, Darden’s earnings per share came in at $2.34, and it increased its fiscal 2023 EPS estimate to $7.85-$8 from $7.60-$8.Bank of America responded to the news by raising its price target on DRI stock to $172 from $170. The firm is upbeat on the company’s low-price strategy, and it thinks that DRI could beat its same-restaurant-sales-growth guidance of 3%-5% for the current quarter. The bank maintained a “buy” rating on the shares.And calling Darden’s Q3 results “solid,” RBC Capital raised its price target on the shares to $165 from $160. The bank says that commodity prices are trending downwards, which maintained an “outperform” rating on DRI stock.Given Darden’s strong growth, its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 16.8 times is quite attractive regarding undervalued growth stocks.Air Products &amp; Chemicals (APD)Air Products (APD) logo on the Arts Quest building, Air Products is a sponsor of Air Products Town Square at Arts Quest in Bethlehem, PASource: Andy Borysowski / Shutterstock.comInvestorPlace columnist Chris Markoch recently reported that Air Products &amp; Chemicals (NYSE:APD) plans to spend “over $15 billion by 2027 to deliver large amounts of clean hydrogen.”Thus, over the long term, APD will likely deliver strong growth as the demand for green hydrogen by trucking companies, airlines, and many other companies surges tremendously.Supporting my theory, APD CEO Seifi Ghasemi said in February, “We continue to see significant opportunities…to bring green hydrogen to consumers around the world,”And as Markoch points out, the company has low debt and a stable gas business, making the shares appealing to conservative investors. Also noteworthy is that APD expects its earnings per share, excluding certain items, to soar 9%-12% this year to $11.20-$11.50.On March 7, investment bank Evercore added APD to its “Tactical Outpeform” list, citing the company’s favorable valuation and the strong outlook of its industrial gases business.At the midpoint, that equates to a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 23.7 for APD stock. That valuation is very attractive, given the company’s strong profitability and a huge opportunity in green hydrogen.Canadian Solar (CSIQ)A Canadian Solar (CSIQ) display booth at a convention in Bangkok, Thailand.Source: Shutter B Photo / Shutterstock.comCanadian Solar (NASDAQ:CSIQ) reported very strong fourth-quarter results, showing that it’s benefiting a great deal from the very rapid proliferation of solar energy. Specifically, the company’s shipments of solar modules soared 68% year-over-year, while its net income jumped almost 300% to $77.8 million. Moreover, its gross margin came in at nearly 17.7%, near the upper end of its guidance range. And analysts, on average, expect its EPS to soar 69% in 2023.Importantly CEO Shawn Qu, speaking on the company’s Q4 earnings call, stated that he thinks gross margins can reach “20% to 30%..in [the] mid to long term.”And impressively, CSIQ stock has a Composite Rating of 89 from IBD, including an RS score of 90,. The latter score indicates that CSIQ stock has meaningfully outperformed the market in the last year.CSIQ should continue to benefit from the quickly increasing use of solar energy in many parts of the world, especially China and Europe, and from the electrification of transportation.The stock’s forward price-to-earnings ratio of 5.75x is extremely low, making it one of the top undervalued growth stocks.PayPal (PYPL)PayPal logo and front of headquarters. PYPL stockSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is clearly continuing to benefit from the ongoing growth of e-commerce and digital payments, along with strong consumer spending trends. Last quarter, its free cash flow climbed 4%, while it expects its earnings per share, excluding some items, to rise around 24% this quarter versus the same period a year earlier.Going forward, the company may also get a boost from the accusations made by Hindenburg Research against Block (NYSE:SQ). First, some investors who have sold SQ stock because of the accusations could look to buy PayPal instead. And secondly, PayPal does compete with Block to some extent, and some small businesses could give up Block and turn to PayPal in the wake of Hindenburg’s charges.Also noteworthy is that outgoing CEO Dan Schulman, on March 9, said that “I think across our business, we’re seeing strength that’s beyond what we expected.” Schulman said that a rebound of e-commerce, or “discretionary spending,” may be responsible for the rebound.Alternatively, PayPal could be gaining market share, he stated.PYPL stock has a very attractive forward price-to-earnings ratio of 15x.Volkswagen (VWAGY)A Volkswagen (VWAGY) logo on a sign in Turkey.Source: multitel / Shutterstock.comVolkswagen’s (OTCMKTS:VWAGY) revenue climbed 11.6% last year, and it is second when it comes to global sales of automobiles. Additionally, the company’s earnings before taxes jumped 9.5% last year to 22 billion euros. And in the fourth quarter, its global auto sales climbed 11% compared to a year earlier.Going forward, the automaker should benefit from improving economic trends in the EU. Indeed, the number of “new car registrations” in the bloc jumped 11.5% year-over-year last month.Moreover, Volkswagen is a leader in the rapidly growing EV sector. Last quarter, its global EV sales jumped 24% year-over-year to 118,000. In the EU, overall EV sales soared 40% YOY last month, so Volkswagen’s leadership in the EV sector should boost its growth within Europe. And with the automaker planning to invest a great deal in its EV transformation going forward, it should benefit tremendously from the continued proliferation of EVs in Europe, the U.S., and China.Despite all of these positive catalysts, Volkswagen has a tiny forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 4.9x. That makes it among the best undervalued growth stocks in my book.As of the date of publication, Larry Ramer owned shares of PLUG.

(NYSE: CMI) in Fridley, Minnesota (USA) as part of his Administration’s Investing in America tour. During the visit, President Biden will discuss how his Investing in America agenda is supporting manufacturing, innovation and a clean energy economy, as well as creating good-paying jobs in communities like Fridley and across the country.""I am delighted that we will have the chance to show President Biden the innovative work we are doing at our Fridley plant and our incredible Cummins employees who are doing it,"" said Jennifer Rumsey, Cummins President and CEO. ""In just a few weeks, we will begin manufacturing one of the key pieces of technology for green hydrogen production that will help decarbonize our economy and drive the clean energy transition – the electrolyzer. Support from the Biden Administration and Congress with legislation like the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act are driving the clean energy economy forward in the United States and critical to our decarbonization efforts.""Coinciding with the visit, Cummins has announced that in addition to recent investments in Fridley, the company is investing more than $1 billion across its U.S. engine manufacturing network in Indiana, North Carolina and New York. The investment will provide upgrades to those facilities to support the industry’s first fuel agnostic engine platforms that will run on low carbon fuels, including natural gas, diesel and eventually hydrogen, helping decarbonize the nation’s truck fleets today.""The historic investments included in those pieces of legislation played a key role in our decision to manufacture products here in the U.S., creating more clean-tech jobs and positively impacting our communities,"" Rumsey continued. ""The electrolyzer production in Minnesota and investment in our Indiana, North Carolina and New York facilities are reflective of our dual path approach of advancing both engine-based and zero-emission solutions – an approach that is best for all of our stakeholders and our impact on the planet. We can’t do this alone and are grateful for the continued partnership and collaboration with congressional leaders and the Biden Administration.""Story continuesOver half of all medium- and heavy-duty trucks on the road in the U.S. today use Cummins engines. This investment is intended to retain the thousands of current engineering and manufacturing jobs and support the creation of hundreds of new jobs across the company’s New York, North Carolina and Indiana footprint as Cummins invests in its people and facilities to grow innovation and manufacturing and accelerate our decarbonization efforts.The following information highlights the company’s plans to continue investments in its Jamestown Engine Plant in New York and information regarding recent investments in Fridley, Minnesota. Information on additional investment in Indiana and North Carolina will be made public later.Jamestown Engine Plant and the First Fuel Agnostic Engines Arriving to CustomersThe announcement includes Cummins’ plans to invest $452M in its Jamestown Engine Plant (JEP) to upgrade its 998,000 square-foot facility in Western New York to produce the industry’s first fuel-agnostic internal combustion engine platform that leverages a range of lower carbon fuel types. The X15N is part of the new fuel-agnostic 15-liter engine platform produced at JEP.Cummins customers, including Walmart, Werner, Matheson, and National Ready Mix, among others, are beginning to test the very first engines of the fuel agnostic platform, the X15N. Walmart will receive the very first field test unit later in April to take part in the field test of this industry-first, 15-liter advanced engine platform running on renewable natural gas.Cummins U.S. Electrolyzer Product in Fridley, MinnesotaAt the Fridley facility, Accelera by Cummins – Cummins' zero-emission technology brand – will soon manufacture electrolyzers, which are a critical piece of the green hydrogen economy. Hydrogen produced by electrolyzers can power hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and is used in industrial processes like steel production. Building electrolyzers in Fridley is helping to bring the supply chain for zero-emissions vehicles to the United States – particularly in heavy trucking industries – and employing hundreds of workers in the area with good-paying jobs.The Cummins Power Systems factory is a 1.1 million square feet full-service facility, concentrating on design, product, service engineering and manufacturing located just north of Minneapolis. Established in 1969, Fridley employs over 900 and will plan to dedicate 89,000 square feet of the existing facility to electrolyzer production starting April 24. This is a $10 million investment that will support 100 new jobs by 2024.About Cummins Inc.Cummins Inc., a global power technology leader, is a corporation of complementary business segments that design, manufacture, distribute and service a broad portfolio of power solutions. The company’s products range from internal combustion, electric and hybrid integrated power solutions to components including filtration, aftertreatment, turbochargers, fuel systems, controls systems, air handling systems, automated transmissions, electric power generation systems, microgrid controls, batteries, electrolyzers and fuel cell products.

For instance, Target (NYSE:TGT), Dollar General (NYDE:DG) and Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) are now classified as consumer staples rather than consumer discretionary stocks. And Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL) have been moved from the technology sector to financials, which all makes sense. In addition to reclassifications, companies can be replaced in the index if they fail to meet market cap or other requirements. After all, the S&amp;P 500 is made up of the 500 largest publicly traded companies in the U.S.As an article in The Journal of Portfolio Management noted back in 2002:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsStandard &amp; Poor’s has become increasingly aggressive in deleting stocks from the S&amp;P 500 index. Where once it made replacements in the index only when a particular stock had to be removed due to merger or acquisition, corporate restructuring, and bankruptcy filing, S&amp;P now voluntarily removes a company for a variety of reasons, which may include low market capitalization, low share price, dwindling market share, or simply the need to find a spot for an up-and-comer.I would argue that the names below are not only S&amp;P 500 stocks to sell but ones that no longer deserve to hold a place in the prestigious index.VRSNVeriSign$206.10XRAYDentsply Sirona$38.56FRCFirst Republic Bank $13.69BXPBoston Properties$53.30NWLNewall Brands$12.04NCLHNorwegian Cruise Line$13.27LUMNLumen Technologies$2.56VeriSign (VRSN)a man in a collared shirt smiles while typing on his laptopSource: ShutterstockVeriSign’s (NASDAQ:VRSN) big claim to fame is that it owns two of the world’s 13 internet root servers and is one of the world’s largest domain name registry services. Without Verisign and others like it, the internet would be unable to function. In 2022, VeriSign processed 39.9 million new domain name registrations for.com and .net. It finished the year with 173.8 million registrations, up 0.2% from 2021. That business translated into $1.42 billion in revenue, 7% higher than a year earlier. Operating income of $943.1 million for 2022 was 9% higher year over year. Its operating margin is a healthy 66.2%.Story continuesVeriSign’s biggest U.S. competitor is GoDaddy (NYSE:GDDY), which generated approximately $2 billion in revenue from domain name registration in 2022. Meanwhile, the company generated total revenue of $4.1 billion and operating income of $498.8 million. Verisign’s margins are much higher than GoDaddy’s because it has a monopoly on the .com and .net top-level domains. This is why it should be booted out of the S&amp;P 500. Its business model promotes nearly zero growth. It probably always will. Dentsply Sirona (XRAY)Close up of smiling dentist leaning against dentists chair in dental clinicSource: wavebreakmedia / Shutterstock.comDentsply Sirona (NASDAQ:XRAY) manufactures dental equipment and consumables. It has an international leaning, generating 65% of its revenue outside the U.S. In 2022, the company’s sales fell 7.3% to $3.92 billion. Excluding currency fluctuations, organic sales were off by 0.5%. On an adjusted basis, it earned $2.09 a share last year, down nearly 26% from $2.82 in 2021. The company has failed to consistently grow its revenue. In 2016, Dentsply Sirona generated $3.75 billion in revenue. That means its compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next five years was less than 1%. For comparison, the median sales growth rate for companies in the S&amp;P 500 over the past 20 years is 5.2%.Surprisingly, five of the 13 analysts that cover the stock give it an “overweight” rating, with the rest rating it a “hold.” Yet, their average target price of $39.82 is just 3.4% above where shares currently trade.In February, the company announced plans to restructure in an effort to drive growth and profitability. Given its track record thus far, maybe it should do so from outside the index.  First Republic Bank (FRC)A First Republic Bank (FRC) branch in the Financial District of San Francisco, CaliforniaSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comFirst Republic Bank (NYSE:FRC) is one of the regional banks that got caught up in the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. Founded in 1985 to service the wealth management needs of high-net-worth clients, many of those customers bolted to big banks.Fortunately for First Republic, 11 of those same big banks deposited $30 billion to signal to customers and investors alike that the banking system was stable. The deposits must remain at First Republic for at least four months.   However, the damage has been done in terms of the share price, with FRC stock cratering 88% from $115 on March 8 to less than $14 a share today. And its market cap has fallen to a mere $2.7 billion. University of San Francisco finance professor Ludwig Chincarini was quoted in The San Francisco Standard, saying:“The longer-term question [investors are] asking is: What are they going to do with the lost deposits? Either they’re going to have to call clients back and say, ‘We’re doing OK now,’ or they’re going to have to lay off a bunch of people,” Chincarini said. “I think that latter option is more likely.”This sullied regional bank has no business being a part of America’s most prestigious index. Boston Properties (BXP)Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of boston properties, stock market chart background. BXP stock.Source: Ralf Liebhold / ShutterstockReal estate investment trust (REIT) Boston Properties (NYSE:BXP) will likely be one of my biggest mistakes in 2023. In early January, I included the owner of 194 properties and 54.1 million square feet of office space in a group of seven REITS that will be big winners in 2023. Even though it had 4.4 million square feet in development at the time, between the mini-banking crisis and the continuation of work-from-home policies, office space in major cities is seeing sagging demand. As a result, the media and real estate experts are asking what should be done with all the empty office space. That’s hardly a confidence booster.  “There are places in the U.S. where office occupancy is down 20% or 30%, which is a big amount, but not necessarily catastrophic — there are also places where it’s down 50% or more,” said Brookings Institution fellow Tracy Hadden Loh in a January interview. “Those are the places where you start to hear rhetoric like downtown is a ghost town.” Eventually, Boston Properties will figure out how to resolve this crisis. Until then, does it make sense to have an office REIT in the index? I don’t think so, especially when shares are down 57% over the past five years. Newall Brands (NWL)A photo of a sign showing the Newell Brands (NWL) logo outside a building.Source: JHVEPhoto/Shutterstock.comShares of consumer and commercial products manufacturer Newall Brands (NASDAQ:NWL) are trading at their lowest level since May 2020. Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Mark Erceg must believe they are a good deal. He bought nearly 77,000 shares this month at prices between $12.81 and $13. It’s always impressive when insiders make this big of a bet on their company. Erceg became CFO in December, having previously served as CFO of Tiffany &amp; Co., Cerner and several other large companies. Unfortunately, for Erceg, Newell’s shares are currently trading just above $12, so he’s already underwater on his bet. At the end of January, the company announced a restructuring plan that would eliminate 13% of its office positions by the end of this year. As part of the restructuring, it expects to generate annual pre-tax savings of up to $250 million. Less than two weeks after announcing the restructuring plan, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Ravi Saligram announced he was retiring after less than four years in the top job. Replacing Saligram will be Newell’s former CFO and current president, Chris Peterson. Newell has more than 100 brands. It’s sold off a bunch in recent years, but it still owns way too many. This company should be taken private where it can be rehabilitated away from the glare of Wall Street. Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH)Norwegian Cruise Line ship in Spain. NCLH stock.Source: Roberto Sorin / ShutterstockThis is not a slight against Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH), but do we need three cruise line operators in the S&amp;P 500? Yes, I know, there are five airlines in the index, so three cruise operators shouldn’t be a big deal. However, compared to Carnival (NYSE:CCL) and Royal Caribbean Cruises (NYSE:RCL), NCLH is considerably smaller. Its $5.9 billion market cap is less than half that of the former and roughly one-third of the latter. It doesn’t help that Norwegian Cruise Line reported weaker-than-expected guidance for 2023 at the end of February. Since then, NCLH stock has lost nearly a fifth of its value, giving back most of its gains for the year. And it’s trailing its larger peers by a considerable amount in 2023.The company is also burdened with a tremendous amount of debt like the entire cruise industry. Its $14.25 billion in debt is 2.4 times its market cap. That’s high.  Fortunately, travel demand is also high right now, so the cruise line operator should be able to manage its debt load just fine… for now. But I return to my original question: Do we need three cruise lines in the index? I don’t think so. Lumen Technologies (LUMN)A magnifying glass zooms in on the website for Lumen Technologies (LUMN).Source: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.comLumen Technologies (NYSE:LUMN) is the newish name of CenturyLink, a provider of telecommunications services for enterprise customers. It changed its name to Lumen in 2020 as it moved away from consumer services, opting to serve a more profitable enterprise end user. In early March, a class action lawsuit was filed against the company in Louisiana. The suit alleges Lumen intentionally misled investors about its Quantum Fiber residential buildout plans to boost its share price artificially. Management announced in early February that it was cutting its planned buildout from 12 million locations to between 8 million and 10 million.   Lumen is undergoing what CEO Kate Johnson called a “year of rapid change,” which is estimated to cost it roughly $3 billion in capital expenditures. I will admit that I got caught up in the transformation strategy Lumen is selling investors. In August 2022, I included LUMN in a group of ultra-high-yield dividend stocks worth considering. Trading at $11.26, shares were yielding 9%. “Get paid to wait for the completion of its transformation,” I wrote at the time. Unfortunately, the company eliminated its dividend in November, saying it would focus on share repurchases. It was also meant to give the newly appointed Johnson a fresh slate for capital allocation. Dividend investors abandoned the stock, which is down 64% since the announcement. At $2.6 billion, it has the smallest market cap in the index, with First Republic coming in second.

Multicloud is the reality in enterprise technology according to a study from 451 Research, part of S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, commissioned by Oracle. The study collected information from 1,500 respondents at enterprises about how they use the cloud within their organization and found that almost every cloud journey is now becoming a multicloud journey. Read the full report here. Cloud adoption has become synonymous with how enterprises build business agility and operational efficiency. While these trends have existed for some time, more than 90 percent of Asia Pacific respondents agreed that the COVID-19 pandemic has been a strong driver of greater interest and investment in cloud technology. As organizations faced new challenges such as increased levels of remote work and collaboration with new business partners and suppliers, they adopted a multicloud strategy to gain the flexibility and scalability they needed for this new reality.""The 'one-stop-shop' mentality has died when it comes to the cloud. Instead, multicloud is the reality of enterprise technology environments as these organizations seek to get the right mix of solutions and capabilities they need to operate effectively,"" said Melanie Posey, research director, Cloud &amp; Managed Services Transformation at 451 Research. ""Multicloud is here to stay, and enterprises are choosing this model for the benefits it provides for a range of different business and operational requirements, like business agility or access to best-of-breed technology.""Key findings from the study include:Almost every cloud journey is multicloud 97 percent of Asia Pacific enterprises surveyed are using or plan to use at least two cloud infrastructure providers and 35 percent are using four or more.95 percent of Asia Pacific respondents reported they are using or plan to use at least two cloud application providers (Software-as-a-Service), with more than 48 percent using cloud applications from five or more providers.This multicloud strategy allows IT departments to meet the specific technology needs of different teams across the organization.Story continuesData sovereignty and cost optimization are driving demand for multicloud strategiesThe top two drivers of multicloud strategies in enterprises are data sovereignty (44 percent) and cost optimization (40 percent).Other drivers of multicloud strategies include business agility and innovation (32 percent), best of breed cloud services and applications (27 percent) and cloud vendor lock-in concerns (26 percent).Multicloud strategies give enterprises more control over where and how their data is stored and used, while also ensuring businesses can control the costs of their cloud operations by adjusting which services they use from different providers.Enterprise organizations are proactively planning multicloud strategies for the futureData redundancy (56 percent) is the most anticipated future use case, followed by data mobility (52 percent) and cost optimization across public clouds (45 percent).IT departments also plan to use multicloud strategies for risk mitigation for the entire IT environment (41 percent) and geographic expansion or global service delivery (44 percent).The fact that IT departments are planning multicloud strategies shows that they see multicloud as a way to get ahead of their technology needs, instead of simply a tactic to react to crises.""Customers are on-boarding new cloud providers to accelerate their digital transformation goals.  They want to get their existing mission critical workloads on the cloud faster, without the cost or risk of having to re-write, to then tap into the innovation areas driven by machine learning and AI"" said Chris Chelliah, senior vice president, technology and customer strategy, Oracle Japan and Asia Pacific. ""Unique among hyperscale providers, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) offers customer choice to deploy workloads where they best fit - on-premises, on the public cloud or even across multiple clouds.

""From a regulatory point of view, Alibaba may use this to make peace with Beijing on monopoly concerns.""Since China canned Ant Group's jumbo dual-stock offering in November 2020 and launched an investigation into ride-hailing and online tutoring firms throughout 2021, internet stocks have borne the brunt of a market sell-off.

Investors are betting local Chinese firms may benefit, with the nation’s memory-chip business considered relatively advanced and experienced, unlike the domestic logic subsector.The Chinese government said in a statement Friday that it’s conducting a review of Micron to ensure the integrity of its information infrastructure supply chain, prevent network security risks and maintain national security.

Senior officials of this group already held their first video meeting in February to discuss supply chain resilience.In particular, South Korea is expected to take notice of the CAC's cybersecurity review of Micron, according to Wang at ICwise. For Korean memory chip makers Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix, which still have manufacturing facilities in China, the investigation provided a cautionary sign not to follow US actions, he said.That caution would also extend to the Netherlands, following a reported agreement between the Dutch, Japanese and US governments to restrict exports of some advanced chip-making machinery to China. That has created a powerful new alliance that could undercut Beijing's ambitions to build up China's domestic chip capabilities.Micron Technology, the United States' largest memory chip maker, is now under scrutiny in China.

Photo: Shutterstock&gt;Why did China target Micron for investigation?Before the cybersecurity review of Micron was announced, Beijing had not taken any major steps to hit back at the US for implementing stringent restrictions on advanced chip exports to China on grounds of national security.Micron has been perceived by the Chinese government as ""playing a negative role"" in the country's technology industry, ICwise analyst Wang said. ""There is some speculation that Micron was behind efforts to push the US government to impose sanctions against China"".Micron was said to be among several US semiconductor firms that increased their lobbying spending since the Biden administration enacted into law the CHIPS and Science Act in August last year, offering US$52 billion in federal funding for chip production in the US. Months before that legislation became law, Micron announced the closing of its Shanghai chip design centre at the end of 2022 and offered 150 Chinese engineers relocation packages to the US or India.In 2017, Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co, a state-owned memory plant maker in southeastern Fujian province, was accused by the US of stealing technologies from Micron. The Chinese firm subsequently suspended production after it was sanctioned by Washington.Micron previously warned of the risks of being excluded from the China market. In its 2021 financial report, Micron said Beijing's support for domestic DRAM makers could restrict its growth. Unlike semiconductor equipment from ASML or graphics chips from Nvidia, Micron's products can be easily replaced in China with those from local suppliers such as Yangtze Memory Technologies Co and Korean firms Samsung and SK Hynix.How significant would be the impact of Micron's cybersecurity review?The CAC's investigation comes at a time when Micron appears to be vulnerable. Mainland China accounts for more than 10 per cent of Micron's total sales, which makes the country its third-largest market behind the US and Taiwan.Micron last week reported a net loss of US$2.3 billion in the second quarter ended March 2 of its latest financial year, owing to a sharp drop in demand for 3D NAND products, marking the company's worst quarterly loss in the past two decades. As a result, Micron said it will accelerate lay-offs, reducing its workforce by nearly 15 per cent this year, as a measure to adapt to declining global demand for computers and other electronics that use its products. The job cuts will affect about 7,200 employees worldwide.Amid that industry slowdown, China's Micron investigation could potentially benefit the firm's competitors in the global memory chip market.As such, the proceedings related to the investigation and its ultimate result is expected to be closely watched by other multinational companies with business in China. For US tech firms, the CAC's cybersecurity review has added a new regulatory risk to doing business in China, as all foreign companies also must deal with the Ministry of Commerce and the National Development and Reform Commission.A new package of Micron Technology's 64-gigabyte random access memory chips is seen with a computer in the background.

Photo: Shutterstock&gt;What is the likely outcome of the Micron investigation?While the CAC's cybersecurity investigation takes at least 30 days to be completed, the process can take much longer if the case is complicated, according to Beijing-based semiconductor lawyer Feng Qiong, citing China's Cybersecurity Review Measures.The CAC's cybersecurity review of Didi Chuxing, for example, took a year before the agency slapped a fine of 8.026 billion yuan (US$1.2 billion) on the Chinese ride-hailing giant.Feng said China could impose various ""penalties and restrictive measures"" if Micron's products were found to have cybersecurity issues. ""The possibility of applying the stricter liabilities under the National Security Law can't be excluded,"" she said.Wang of ICwise, meanwhile, said fines would represent ""the mildest warning"" for Micron. If there is ""no remorse or any change"" implemented by the company after the review, ""the next step could be restrictions or even a ban on market access"".""This move reflects a certain attitude from government officials who would say the market can be opened up to you and you will be given some carrots, but if you offend us, we can hit back with sticks,"" Wang said.This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

It told international corporate staff to follow guidance in their particular regions.The company said in the memo that the layoffs are intended to make McDonald's more efficient.""We have a clear opportunity ahead of us to get faster and more effective at solving problems for our customers and people and to globally scale our successful market innovations at speed,"" the company said.McDonald's declined to comment on the memo or the layoffs on Monday. The memo was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.Though the U.S. labor market remains strong, layoffs have been mounting, mainly in the technology secto r, where many companies over-hired after a pandemic boom. IBM, Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce, Facebook parent Meta, Twitter and DoorDash have all announced layoffs in recent months.There have been cuts in other sectors as well.Most of those job cuts are at corporate offices. There are still shortages of workers to fill service jobs, such as those at McDonald's restaurants.Policymakers at the Federal Reserve have forecast the unemployment rate may rise to 4.6% by the end of this year, a sizable increase historically associated with recessions.McDonald's has more than 150,000 employees in corporate roles and in company-owned restaurants. About 70% of those employees are based outside the United States.McDonald's shares rose just under 1% Monday. The company's revenue was flat at $23.2 billion for the full year in 2022, but its net income fell 18%, partly due to the sale of its business in Russia.McDonald's warned employees in January that layoffs would be coming as it tried to get more nimble and break down walls between its global markets. In a January memo to employees, McDonald's President and CEO Chris Kempczinski said the company was evaluating roles and staffing levels in various parts of the company.Story continues“We have historically been very decentralized in some areas where we reinvent the wheel way too often,” Kempczinski said during a January conference call with investors. “And I think the other thing I’ve seen is we haven’t been as sharp around our global priorities, and so there’s been proliferation of priorities.”In one market, Kempczinski said he had recently discovered a list of 300 separate priorities.___This story corrects a previous version that said McDonald's has 150,000 corporate employees.

It is unclear how many employees will be laid off.""During the week of April 3, we will communicate key decisions related to roles and staffing levels across the organization,"" the Chicago-based company said in the message viewed by the Journal.McDonald's also asked employees to cancel all in-person meetings with vendors and other outside parties at its headquarters, the report added.McDonald's did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for a comment.The fast-food chain said in January that it would review corporate staffing levels as part of an updated business strategy, which could lead to layoffs in some areas and expansion in others.McDonald's is expected to begin announcing key decisions by Monday.

It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. As with many other companies Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX) makes use of debt. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?When Is Debt A Problem?Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together. Check out our latest analysis for Boston Scientific What Is Boston Scientific's Debt?The chart below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Boston Scientific had US$8.93b in debt in December 2022; about the same as the year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$928.0m, its net debt is less, at about US$8.00b.debt-equity-history-analysisA Look At Boston Scientific's LiabilitiesThe latest balance sheet data shows that Boston Scientific had liabilities of US$3.80b due within a year, and liabilities of US$11.1b falling due after that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$928.0m as well as receivables valued at US$1.97b due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$12.0b.Since publicly traded Boston Scientific shares are worth a very impressive total of US$71.9b, it seems unlikely that this level of liabilities would be a major threat. Having said that, it's clear that we should continue to monitor its balance sheet, lest it change for the worse.Story continuesWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.Boston Scientific has a debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.5 and its EBIT covered its interest expense 4.4 times. This suggests that while the debt levels are significant, we'd stop short of calling them problematic. If Boston Scientific can keep growing EBIT at last year's rate of 11% over the last year, then it will find its debt load easier to manage. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Boston Scientific can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. Over the most recent three years, Boston Scientific recorded free cash flow worth 75% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.Our ViewHappily, Boston Scientific's impressive conversion of EBIT to free cash flow implies it has the upper hand on its debt. But, on a more sombre note, we are a little concerned by its interest cover. We would also note that Medical Equipment industry companies like Boston Scientific commonly do use debt without problems. Taking all this data into account, it seems to us that Boston Scientific takes a pretty sensible approach to debt. That means they are taking on a bit more risk, in the hope of boosting shareholder returns. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Case in point: We've spotted   4 warning signs for Boston Scientific  you should be aware of, and 1 of them can't be ignored.If you're interested in investing in businesses that can grow profits without the burden of debt, then check out this free list of growing businesses that have net cash on the balance sheet.Have feedback on this article?

With even big retailers going under, and the industry consolidating around a few leaders, there remain a few in the “sweet spot” between enormous size and collapse. In fact, I’ll share with you some of the top retail stocks to buy today.What they have in common is that they clearly know their customers from the inside out, they know how to serve them, and they’re constantly looking for new ways to do that. When they make mistakes, they own them. Their message is consistent, based not on price, but on perceived value to their chosen niche.This means they can deliver consistent returns to investors over time. All the companies in this gallery are averaging capital gains of over 20% per year for the last five years. All dominate their niches. They may look expensive, in terms of price earnings, but they pay off in the long run. Some even offer dividends. You can visualize the brands from a quick description. The sporting goods superstore. The yoga people. The beauty people. The home for young shoppers. The middle-class grocer.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAll of these stores went through things during the pandemic, but they came out the other side stronger than ever. Placer.AI, which measures retailer foot traffic, sees positive trends for all these retailers, and that’s good enough for me. They’re listed in order of their five-year returns, and the leader may surprise you. Here’s that list of top retail stocks to buy.Dick’s Sporting GoodsDKS306%$137.18Lululemon AthleticaLULU257%$320.31Five BelowFIVE186%$202.08UltaULTA155%$531.79KrogerKR106%$48.92Retail Stocks to Buy: Dick’s Sporting (DKS)A basketball player makes a slam dunk in a crowded arena.Source: Alex Kravtsov / Shutterstock.comStory continuesDick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) has become the dominant sporting goods retailer, thanks largely to athleisure merchandise and ties to the sports industry. The company was founded in 1948 around fishing and began acquiring other chains early this century under the founder’s son. The company is based outside Pittsburgh but has naming rights to a soccer stadium in Colorado. A new emphasis on branded apparel for sports teams is reflected in a recent deal with the NCAA and Warner Brothers Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD), making Dick’s “the official sporting goods retail partner of the NCAA.”Dick’s has also been helped by its move into e-commerce, the collapse of rivals like Sports Authority, and Modell’s, and regional chains like Eastern Mountain and Olympia. It’s looking for growth from a concept called “House of Sport,” taking over former mall anchors with features like rock climbing walls and batting cages. Analysis of foot traffic indicates good reasons for optimism.Over the last five years, DKS stock is up almost 300%. Its Christmas quarter smashed expectations, and it issued positive guidance for fiscal 2024. You even get a dividend yielding nearly 1.8%. Despite this, some analysts consider the stock a bargain. That’s thanks to a price-earnings ratio that’s still just 12.5.Retail Stocks to Buy: Lululemon Athletica (LULU)A close-up picture of the Lululemon (LULU) sign in the Hong Kong airport.Source: Sorbis / Shutterstock.comLululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU) proved it’s in the sweet spot for wellness by beating estimates on its fourth-quarter earnings on March 28. For the quarter ending January 29, the athleisure company earned $120 million, 94 cents a share, on revenue of $2.77 billion. Net income was lower than in 2021, but there was a reason for that. Revenue was 30% higher.The company also hiked its revenue guidance for fiscal 2024.  That’s what investors focused on in sending the stock up 16% overnight, to a market cap of over $43 billion. Over the last five years, it’s now up nearly 300%.Lululemon was founded in Vancouver, Canada, in 1998, by Chip Wilson.  A decade ago, in the wake of what now seems a silly scandal over yoga pants that cost Wilson his job, I suggested Under Armour (NYSE:UAA) (NYSE:UA) should buy Lululemon, then a small maker of yoga apparel.Today LULU could buy UAA more than 10 times over. Lululemon succeeds with a tight focus on its target market and a business model that maximizes margins by sourcing production from Asia and selling at full retail. Where it was Under Armour for women, it’s now Nike (NYSE:NKE) for women. (Given Nike’s own success that’s a nice comparison.)The company is less about yoga than healthy lifestyles, which let it expand into menswear and grow internationally. It does make mistakes. Its Mirror, a Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) for yoga acquired for $500 million during the pandemic in 2020, created a $442 million charge against earnings this last quarter that analysts (with a few exceptions) barely noticed. Critics also say it resorted to more discounts than normal to hike revenue and hide the Mirror disaster. But it hid it well.Retail Stocks to Buy: Five Below (FIVE)Friends sit on a ledge with shopping bags after shopping retail stores.Source: Rawpixel.com / ShutterstockIf you have a daughter, if you live in a suburb, and if she has even a little money of her own, you know Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE). I like to call it the Dollar General (NYSE:DG) of Generation Z, a place young women can spend a lot of time without spending a lot of money.Despite being valued like a 2021 tech stock, at 42 times earnings, Five Below continues to defy gravity. Shares are up 23% in the last year and 175% over the last five. Revenue has nearly doubled, just since 2020. For the most recent quarter, ending in January, the company reported a net income of $171 million, $3.07 per share, and net sales of $1.12 billion. Five Below was founded in Philadelphia 20 years ago by executives from Zany Brainy, a unit of FAO Schwarz. It specializes in products appealing to young women, most priced at $5 and less. It now has over 1,300 stores, opening 200 new ones this year alone, and believes there can be 2,500 in the U.S. Most are in suburban strip malls and typically measure 8,000 square feet.Inflation is driving innovation, with a new store-within-the-store called Five Beyond, with higher-priced goods. That should boost same-store sales, which were up just 13% in the most recent quarter. Its guidance, to revenue of $723 million this quarter, was below estimates and sent the stock down after earnings.Ulta Beauty (ULTA)ULTA stock Ulta Beauty store front sign located at Laurel Town Centre in Laurel, Maryland.Source: Ryan P Stephans / Shutterstock.comUlta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) is the country’s dominant beauty chain. It was founded in 1990, by a drug store executive, and came public in 2007. It now employs over 37,000 people.Over the last five years, Ulta stock has risen 152%. Most of the gains have come since the start of the COVID pandemic, with men as well as women fixing their faces to face Zoom calls. As the country opened the trend accelerated, and people fixed their faces to return to work. Foot traffic is now well ahead of 2019 levels.Most Ulta stores are in suburban strip malls, offering salons, try-on stations, and merchandise. The concentration is heaviest on the coasts, but you can also find them in places like Garden City, Kansas. The stores invite customers to come in for a day and build their look, then convert them into regular online shoppers to maintain it.For its 2023 fiscal year Ulta sales grew 18% and net income gained 26%. Sales topped $10 billion for the first time. Its most recent quarter was a solid beat on both revenue and earnings, with net income of nearly $341 million, $6.68 per share fully diluted share, and comparable sales up 15.6%.  This has made it a favorite among analysts. The current market cap is $26.3 billion, about 2.6 times sales. CEO Dave Kimbell sees the company expanding the definition of beauty into wellness and self-care. Ulta has also created its own investment fund for start-ups.Given its track record, the price-to-earnings ratio of 21.6 isn’t extreme. While many are reluctant to pay high for a stock going into a recession, it’s unlikely to get much cheaper.Kroger (KR)Kroger (KR) Supermarket. The Kroger Co. is One of the World's Largest Grocery Retailers.Source: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.comKroger (NYSE:KR) is now the main competitor to Walmart in general groceries. While stores like Aldi, Trader Joe’s, Lidl, and Costco offer limited selections, Kroger and its associated chains fill your whole shopping list, often with multiple brands. If its merger with Albertson’s (NYSE:ACI) is approved, it will also have Walmart’s national footprint and half its market share.Over the last five years Kroger stock has doubled, but it is well off its all-time high of $61 per share achieved last April. At its current price, it has a market cap of $35 billion. It had 2022 sales of $148 billion. The low market cap is thanks to tiny margins, just 1.5% of revenue making it to net income. (Walmart turns 1.9% of revenue into net income.) There was $4.3 billion of operating cash flow last year.While Kroger is the chain’s main store brand, most regional chains are now owned by it. Ralph’s is Kroger. Dillon’s is Kroger. Mariano’s and King Soopers, Harris Teeter, and Fred Meyer are also all Kroger. I once wrote complaining about that, because marketing spend is wasted. The company has since launched a single national campaign for all its stores, using animated characters called “Krojis.”There are advantages to decentralization. It can keep wages low. Kroger reportedly “left” the Raleigh market in 2018 but in fact, it closed unionized Kroger outlets in favor of non-union Harris Teeters. If Kroger can capitalize on its national footprint after Albertson’s merger is complete, the stock could fly.On the date of publication, Dana Blankenhorn held long positions in AMZN, DG, and COST.

Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Vertex Pharmaceuticals Step By Step Through The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.70bUS$4.24bUS$4.80bUS$5.20bUS$5.61bUS$5.93bUS$6.20bUS$6.43bUS$6.64bUS$6.83bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x7Analyst x6Analyst x5Analyst x5Est @ 5.59%Est @ 4.54%Est @ 3.80%Est @ 3.28%Est @ 2.92% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.8% US$3.5kUS$3.7kUS$3.9kUS$4.0kUS$4.0kUS$4.0kUS$3.9kUS$3.8kUS$3.7kUS$3.5k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$38bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$6.8b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.8%– 2.1%) = US$147bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$147b÷ ( 1 + 6.8%)10= US$76bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$114b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$315, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 29% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Vertex Pharmaceuticals as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Vertex PharmaceuticalsStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Currently debt free.WeaknessNo major weaknesses identified for VRTX.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

(NYSE:WM were amply compensated",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insiders-sold-us-5-3m-110042333.html,1680519642,STORY,['WM'],"[Waste Management, Inc.'s (NYSE:WM) stock rose 6.2% last week, but insiders who sold US$5.3m worth of stock over the last year are probably in a more advantageous position. Selling at an average price of US$167, which is higher than the current price, may have been the best move for these insiders because their investment would have been worth less now than when they sold.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Waste Management Waste Management Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Executive VP &amp; COO, John Morris, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$3.4m worth of shares at a price of US$168 each. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$163. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).Waste Management insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Waste Management Insiders Are Selling The StockOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Waste Management. In total, insider Leslie Nagy sold US$121k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesDoes Waste Management Boast High Insider Ownership?Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It's great to see that Waste Management insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$130m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Waste Management Tell Us?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. But since Waste Management is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Waste Management. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for Waste Management you should be aware of.But note: Waste Management may not be the best stock to buy.

For instance, Target (NYSE:TGT), Dollar General (NYDE:DG) and Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) are now classified as consumer staples rather than consumer discretionary stocks. And Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL) have been moved from the technology sector to financials, which all makes sense. In addition to reclassifications, companies can be replaced in the index if they fail to meet market cap or other requirements. After all, the S&amp;P 500 is made up of the 500 largest publicly traded companies in the U.S.As an article in The Journal of Portfolio Management noted back in 2002:InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsStandard &amp; Poor’s has become increasingly aggressive in deleting stocks from the S&amp;P 500 index. Where once it made replacements in the index only when a particular stock had to be removed due to merger or acquisition, corporate restructuring, and bankruptcy filing, S&amp;P now voluntarily removes a company for a variety of reasons, which may include low market capitalization, low share price, dwindling market share, or simply the need to find a spot for an up-and-comer.I would argue that the names below are not only S&amp;P 500 stocks to sell but ones that no longer deserve to hold a place in the prestigious index.VRSNVeriSign$206.10XRAYDentsply Sirona$38.56FRCFirst Republic Bank $13.69BXPBoston Properties$53.30NWLNewall Brands$12.04NCLHNorwegian Cruise Line$13.27LUMNLumen Technologies$2.56VeriSign (VRSN)a man in a collared shirt smiles while typing on his laptopSource: ShutterstockVeriSign’s (NASDAQ:VRSN) big claim to fame is that it owns two of the world’s 13 internet root servers and is one of the world’s largest domain name registry services. Without Verisign and others like it, the internet would be unable to function. In 2022, VeriSign processed 39.9 million new domain name registrations for.com and .net. It finished the year with 173.8 million registrations, up 0.2% from 2021. That business translated into $1.42 billion in revenue, 7% higher than a year earlier. Operating income of $943.1 million for 2022 was 9% higher year over year. Its operating margin is a healthy 66.2%.Story continuesVeriSign’s biggest U.S. competitor is GoDaddy (NYSE:GDDY), which generated approximately $2 billion in revenue from domain name registration in 2022. Meanwhile, the company generated total revenue of $4.1 billion and operating income of $498.8 million. Verisign’s margins are much higher than GoDaddy’s because it has a monopoly on the .com and .net top-level domains. This is why it should be booted out of the S&amp;P 500. Its business model promotes nearly zero growth. It probably always will. Dentsply Sirona (XRAY)Close up of smiling dentist leaning against dentists chair in dental clinicSource: wavebreakmedia / Shutterstock.comDentsply Sirona (NASDAQ:XRAY) manufactures dental equipment and consumables. It has an international leaning, generating 65% of its revenue outside the U.S. In 2022, the company’s sales fell 7.3% to $3.92 billion. Excluding currency fluctuations, organic sales were off by 0.5%. On an adjusted basis, it earned $2.09 a share last year, down nearly 26% from $2.82 in 2021. The company has failed to consistently grow its revenue. In 2016, Dentsply Sirona generated $3.75 billion in revenue. That means its compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next five years was less than 1%. For comparison, the median sales growth rate for companies in the S&amp;P 500 over the past 20 years is 5.2%.Surprisingly, five of the 13 analysts that cover the stock give it an “overweight” rating, with the rest rating it a “hold.” Yet, their average target price of $39.82 is just 3.4% above where shares currently trade.In February, the company announced plans to restructure in an effort to drive growth and profitability. Given its track record thus far, maybe it should do so from outside the index.  First Republic Bank (FRC)A First Republic Bank (FRC) branch in the Financial District of San Francisco, CaliforniaSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comFirst Republic Bank (NYSE:FRC) is one of the regional banks that got caught up in the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. Founded in 1985 to service the wealth management needs of high-net-worth clients, many of those customers bolted to big banks.Fortunately for First Republic, 11 of those same big banks deposited $30 billion to signal to customers and investors alike that the banking system was stable. The deposits must remain at First Republic for at least four months.   However, the damage has been done in terms of the share price, with FRC stock cratering 88% from $115 on March 8 to less than $14 a share today. And its market cap has fallen to a mere $2.7 billion. University of San Francisco finance professor Ludwig Chincarini was quoted in The San Francisco Standard, saying:“The longer-term question [investors are] asking is: What are they going to do with the lost deposits? Either they’re going to have to call clients back and say, ‘We’re doing OK now,’ or they’re going to have to lay off a bunch of people,” Chincarini said. “I think that latter option is more likely.”This sullied regional bank has no business being a part of America’s most prestigious index. Boston Properties (BXP)Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of boston properties, stock market chart background. BXP stock.Source: Ralf Liebhold / ShutterstockReal estate investment trust (REIT) Boston Properties (NYSE:BXP) will likely be one of my biggest mistakes in 2023. In early January, I included the owner of 194 properties and 54.1 million square feet of office space in a group of seven REITS that will be big winners in 2023. Even though it had 4.4 million square feet in development at the time, between the mini-banking crisis and the continuation of work-from-home policies, office space in major cities is seeing sagging demand. As a result, the media and real estate experts are asking what should be done with all the empty office space. That’s hardly a confidence booster.  “There are places in the U.S. where office occupancy is down 20% or 30%, which is a big amount, but not necessarily catastrophic — there are also places where it’s down 50% or more,” said Brookings Institution fellow Tracy Hadden Loh in a January interview. “Those are the places where you start to hear rhetoric like downtown is a ghost town.” Eventually, Boston Properties will figure out how to resolve this crisis. Until then, does it make sense to have an office REIT in the index? I don’t think so, especially when shares are down 57% over the past five years. Newall Brands (NWL)A photo of a sign showing the Newell Brands (NWL) logo outside a building.Source: JHVEPhoto/Shutterstock.comShares of consumer and commercial products manufacturer Newall Brands (NASDAQ:NWL) are trading at their lowest level since May 2020. Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Mark Erceg must believe they are a good deal. He bought nearly 77,000 shares this month at prices between $12.81 and $13. It’s always impressive when insiders make this big of a bet on their company. Erceg became CFO in December, having previously served as CFO of Tiffany &amp; Co., Cerner and several other large companies. Unfortunately, for Erceg, Newell’s shares are currently trading just above $12, so he’s already underwater on his bet. At the end of January, the company announced a restructuring plan that would eliminate 13% of its office positions by the end of this year. As part of the restructuring, it expects to generate annual pre-tax savings of up to $250 million. Less than two weeks after announcing the restructuring plan, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Ravi Saligram announced he was retiring after less than four years in the top job. Replacing Saligram will be Newell’s former CFO and current president, Chris Peterson. Newell has more than 100 brands. It’s sold off a bunch in recent years, but it still owns way too many. This company should be taken private where it can be rehabilitated away from the glare of Wall Street. Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH)Norwegian Cruise Line ship in Spain. NCLH stock.Source: Roberto Sorin / ShutterstockThis is not a slight against Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH), but do we need three cruise line operators in the S&amp;P 500? Yes, I know, there are five airlines in the index, so three cruise operators shouldn’t be a big deal. However, compared to Carnival (NYSE:CCL) and Royal Caribbean Cruises (NYSE:RCL), NCLH is considerably smaller. Its $5.9 billion market cap is less than half that of the former and roughly one-third of the latter. It doesn’t help that Norwegian Cruise Line reported weaker-than-expected guidance for 2023 at the end of February. Since then, NCLH stock has lost nearly a fifth of its value, giving back most of its gains for the year. And it’s trailing its larger peers by a considerable amount in 2023.The company is also burdened with a tremendous amount of debt like the entire cruise industry. Its $14.25 billion in debt is 2.4 times its market cap. That’s high.  Fortunately, travel demand is also high right now, so the cruise line operator should be able to manage its debt load just fine… for now. But I return to my original question: Do we need three cruise lines in the index? I don’t think so. Lumen Technologies (LUMN)A magnifying glass zooms in on the website for Lumen Technologies (LUMN).Source: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.comLumen Technologies (NYSE:LUMN) is the newish name of CenturyLink, a provider of telecommunications services for enterprise customers. It changed its name to Lumen in 2020 as it moved away from consumer services, opting to serve a more profitable enterprise end user. In early March, a class action lawsuit was filed against the company in Louisiana. The suit alleges Lumen intentionally misled investors about its Quantum Fiber residential buildout plans to boost its share price artificially. Management announced in early February that it was cutting its planned buildout from 12 million locations to between 8 million and 10 million.   Lumen is undergoing what CEO Kate Johnson called a “year of rapid change,” which is estimated to cost it roughly $3 billion in capital expenditures. I will admit that I got caught up in the transformation strategy Lumen is selling investors. In August 2022, I included LUMN in a group of ultra-high-yield dividend stocks worth considering. Trading at $11.26, shares were yielding 9%. “Get paid to wait for the completion of its transformation,” I wrote at the time. Unfortunately, the company eliminated its dividend in November, saying it would focus on share repurchases. It was also meant to give the newly appointed Johnson a fresh slate for capital allocation. Dividend investors abandoned the stock, which is down 64% since the announcement. At $2.6 billion, it has the smallest market cap in the index, with First Republic coming in second.

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. However, after investigating LyondellBasell Industries (NYSE:LYB), we don't think it's current trends fit the mold of a multi-bagger.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for LyondellBasell Industries:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.17 = US$5.1b ÷ (US$36b - US$6.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).Therefore, LyondellBasell Industries has an ROCE of 17%. In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Chemicals industry average of 11% it's much better. View our latest analysis for LyondellBasell Industries roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for LyondellBasell Industries compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for LyondellBasell Industries.How Are Returns Trending?In terms of LyondellBasell Industries' historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 26% over the last five years. Meanwhile, the business is utilizing more capital but this hasn't moved the needle much in terms of sales in the past 12 months, so this could reflect longer term investments. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.Story continuesIn Conclusion...To conclude, we've found that LyondellBasell Industries is reinvesting in the business, but returns have been falling. And investors may be recognizing these trends since the stock has only returned a total of 24% to shareholders over the last five years. So if you're looking for a multi-bagger, the underlying trends indicate you may have better chances elsewhere.One more thing to note, we've identified   4 warning signs  with LyondellBasell Industries and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Shares are up more than 1% pre-market today.Last week, Cemex (BMV:CEMEXCPO) (NYSE:CX) and Vulcan agreed on a temporary pact allowing Cemex to use Vulcan's seized port facilities in Punta Venado, Playa del Carmen, Mexico. This agreement may help to resolve a recent legal battle that has caused tensions between the U.S. and Mexico.Earlier in March, Cemex forcefully entered Vulcan's port facilities with the assistance of armed Mexican police and military, even though there was no contract permitting Cemex's use of the facilities. Although there was a previous agreement for Cemex to lease part of Vulcan's property, it had expired on December 31, 2022, without renewal. Instead of seeking a mutually agreeable solution, Cemex officers threatened to involve the Mexican government and its armed forces to use the facilities.Martin Marietta Materials upgraded at GoldmanGoldman Sachs upgraded Martin Marietta Materials (NYSE:MLM) to Buy from Neutral and raised its price target to $428.00 from $420.00.Story continuesThe company will report its Q1/23 earnings results on May 2.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Valero Energy with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for Valero Energy Valero Energy's Improving ProfitsStrong earnings per share (EPS) results are an indicator of a company achieving solid profits, which investors look upon favourably and so the share price tends to reflect great EPS performance. So a growing EPS generally brings attention to a company in the eyes of prospective investors. It's an outstanding feat for Valero Energy to have grown EPS from US$2.27 to US$31.22 in just one year. While it's difficult to sustain growth at that level, it bodes well for the company's outlook for the future. Could this be a sign that the business has reached an inflection point?Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. Valero Energy shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 2.1% to 9.2%, and revenue is growing. That's great to see, on both counts.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-historyIn investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of Valero Energy's forecast profits?Are Valero Energy Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Valero Energy, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$233m. This comes in at 0.5% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.Should You Add Valero Energy To Your Watchlist?Valero Energy's earnings per share growth have been climbing higher at an appreciable rate. This level of EPS growth does wonders for attracting investment, and the large insider investment in the company is just the cherry on top. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. So based on this quick analysis, we do think it's worth considering Valero Energy for a spot on your watchlist. You still need to take note of risks, for example - Valero Energy has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

(NYSE:EL) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Estée Lauder CompaniesThe President, Fabrizio Freda, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$5.3m worth of shares at a price of US$268 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$246. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.Insiders in Estée Lauder Companies didn't buy any shares in the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeI will like Estée Lauder Companies better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insiders At Estée Lauder Companies Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Estée Lauder Companies. In total, insider Jennifer Hyman sold US$267k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of Estée Lauder CompaniesAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Estée Lauder Companies insiders own about US$11b worth of shares (which is 12% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Do The Estée Lauder Companies Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider sold Estée Lauder Companies shares recently, but they didn't buy any. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. To assist with this, we've discovered 3 warning signs that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of Estée Lauder Companies.Of course Estée Lauder Companies may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

149,57ecdbc2-6284-37b8-8932-c2bb711e1af5,ADP,2023-04-03,7 Growth Stocks That Pay Generous Dividends,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-growth-stocks-pay-generous-124305860.html,1680180185,STORY,"['TXRH', 'ADP', 'QCOM', 'WELL', 'AZN', 'ARCO', 'F']","[When it comes to dividend-paying growth stocks, it can be difficult to find names that are both high-growth and high-yield. This makes sense, given that companies with high dividend yields are typically paying out a large portion of their earnings as a dividend, leaving little capital to fund growth. That said, there are quite a few stocks that, while not exactly “high-yield,” have annual yields above that of the S&amp;P 500 (1.69%), plus offer the opportunity for growth. Hitting this “sweet spot,” these dividend stocks could be a path to generating solid long-term total returns for your portfolio.How? First, their above-average yields provide a consistent baseline of returns. Then, over an extended timeframe, shares move steadily higher, in tandem with earnings growth. That’s the story here with these seven dividend-paying growth stocks. Each of them has a forward yield of at least 2%, plus the strong potential to report strong earnings growth in the coming years.ADPAutomatic Data Processing$219.90ARCOArcos Dorados$7.62AZNAstraZeneca$68.64FFord Motor$12.05QCOMQualcomm$125.09TXRHTexas Roadhouse$107.92WELLWelltower$69.96InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAutomatic Data Processing (ADP)A photo of a young boy wearing sunglasses, jeans, a blazer, a white shirt and suspenders holding money in various denominations in one hand and sitting in a plush chair.Source: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.comAdmittedly, Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) may not be what first comes to mind when you think of “growth stock.” The payroll processing and outsourced HR services company is generally regarded as a blue-chip. As I’ve discussed before, the stock is also a year away from attaining “dividend aristocrat” status.But besides dividend growth, ADP stock has strong potential to continue delivering further earnings growth. Sell-side forecasts call for ADP’s earnings to grow by nearly 16% this fiscal year (ending June 2023), by 10.6% next fiscal year, and by 11.3% the fiscal year after that.This earnings growth could enable ADP to rise by double-digits annually over the next few years. Add in ADP’s 2.33% dividend, which has itself grown by double-digits on average annually over the past five years,  and it’s easy to see why Automatic Data Processing is a strong candidate for any growth-focused portfolio.Story continuesArcos Dorados (ARCO)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large textSource: iQoncept/shutterstock.comArcos Dorados (NYSE:ARCO), which means “Golden Arches” in Spanish, is the master franchisee for McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) throughout much of Latin America and the Caribbean. The Uruguay-based company operates in over 20 markets.ARCO stock is a name that offers investors not only a solid dividend yield (2.12%) and the prospect of earnings growth but value as well. Shares today trade for only 11.2 times earnings. Arcos’ profitability has been bouncing back since the pandemic. Per analyst estimates, earnings per share (or EPS) could keep climbing over the next few years. There may be big upside potential if this plays out for ARCO. Renewed confidence in Arcos Dorados’ earnings growth may result in a re-rating for the stock. Instead of trading for 11 times earnings, shares may have room to climb to much higher earnings multiple, like, say, 15 or even 20 times earnings.AstraZeneca (AZN)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockAstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) is another established company that’s one of the best dividend-paying growth stocks. The U.K.-based pharma firm reported strong growth during 2022, however, the company reported declining growth last quarter, due to falling demand for its Covid-19 vaccine and treatment.That said, according to the company’s latest guidance, further earnings growth is on the menu for AZN stock this year. Management has guided for high single-digit to low double-digit earnings growth in 2023, as growth from drugs such as cancer treatment Calquence and diabetes treatment Farxiga, outweigh a further drop in sales for its Covid offerings.Alongside promising earnings growth prospects, AZN pays its investors around $1.45 per share in dividends annually. This gives the stock a forward yield of around 2.1%. Although dividend growth has been non-existent in recent years, a resurgence in earnings growth may lead to larger payouts down the road.Ford (F)7 Safe Dividend Stocks for Investors to Buy Right NowSource: ShutterstockLike with ADP, Ford (NYSE:F) is another “old school” company that on the surface may not seem like it is a growth stock. Worse yet, unlike recession-resistant ADP, Ford is a cyclical automaker, and in theory, could be hit hard by a possible 2023 recession.Still, you may not want to dismiss the potential for F stock to become an unexpected growth play. It’s not definite that Ford experiences declining sales and heavy losses during this year. Pent-up demand from last year’s chip shortage may result in solid sales during 2023, despite all the recession talk. More specific to Ford’s bona fides as a growth play, the company’s pivot towards electric vehicles (or EVs), if successful, could put it on the path to earnings growth through the end of the decade. While waiting for this to take shape, sit back and collect the stock’s 4.74% dividend.Qualcomm (QCOM)dividend stocks: A calculator projecting the word ""DIVIDEND"" rests on a pile of gold and silver coins.Source: ShutterstockWith a 2.47% forward yield, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is clearly a dividend stock, but does it belong in the dividend-paying growth stocks category? Many would say no. Largely, because for the mobile chip maker, there’s the overhang of key customer Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) moving modem chip production in-house.However, while this factor has resulted in the market taking a “wait and see” approach with QCOM stock, the company may be able to do more than makeup for the loss of Apple. How? As I discussed back in January, Qualcomm is making a big move into fast-growing areas such as advanced automotive chips.Although earnings are set to slide this fiscal year (ending September 2023), earnings growth may be poised to re-accelerate in FY2024 and FY2025. A return to growth could spark a big move higher for shares, which today trade for just 11.7 times earnings.Texas Roadhouse (TXRH)The word ""dividend"" highlighted in a dictionary.Source: ShutterstockRallying by nearly 30% over the past year, Texas Roadhouse (NASDAQ:TXRH) has managed to stay in bull market mode, even as the broad market has struggled during this time frame. Of course, this strong performance isn’t entirely surprising.The steakhouse chain has continued to report above-average growth. Revenue and earnings both grew by double-digits, during Q4 and the full year of 2022. Based on earnings forecasts for TXRH stock, expect this to carry on in 2023, 2024, and 2025. Even with this strong level of organic growth, the company manages to pay a generous dividend.Shares currently yield 2.07%, with TXRH’s rate of payout more than doubling since 2018. Future dividend growth may be more modest by comparison, but with a sustainable payout ratio of 46.35% at present, Texas Roadhouse may have the ability to raise the payout in line with earnings growth.Welltower (WELL)sheet of paper marked ""dividends"" with a $20 bill on top of it to represent dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockWelltower (NYSE:WELL) is a real estate investment trust (REIT). This REIT owns a portfolio of senior living, post-acute care, and outpatient medical facilities. WELL currently has a forward dividend yield of 3.55%.Affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, Welltower continues to struggle to move back towards prior levels of occupancy, revenue, and earnings. However, a massive tailwind could help Welltower return to its operational high-water mark, then go on to experience continued growth. That would be the “Grey Wave,” or the big expected increase in the U.S. senior citizen population.As InvestorPlace’s Chris Markoch argued earlier this year, earnings could grow by an average of 38% over the next five years, in large part due to this trend. Besides propelling WELL stock to higher prices, this will also likely result in increased dividend payouts. With this in mind, consider WELL one of the best dividend-paying growth stocks.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Thomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayIt doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

(NYSE:AMP) shareholders have seen the share price descend 11% over the month. But in three years the returns have been great. In three years the stock price has launched 199% higher: a great result. After a run like that some may not be surprised to see prices moderate. If the business can perform well for years to come, then the recent drop could be an opportunity.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. View our latest analysis for Ameriprise Financial To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Ameriprise Financial was able to grow its EPS at 20% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. This EPS growth is lower than the 44% average annual increase in the share price. This indicates that the market is feeling more optimistic on the stock, after the last few years of progress. That's not necessarily surprising considering the three-year track record of earnings growth.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthThis free interactive report on Ameriprise Financial's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Ameriprise Financial's TSR for the last 3 years was 217%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Ameriprise Financial shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 4.8% over one year. And that does include the dividend. However, the TSR over five years, coming in at 19% per year, is even more impressive. The pessimistic view would be that be that the stock has its best days behind it, but on the other hand the price might simply be moderating while the business itself continues to execute. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Ameriprise Financial   you should know about.For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

153,9f71f650-da01-3f9e-a138-f83aacb8c3d8,AMP,2023-04-03,3 Bank Stocks to Buy After the Silicon Valley Bank Failure,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-bank-stocks-buy-silicon-184353384.html,1680201833,STORY,"['OZK', 'CTBI', 'AMP']","[With the recent sudden collapse of SVB Financial’s (OTCMKTS:SIVBQ) Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank (OTCMKTS:SBNY), the entire banking sector has been thrown into turmoil. As a result, bank stocks plummeted. However, this creates several attractive opportunities for investors to capitalize.Many bank stocks are being priced down despite being well-insulated from potential fallout from the failures of SIVB and SBNY. And, many regional banks are Dividend Champions with long histories of dividend growth, such as the three below.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCommunity Trust Bancorp (CTBI)A customer makes a transaction at a bankSource: Africa Studio / Shutterstock.comCommunity Trust Bancorp (NASDAQ:CTBI) operates as a regional bank with 84 branches across 35 counties in Kentucky, Tennessee and West Virginia. It is Kentucky’s second-largest bank holding company, boasting a $5.5 billion balance sheet. It has established itself as a tremendous dividend growth stock, with 42 consecutive years of dividend growth.The company offers a wide array of banking services for both commercial and personal purposes, as well as trust and wealth management activities. These services encompass accepting both time and demand deposits, extending loans to both individuals and corporations, providing cash management services, issuing letters of credit, renting out safe deposit boxes, facilitating funds transfers and more.Over the last decade, Community Trust Bancorp has achieved an average annual growth rate of 6.4% in earnings per share (EPS). Over the last five years, it has 9.5% EPS compound annual growth rate (CAGR). Despite this, the recent aggressive increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve has slowed down the economy. Furthermore, the non-recurring tax rate cuts in 2018 and 2019 will likely not contribute to further growth. Consequently, the bank is projected to experience a slower growth rate in the coming years, estimated at 2% per year over the next five years.Story continuesDuring the Great Recession, Community Trust Bancorp proved its strength by remaining profitable and raising its dividend. Therefore, it stood in contrast to many other banks. Despite an 8% decline in EPS during the pandemic in 2020, the bank’s conservative loan portfolio has enabled it to outperform most other banks with very low net loan charge-offs.However, the bank’s stock may underperform its sector during significant market downturns due to its low market capitalization and limited trading liquidity. Hence, investors who prioritize fundamentals over short-term price pressure might find this security attractive.With an expected payout ratio in 2023 of less than 40%, Community Trust Bancorp’s dividend looks safe for the foreseeable future. It is an opportunistic buy amid turmoil in the banking sector.Bank OZK (OZK)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Bank OZK (NASDAQ:OZK) is a diversified financial institution founded in 1903 and provides various retail and commercial banking services. These include deposit-taking products and loans for real estate, businesses, agriculture and homebuilding. It also offers trust and wealth services and operates in 240 offices across eight states.Bank OZK has had almost yearly increases in profits per share since the financial crisis, with an 11% growth rate from 2011 to 2019. Despite the challenges faced in 2020, the company will likely continue its growth trajectory with catalysts like economic growth, interest rate hikes, and a low payout ratio. Bank OZK is relatively well insulated from market movements due to its small amount of non-interest income. With a record EPS achieved in 2022, a 3% EPS growth rate is likely over the next five years.The bank has a strong record of dividend increases with multiple raises each year since 2010. The bank’s payout ratio remains low despite a temporary uptick in 2020 due to depressed earnings. Bank OZK has a strong presence in key markets due to the opening of new branches and inorganic growth. As a result, it the largest bank in Arkansas.Its stability during the last financial crisis and ability to grow profits make it an attractive financial stock. Bank OZK also benefits from its underwriting skill that enables it to earn high yields on its loans while keeping credit risks quite low.The yield is quite attractive following the broader market selloff. Its expected 25% payout ratio in 2023 makes it quite a safe dividend growth stock as well.Ameriprise Financial (AMP)bank stocks Hand inserting ATM card into bank machine to withdraw moneySource: totojang1977 / Shutterstock.comAmeriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP) is a large financial services company with over 12,000 employees. The company manages over $1 trillion in assets and has four operating segments: Advice &amp; Wealth Management, Asset Management, Annuities and Protection.Ameriprise Financial has enjoyed an EPS growth rate of 15.7% between 2013 and 2022. However, it is expected to have a more conservative 8% EPS growth in the future, driven by revenue growth and share repurchases. The large Advice &amp; Wealth Management segment is expected to continue growing revenues steadily. The company is likely to favor share repurchases, given its persistently low valuation multiples, and dividend growth is expected to roughly keep pace with earnings growth.The majority of Ameriprise Financial’s balance sheet is composed of debt, which can cause problems when the value of its assets faces volatility. This was seen in the 2007-2009 financial crisis. However, the company appears well-run, and the likelihood of experiencing another financial panic is low. Ameriprise Financial’s key competitive advantage is its reputation as a well-known financial firm. It has many assets under management and over 9,000 agents.With 18 consecutive years of dividend growth, and the stock price down by about 20% over the past month, it appears to be a very attractively priced dividend growth stock. Moreover, its expected payout ratio for 2023 is just 16%, making its dividend very safe and likely to continue growing despite the broader turmoil facing the banking sector at the moment.On the date of publication, Bob Ciura did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

155,173f4cd7-7857-3266-9d75-18992ca8c902,CSCO,2023-04-03,History in the Making: How Women at Cisco Are Making Strides in Sustainability,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/history-making-women-cisco-making-120000628.html,1680523200,STORY,['CSCO'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / April 3, 2023 / Cisco Systems Inc.The choices that we make today shape history, and this is certainly true when it comes to sustainability. March is Women's History Month in the United States, which began as ""Women's History Week"" in 1982 and evolved into a monthly commemoration in 1987 to celebrate women's contributions and achievements in a variety of fields.In the field of sustainability, women are flourishing in leadership positions. According to GreenBiz, 58 percent of sustainability executives in large companies are female. This number is significant since, across different industries, the global share of women in leadership roles is 31 percent, according to high-frequency data from LinkedIn. But it isn't just the women in the C-Suite; it is about the women growing into their sustainability roles who will become trailblazers in the field.Those who work in sustainability right now are making history by helping to ensure a healthy future for our planet. I want to recognize some of the amazing unsung heroes at Cisco doing this great work in sustainability, from engineering to operations, customer experience, supply chain, and climate impact investing.Catherine Paquette, Sustainability Manager, Global Energy Management and Sustainability (GEMS)Catherine joined the GEMS team within Cisco's real estate organization over eight years ago.During that time, she's seen sustainability dramatically increase in importance both inside and outside of Cisco.She shared:""We've seen a huge shift in the amount of focus on environmental sustainability. It's been exciting to witness.People are increasingly aware of climate change and are pushing for action.During my time here, our team has made great strides in embedding sustainability within our workplace strategy, and within the day-to-day operation of our facilities.We've also set and achieved two Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals. I'm looking forward to this new chapter as we scale up our efforts to help Cisco reach net zero across its value chain by 2040.""Story continuesEve Richer, Sustainability Manager, Supply Chain SustainabilityEve joined Cisco in 2017 as part of a cross-functional group shaping Cisco's holistic circular economy strategy.Over the last five years, she has led a range of programs, including initiatives to embed circularity into product design, increase product takeback and reuse, and accelerate progress toward our net zero goals.She shared:""It has been really rewarding to see sustainability increasingly embedded into our business.The Cisco culture is very collaborative, and I've been fortunate to partner with so many colleagues passionate about driving impact through their roles, whether they are engineers rethinking product and packaging design, supply chain managers prioritizing sustainability in their sourcing strategies, or salespeople engaging customers on sustainable technology solutions.We are working toward some ambitious sustainability goals, and I look forward to seeing the progress we'll make together over the coming years.""Esther Roure Vila, Sustainability Lead, Cisco Customer Experience (CX), EMEAThe economic and technical transformation needed to transition to net zero and sustainable business models will be substantial.Esther joined Cisco in 2007 and for the past two years has shifted her focus to capturing this market opportunity and helping our customers on their journey to sustainability.In partnership with CX Leaders and Sales, Esther supports customers with bridging the gap between their sustainability priorities and an executable roadmap.She works interactively to set strategy, identify and align new opportunities, implement new business models, and drive revenue. She is building and managing cross-functional relationships at all levels of the business to enable our customers on their sustainability transformation, generating sustainability-driven growth.Esther feels most inspired when mobilizing people to tackle the task at hand. She led the organization of Camino 2022 where 425 Cisco employees, friends, and families from 21 countries came together to train, prepare, and hike the Camino de Santiago-while raising funds for global charities battling cancer.The experience was an opportunity for colleagues to connect after an extended time apart and positively impact people and the environment throughout the journey. Esther shared: ""Sustainability is a big undertaking requiring interdependencies between people, planet, and profit.""Jocelyn Matyas, Climate Impact Investing Lead, Cisco FoundationJocelyn Matyas leads impact investing for the Cisco Foundation's $100M Climate Impact and Regeneration portfolio.Her work includes setting the initial climate impact investment strategy, creating a deal-flow ecosystem, due-diligence/vetting of potential investment opportunities, and measurement and evaluation (M&amp;E).She also works with the Cisco Foundation board and climate subcommittee in service to Cisco's decarbonization and regenerative priorities.Jocelyn recently shared:""In order to take the necessary climate action that results in a more regenerative and sustainable future, we need to unlock entire new levels of innovation and investment.Cisco has responded to this call and the Cisco Foundation has stepped up to the task of taking on some of the relatively higher risk, but critical, investments that will pave the way for transformative climate solutions.In my role, I consistently hear that ‘we need more climate investors like you all' and I feel confident that our brand and approach will inspire other foundations and corporate foundations to fill key climate finance gaps and drive forward high-impact, inclusive climate solutions.""Beth Kochuparambil, Technical Leader, Cisco's Common Hardware GroupBeth has been working as a hardware engineer at Cisco for over 12 years, and as part of Cisco's Common Hardware Group (CHG) her focus is on innovation, standards, and now sustainability.The CHG is constantly innovating to ensure our products are balancing power and performance through product energy efficiency.She recently shared:""Industry wide, companies have been setting goals for reducing their carbon footprint, but this is only the beginning. At Cisco, this has helped us raise the conversation in all aspects of our design.Sustainability is discussed throughout the product lifecycle, from concept to customer, and our net zero goal has allowed us to re-evaluate our steps through that process with sustainability in mind.For a company our size, we have a unique opportunity to make a big impact and to partner with customers to drive energy efficiency throughout the internet.Emissions are an urgent issue for our world's health and future generations. Starting with companies and products is a great first step.My hope is that people take it all to heart and begin to evaluate behaviors and usage at home just as seriously. Both will be needed to combat climate change.""Learn more about Sustainability at Cisco in our Environmental, Social, and Governance Hub (ESG).View original content hereView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-inc Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/747254/History-in-the-Making-How-Women-at-Cisco-Are-Making-Strides-in-Sustainability]"
