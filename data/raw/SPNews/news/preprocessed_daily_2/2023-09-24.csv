The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. This means that investors who purchase U.S. Bancorp's shares on or after the 28th of September will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 16th of October.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.48 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$1.92 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, U.S. Bancorp stock has a trailing yield of around 5.8% on the current share price of $33.38. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. As a result, readers should always check whether U.S. Bancorp has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. See our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. U.S. Bancorp paid out 53% of its earnings to investors last year, a normal payout level for most businesses.When a company paid out less in dividends than it earned in profit, this generally suggests its dividend is affordable. The lower the % of its profit that it pays out, the greater the margin of safety for the dividend if the business enters a downturn.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks with flat earnings can still be attractive dividend payers, but it is important to be more conservative with your approach and demand a greater margin for safety when it comes to dividend sustainability. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. It's not encouraging to see that U.S. Bancorp's earnings are effectively flat over the past five years. Better than seeing them fall off a cliff, for sure, but the best dividend stocks grow their earnings meaningfully over the long run.Story continuesThe main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. U.S. Bancorp has delivered 9.4% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years.To Sum It UpIs U.S. Bancorp worth buying for its dividend? U.S. Bancorp's earnings per share have been essentially flat, and the company is paying out more than half of its earnings as dividends to shareholders. U.S. Bancorp doesn't appear to have a lot going for it, and we're not inclined to take a risk on owning it for the dividend.Having said that, if you're looking at this stock without much concern for the dividend, you should still be familiar of the risks involved with U.S. Bancorp. Our analysis shows 2 warning signs for U.S. Bancorp and you should be aware of these before buying any shares.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

The Tories are already 19 points behind Labour in the polls.Continued inflation declines not a givenOil prices have risen by 30pc since June, with the Brent benchmark trading around $94.10 a barrel on Friday. Economists predict it could soon breach the $100 mark.Petrol and diesel prices have already risen by as much as 9pc at the pump since June and are expected to keep climbing.It threatens to undermine Rishi Sunak’s promise to halve inflation by December, which would require it to hit 5.2pc.Inflation fell unexpectedly to 6.7pc in August in a boost for Downing Street. However, Ashley Webb at Capital Economics says rising oil prices mean continued declines are not a given.“It’s on the edge of whether the prime minister would actually manage to achieve his inflation pledge or not,” he says.“If oil prices were to rise to $100 a barrel by the end of this year, we would still expect inflation to fall to 5.2pc in December.”However, if prices keep rising toward $150, “the prime minister would comfortably fail his pledge”, he says.Oil prices have been climbing as the Opec+ cartel has steadily cut back its crude exports throughout the year. Supply cuts mean that two million fewer barrels are now entering the market every day compared to the start of 2023.Story continuesSaudi Arabia and Russia have also introduced additional voluntary restrictions on their production until the end of the year.Adding to the pain, Vladimir Putin last week banned all Russian diesel exports. A million fewer barrels will be entering the market every day as a result.Warren Patterson, commodities analyst from Dutch bank ING, says: “The oil market is basically in a pretty large deficit from now all the way through until the end of this year.”The global market is projected to face a shortfall of 3.3 million barrels a day in the last months of 2023.“We could very well see Brent trading above $100 a barrel in the short term,” Patterson says.Higher fuel costs will hit hardest in Tory heartlandsFor producers, this is the point. Saudi Arabia makes the lion’s share of its money from fuel exports and its budget only breaks even when prices are between $80 a barrel and $88 a barrel, S&amp;P Global has estimated.However, Opec+ will face intense political pressure to ramp up supplies next year. Higher oil prices feed into not just higher prices at the pump but also higher inflation overall, as fuel costs contribute to everything from manufacturing to logistics.Beyond the UK, both the US and India - two big oil consumers - also have elections coming up next year. Politicians will be keen to do everything they can to stop fuel prices becoming the dominant issue.Petrol prices can easily turn into political flashpoints. Blockades by aggrieved lorry drivers in 2000 caused huge disruption in Britain, while protesters upset by high fuel prices also disrupted motorways last year.In France, rising fuel prices first sparked the yellow vest protest movement in 2018 and triggered massive protests.Higher petrol and diesel costs will hit hardest in Tory heartlands where countryside voters are reliant on their cars.It threatens to undermine the Tory message that the Government is more driver-friendly than a Labour administration would be. This campaign message is seen as key to turning around the Conservative Party’s woeful polling numbers.“There are at least some people inside the Conservative Party who wish to demonstrate that perhaps they are friendlier to the motorist than they believe the Labour Party to be,” says Sir John Curtice, the polling expert and professor of political science.That message will be more difficult to get across if drivers are facing much higher fuel costs, he says.As a result, Hunt and Sunak will be looking nervously at rising pump prices.“The question is who will people blame?,” says Curtice. “Will they blame the Government or will they blame President Putin?”Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

The International Energy Agency has said that coal demand stands at an all-time high, regardless of its damage to the environment.Javelin posted record profits last year, according to Bloomberg's sources – beating the $194 million the firm made in 2021, the outlet reported.Its remarkable growth has seen the firm begin competing with commodities giants Trafigura and Glencore.Javelin accounted for just under 20% of all coal shipped from the US in 2022 – which amounts to 12.7 million tons of the commodity, according to Riverside Shipping data.Its rise comes as the world seeks to move away from the most polluting of non-renewables – and Javelin has faced protests for its role in the expansion.""Coal is climate priority number one: If we don't reduce emissions from coal by 50% this decade we have no chance of maintaining global warming below 2C,"" Joseph Curtin, managing director at the Rockefeller Centre, told Bloomberg.

In 2019, Bloomberg announced an initial $500 million commitment “to help finish the job transitioning the country from coal and other fossil fuels to 100 percent clean power.”“Shut down every last U.S. coal plant” Now, the businessman and former New York City mayor is pledging another $500 million in the next phase of the campaign, which aims to “shut down every last U.S. coal plant.”Part of the efforts of Bloomberg’s campaign will include raising U.S. clean energy capacity four-fold to reach a goal of 80% of electricity generation by 2030.Bloomberg’s ambition fits in the current U.S. Administration’s goal to have a “carbon pollution-free electricity sector by 2035.”While coal plants have been retiring at a fast pace in recent years due to the financial pressure of lower profitability compared to natural gas and renewables, halving gas capacity and stopping all new gas plants is a task even the billionaire Bloomberg is unlikely to achieve.Coal plants are retiring, but natural gas – currently the single largest source of U.S. power generation – is helping stabilize the grids when renewables such as solar and wind falter.Battery storage is helping with the intermittency of solar and wind power generation, but for renewables plus storage to take over from all the coal and half the gas capacity, America will need more investments than the $500 million Bloomberg has just committed—much more than the net worth of Bloomberg himself.Story continuesAnalysts and researchers have said that America needs to double the size of its grid to keep up with the renewables surge and the electrification of everything from buildings to transportation. Some have pegged the necessary investment for grid upgrades at up to $2 trillion through 2050.Coal Capacity Retirements “Today marks a new chapter in the Beyond Carbon campaign, as we move to finish the job,” Bloomberg, who is also founder of Bloomberg LP and Bloomberg Philanthropies, said in the statement announcing the latest $500-million pledge.“By working with our partners across the country, we hope to transform the way we power America by moving beyond fossil fuels and replacing them with renewable energy.”In the Beyond Carbon campaign, shutting down all coal-fired power plants by 2030 seems like the most feasible pledge.There are around 150 still operating coal-fired power plants in the United States, and Bloomberg wants to “finish the job on coal.”“With 372 of 530 coal plants announced to retire or closed to date – more than 70 percent of the country’s coal fleet – this next phase will shut down every last U.S. coal plant,” Bloomberg Philanthropies said.This year alone, operators plan to retire 15.6 gigawatts (GW) of electric-generating capacity in the United States, mostly natural gas-fired (6.2 GW) and coal-fired (8.9 GW) power plants, the EIA says. Coal and natural gas retirements will account for 98% of U.S. capacity retirements in 2023.“Aging coal-fired power plants compete with a growing number of highly efficient, modern natural gas-fired power plants and low-cost renewables, such as wind and solar, more of these coal-fired power plants are being retired,” the administration notes.Due to continued competition from natural gas and renewables, as of November 2022, a total of 23% of all the 200,568 megawatts (MW) of coal-fired capacity operating in the United States had reported plans to retire by the end of 2029.U.S. coal capacity will decrease by 2050 in all scenarios, but it doesn’t drop to zero in any of those cases, the EIA’s Annual Energy Outlook 2023 showed.“The coal-fired generation in all three cases comes from the newer, more efficient coal-fired power plants that will remain online because they can provide lower-cost, dispatchable power to the grid,” according to the EIA.In 2022, coal accounted for 19.5% of U.S. utility-scale electricity generation, second only to natural gas, which had a 39.8% share. Nuclear followed with 18.2%, and wind had a 10.2% share of America’s power generation.Halving natural gas capacity and stopping all new gas plants would be a more difficult task for Bloomberg, the Sierra Club, and other campaigners for a clean energy grid as soon as possible.So far this year, all major U.S. power markets have relied more on natural gas to keep a balanced grid system. Despite the growth in solar, wind, and battery installations, renewable power generation has been basically flat this year as natural gas has been the power source to pick up the slack when wind speeds were low or hydropower generation faltered due to lower water reservoir levels.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads from Oilprice.com:Detroit's Auto Giants Reel As UAW Strikes Bite HardBiden Met With Central Asian Leaders To Discuss Trade And DevelopmentEgypt Eyes Energy Revival With Zohr Gas Field ExpansionRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

The area hosts industries as varied as steelmaking and paper production and accounts for one quarter of Wales’ total carbon emissions and about 5pc of total UK emissions – meaning that if the country is to decarbonise, so must Milford Haven.The groundwork is already being laid for a major overhaul.RWE operates the Pembroke Power Station on the south side of the waterway. The facility is currently one of the largest and most efficient gas power stations in Europe. But within the next two years, bosses will have to make key decisions about its future.“If you just carried on with business-as-usual, then effectively you would have to close on December 31, 2034,” says Roland Long, site manager of Pembroke Power Station. “So you ask yourself, what are the options?”Roland Long, site manager of Pembroke Power StationRWE is considering turning the power station green by capturing direct emissions from its gas-fired units and storing them. The emissions would have to be converted into liquified CO2 and then transported elsewhere – probably to be piped into emptied oil and gas reservoirs underneath the North Sea.Story continuesAt the same time, the German company is exploring the development of two “green” hydrogen production plants where electrolysers would convert water into hydrogen and oxygen using renewable electricity.It is also looking at the possibility of an on-site battery storage plant. And land has been set aside for a separate, “blue” hydrogen facility where natural gas would be combined with steam to produce hydrogen.All options are on the table.“We’ve got engineers here working on this right now,” says Long. “What do we need if we do carbon capture? How would we actually extend the life of this plant? It’s about the absolute details, so it’s quite an exciting time for people to work in the power industry.”The oil and chemical tanker Bro Deliverer sits moored on the quayside at Milford Haven waterway - Ben Stansall / AFPHydrogen could potentially allow neighbouring facilities such as the Valero oil refinery, capable of producing 270,000 barrels of oil per day, to decarbonise jobs that involve heating. Instead of natural gas, hydrogen could be used to power industrial processes.However, significant parts of the investment case for projects in Milford Haven depend on other projects being developed elsewhere.For example, the green electricity that will power RWE’s electrolysers is expected to come from new floating wind farms off the coast in the Celtic Sea. The Crown Estate estimates there is potential for 20 gigawatts of capacity out there - equivalent to roughly 1,000 skyscraper-sized turbines.But in the Government’s latest renewable subsidies auction, no bids were received by offshore wind farm developers because the prices offered were too low. That puts a question mark over Milford Haven’s green energy supply.There will also need to be new infrastructure built to transport the hydrogen across South Wales.The Valero Pembroke Refinery in Milford Haven - Matthew Horwood/GettySarah Williams, director of asset strategy at gas network operator Wales &amp; West Utilities, says her company is currently exploring plans for an 80-mile steel pipeline called HyLine Cymru.But the project cannot go ahead without guarantees that there will be both production of hydrogen locally and - most crucially - willing customers.“This would be a major project to support industry,” Williams says. “But there’s clearly no point in building a pipeline if we can’t confirm the hydrogen is going to be available to go through it or if there are no customers who are going to use it.”Some of the demand is expected to come from transport. South Wales Transport is currently trialling buses that use hydrogen fuel cells, for example.However, a string of big industrial users must sign up for the sums to stack up.Against that backdrop, a recent decision by Tata Steel to wind down its coal-fired blast furnaces in Port Talbot and replace them with electric arc systems has delivered a blow.The change means the end of steel production from ore at the plant, a process which could have been done using hydrogen instead of fossil fuels. The factory is instead switching to using scrap metal to make recycled steel, a process that will be powered by electricity likely generated by nearby wind farms.The busy Pembroke dock and the oil and gas terminals at Milford Haven - Phillip Roberts / AlamyMeanwhile, the port of Milford Haven is busy upgrading its own infrastructure in preparation for what it predicts will be a wind power boom. Changes include new “laydown” areas to make it easier for companies to work on large components such as turbine towers and blades, as well as “super slipways” to help transport the parts.While the recent government auction failed to generate any bids for offshore wind projects, Sawyer believes future rounds are bound to yield results given the potential of the Celtic Sea.“You’ve got more than 1,000, very, very large turbines going up,” Sawyer adds. “They’ll need businesses that can make anchors, chains, cabling, so you need welders, fabricators and mechanical and electrical engineers - there’s just this enormous opportunity.”Combined plans could inject £6bn into local economyEven if Port Talbot won’t be using hydrogen for its electric arc furnaces, Sawyer argues the recycled steel the plant will produce should be suitable for making the wind turbines.“I actually see the steel announcement at Port Talbot as fantastic, because that was always going to be the long pole in the tent.”The port of Milford Haven has applied for grant funding from the Government to help finance the work. If all goes to plan, it is hoped the combined plans in the South Wales Industrial Cluster could add £6bn to the local economy.The port is also bidding to become a freeport, which will unlock tax breaks such as business rates relief for all the new infrastructure that is planned. Speedy planning consents and upgrades to local grid capacity are also seen as vital.“We want to win this competition,” says Sawyer. “And we see ourselves competing with Portugal and Norway and the Far East to win this business.“It’s genuinely a once in a generation opportunity - and it finally feels like there is momentum building behind us.”Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

So are new artificial intelligence solutions to fight them,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/threat-wildfires-rising-artificial-intelligence-070753402.html,1695539273,STORY,['MSFT'],"[LONDON (AP) — Wildfires fueled by climate change have ravaged communities from Maui to the Mediterranean this summer, killing many people, exhausting firefighters and fueling demand for new solutions. Enter artificial intelligence.Firefighters and startups are using AI-enabled cameras to scan the horizon for signs of smoke. A German company is building a constellation of satellites to detect fires from space. And Microsoft is using AI models to predict where the next blaze could be sparked.With wildfires becoming larger and more intense as the world warms, firefighters, utilities and governments are scrambling to get ahead of the flames by tapping into the latest AI technology — which has stirred both fear and excitement for its potential to transform life. While increasingly stretched first responders hope AI offers them a leg up, humans are still needed to check that the tech is accurate.California's main firefighting agency this summer started testing an AI system that looks for smoke from more than 1,000 mountaintop camera feeds and is now expanding it statewide.The system is designed to find “abnormalities” and alert emergency command centers, where staffers will confirm whether it’s indeed smoke or something else in the air.“The beauty of this is that it immediately pops up on the screen and those dispatchers or call takers are able to interrogate that screen” and determine whether to send a crew, said Phillip SeLegue, staff chief of intelligence for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.The cameras, part of a network that workers previously had to watch, provide billions of bytes of data for the AI system to digest. While humans still need to confirm any smoke sightings, the system helps reduce fatigue among staffers typically monitoring multiple screens and cameras, alerting them to look only when there's possible fire or smoke, SeLegue said.It's already helped. A battalion chief got a smoke alert in the middle of the night, confirmed it on his cellphone and called a command center in San Diego to scramble first responders to the remote area.Story continuesThe dispatchers said that if they hadn’t been alerted, the fire would have been much larger because it likely wouldn't have been noticed until the next morning, SeLegue said.San Francisco startup Pano AI takes a similar approach, mounting cameras on cell towers that scan for smoke and alert customers, including fire departments, utility companies and ski resorts.The cameras use computer vision machine learning, a type of AI.“They’re trained very specifically to detect smoke or not, and we train them with images of smoke and images of not smoke,” CEO Sonia Kastner said.The images are combined with feeds from government weather satellites that scan for hotspots, along with other data sources, such as social media posts.The technology gets around one of the main problems in the traditional way of detecting wildfires — relying on 911 calls from passers-by that need confirmation from staffers before crews and water-dropping planes can be deployed.“Generally, only one in 20 of these 911 calls are actually a wildfire. Even during fire season, it might be a cloud or fog or a barbecue,” Kastner said.Pano AI’s systems do still rely on final confirmation, with managers playing a time lapse of the camera feed to ensure it’s smoke rising.For fighting forest fires, “technology is becoming really essential,” said Larry Bekkedahl, senior vice president of energy delivery at Portland General Electric, Oregon’s largest utility and a Pano AI customer.Utility companies sometimes play a role in sparking wildfires, when their power lines are knocked down by wind or struck by falling trees. Hawaii’s electric utility acknowledged that its power lines started a devastating blaze in Maui this summer after apparently being downed by high winds.PGE, which provides electricity to 51 cities in Oregon, has deployed 26 Pano AI cameras, and Bekkedahl said they have helped speed up response and coordination with emergency services.Previously, fire departments were “running around looking for stuff and not even really knowing exactly where it’s at,” he said. The cameras help detect fires quicker and get teams on the ground faster, shaving up to two hours off response times.“That’s significant in terms of how fast that fire can can spread and grow,” Bekkedahl said.Using AI to detect smoke from fires “is relatively easy,” said Juan Lavista Ferres, chief data scientist at Microsoft.“What is not easy is to have enough cameras that cover enough places,” he said, pointing to vast, remote areas in northern Canada that have burned this summer.Ferres' team at Microsoft has been developing AI models to predict where fires are likely to start. They have fed the model with maps of areas that burned previously, along with climate and geospatial data.The system has its limitations — it can't predict random events like a lightning strike. But it can sift through historical weather and climate data to identify patterns, such as areas that are typically drier. Even a road, which indicates people are nearby, is a risk factor, Ferres said.“It’s not going to get it all perfectly right,"" he said. ""But what it can do is it can build a probability map (based on) what happened in the past.”The technology, which Microsoft plans to offer as an open source tool, can help first responders trying to figure out where to focus their limited resources, Ferres said.Another company is looking to the heavens for a solution. German startup OroraTech analyzes satellite images with artificial intelligence.Taking advantage of advances in camera, satellite and AI technology, OroraTech has launched two mini satellites about the size of a shoebox into low orbit, about 550 kilometers (340 miles) above Earth’s surface. The Munich-based company has ambitions to send up eight more next year and eventually put 100 into space.As wildfires swept central Chile this year, OroraTech said it provided thermal images at night when aerial drones are used less frequently.Weeks after OroraTech launched its second satellite, it detected a fire near the community of Keg River in northern Alberta, where flames burned remote stretches of boreal forest repeatedly this summer.""There are algorithms on the satellite, very efficient ones to detect fires even faster,"" CEO Thomas Gruebler said.The AI also takes into account vegetation and humidity levels to identify flare-ups that could spawn devastating megafires. The technology could help thinly stretched firefighting agencies direct resources to blazes with the potential to cause the most damage.“Because we know exactly where the fires are, we can see how the fires will propagate,"" Gruebler said. “So, which fire will be the big fire in one day and which will stop on their own.”___AP Technology Writer Barbara Ortutay in San Francisco contributed.]"

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. So, when we ran our eye over Sysco's (NYSE:SYY) trend of ROCE, we liked what we saw.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Sysco is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.19 = US$2.7b ÷ (US$23b - US$8.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).So, Sysco has an ROCE of 19%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Consumer Retailing industry average of 13% it's much better. View our latest analysis for Sysco roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Sysco compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Sysco here  for free.How Are Returns Trending?While the current returns on capital are decent, they haven't changed much. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 19% and the business has deployed 24% more capital into its operations. Since 19% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.The Bottom Line On Sysco's ROCETo sum it up, Sysco has simply been reinvesting capital steadily, at those decent rates of return. And given the stock has only risen 6.3% over the last five years, we'd suspect the market is beginning to recognize these trends. So to determine if Sysco is a multi-bagger going forward, we'd suggest digging deeper into the company's other fundamentals.Story continuesOne more thing, we've spotted   1 warning sign  facing Sysco that you might find interesting.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the stock market outlook and industries benefiting the most due to high interest rates, head directly to 5 Best Investments During High Interest Rates.According to J.P. Morgan's analysis last year, as mentioned by Forbes, starting from February 2009, there was a strong correlation between the movements of the S&amp;P 500 and the 10-year Treasury bond yield until the 10-year yield reached 3.5%, at which point they began to diverge. In simpler terms, increasing interest rates can benefit the overall stock market up to a certain threshold. Rising interest rates have several implications for financial markets. They tend to put pressure on stock valuations, impacting corporate profits and growth prospects, especially for growth stocks. Dividend-paying stocks may need to increase yields to compete with potentially higher bond coupon rates. However, financials, particularly banks and lending institutions, historically perform well in rising rate environments as they can earn more on loans.""As the Federal Reserve increases interest rates, we can anticipate a deceleration in economic growth,"" Eric Freedman, Chief Investment Officer, U.S. Bank Wealth and Institutional Asset Management, commented in July 2023. Indeed, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expanded at a notably slower rate in 2022, registering a 2.1% growth compared to the 5.9% seen in 2021. In the first quarter of 2023, the economy seemed to stabilize, achieving a 2.0% annualized growth rate. Hiked interest rates have also altered the landscape for equity investors, leading to potential impacts on future earnings growth for U.S. companies. Economic weakness, resulting in slower GDP growth, can affect corporate earnings and stock prices. Additionally, the attractiveness of bonds and other fixed income investments increases with higher interest rates, potentially reducing demand for stocks. Stocks with premium price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples, particularly those with future earnings expectations that may not materialize, face risks in this changing environment. Higher debt costs due to elevated interest rates could also impact corporate profits and stock prices. While the Federal Reserve has signaled more rate hikes to come, the outlook for equities remains uncertain, with factors like corporate performance and inflation influencing market dynamics and potential volatility ahead.Story continuesIt's not only financial companies that can thrive in a favorable rising interest rate environment. Consumer discretionary stocks can also experience a boost, as improved employment and a healthier housing market tend to encourage consumers to indulge in non-essential purchases beyond basic staples like food, beverages, and hygiene products. According to CNBC, in July 2022, the United States' inflation rate, assessed through the Consumer Price Index, stood at 8.5%. Although the impact of inflation varied across different goods and services, categories like food and energy witnessed the most significant price increases. Some noteworthy companies to watch during interest rate hikes include Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), in the banking and finance sector, as well as consumer goods retailers such as Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT).Investors should consider strategies for navigating this environment, such as strategic bond investments to manage rate exposure, actively managed strategies to mitigate concentration risk, and diversification across sectors, regions, and market capitalization to maintain a balanced portfolio. Investors looking to expand their portfolio through low-risk investment opportunities during a period with hiked interest rates can look at Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK.A).Our Methodology We selected stocks from industries that historically perform well during high interest rate environments, such as consumer staples, banking, retail, and insurance. We aimed to select stocks that had the highest hedge fund sentiment in the aforementioned sectors. We assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 910 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the second quarter of 2023. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund investors in each firm.10 Best Investments During High Interest RatesPhoto by Mirza Babic on UnsplashBest Investments During High Interest Rates10.

Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Let's assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Investments During High Interest Rates.  Suggested articles:30 Low Cost Business Ideas With High Profit12 Best Streaming and TV Stocks To Buy Now12 Best Growth ETFs to Buy Disclosure: None. 10 Best Investments During High Interest Rates is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Identify undervalued stocks, put your capital to work and reap the rewards of your patience as they increase in value at some later point. This month, as in any other, there are deals to be had with undervalued energy stocks.All of the firms discussed include dividends. Thus, those who invest now in anticipation of price increases will get the immediate benefit of dividend income. That said, let’s take a deeper dive into said undervalued energy stocks. NextEra Energy (NEE) Nextra Energy (NEE) website on a mobile phone screenSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comNextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is an energy stock in the sense that it provides energy. It is not a traditional energy stock in that it doesn’t sell oil. The company operates an electric utilities firm in Florida and another business segment focused on solar and wind power generation. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsEach of those is the largest among its competitors. Florida Power &amp; Light is the largest U.S. electric utility while NextEra Energy Resources is the world’s largest generator of solar and wind power. In fact, NextEra Energy Resources has become the larger contributor to the firm’s overall revenues. That’s a testament to the value of renewable energy and to NextEra Energy as an investment. The company continues to grow based on both top and bottom-line results. Buy NEE stock because it is undervalued, includes a dividend yielding 2.8% and has built an enviable and diversified business overall. The company is future-proofing itself and combines the stability of a utilities firm with dividends and the growth of the renewables sector. It’s a win-win situation.  Schlumberger (SLB)slb stockSource: Valentin Martynov / Shutterstock.comSchlumberger (NYSE:SLB) continues to offer upside to investors and remains highly regarded by Wall Street. That combination of factors is almost always positive. The company is an exploration and production firm (E&amp;P) but is more aligned with the services side than the actual business of drilling itself. Story continuesAs with any E&amp;P firm, Schlumberger benefits as prices rise and firms get into the field to extract that oil. The company then has much more fertile ground into which it can sell its services. Schlumberger’s earnings were pretty much right where Wall Street expected. Revenues rose by 20% while EPS increased by 44% year-over-year. The sector is marked by a positive outlook moving into 2024. International activity and offshore activity are both expected to continue to strengthen with large firms like Schlumberger expected to benefit. The company also recently increased its dividend. That’s good for income investors and a positive sign overall. ConocoPhillips (COP) In the field, the oil pump in the evening, the evening silhouette of the pumping unit, the silhouette of the oil pump. Oil stocks and energy stocksSource: zhengzaishuru / Shutterstock.comConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is also an exploration and production firm within the energy sector. It is perhaps more accurately described as an Oil Major and although pumping oil is its bread and butter, it touches the entire value chain. Like just about every other oil E&amp;P, ConocoPhillips is dealing with the hangover that is 2023. Prices for a barrel of oil were much lower during Q2 2023 compared to Q2 2022. ConocoPhillips’ EPS more than halved as a result, falling to $1.84. That may sound discouraging but Oil Majors have pretty well built these factors into their business models. It hasn’t correlated to a halving of share prices, not even close. Nor is there any expectation of that occurring. The company has raised dividends and increased share buyback authority. It’s all about rewarding the investor in the good times and the bad while continuing to explore for more oil. ConocoPhillips has been one of the best at doing exactly that and will continue to be among the best moving forward. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So, when we ran our eye over General Dynamics' (NYSE:GD) trend of ROCE, we liked what we saw.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for General Dynamics:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.11 = US$4.2b ÷ (US$53b - US$16b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).So, General Dynamics has an ROCE of 11%.  That's a relatively normal return on capital, and it's around the 9.5% generated by the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry. See our latest analysis for General Dynamics roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for General Dynamics compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering General Dynamics here  for free.What Does the ROCE Trend For General Dynamics Tell Us?While the returns on capital are good, they haven't moved much. The company has employed 21% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 11%. Since 11% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On General Dynamics' ROCEThe main thing to remember is that General Dynamics has proven its ability to continually reinvest at respectable rates of return. And given the stock has only risen 20% over the last five years, we'd suspect the market is beginning to recognize these trends. So because of the trends we're seeing, we'd recommend looking further into this stock to see if it has the makings of a multi-bagger.One more thing to note, we've identified   2 warning signs  with General Dynamics and understanding them should be part of your investment process.While General Dynamics isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

The Tories are already 19 points behind Labour in the polls.Continued inflation declines not a givenOil prices have risen by 30pc since June, with the Brent benchmark trading around $94.10 a barrel on Friday. Economists predict it could soon breach the $100 mark.Petrol and diesel prices have already risen by as much as 9pc at the pump since June and are expected to keep climbing.It threatens to undermine Rishi Sunak’s promise to halve inflation by December, which would require it to hit 5.2pc.Inflation fell unexpectedly to 6.7pc in August in a boost for Downing Street. However, Ashley Webb at Capital Economics says rising oil prices mean continued declines are not a given.“It’s on the edge of whether the prime minister would actually manage to achieve his inflation pledge or not,” he says.“If oil prices were to rise to $100 a barrel by the end of this year, we would still expect inflation to fall to 5.2pc in December.”However, if prices keep rising toward $150, “the prime minister would comfortably fail his pledge”, he says.Oil prices have been climbing as the Opec+ cartel has steadily cut back its crude exports throughout the year. Supply cuts mean that two million fewer barrels are now entering the market every day compared to the start of 2023.Story continuesSaudi Arabia and Russia have also introduced additional voluntary restrictions on their production until the end of the year.Adding to the pain, Vladimir Putin last week banned all Russian diesel exports. A million fewer barrels will be entering the market every day as a result.Warren Patterson, commodities analyst from Dutch bank ING, says: “The oil market is basically in a pretty large deficit from now all the way through until the end of this year.”The global market is projected to face a shortfall of 3.3 million barrels a day in the last months of 2023.“We could very well see Brent trading above $100 a barrel in the short term,” Patterson says.Higher fuel costs will hit hardest in Tory heartlandsFor producers, this is the point. Saudi Arabia makes the lion’s share of its money from fuel exports and its budget only breaks even when prices are between $80 a barrel and $88 a barrel, S&amp;P Global has estimated.However, Opec+ will face intense political pressure to ramp up supplies next year. Higher oil prices feed into not just higher prices at the pump but also higher inflation overall, as fuel costs contribute to everything from manufacturing to logistics.Beyond the UK, both the US and India - two big oil consumers - also have elections coming up next year. Politicians will be keen to do everything they can to stop fuel prices becoming the dominant issue.Petrol prices can easily turn into political flashpoints. Blockades by aggrieved lorry drivers in 2000 caused huge disruption in Britain, while protesters upset by high fuel prices also disrupted motorways last year.In France, rising fuel prices first sparked the yellow vest protest movement in 2018 and triggered massive protests.Higher petrol and diesel costs will hit hardest in Tory heartlands where countryside voters are reliant on their cars.It threatens to undermine the Tory message that the Government is more driver-friendly than a Labour administration would be. This campaign message is seen as key to turning around the Conservative Party’s woeful polling numbers.“There are at least some people inside the Conservative Party who wish to demonstrate that perhaps they are friendlier to the motorist than they believe the Labour Party to be,” says Sir John Curtice, the polling expert and professor of political science.That message will be more difficult to get across if drivers are facing much higher fuel costs, he says.As a result, Hunt and Sunak will be looking nervously at rising pump prices.“The question is who will people blame?,” says Curtice. “Will they blame the Government or will they blame President Putin?”Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

The International Energy Agency has said that coal demand stands at an all-time high, regardless of its damage to the environment.Javelin posted record profits last year, according to Bloomberg's sources – beating the $194 million the firm made in 2021, the outlet reported.Its remarkable growth has seen the firm begin competing with commodities giants Trafigura and Glencore.Javelin accounted for just under 20% of all coal shipped from the US in 2022 – which amounts to 12.7 million tons of the commodity, according to Riverside Shipping data.Its rise comes as the world seeks to move away from the most polluting of non-renewables – and Javelin has faced protests for its role in the expansion.""Coal is climate priority number one: If we don't reduce emissions from coal by 50% this decade we have no chance of maintaining global warming below 2C,"" Joseph Curtin, managing director at the Rockefeller Centre, told Bloomberg.

34,11b6d89a-f8ce-3cec-b179-1c9914bf4957,NOV,2023-09-24,Michael Bloomberg Pledges Another $500 Million To “Finish The Job On Coal”,Oilprice.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/michael-bloomberg-pledges-another-500-150000514.html,1695481200,STORY,"['NG=F', 'CL=F']","[Michael Bloomberg is doubling down on his climate ambition to “finish the job on coal” and shut down all remaining coal-fired power plants in the United States by 2030.As part of the Beyond Carbon campaign, Bloomberg, who is also the UN Special Envoy on Climate Ambition and Solutions, announced this week an additional $500 million commitment to end coal-fired generation in the U.S., block all new natural gas plants, and slash gas plant capacity by half by the end of the decade.Bloomberg, via Bloomberg Philanthropies, will continue to invest to expand the Beyond Carbon campaign, a Sierra Club campaign launched in 2011, to which Bloomberg first contributed $50 million. In 2019, Bloomberg announced an initial $500 million commitment “to help finish the job transitioning the country from coal and other fossil fuels to 100 percent clean power.”“Shut down every last U.S. coal plant” Now, the businessman and former New York City mayor is pledging another $500 million in the next phase of the campaign, which aims to “shut down every last U.S. coal plant.”Part of the efforts of Bloomberg’s campaign will include raising U.S. clean energy capacity four-fold to reach a goal of 80% of electricity generation by 2030.Bloomberg’s ambition fits in the current U.S. Administration’s goal to have a “carbon pollution-free electricity sector by 2035.”While coal plants have been retiring at a fast pace in recent years due to the financial pressure of lower profitability compared to natural gas and renewables, halving gas capacity and stopping all new gas plants is a task even the billionaire Bloomberg is unlikely to achieve.Coal plants are retiring, but natural gas – currently the single largest source of U.S. power generation – is helping stabilize the grids when renewables such as solar and wind falter.Battery storage is helping with the intermittency of solar and wind power generation, but for renewables plus storage to take over from all the coal and half the gas capacity, America will need more investments than the $500 million Bloomberg has just committed—much more than the net worth of Bloomberg himself.Story continuesAnalysts and researchers have said that America needs to double the size of its grid to keep up with the renewables surge and the electrification of everything from buildings to transportation. Some have pegged the necessary investment for grid upgrades at up to $2 trillion through 2050.Coal Capacity Retirements “Today marks a new chapter in the Beyond Carbon campaign, as we move to finish the job,” Bloomberg, who is also founder of Bloomberg LP and Bloomberg Philanthropies, said in the statement announcing the latest $500-million pledge.“By working with our partners across the country, we hope to transform the way we power America by moving beyond fossil fuels and replacing them with renewable energy.”In the Beyond Carbon campaign, shutting down all coal-fired power plants by 2030 seems like the most feasible pledge.There are around 150 still operating coal-fired power plants in the United States, and Bloomberg wants to “finish the job on coal.”“With 372 of 530 coal plants announced to retire or closed to date – more than 70 percent of the country’s coal fleet – this next phase will shut down every last U.S. coal plant,” Bloomberg Philanthropies said.This year alone, operators plan to retire 15.6 gigawatts (GW) of electric-generating capacity in the United States, mostly natural gas-fired (6.2 GW) and coal-fired (8.9 GW) power plants, the EIA says. Coal and natural gas retirements will account for 98% of U.S. capacity retirements in 2023.“Aging coal-fired power plants compete with a growing number of highly efficient, modern natural gas-fired power plants and low-cost renewables, such as wind and solar, more of these coal-fired power plants are being retired,” the administration notes.Due to continued competition from natural gas and renewables, as of November 2022, a total of 23% of all the 200,568 megawatts (MW) of coal-fired capacity operating in the United States had reported plans to retire by the end of 2029.U.S. coal capacity will decrease by 2050 in all scenarios, but it doesn’t drop to zero in any of those cases, the EIA’s Annual Energy Outlook 2023 showed.“The coal-fired generation in all three cases comes from the newer, more efficient coal-fired power plants that will remain online because they can provide lower-cost, dispatchable power to the grid,” according to the EIA.In 2022, coal accounted for 19.5% of U.S. utility-scale electricity generation, second only to natural gas, which had a 39.8% share. Nuclear followed with 18.2%, and wind had a 10.2% share of America’s power generation.Halving natural gas capacity and stopping all new gas plants would be a more difficult task for Bloomberg, the Sierra Club, and other campaigners for a clean energy grid as soon as possible.So far this year, all major U.S. power markets have relied more on natural gas to keep a balanced grid system. Despite the growth in solar, wind, and battery installations, renewable power generation has been basically flat this year as natural gas has been the power source to pick up the slack when wind speeds were low or hydropower generation faltered due to lower water reservoir levels.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads from Oilprice.com:Detroit's Auto Giants Reel As UAW Strikes Bite HardBiden Met With Central Asian Leaders To Discuss Trade And DevelopmentEgypt Eyes Energy Revival With Zohr Gas Field ExpansionRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

The area hosts industries as varied as steelmaking and paper production and accounts for one quarter of Wales’ total carbon emissions and about 5pc of total UK emissions – meaning that if the country is to decarbonise, so must Milford Haven.The groundwork is already being laid for a major overhaul.RWE operates the Pembroke Power Station on the south side of the waterway. The facility is currently one of the largest and most efficient gas power stations in Europe. But within the next two years, bosses will have to make key decisions about its future.“If you just carried on with business-as-usual, then effectively you would have to close on December 31, 2034,” says Roland Long, site manager of Pembroke Power Station. “So you ask yourself, what are the options?”Roland Long, site manager of Pembroke Power StationRWE is considering turning the power station green by capturing direct emissions from its gas-fired units and storing them. The emissions would have to be converted into liquified CO2 and then transported elsewhere – probably to be piped into emptied oil and gas reservoirs underneath the North Sea.Story continuesAt the same time, the German company is exploring the development of two “green” hydrogen production plants where electrolysers would convert water into hydrogen and oxygen using renewable electricity.It is also looking at the possibility of an on-site battery storage plant. And land has been set aside for a separate, “blue” hydrogen facility where natural gas would be combined with steam to produce hydrogen.All options are on the table.“We’ve got engineers here working on this right now,” says Long. “What do we need if we do carbon capture? How would we actually extend the life of this plant? It’s about the absolute details, so it’s quite an exciting time for people to work in the power industry.”The oil and chemical tanker Bro Deliverer sits moored on the quayside at Milford Haven waterway - Ben Stansall / AFPHydrogen could potentially allow neighbouring facilities such as the Valero oil refinery, capable of producing 270,000 barrels of oil per day, to decarbonise jobs that involve heating. Instead of natural gas, hydrogen could be used to power industrial processes.However, significant parts of the investment case for projects in Milford Haven depend on other projects being developed elsewhere.For example, the green electricity that will power RWE’s electrolysers is expected to come from new floating wind farms off the coast in the Celtic Sea. The Crown Estate estimates there is potential for 20 gigawatts of capacity out there - equivalent to roughly 1,000 skyscraper-sized turbines.But in the Government’s latest renewable subsidies auction, no bids were received by offshore wind farm developers because the prices offered were too low. That puts a question mark over Milford Haven’s green energy supply.There will also need to be new infrastructure built to transport the hydrogen across South Wales.The Valero Pembroke Refinery in Milford Haven - Matthew Horwood/GettySarah Williams, director of asset strategy at gas network operator Wales &amp; West Utilities, says her company is currently exploring plans for an 80-mile steel pipeline called HyLine Cymru.But the project cannot go ahead without guarantees that there will be both production of hydrogen locally and - most crucially - willing customers.“This would be a major project to support industry,” Williams says. “But there’s clearly no point in building a pipeline if we can’t confirm the hydrogen is going to be available to go through it or if there are no customers who are going to use it.”Some of the demand is expected to come from transport. South Wales Transport is currently trialling buses that use hydrogen fuel cells, for example.However, a string of big industrial users must sign up for the sums to stack up.Against that backdrop, a recent decision by Tata Steel to wind down its coal-fired blast furnaces in Port Talbot and replace them with electric arc systems has delivered a blow.The change means the end of steel production from ore at the plant, a process which could have been done using hydrogen instead of fossil fuels. The factory is instead switching to using scrap metal to make recycled steel, a process that will be powered by electricity likely generated by nearby wind farms.The busy Pembroke dock and the oil and gas terminals at Milford Haven - Phillip Roberts / AlamyMeanwhile, the port of Milford Haven is busy upgrading its own infrastructure in preparation for what it predicts will be a wind power boom. Changes include new “laydown” areas to make it easier for companies to work on large components such as turbine towers and blades, as well as “super slipways” to help transport the parts.While the recent government auction failed to generate any bids for offshore wind projects, Sawyer believes future rounds are bound to yield results given the potential of the Celtic Sea.“You’ve got more than 1,000, very, very large turbines going up,” Sawyer adds. “They’ll need businesses that can make anchors, chains, cabling, so you need welders, fabricators and mechanical and electrical engineers - there’s just this enormous opportunity.”Combined plans could inject £6bn into local economyEven if Port Talbot won’t be using hydrogen for its electric arc furnaces, Sawyer argues the recycled steel the plant will produce should be suitable for making the wind turbines.“I actually see the steel announcement at Port Talbot as fantastic, because that was always going to be the long pole in the tent.”The port of Milford Haven has applied for grant funding from the Government to help finance the work. If all goes to plan, it is hoped the combined plans in the South Wales Industrial Cluster could add £6bn to the local economy.The port is also bidding to become a freeport, which will unlock tax breaks such as business rates relief for all the new infrastructure that is planned. Speedy planning consents and upgrades to local grid capacity are also seen as vital.“We want to win this competition,” says Sawyer. “And we see ourselves competing with Portugal and Norway and the Far East to win this business.“It’s genuinely a once in a generation opportunity - and it finally feels like there is momentum building behind us.”Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.""We are at the tail-end of the discussions [with Chinese lenders] for financial close. We are confident that by the end of October of this year, we will close the debt component and we would have mobilised most of the funding for the project,"" Bateebe said on Friday.Uganda needs about US$5 billion for the pipeline running from Lake Albert's oilfields to a storage and loading terminal in the Tanzanian port of Tanga. Financing is set at a 60:40 debt-to-equity ratio, meaning US$3 billion will be secured as debt with the remaining US$2 billion to be financed by shareholders through equity contributions.TotalEnergies controls a 62 per cent interest in the pipeline; the Uganda National Oil Company holds 15 per cent; Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation has 15 per cent; leaving 8 per cent for Chinese oil giant China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC).The 1,443km (896-mile) pipeline would transport crude oil from Uganda's Lake Albert oilfields in northwest Uganda to Tanga in Tanzania on the Indian Ocean where the oil would then be sold onwards to world markets.Story continuesBesides the Chinese lenders, Bateebe said Uganda expects to get some funding from Saudi Arabia's Islamic Development Bank and some African banks, including the African Export-Import Bank.Bateebe said initially many Western-backed lenders had expressed interest in financing the pipeline but pulled out due to strong opposition from environmental and human rights groups who have said the oilfields and pipeline threaten the region's fragile ecosystem and the livelihoods of thousands of people. Further, environmentalists say Uganda is going against the global push for energy transition away from fossil fuels.""We did see some Western banks withdrawing from supporting the project but we always say look at your other friend. We had other friends who were willing to come on board. We became East-looking,"" Bateebe said. She added that, previously, a large portion of the debt was to come from Western lenders.In 2006, British company Tullow Oil discovered commercially viable oil deposits on the shores of Lake Albert in western Uganda at the border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Uganda has an estimated 6.5 billion barrels of crude oil - the equivalent of 1.4 billion barrels of recoverable oil.Police detain a Ugandan activist demonstrating against the EACOP oil pipeline. Photo: Reuters alt=Police detain a Ugandan activist demonstrating against the EACOP oil pipeline. Photo: Reuters&gt;But it was only last year that the partners announced a US$10 billion final investment decision for the project, which includes the oilfield development and the construction of the pipeline to carry crude oil harvested from Hoima in western Uganda.CNOOC operates the Kingfisher oilfield, located on the eastern shores of Lake Albert in Uganda. It will invest an estimated US$2-3 billion to develop the oilfield that would produce 40,000 barrels per day at peak production.The other, larger oilfield is the Tilenga, operated by French oil multinational TotalEnergies, which is estimated to cost between US$4 billion and US$6 billion to develop. It will produce 190,000 barrels per day.Spudding (the start of drilling) of the development and production wells for Kingfisher and Tilenga started in January and June 2023 respectively, with the landlocked East African nation aiming to join oil exporting nations by 2025.Environmental groups under the banner #StopEACOP have been piling pressure on key financiers from the West to drop investment plans and according to them, dozens of major banks including Barclays, Credit Suisse, Citi, HSBC, Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan Chase have ruled out backing the pipeline.South Africa's Standard Bank and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) are acting as financial advisers and lead debt arrangers for EACOP, according to BankTrack, a tracking, campaigning and NGO support organisation focused on banks and the activities they finance. ICBC owns a 20 per cent stake in Standard Bank, South Africa's largest lender.Japan's Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation also ruled out financing the project but it wasn't clear if it remained one of the debt arrangers and advisers.Last year, the issue found its way to the floor of the European Parliament, where legislators passed a resolution calling for a halt to the project over environmental and human rights concerns and warned TotalEnergies against backing the project.Uganda has said the push by countries in the West for it to drop the oil plans do not take in the whole picture.""That will be very unfair. It will no longer be a just energy transition, it will be an unjust energy transition,"" Bateebe said, adding that Uganda believes the oil and gas sector can still coexist with its plans for renewable energy.""The oil sector, which we are developing in a sustainable way environmentally, will support us in our energy transition by providing financing. Otherwise, it is not enough to come to countries like ours and say we must transit, and there's no financing plan for the transition,"" Bateebe said.In support of Uganda's projects, the Chinese embassy in Uganda last year criticised the European Union for trying to interfere with the development of Uganda's oil ambitions. Chinese ambassador to Uganda Zhang Lizhong said the EU ""should not use the excuse of environmental and human rights issues to block development"" of the oilfields and the pipeline.This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

Identify undervalued stocks, put your capital to work and reap the rewards of your patience as they increase in value at some later point. This month, as in any other, there are deals to be had with undervalued energy stocks.All of the firms discussed include dividends. Thus, those who invest now in anticipation of price increases will get the immediate benefit of dividend income. That said, let’s take a deeper dive into said undervalued energy stocks. NextEra Energy (NEE) Nextra Energy (NEE) website on a mobile phone screenSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comNextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is an energy stock in the sense that it provides energy. It is not a traditional energy stock in that it doesn’t sell oil. The company operates an electric utilities firm in Florida and another business segment focused on solar and wind power generation. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsEach of those is the largest among its competitors. Florida Power &amp; Light is the largest U.S. electric utility while NextEra Energy Resources is the world’s largest generator of solar and wind power. In fact, NextEra Energy Resources has become the larger contributor to the firm’s overall revenues. That’s a testament to the value of renewable energy and to NextEra Energy as an investment. The company continues to grow based on both top and bottom-line results. Buy NEE stock because it is undervalued, includes a dividend yielding 2.8% and has built an enviable and diversified business overall. The company is future-proofing itself and combines the stability of a utilities firm with dividends and the growth of the renewables sector. It’s a win-win situation.  Schlumberger (SLB)slb stockSource: Valentin Martynov / Shutterstock.comSchlumberger (NYSE:SLB) continues to offer upside to investors and remains highly regarded by Wall Street. That combination of factors is almost always positive. The company is an exploration and production firm (E&amp;P) but is more aligned with the services side than the actual business of drilling itself. Story continuesAs with any E&amp;P firm, Schlumberger benefits as prices rise and firms get into the field to extract that oil. The company then has much more fertile ground into which it can sell its services. Schlumberger’s earnings were pretty much right where Wall Street expected. Revenues rose by 20% while EPS increased by 44% year-over-year. The sector is marked by a positive outlook moving into 2024. International activity and offshore activity are both expected to continue to strengthen with large firms like Schlumberger expected to benefit. The company also recently increased its dividend. That’s good for income investors and a positive sign overall. ConocoPhillips (COP) In the field, the oil pump in the evening, the evening silhouette of the pumping unit, the silhouette of the oil pump. Oil stocks and energy stocksSource: zhengzaishuru / Shutterstock.comConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is also an exploration and production firm within the energy sector. It is perhaps more accurately described as an Oil Major and although pumping oil is its bread and butter, it touches the entire value chain. Like just about every other oil E&amp;P, ConocoPhillips is dealing with the hangover that is 2023. Prices for a barrel of oil were much lower during Q2 2023 compared to Q2 2022. ConocoPhillips’ EPS more than halved as a result, falling to $1.84. That may sound discouraging but Oil Majors have pretty well built these factors into their business models. It hasn’t correlated to a halving of share prices, not even close. Nor is there any expectation of that occurring. The company has raised dividends and increased share buyback authority. It’s all about rewarding the investor in the good times and the bad while continuing to explore for more oil. ConocoPhillips has been one of the best at doing exactly that and will continue to be among the best moving forward. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

But what does this mean for the future of the IPO market? Byron Deeter, Bessemer Venture Partners, Partner, joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the IPO market.""We’ve definitely seen investor appetite move more towards short-term earnings... They want to see shorter payback periods. They want to see this tradeoff from growth at all costs over to efficient growth,"" Deeter explains.On IPO valuations, Deeter says, ""I do think there have to be some reset expectations as the private multiples come down to meet the public multiples and companies that want to make that transition have to adjust.""For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptAKIKO FUJITA: Byron, you could argue at least in the public markets, investors have become a little more discriminatory. Yes, they like the high-growth companies. But they also want to see a very clear path to profitability. When you consider where these companies-- we're talking specifically about names like Klaviyo as well as Instacart, where they have performed at least in the initial days-- and you look at who's lining up on the sidelines on the private side of things, you think there's enough companies that are ready to test the market with investors-- with investor expectations where they are?BYRON DEETER: So I think that's a key question as we've definitely seen investor appetite move more towards short-term earnings. And it's a rational response. Rising interest rates causes an increased cost of capital. They want to see shorter payback periods. They want to see this trade-off from growth at all costs over to efficient growth.And that's why it took a high-quality company like Klaviyo to open the market on the software side. They're growing at over 50%. But they're also generating 8% free cash flow. And so it's a very efficient growth model. To get to over $650 million of annual recurring revenue, they only burn $15 million over their entire life cycle. And so that's the type of company that the buy side was waiting to open the market.Story continuesAnd I think you're right that we're going to see companies that are free cash flow positive or very close to break even that are going to start to test the waters next. And then as that buy side starts to move more towards greed, I do think we're going to see companies that are in the hypergrowth mode and burning a few bucks that'll probably test the water middle of next year. But it's going to be an efficient mindset. And it's going to be a subset of those 300-plus companies that are in the queue that will probably push to the front with that efficient mindset.AKIKO FUJITA: Byron, when you look specifically at Instacart's debut, there was a lot made about, you know, where they were in their last private funding round valued at roughly $39 billion versus where they debuted in the market roughly $9 billion. Is the expectation here m matching now increasingly? In other words, these companies that are still private, are they expecting largely to maybe have to take a bit of a cut in valuation in order to test the public markets?BYRON DEETER: So that's a dance that's going on. And I do think there have to be some reset expectations as the private multiples come down to meet the public multiples. And companies that want to make that transition have to adjust. Obviously, a lot of the private companies are growing into these compressed multiples. And an absolute case may grow back into those valuations. And that's what a lot of them are hoping to do.But we do expect to see more of the Instacart-like financings, which are great outcomes in an absolute sense, $10 billion-plus values. And yet, the investors have to absorb some valuation compression just like the public investors did. We all saw these numbers come down meaningfully over the last two years, where public multiples compressed by 50% or more. And so it's quite logical that the private companies will have to endure some of that as well as they make this transition to public life.]"

So they're not going to have opinions about this that they can publish for several weeks.But we do have one sell, three hold equivalents, and one buy on ARM right now. And it's important to note that, this is a company that's been around since 1990. It's a large one. Market cap is $52 billion. And if we take a look, I do have some notes from Susquehanna, they have a price target of $48 with a neutral rating.And what they're saying is, the company, this is a quote, ""The company appears to be pushing royalty rates to the limit, while also adding lower margin subsystem's revenue."" And then Bloomberg summarizing the note says, ""With Susquehanna, there are now three firms that have equivalent of a hold rating on the stock, compared with one rating and one sell.""Story continuesAnd we can also take Instacart and Klaviyo. Some interesting commentary there as well. Here's Instacart. You can see we have only two holds. No, no sell, no buy right there. And I have BTIG comments on them, we'll pull that up in a second. And I should also note that IPOs have not fared that well this week, at least the stock the ones that have recently listed, and that's in line with the general market. We've seen stocks under a lot of pressure over the last two days.But back to the main point. Here's what BTIG is saying about Instacart. Jake Fuller over there is saying that the company has a fair valuation based on modest growth potential and challenging competitive dynamics with its peers which are, Doordash and Uber. And also writing, while there are positives for CART in competitive positioning, low category adoption, ancillary opportunity, opportunities, and healthy margin profile, we see valuation as fair relative to modest top line prospects. There was concern over a revenue slowdown, at least a revenue growth slowdown.But let me just show you what's been happening this, since it listed earlier this week. You can see that $30 IPO price, and it is right there, right at that place where it sold shares to insider investors. And it's down quite a bit from where it originally popped that first day. Now, you take a look at ARM holdings, that stock is under water here. And then Klaviyo, as well. But that stock is actually up 10% from its IPO price, but down from its first day high.So interesting mix to take a look at there. And I do have some comments from Bloomberg intelligence on Klaviyo. They're seeing a surge in sales, and an IPO that topped its fundraising goals, but it faces challenges in broadening its app portfolio, and deepening its e-commerce to reach Wix salesforce commerce cloud, and others.So not the best week maybe to debut, I'd say, in place of Fed and, in the face of the Fed and what they've done with interest rates, and also the risk off tone that the market has had, but it's good to see you guys here.]"

Earlier it dipped as low as $50.35, below the $51 price set in its IPO on Sept. 13.Arm surged on its first day on Wall Street and has fallen every day since then.Grocery delivery app Instacart, formally known as Maplebear, fell 2.1% to $30.02, marginally above the $30 price set in its IPO on Monday.The weak performances of Arm and Instacart's stocks since their market debuts add to doubts about whether a hoped-for revival in IPOs will materialize after a drought of more than 18 months.In a client note, BTIG analyst Jake Fuller gave Instacart a ""neutral"" rating and warned that the company faces heavy competition from DoorDash and Uber Technologies in the slowly expanding market of grocery delivery.In another note, Susquehanna analysts assigned Arm a ""neutral"" rating and $48 price target, saying the chip designer ""appears to be pushing royalty rates to the limit, while also adding lower margin 'subsystems' revenue"".That followed a Bernstein ""underperform"" rating with a $46 price target earlier this week, and a ""hold"" assigned to Arm by Needham and Company on Sept. 16.Neutral and negative stock ratings are much less common on Wall Street than ""buy"" recommendations or other positive ratings. Of more than 10 thousand current analyst recommendations for S&amp;P 500 companies, 56% are positive, 39% are neutral and 5% are negative, according to LSEG data.Meanwhile, shares of Klaviyo, which debuted on Wednesday, dipped 1.8% to $33.12. Still, the marketing automation firm's stock remains above the $30 IPO price.The declines in Arm, Instacart and Klaviyo on Friday were in contrast to a 0.3% gain in the Nasdaq.(Reporting by Noel Randewich; editing by Lance Tupper and Kirsten Donovan)]"

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for QUALCOMM QUALCOMM Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Chief Technology Officer of Qualcomm Technologies, James Thompson, sold US$3.2m worth of shares at a price of US$113 per share. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$108. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.Insiders in QUALCOMM didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeI will like QUALCOMM better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.QUALCOMM Insiders Are Selling The StockOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at QUALCOMM. In total, Chief Technology Officer of Qualcomm Technologies James Thompson sold US$3.2m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of QUALCOMMMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Insiders own 0.07% of QUALCOMM shares, worth about US$80m. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About QUALCOMM Insiders?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. While insiders do own shares, they don't own a heap, and they have been selling. We'd practice some caution before buying! While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. At Simply Wall St, we found 1 warning sign for QUALCOMM that deserve your attention before buying any shares.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

The best industrial stocks to buy are those that are heavily exposed to the energy revolution, U.S. economic growth, government infrastructure spending and the onshoring trend. The latter term refers to American companies’ recent tendency to relocate their factories to America. And with many farmers prospering tremendously amid very high food prices, buying the shares of farm equipment makers also makes a great deal of sense. The following greatly undervalued industrial stocks have a great deal of exposure to one or more of those trends.Quanta Services (PWR)Environmental protection, renewable, sustainable energy sources.

Quanta will therefore see an increased need in their services in the forms of energy transmission and additional power grids. Additionally, Quanta will be helped by the tremendous amount of money that will be spent on renewable energy facilities.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsQuanta has taken on two huge renewable energy products in SunZia Transmission and SunZia Wind. The company was selected to transmit wind power generated in New Mexico to power-hungry states in the Western U.S. Cumulatively, the two initiatives ” represent the largest clean energy infrastructure project in United States history,” Quanta reported.Quanta will doubtlessly generate a great deal of revenue and profits from these projects and will probably be chosen to carry out many more like them.Despite these powerful, positive catalysts, PWR stock only has a forward price-earnings ratio of 23.25 which is about average for the S&amp;P 500.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the stock market outlook and industries benefiting the most due to high interest rates, head directly to 5 Best Investments During High Interest Rates.According to J.P. Morgan's analysis last year, as mentioned by Forbes, starting from February 2009, there was a strong correlation between the movements of the S&amp;P 500 and the 10-year Treasury bond yield until the 10-year yield reached 3.5%, at which point they began to diverge. In simpler terms, increasing interest rates can benefit the overall stock market up to a certain threshold. Rising interest rates have several implications for financial markets. They tend to put pressure on stock valuations, impacting corporate profits and growth prospects, especially for growth stocks. Dividend-paying stocks may need to increase yields to compete with potentially higher bond coupon rates. However, financials, particularly banks and lending institutions, historically perform well in rising rate environments as they can earn more on loans.""As the Federal Reserve increases interest rates, we can anticipate a deceleration in economic growth,"" Eric Freedman, Chief Investment Officer, U.S. Bank Wealth and Institutional Asset Management, commented in July 2023. Indeed, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expanded at a notably slower rate in 2022, registering a 2.1% growth compared to the 5.9% seen in 2021. In the first quarter of 2023, the economy seemed to stabilize, achieving a 2.0% annualized growth rate. Hiked interest rates have also altered the landscape for equity investors, leading to potential impacts on future earnings growth for U.S. companies. Economic weakness, resulting in slower GDP growth, can affect corporate earnings and stock prices. Additionally, the attractiveness of bonds and other fixed income investments increases with higher interest rates, potentially reducing demand for stocks. Stocks with premium price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples, particularly those with future earnings expectations that may not materialize, face risks in this changing environment. Higher debt costs due to elevated interest rates could also impact corporate profits and stock prices. While the Federal Reserve has signaled more rate hikes to come, the outlook for equities remains uncertain, with factors like corporate performance and inflation influencing market dynamics and potential volatility ahead.Story continuesIt's not only financial companies that can thrive in a favorable rising interest rate environment. Consumer discretionary stocks can also experience a boost, as improved employment and a healthier housing market tend to encourage consumers to indulge in non-essential purchases beyond basic staples like food, beverages, and hygiene products. According to CNBC, in July 2022, the United States' inflation rate, assessed through the Consumer Price Index, stood at 8.5%. Although the impact of inflation varied across different goods and services, categories like food and energy witnessed the most significant price increases. Some noteworthy companies to watch during interest rate hikes include Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), in the banking and finance sector, as well as consumer goods retailers such as Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT).Investors should consider strategies for navigating this environment, such as strategic bond investments to manage rate exposure, actively managed strategies to mitigate concentration risk, and diversification across sectors, regions, and market capitalization to maintain a balanced portfolio. Investors looking to expand their portfolio through low-risk investment opportunities during a period with hiked interest rates can look at Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK.A).Our Methodology We selected stocks from industries that historically perform well during high interest rate environments, such as consumer staples, banking, retail, and insurance. We aimed to select stocks that had the highest hedge fund sentiment in the aforementioned sectors. We assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 910 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the second quarter of 2023. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund investors in each firm.10 Best Investments During High Interest RatesPhoto by Mirza Babic on UnsplashBest Investments During High Interest Rates10. Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 54Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) functions as a tobacco enterprise working to create a smoke-free future. On September 13, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) declared a $1.30 per share quarterly dividend, a 2.4% increase from its prior dividend of $1.27. The dividend is distributable on October 12, to shareholders of record on September 27. According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, 54 hedge funds were bullish on Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), compared to 55 funds in the last quarter. Terry Smith’s Fundsmith LLP is one of the major stakeholders of the company, with 15.8 million shares worth $1.54 billion.In addition to Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), and  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK.A), Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) is one of the best investments during high interest rates.Ariel International Fund made the following comment about Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Finally, tobacco maker, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) declined in the period on concerns related to supply-chain disruptions resulting from the war in Ukraine, which we view as temporary. We believe the favorable economics and margin expansion associated with market share gains from the IQOS brand and Reduced Risk Products should yield value creation opportunities in the years ahead. Furthermore, at current trading levels, we think the company’s operating leverage, pricing power, and free cash flow profile offer a margin of safety.”9. Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) produces and markets consumer goods on a global scale. The corporation is divided into two divisions – Oral, Personal, Home Care, and Pet Nutrition.

It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Let's assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the stock market outlook and industries benefiting the most due to high interest rates, head directly to 5 Best Investments During High Interest Rates.According to J.P. Morgan's analysis last year, as mentioned by Forbes, starting from February 2009, there was a strong correlation between the movements of the S&amp;P 500 and the 10-year Treasury bond yield until the 10-year yield reached 3.5%, at which point they began to diverge. In simpler terms, increasing interest rates can benefit the overall stock market up to a certain threshold. Rising interest rates have several implications for financial markets. They tend to put pressure on stock valuations, impacting corporate profits and growth prospects, especially for growth stocks. Dividend-paying stocks may need to increase yields to compete with potentially higher bond coupon rates. However, financials, particularly banks and lending institutions, historically perform well in rising rate environments as they can earn more on loans.""As the Federal Reserve increases interest rates, we can anticipate a deceleration in economic growth,"" Eric Freedman, Chief Investment Officer, U.S. Bank Wealth and Institutional Asset Management, commented in July 2023. Indeed, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expanded at a notably slower rate in 2022, registering a 2.1% growth compared to the 5.9% seen in 2021. In the first quarter of 2023, the economy seemed to stabilize, achieving a 2.0% annualized growth rate. Hiked interest rates have also altered the landscape for equity investors, leading to potential impacts on future earnings growth for U.S. companies. Economic weakness, resulting in slower GDP growth, can affect corporate earnings and stock prices. Additionally, the attractiveness of bonds and other fixed income investments increases with higher interest rates, potentially reducing demand for stocks. Stocks with premium price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples, particularly those with future earnings expectations that may not materialize, face risks in this changing environment. Higher debt costs due to elevated interest rates could also impact corporate profits and stock prices. While the Federal Reserve has signaled more rate hikes to come, the outlook for equities remains uncertain, with factors like corporate performance and inflation influencing market dynamics and potential volatility ahead.Story continuesIt's not only financial companies that can thrive in a favorable rising interest rate environment. Consumer discretionary stocks can also experience a boost, as improved employment and a healthier housing market tend to encourage consumers to indulge in non-essential purchases beyond basic staples like food, beverages, and hygiene products. According to CNBC, in July 2022, the United States' inflation rate, assessed through the Consumer Price Index, stood at 8.5%. Although the impact of inflation varied across different goods and services, categories like food and energy witnessed the most significant price increases. Some noteworthy companies to watch during interest rate hikes include Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), in the banking and finance sector, as well as consumer goods retailers such as Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT).Investors should consider strategies for navigating this environment, such as strategic bond investments to manage rate exposure, actively managed strategies to mitigate concentration risk, and diversification across sectors, regions, and market capitalization to maintain a balanced portfolio. Investors looking to expand their portfolio through low-risk investment opportunities during a period with hiked interest rates can look at Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK.A).Our Methodology We selected stocks from industries that historically perform well during high interest rate environments, such as consumer staples, banking, retail, and insurance. We aimed to select stocks that had the highest hedge fund sentiment in the aforementioned sectors. We assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 910 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the second quarter of 2023.

66,74adffec-0690-3485-8144-f4e6cb0469a3,VZ,2023-09-24,Does Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) Have A Healthy Balance Sheet?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-verizon-communications-nyse-vz-120012568.html,1695556812,STORY,['VZ'],"[The external fund manager backed by Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger, Li Lu, makes no bones about it when he says 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. As with many other companies Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) makes use of debt. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?When Is Debt Dangerous?Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. Check out our latest analysis for Verizon Communications How Much Debt Does Verizon Communications Carry?The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at June 2023 Verizon Communications had debt of US$157.3b, up from US$151.2b in one year. However, it does have US$4.92b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$152.4b.debt-equity-history-analysisA Look At Verizon Communications' LiabilitiesWe can see from the most recent balance sheet that Verizon Communications had liabilities of US$51.4b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$232.0b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$4.92b and US$23.7b worth of receivables due within a year. So it has liabilities totalling US$254.8b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.Story continuesThe deficiency here weighs heavily on the US$139.9b company itself, as if a child were struggling under the weight of an enormous back-pack full of books, his sports gear, and a trumpet. So we definitely think shareholders need to watch this one closely. At the end of the day, Verizon Communications would probably need a major re-capitalization if its creditors were to demand repayment.In order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.With net debt to EBITDA of 3.2 Verizon Communications has a fairly noticeable amount of debt. On the plus side, its EBIT was 7.2 times its interest expense, and its net debt to EBITDA, was quite high, at 3.2. Sadly, Verizon Communications's EBIT actually dropped 7.7% in the last year. If earnings continue on that decline then managing that debt will be difficult like delivering hot soup on a unicycle. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Verizon Communications's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. Over the last three years, Verizon Communications recorded negative free cash flow, in total. Debt is usually more expensive, and almost always more risky in the hands of a company with negative free cash flow. Shareholders ought to hope for an improvement.Our ViewMulling over Verizon Communications's attempt at staying on top of its total liabilities, we're certainly not enthusiastic. But on the bright side, its interest cover is a good sign, and makes us more optimistic. After considering the datapoints discussed, we think Verizon Communications has too much debt. While some investors love that sort of risky play, it's certainly not our cup of tea. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. To that end, you should be aware of the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Verizon Communications .At the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the stock market outlook and industries benefiting the most due to high interest rates, head directly to 5 Best Investments During High Interest Rates.According to J.P. Morgan's analysis last year, as mentioned by Forbes, starting from February 2009, there was a strong correlation between the movements of the S&amp;P 500 and the 10-year Treasury bond yield until the 10-year yield reached 3.5%, at which point they began to diverge. In simpler terms, increasing interest rates can benefit the overall stock market up to a certain threshold. Rising interest rates have several implications for financial markets. They tend to put pressure on stock valuations, impacting corporate profits and growth prospects, especially for growth stocks. Dividend-paying stocks may need to increase yields to compete with potentially higher bond coupon rates. However, financials, particularly banks and lending institutions, historically perform well in rising rate environments as they can earn more on loans.""As the Federal Reserve increases interest rates, we can anticipate a deceleration in economic growth,"" Eric Freedman, Chief Investment Officer, U.S. Bank Wealth and Institutional Asset Management, commented in July 2023. Indeed, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expanded at a notably slower rate in 2022, registering a 2.1% growth compared to the 5.9% seen in 2021. In the first quarter of 2023, the economy seemed to stabilize, achieving a 2.0% annualized growth rate. Hiked interest rates have also altered the landscape for equity investors, leading to potential impacts on future earnings growth for U.S. companies. Economic weakness, resulting in slower GDP growth, can affect corporate earnings and stock prices. Additionally, the attractiveness of bonds and other fixed income investments increases with higher interest rates, potentially reducing demand for stocks. Stocks with premium price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples, particularly those with future earnings expectations that may not materialize, face risks in this changing environment. Higher debt costs due to elevated interest rates could also impact corporate profits and stock prices. While the Federal Reserve has signaled more rate hikes to come, the outlook for equities remains uncertain, with factors like corporate performance and inflation influencing market dynamics and potential volatility ahead.Story continuesIt's not only financial companies that can thrive in a favorable rising interest rate environment. Consumer discretionary stocks can also experience a boost, as improved employment and a healthier housing market tend to encourage consumers to indulge in non-essential purchases beyond basic staples like food, beverages, and hygiene products. According to CNBC, in July 2022, the United States' inflation rate, assessed through the Consumer Price Index, stood at 8.5%. Although the impact of inflation varied across different goods and services, categories like food and energy witnessed the most significant price increases. Some noteworthy companies to watch during interest rate hikes include Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), in the banking and finance sector, as well as consumer goods retailers such as Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT).Investors should consider strategies for navigating this environment, such as strategic bond investments to manage rate exposure, actively managed strategies to mitigate concentration risk, and diversification across sectors, regions, and market capitalization to maintain a balanced portfolio. Investors looking to expand their portfolio through low-risk investment opportunities during a period with hiked interest rates can look at Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK.A).Our Methodology We selected stocks from industries that historically perform well during high interest rate environments, such as consumer staples, banking, retail, and insurance. We aimed to select stocks that had the highest hedge fund sentiment in the aforementioned sectors. We assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 910 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the second quarter of 2023. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund investors in each firm.10 Best Investments During High Interest RatesPhoto by Mirza Babic on UnsplashBest Investments During High Interest Rates10. Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 54Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) functions as a tobacco enterprise working to create a smoke-free future. On September 13, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) declared a $1.30 per share quarterly dividend, a 2.4% increase from its prior dividend of $1.27. The dividend is distributable on October 12, to shareholders of record on September 27.

(NYSE:PM) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Finally, tobacco maker, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) declined in the period on concerns related to supply-chain disruptions resulting from the war in Ukraine, which we view as temporary. We believe the favorable economics and margin expansion associated with market share gains from the IQOS brand and Reduced Risk Products should yield value creation opportunities in the years ahead. Furthermore, at current trading levels, we think the company’s operating leverage, pricing power, and free cash flow profile offer a margin of safety.”9. Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) produces and markets consumer goods on a global scale.

FIS and Colgate have both since “beat and raised” this guidance, indicating that many management teams are adopting very conservative tones in this uncertain macro environment.”8. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) is a global company known for producing, marketing, and distributing a wide range of beverages and convenient foods.

(NYSE:JPM), and  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK.A), Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) is one of the best investments for high interest rate periods. Rowan Street Capital made the following comment about The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Let's assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Investments During High Interest Rates.  Suggested articles:30 Low Cost Business Ideas With High Profit12 Best Streaming and TV Stocks To Buy Now12 Best Growth ETFs to Buy Disclosure: None. 10 Best Investments During High Interest Rates is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

(NASDAQ:XRAY) is about to go ex-dividend in just 4 days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Therefore, if you purchase DENTSPLY SIRONA's shares on or after the 28th of September, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 13th of October.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.14 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$0.56 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, DENTSPLY SIRONA stock has a trailing yield of around 1.7% on the current share price of $33.88. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether DENTSPLY SIRONA's dividend is reliable and sustainable. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. Check out our latest analysis for DENTSPLY SIRONA If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. DENTSPLY SIRONA's dividend is not well covered by earnings, as the company lost money last year. This is not a sustainable state of affairs, so it would be worth investigating if earnings are expected to recover. Given that the company reported a loss last year, we now need to see if it generated enough free cash flow to fund the dividend. If cash earnings don't cover the dividend, the company would have to pay dividends out of cash in the bank, or by borrowing money, neither of which is long-term sustainable. Dividends consumed 56% of the company's free cash flow last year, which is within a normal range for most dividend-paying organisations.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. DENTSPLY SIRONA was unprofitable last year, but at least the general trend suggests its earnings have been improving over the past five years. Even so, an unprofitable company whose business does not quickly recover is usually not a good candidate for dividend investors.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, DENTSPLY SIRONA has lifted its dividend by approximately 9.8% a year on average. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.Get our latest analysis on DENTSPLY SIRONA's balance sheet health here.Final TakeawayFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid DENTSPLY SIRONA? First, it's not great to see the company paying a dividend despite being loss-making over the last year. On the plus side, the dividend was covered by free cash flow."" Overall, it's hard to get excited about DENTSPLY SIRONA from a dividend perspective.However if you're still interested in DENTSPLY SIRONA as a potential investment, you should definitely consider some of the risks involved with DENTSPLY SIRONA. To help with this, we've discovered 1 warning sign for DENTSPLY SIRONA that you should be aware of before investing in their shares.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

It also makes diesel and gas engines, industrial turbines and more.Its yellow logo is synonymous with construction, and it’s one of the first companies that anyone will think of when building out infrastructure.The major number to watch with Caterpillar is its Machinery, Energy and Transportation (ME&amp;T) division, which makes up the company’s construction, resource, energy and transportation and other segments.ME&amp;T revenue rose from $39.02 million in 2020, during the Covid-19 pandemic, to $56.57 million last year. That outpaces the revenue that CAT was seeing before the pandemic as well.For the second quarter of 2023, CAT reported overall revenues of $17.3 billion, up 22% from a year ago; and EPS of $5.67. ME&amp;T revenues were $13.53 billion, up 22% from 2022.Story continuesCaterpillar stock is up 53% in the last 12 months and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.American Superconductor (AMSC)a hand holding a lightbulb on a green background to represent renewable energy stocksSource: ShutterstockAmerican Superconductor (NASDAQ:AMSC) is a Massachusetts company that provides power solutions for private entities and public companies.The company’s having an odd year, with the share price jumping more than 120% in August ahead of the company’s quarterly earnings report. That coincided with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk speculating in the Wall Street Journal that rising electrical demand could cause electricity use to triple in the U.S. by 2045.You’ve got to hand it to Musk. Like him or hate him, the man can move the market when he talks.AMSC gave back most of those gains in the last month, but the stock price is still up 105% in 2023.For the fiscal Q1 2023 ending June 30, AMSC reported revenues of $30.3 million, up from $22.7 million a year ago. The company reported a net loss of $5.4 million and 19 cents per share, but that’s an improvement over a year ago when it lost $8.7 million and 32 cents per share.AMSC stock has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Symbotic (SYM)Graphic of letters ""AI"" in bold font surrounded by circle of tech symbols in purple and blue against a dark background. ai stocks to buySource: shutterstock.com/Tex vectorStaying in Massachusetts, we have Symbotic (NASDAQ:SYM) a company that creates elaborate systems that allows companies to manage their warehouses with a robotic system.The company is also incorporating AI into its warehousing platform to make it more efficient and flexible.Walmart (NYSE:WMT) uses Symbotic’s warehousing platform in some of its facilities to automate its processes. Symbotic also has a relationship with Softbank (OTCMKTS:SFTBY) to launch a joint venture called GreenBox Systems. The project would create a warehouse-as-a-service to automate supply chains. That alone is a $500 billion opportunity.SYM stock showed earnings for its fiscal third quarter as $312 million, up from $176 million a year ago.Symbotic has a backlog of $23 billion and the stock is up 170% this year. It gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Huadi International Group (HUDI)Steel stocks: rods, bars and other forms of steelSource: ShutterstockHuadi International Group (NASDAQ:HUDI) is a Chinese company that develops steel products including stainless steel pipes, tubes and steel bars. Its products are used in the transmission of oil and gas, food processing, medical devices, construction, automotive, and mechanical industries.This is a small company with a market cap of only $50 million. And the stock price has been up and down this year, with one glaring exception in May when it jumped more than 100% in a day before tumbling on no particular news.There was another incredible jump late last year when Huadi announced it was entering the clean energy space, sending shares from the mid-$20s to more than $200. But then Huadi moved to dilute shares by raising capital in a direct offering, and the stock tumbled again.Earnings for the first half of 2023 included $38 million in revenue, up 3.2% from a year ago. And the company turned a profit, earning 10 cents per share versus a loss of 1 cent per share a year ago.You’re going to have some volatility with stocks this small, but as I’ve said before, I think Huadi is one of the more interesting micro-cap picks you can make if you have some risk tolerance.HUDI stock has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Paccar (PCAR)A sign for Paccar (PCAR) in front of greenery.Source: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.comPaccar (NASDAQ:PCAR) makes heavy-duty and medium-sized trucks under the Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF brands.It has more than 2,200 dealers and also operates a parts distribution center for aftermarket customers.The company also has a financial services division that supplies financing and leasing for 180,000 vehicles.Paccar’s role in infrastructure and industry is to keep the supply chain moving, providing vehicles so companies can ship supplies and products from coast to coast.

(NYSE:UPS)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-intrinsic-value-united-parcel-120018808.html,1695556818,STORY,['UPS'],"[Key InsightsUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, United Parcel Service fair value estimate is US$176With US$154 share price, United Parcel Service appears to be trading close to its estimated fair valueOur fair value estimate is 5.4% lower than United Parcel Service's analyst price target of US$186In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for United Parcel Service Step By Step Through The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$7.54bUS$8.48bUS$8.87bUS$8.83bUS$8.85bUS$8.93bUS$9.04bUS$9.18bUS$9.34bUS$9.51bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x10Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 0.31%Est @ 0.86%Est @ 1.25%Est @ 1.52%Est @ 1.71%Est @ 1.84% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.4% US$7.0kUS$7.3kUS$7.2kUS$6.6kUS$6.2kUS$5.8kUS$5.5kUS$5.2kUS$4.9kUS$4.6k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$60bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.4%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$9.5b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.4%– 2.2%) = US$184bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$184b÷ ( 1 + 7.4%)10= US$90bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$151b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$154, the company appears about fair value at a 13% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at United Parcel Service as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.053. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for United Parcel ServiceStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Logistics market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. In other words, investors can purchase Stryker's shares before the 28th of September in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 31st of October.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.75 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$3.00 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Stryker stock has a trailing yield of around 1.1% on the current share price of $285.28. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to investigate whether Stryker can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. See our latest analysis for Stryker If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Fortunately Stryker's payout ratio is modest, at just 41% of profit. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Fortunately, it paid out only 45% of its free cash flow in the past year.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. It's encouraging to see Stryker has grown its earnings rapidly, up 21% a year for the past five years. Earnings per share have been growing very quickly, and the company is paying out a relatively low percentage of its profit and cash flow. This is a very favourable combination that can often lead to the dividend multiplying over the long term, if earnings grow and the company pays out a higher percentage of its earnings.Story continuesMany investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Stryker has delivered an average of 13% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it.Final TakeawayIs Stryker an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? We love that Stryker is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. These characteristics suggest the company is reinvesting in growing its business, while the conservative payout ratio also implies a reduced risk of the dividend being cut in the future. Stryker looks solid on this analysis overall, and we'd definitely consider investigating it more closely.On that note, you'll want to research what risks Stryker is facing. Our analysis shows 2 warning signs for Stryker and you should be aware of them before buying any shares.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. As with many other companies UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) makes use of debt. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?When Is Debt A Problem?Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. View our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group How Much Debt Does UnitedHealth Group Carry?You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that as of June 2023 UnitedHealth Group had US$65.6b of debt, an increase on US$51.4b, over one year. On the flip side, it has US$46.3b in cash leading to net debt of about US$19.3b.debt-equity-history-analysisA Look At UnitedHealth Group's LiabilitiesWe can see from the most recent balance sheet that UnitedHealth Group had liabilities of US$113.0b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$75.0b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$46.3b in cash and US$34.1b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$107.6b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.UnitedHealth Group has a very large market capitalization of US$468.8b, so it could very likely raise cash to ameliorate its balance sheet, if the need arose. However, it is still worthwhile taking a close look at its ability to pay off debt.Story continuesIn order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.UnitedHealth Group's net debt is only 0.58 times its EBITDA. And its EBIT easily covers its interest expense, being 11.0 times the size. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. Also positive, UnitedHealth Group grew its EBIT by 20% in the last year, and that should make it easier to pay down debt, going forward. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine UnitedHealth Group's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. Happily for any shareholders, UnitedHealth Group actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT over the last three years. That sort of strong cash conversion gets us as excited as the crowd when the beat drops at a Daft Punk concert.Our ViewThe good news is that UnitedHealth Group's demonstrated ability to convert EBIT to free cash flow delights us like a fluffy puppy does a toddler. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its interest cover is also very heartening. We would also note that Healthcare industry companies like UnitedHealth Group commonly do use debt without problems. Overall, we don't think UnitedHealth Group is taking any bad risks, as its debt load seems modest. So the balance sheet looks pretty healthy, to us. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with UnitedHealth Group .When all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the stock market outlook and industries benefiting the most due to high interest rates, head directly to 5 Best Investments During High Interest Rates.According to J.P. Morgan's analysis last year, as mentioned by Forbes, starting from February 2009, there was a strong correlation between the movements of the S&amp;P 500 and the 10-year Treasury bond yield until the 10-year yield reached 3.5%, at which point they began to diverge. In simpler terms, increasing interest rates can benefit the overall stock market up to a certain threshold. Rising interest rates have several implications for financial markets. They tend to put pressure on stock valuations, impacting corporate profits and growth prospects, especially for growth stocks. Dividend-paying stocks may need to increase yields to compete with potentially higher bond coupon rates. However, financials, particularly banks and lending institutions, historically perform well in rising rate environments as they can earn more on loans.""As the Federal Reserve increases interest rates, we can anticipate a deceleration in economic growth,"" Eric Freedman, Chief Investment Officer, U.S. Bank Wealth and Institutional Asset Management, commented in July 2023. Indeed, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expanded at a notably slower rate in 2022, registering a 2.1% growth compared to the 5.9% seen in 2021. In the first quarter of 2023, the economy seemed to stabilize, achieving a 2.0% annualized growth rate. Hiked interest rates have also altered the landscape for equity investors, leading to potential impacts on future earnings growth for U.S. companies. Economic weakness, resulting in slower GDP growth, can affect corporate earnings and stock prices. Additionally, the attractiveness of bonds and other fixed income investments increases with higher interest rates, potentially reducing demand for stocks. Stocks with premium price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples, particularly those with future earnings expectations that may not materialize, face risks in this changing environment. Higher debt costs due to elevated interest rates could also impact corporate profits and stock prices. While the Federal Reserve has signaled more rate hikes to come, the outlook for equities remains uncertain, with factors like corporate performance and inflation influencing market dynamics and potential volatility ahead.Story continuesIt's not only financial companies that can thrive in a favorable rising interest rate environment. Consumer discretionary stocks can also experience a boost, as improved employment and a healthier housing market tend to encourage consumers to indulge in non-essential purchases beyond basic staples like food, beverages, and hygiene products. According to CNBC, in July 2022, the United States' inflation rate, assessed through the Consumer Price Index, stood at 8.5%. Although the impact of inflation varied across different goods and services, categories like food and energy witnessed the most significant price increases. Some noteworthy companies to watch during interest rate hikes include Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), in the banking and finance sector, as well as consumer goods retailers such as Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT).Investors should consider strategies for navigating this environment, such as strategic bond investments to manage rate exposure, actively managed strategies to mitigate concentration risk, and diversification across sectors, regions, and market capitalization to maintain a balanced portfolio. Investors looking to expand their portfolio through low-risk investment opportunities during a period with hiked interest rates can look at Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK.A).Our Methodology We selected stocks from industries that historically perform well during high interest rate environments, such as consumer staples, banking, retail, and insurance. We aimed to select stocks that had the highest hedge fund sentiment in the aforementioned sectors. We assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 910 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the second quarter of 2023. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund investors in each firm.10 Best Investments During High Interest RatesPhoto by Mirza Babic on UnsplashBest Investments During High Interest Rates10.

Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Let's assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Investments During High Interest Rates.  Suggested articles:30 Low Cost Business Ideas With High Profit12 Best Streaming and TV Stocks To Buy Now12 Best Growth ETFs to Buy Disclosure: None. 10 Best Investments During High Interest Rates is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

The dividend yield is 1.6% based on this payment, which is a little bit low compared to the other companies in the industry. Check out our latest analysis for Freeport-McMoRan Freeport-McMoRan's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsEven a low dividend yield can be attractive if it is sustained for years on end. Prior to this announcement, Freeport-McMoRan's dividend was only 41% of earnings, however it was paying out 225% of free cash flows. The company might be more focused on returning cash to shareholders, but paying out this much of its cash flow could expose the dividend to being cut in the future.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 71.5%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 20% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityThe company's dividend history has been marked by instability, with at least one cut in the last 10 years. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.25 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $0.60. This works out to be a decline of approximately 7.1% per year over that time. Declining dividends isn't generally what we look for as they can indicate that the company is running into some challenges.Dividend Growth May Be Hard To Come ByGiven that dividend payments have been shrinking like a glacier in a warming world, we need to check if there are some bright spots on the horizon. It's not great to see that Freeport-McMoRan's earnings per share has fallen at approximately 5.9% per year over the past five years. Declining earnings will inevitably lead to the company paying a lower dividend in line with lower profits. However, the next year is actually looking up, with earnings set to rise. We would just wait until it becomes a pattern before getting too excited.Story continuesThe Dividend Could Prove To Be UnreliableIn summary, while it's good to see that the dividend hasn't been cut, we are a bit cautious about Freeport-McMoRan's payments, as there could be some issues with sustaining them into the future. While Freeport-McMoRan is earning enough to cover the payments, the cash flows are lacking. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks.Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 1 warning sign for Freeport-McMoRan that investors need to be conscious of moving forward.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of emerging economies you can move directly to the 5 Fastest Growing Cities in the World Economically.According to a report by the International Monetary Fund, the global growth rate is expected to fall to 3% in 2023 and 2024 from an expected 3.5% in 2022. The report suggests that rising inflation rates have contributed to the current state of the global economy. As per the current data, the global headline inflation rate is expected to fall from 6.8% in 2023 to 5.2% in 2024. Moreover, world trade growth is expected to decline from 5.2% in 2022 to 2.0% in 2023.However, the future of the global economy is not as bleak as it may seem right now. The report suggests that 2024 may be slightly better for the world. The world trade rate is expected to rise to 3.7% in 2024. Emerging economies are expected to experience significant growth by the end of 2023 and 2024, at 4.0% and 4.1%, respectively. Particularly, emerging economies in Asia are expected to experience the highest growth globally and global growth is on track to rise to 5.3% in 2023 and 5.0% in 2024.BRICS May Drive Future Economic GrowthBrazil, Russia, India, and China first grouped to form BRIC in 2006. In 2011, South Africa joined the group, which led the cluster to be renamed to the BRICS. These economies were grouped as expectations of high economic growth dominated the prospects for each country. You can take a look at some countries that are expected to experience significant economic growth.On January 1 2024, BRICS is set to welcome new members formally. These include Saudi Arabia, Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates. On August 23, Forbes reported how the new arrangement between the BRICS countries could be a political move to attain energy dominance. As per the report, the arrangement immensely benefits China. Saudi Arabia, a major oil supplier to China, will benefit the country by the Riyadh-Teheran détente. The new treaty between Iran and Saudia Arabia promises trade and friendship between the two countries.
