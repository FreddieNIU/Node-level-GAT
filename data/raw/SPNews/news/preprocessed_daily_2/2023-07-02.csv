That's one piece of investing advice that gurus of all sorts – no matter how they approach the market – agree on.What they're talking about is having an asset allocation plan, which divvies up your money into stocks, bonds, cash and other assets in appropriate proportions according to your goals, how long you plan to invest and your tolerance for risk.The advice is sound. By spreading your money among different kinds of assets – diversifying your investments, essentially – you lower the chance that you'll lose money because, theoretically, they won't move in lockstep.But asset allocation strategies were seriously tested in 2022, when stocks and bonds fell in tandem. Diversification goes out the window during such market crashes, ""just when investors need it the most,"" says Sebastien Page, chief investment officer at T. Rowe Price and author of ""Beyond Diversification: What Every Investor Needs to Know About Asset Allocation.""Even so, asset allocation matters. One old Wall Street saw says it drives 90% of portfolio returns. But in fact, asset allocation affects portfolio volatility more than returns. ""You engage in asset allocation because, like ballast in a boat, you want to minimize the sway of the portfolio,"" says Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at investment research firm CFRA Research. More important, ""because you're smoothing out the fluctuations, your emotions are less likely to become your portfolio's worst enemy,"" he says.The 12 Best Stocks to Buy NowSmart investors will view the turmoil of 2022 as a sign that some tweaks to their portfolio may be required. After all, the market has changed. Bond yields are higher and cash, at long last, can earn a decent interest rate. Inflation, despite recent declines, remains high.Story continuesMeanwhile, U.S. stocks, down from their peak in late 2021 even after a rebound, are still expensive relative to shares in other countries' markets. Foreign stocks have been outperforming their U.S. counterparts in recent months.To help you decide how to apportion your portfolio, we went to the experts. We polled some of the best asset allocators in the business for their thoughts on how to construct a portfolio. The process is part art and part science. We'll walk you through the steps the pros take to help clients build their portfolios so you can benefit, too.Know your investing goals and risk toleranceAsset allocation is basically about ""getting the right mix of assets given your risk tolerance and risk capacity, or time horizon,"" says Robert Williams, managing director of financial planning at Charles Schwab. ""Balancing those risks is the key to investment planning.""Before professional advisers get into that, however, they get a full picture of your finances and square away important questions first.""What are we trying to accomplish?"" asks Ryan Viktorin, a certified financial planner at Fidelity Investments. Are you saving for retirement, college, a down payment on a house? ""When is that happening? Five years away, or 25 years away?"" Viktorin continues. ""Once you have that framework, you can start to know how to invest given what you hope to accomplish,"" she says.Risk capacity. Your time horizon is easy to nail down. Your child's first college tuition bill will land in two years, for example, or you plan to retire in 10.""Time horizon is a big driver of the amount of risk you can take on in the portfolio,"" says T. Rowe Price's Page. Money needed for a down payment on a house in three years, for instance, should be invested in cash or short-term bonds, not stocks, because you may not have enough time to make up any potential losses.Where to Invest for the Rest of 2023Risk tolerance. Figuring out how much volatility you can stomach – your tolerance for risk – is tougher. ""Risk tolerance is a fuzzy concept,"" says Page. It's emotional. It also varies from person to person, and it may be colored by market conditions.""People say they want to take lots of risk when markets are rising and no risk when markets are falling,"" says David Born, a certified financial planner in Orinda, Calif. Likewise, major life events can have an effect, too. If you're going through a divorce, for example, ""no matter who you are, you're going to have a low tolerance for risk,"" says Blaine Thiederman, a certified financial planner in Arvada, Colo. Most money managers, from digital robos to high-net-worth advisers, pose questions to gauge how aggressive or conservative you are as an investor. Much of it boils down to assessing how you will react during a market crash. If your portfolio declines by 20% in one year, are you likely to stay the course or change the portfolio?Even better is a real-life example. ""What investment changes did you make in 2022? Did you sell? Did you buy? Do nothing?"" asks Sabino Vargas, a senior financial adviser and certified financial planner at Vanguard. ""We tend to remember what happened most recently, so these are good questions to ask now.""If you sold investments in 2022, you are less risk tolerant (or more conservative) than someone who did nothing (moderate) or the investor who bought during a downdraft (aggressive).Of course, we're paring down a complex task that advisers say requires time and effort. Getting a handle on your risk tolerance ""is not a precise or scientific approach. It's by feel,"" says David Kressner, a managing adviser at Altfest Personal Wealth Management. But it is critical to building the right asset allocation strategy because the best portfolios are the ones you can stick with over time, even through big market drawdowns.""Making imprudent decisions at the wrong time can have a meaningful impact on your outcome,"" says Kressner. ""Avoid those mistakes by having the right allocation in place.""How much should investors put in stocks, bonds and cash?Both risk capacity and risk tolerance play a role in how much you put in the basic building blocks of every portfolio: stocks, bonds and cash. Although most model portfolios are tagged with names that point to risk tolerance – conservative, moderate and aggressive, mostly – they also point to time frame. In his book, for instance, T. Rowe Price's Page refers to what he calls life-cycle-based model portfolios in terms of years to retirement – 20 years before retirement, 15 years, 10, 5 and zero.In the end, the most important decision you'll make is how much you put in stocks, says Page, ""because it is the most effective way to calibrate your risk level in the portfolio."" Use the model portfolios below as a broad-brushstroke guide to constructing a portfolio that's right for you. Read on for ideas on how to fill in the picture.asset allocation model portfolios to determine risk capacityStocks. Stocks offer the biggest reward over the long term, but the trade-off is high volatility. Over the past 20 years, stocks have returned an annualized 10.0%, but they suffered four bear markets – technically defined as a decline of 20% or more from the most recent peak. What's more, in any given calendar year – and in some years more than once – the S&amp;P 500 Index tends to dip 5% to 10%.There are dozens of ways to slice your stock portfolio. The division of assets between U.S. and foreign shares is just the start. Within the international portion, you can choose among developed markets and emerging markets. And for both U.S. and foreign stocks, you can home in on company size (small, medium or large) or tilt toward investment style (growth or value). Or you can focus on certain sectors – technology, energy, materials or industrial stocks, for example.You can keep it simple by investing in index funds that cover the whole swath of stocks, such as a total stock market mutual fund or exchange-traded fund, for instance, which holds a stake in nearly every publicly traded stock in the U.S.Our favorites include the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI, $207, expense ratio 0.03%), which also trades in a mutual fund share class (VTSAX, 0.04%), and its international stock counterpart, the Vanguard Total International Stock Index (VXUS, $54, 0.07%), or its mutual fund version (VTIAX, 0.11%). The Fidelity Zero Total Market Index (FZROX) and the Fidelity Zero International Index (FZILX) are both broad index funds that charge no annual expenses.Stock Picks That Billionaires LoveOr leverage index funds to access slices of the stock market. That makes it easy to tilt your portfolio tactically, says Thiederman, the CFP in Arvada, Colo. ""We piece out each part of the allocation with its own ETF to give us control to make adjustments to the portfolio,"" he says. His holdings include Vanguard ETFs that focus on U.S. small-company value stocks, U.S. small-company growth stocks and the like, as well as individual funds that focus on large-company and small-company stocks in foreign developed countries and in emerging markets.But don't worry about getting so narrowly focused if that isn't your thing. ""Granularity adds value, but it's not a requirement,"" says Schwab's Williams. Choosing an asset allocation and saving and investing, Williams says, can be like constructing a rocket ship: ""You shoot it in the air and head toward a destination. You may change the steering here and there,"" tweaking your stock portfolio with more foreign shares, say, or small-cap stocks, ""but generally you're all moving in the right direction.""Bonds. Bonds provide ballast against stock volatility – 2022 notwithstanding – but the trade-off is lower returns. Over the past 20 years, the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index returned 3.2% annualized. In that period, it had just three years of negative returns, in 2022 (–13.0%), in 2021 (–1.5%) and in 2013 (–2.0%).But bonds can do more than just play the foil to stocks. They can also generate income, preserve capital and hedge against inflation. A core bond fund can go a long way toward meeting those objectives: Our favorite actively managed fund is the Baird Aggregate Bond (BAGSX, 0.55%). The fund, yielding 3.8%, is a member of the Kiplinger 25, the list of our favorite actively managed, no-load funds.Best Bond ETFs to Buy NowOr consider the iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG, $99, 0.03%), yielding 4.0%. You can fine-tune your portfolio to specific objectives with the right mix of bonds. Determine what you need most from your bond portfolio – income, preservation and/or diversification from stocks – then match the objective with the right kind of bonds.To diversify from stocks, stick with high-grade bonds, such as Treasuries or government-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities. Buy Treasuries directly from the government at TreasuryDirect.gov and hold to maturity. ETFs are another option. The iShares US Treasury Bond ETF (GOVT, $23, 0.05%) holds debt with short-, medium- and long-term maturities and yields 4.0%. Our favorite mortgage-bond funds include the Vanguard Mortgage-Backed Securities ETF (VMBS, $46, 0.04%), which yields 3.2%, and the Vanguard GNMA (VFIIX, 0.21%), which yields 3.1%.To generate income – an easier task these days thanks to higher rates – focus on high-quality, investment-grade corporate bonds (debt rated between triple-A and triple-B). The Vanguard Intermediate-Term Investment-Grade (VFICX, 0.20%) yields 4.9%. Add some oomph, if your risk tolerance allows, with small doses of high-yield bonds (debt rated double-B to triple-C) or emerging-markets bonds. The Osterweis Strategic Income (OSTIX, 0.84%) tilts toward debt with maturities of five years or less and recently yielded more than 7%. The Vanguard Emerging Markets Bond (VEMBX, 0.55%), another Kip 25 fund, yields 7.3%.For capital preservation, focus on high-quality, short-term bond funds, which yield roughly 4% these days. The Baird Short-Term Bond (BSBSX, 0.55%) holds a mix of government and corporate debt – triple-A-rated debt makes up nearly half of the portfolio – and currently yields 4.3%.Finally, to hedge against inflation, invest in Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS), which pay a fixed rate on principal that adjusts with inflation. Buy directly from Uncle Sam at TreasuryDirect.gov. Or consider a fund. The Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities ETF (VTIP, $48, 0.04%) yields 1.8%; the SPDR Bloomberg 1-10 Year TIPS ETF (TIPX, $19, 0.15%) covers both short- and medium-term securities and yields 1.5%.Best SPDR ETFs to Buy and HoldCash. Gone are the days when sitting in cash was a liability. Cash accounts pay nearly 4% or more now. Most high-yield savings accounts yield 4.0% or nearly, including Capital One's 360 Performance Savings account. Six-month Treasuries recently yielded 5.5%. Buy individual short-term Treasuries and Series I savings bonds (which yield 4.3%) at TreasuryDirect.gov. Or invest in the iShares 1-3 Year Treasury Bond ETF (SHY, $82, 0.15%) or the Goldman Sachs Access Treasury 0-1 Yr ETF (GBIL, $100, 0.12%). Both funds yield more than 4.0%.Money market mutual funds recently yielded more than 5.0%. Vanguard beats everyone on expense ratio and yield in this category – specifically, the Vanguard Federal Money Market (VMFXX, 0.11%) and the Vanguard Cash Reserve Federal Money Market (VMRXX, 0.10%), both yielding just over 5.0%.Consider alternative investment strategiesStick with your plan, but understand it's okay to make incremental shifts in response to market conditions. Bond yields are higher, and so are stock valuations, says T. Rowe Price's Page. So he's slightly underweight in stocks relative to bonds, he says. By underweight, he means below the target stock allocation in any given portfolio. But, he adds, ""we limit our tactical adjustments to plus or minus 10 percentage points"" around the target allocation. ""These aren't big adjustments.""Similarly, the advisers at Altfest Personal Wealth Management have shifted their focus since late 2021 from short-term inflation-protected bonds to intermediate and longer-term Treasury debt to lock in higher yields.Asset classes can morph over time, too. Today, more than half the high-yield bond market is made up of double-B-rated debt, the highest-quality junk bonds, says Page. That's up considerably from 2008, when double-B bonds accounted for roughly one-third of the junk-bond market. That means the asset class is slightly higher in quality than in years past – so it is lower in risk – but investors should expect to earn lower yields on junk bonds relative to Treasuries than in the past. Emerging-market countries, too, are less tied to volatile commodity prices, Page adds. ""That will affect how the asset class behaves"" relative to its historical performance, he says.Stocks Warren Buffett is Buying and SellingPerhaps the biggest lesson investors learned in 2022 is that portfolios could use a dose of alternative strategies, which tend to move independently from stock and bond markets. Some of these strategies posted double-digit-percentage returns in 2022.""It's a catch-all category,"" says Altfest's Kressner, that can include long-short funds, market-neutral funds and managed-futures strategies. Today, a growing number of these approaches are available in mutual funds for mom-and-pop investors. Among them, we like the Pimco Trends Managed Futures Strategy Fund (PQTAX, 1.87%) and the Boston Partners Global Long/Short Fund (BGRSX, 2.81%). We also like the Vanguard Market Neutral Fund (VMNFX, 1.83%).  Note that a $50,000 minimum investment is required.Some advisers make a case for putting up to 20% of your portfolio in alternative-strategy funds, depending on your age, circumstances and risk tolerance – ""especially today,"" says Dan Villalon, global cohead of AQR's portfolio solutions group, who cites expectations for low returns from stocks and bonds in the coming years and the greater level of uncertainty in the world.Ideally, you would trim from both your stock and bond allocations to add alternatives to your portfolio. But Villalon says many investors, especially those who want to maintain a certain level of risk in their portfolio, simply take from the bond side. Either way, Villalon recommends considering a fund that employs multiple alternative strategies. Check out the AQR Diversifying Strategies (QDSNX, 1.72%). The fund proved to be a good diversifier in 2022, when it returned 14.5%.At Altfest, alternative asset strategies include a hodgepodge of approaches, including hedged-equity ETFs that offer some protection against stock downturns in exchange for a cap on potential gains. These so-called buffered or defined-outcome ETFs take some explaining. To limit losses and gains, the ETFs invest in options linked to, say, the S&amp;P 500. Fund firms Innovator, Allianz and Trueshares have the longest track record with these strategies. We'll be watching them closely.Hire a professional adviserEnlisting an expert to manage your portfolio is a good idea for many investors, especially those with complex financial situations. For others, a sit-down with an adviser – to assess whether you're on track with your investment goals – can offer peace of mind, which will help you stick with the plan. A robo adviser is a good option for many, too. You can also access professional expertise without hiring an adviser by buying shares in a fund that holds stocks and bonds, such as a balanced fund, or invest in a target-date fund.Balanced funds typically hold 60% of assets in stocks and 40% in bonds, a common allocation for an investor with a medium- to long-term time horizon and a moderate amount of risk tolerance. Actively managed funds tend to outshine ETFs in this category. Our favorite is the Vanguard Wellington (VWELX, 0.25%) because it has delivered solid, consistent returns and boasts a low annual expense ratio. The Fidelity Puritan (FPURX, 0.50%), American Funds American Balanced (BALFX, 0.62%) and Dodge &amp; Cox Balanced (DODBX, 0.52%) are worth a look, too.How to Survive the 2023 Stock MarketTarget-date funds grow old with you. Experts decide how to allocate your assets over your working life (and often well into your retired life, too) by gradually shifting the mix of stocks and bonds as you grow older. These funds are standard offerings in 401(k)s, but you can invest in one outside of your plan.Choose a target-date series that matches your tolerance for risk. Some are more aggressive than others. The funds in the T. Rowe Price Retirement and Fidelity Freedom target-date series consistently hold more stocks along their glide path (the shift in the stock-bond allocation over time) than peer funds do. The American Funds Target Date Retirement series follows a glide path that starts conservatively relative to peers but ends moderately aggressive. The T. Rowe Price Target series – which is more conservatively positioned than the firm's Retirement series – have lower exposure to stocks compared with peers.Index-based target-date funds get the job done, too. The Vanguard Target Retirement series shines here for its simplicity—the target funds hold a handful of broad-market index funds—and a low expense ratio of 0.08%. No other series comes close.Use online tools to identify identify risk toleranceOnline tools can help you identify – roughly – your tolerance for risk. Bear in mind that your mood and/or market conditions may affect how you answer certain questions.Charles Schwab's questionnaire is open to all; you don't have to be a Schwab client to access it. Your answers will inform a time-horizon score and a risk-tolerance score that together slot you into one of five profiles: conservative; moderately conservative; moderate; moderately aggressive; or aggressive.Vanguard has a free tool, too. It will suggest a stock/bond/cash mix.Robo advisers can be good sources for model portfolios, even if you don't have an account. Check out Schwab Intelligent Portfolios; E*Trade's Core Portfolios and Fidelity Go. You fill out a questionnaire about your age, time horizon and risk tolerance, among other things, and are shown a breakdown of how much to hold in stocks, bonds and other assets. Schwab and Fidelity even show what funds you'd hold if you opened an advisory account with them.Note: This item first appeared in Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine, a monthly, trustworthy source of advice and guidance.

2,b03e9ab2-dce6-37bf-87dd-91736f291f8f,USB,2023-07-02,"U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) earnings and shareholder returns have been trending downwards for the last five years, but the stock grows 3.6% this past week",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-bancorp-nyse-usb-earnings-110017525.html,1688295617,STORY,['USB'],"[In order to justify the effort of selecting individual stocks, it's worth striving to beat the returns from a market index fund. But even the best stock picker will only win with some selections. At this point some shareholders may be questioning their investment in U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), since the last five years saw the share price fall 34%. And some of the more recent buyers are probably worried, too, with the stock falling 29% in the last year.Although the past week has been more reassuring for shareholders, they're still in the red over the last five years, so let's see if the underlying business has been responsible for the decline. See our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Looking back five years, both U.S. Bancorp's share price and EPS declined; the latter at a rate of 0.02% per year. Readers should note that the share price has fallen faster than the EPS, at a rate of 8% per year, over the period. So it seems the market was too confident about the business, in the past. The less favorable sentiment is reflected in its current P/E ratio of 9.00.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthIt's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for U.S. Bancorp the TSR over the last 5 years was -21%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveInvestors in U.S. Bancorp had a tough year, with a total loss of 25% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 16%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 4% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted   1 warning sign for U.S. Bancorp  you should be aware of.There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares.

3,c9c08603-2e6a-3619-b293-bf9093642b29,CTAS,2023-07-02,Time’s Ticking: Dump These 7 Overvalued Value Stocks,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/time-ticking-dump-7-overvalued-163659744.html,1687711019,STORY,"['CHD', 'CTAS', 'ELP', 'PWR', 'EFX', 'IBP', 'ROL']","[To paraphrase a passage from Ecclesiastes, there’s a time to bump and a time to dump and that brings us to overvalued value stocks to sell. Listen, nobody likes talking about this subject because, psychologically, it’s akin to hurting puppies. And if there’s one thing you don’t do in America, it’s hurting puppies. There will be perdition to pay for such evil and for what it’s worth, I stand by such sentiment 100%.However, when it comes to the topic of high-risk value stocks, the most important rule for investors is to look out for yourself. Sure, I suppose a certain level of nobility and honor exists in holding the line. But whose line are you holding? Believe me, these C-level suits – you know, CEOs, CFOs, CIOs, etc. – wouldn’t give a you-know-what about dumping hot potatoes on you. So, you should do it first.Another reason to target value stocks with high risk is the underlying nature of this asset class. By definition, value stocks represent securities that are discounted against some fundamental metric. That lulls investors into complacency. However, it’s important to realize that even value plays can get overheated.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSo, look out for number one and avoid overvalued value stocks.Church &amp; Dwight (CHD)Figurines of two little men in suits looking at downward stock arrow going through the floorSource: shutterstock.com/Black SalmonIncluding Church &amp; Dwight (NYSE:CHD) on this list of overvalued value stocks to sell pains me because I’ve written positive coverage about CHD before. As a consumer goods giant, the company makes sense, especially under this ambiguous market environment. Also, it used to be great value, providing a modest dividend for your troubles. Unfortunately, it might not be a stellar buy anymore.Since the start of the year, CHD soared to just under 19%. I think that’s a significant factor to consider because it outpaces the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index, which gained 14.58% during the same period. Also, I’m not seeing the justification for the premium based on its financial performances.Story continuesFor example, Church &amp; Dwight’s three-year revenue growth rate (on a per-share basis) pings at a modestly positive 8.1%. However, CHD trades at 4.38 times trailing-12-month (TTM) sales, which ranks worse than 87% of its peers. So, unless you see a bullish hysteria for baking soda, CHD ranks among the high-risk value stocks.Cintas (CTAS)Death: grim reaper in black cloakSource: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Mason, Ohio, Cintas (NASDAQ:CTAS) provides a range of products and services to businesses. These include mundane but important items such as uniforms, mats, mops, cleaning and restroom supplies, first aid and safety products, fire extinguishers and testing and safety courses. It’s boring as heck, which traditionally makes it a solid value play. But not anymore.Since the start of the year, CTAS gained almost 9%. In the trailing one-year period, CTAS soared to nearly 33%. Now, some of the enthusiasm is justified based on the broad push among companies recalling their employees back to offices. However, I’m not entirely sure if the premium makes sense, making it a possible candidate for overvalued value stocks to sell.For example, Cintas’ three-year revenue growth rate pings at 5.7%, beating out 57.26% of its peers. It’s not awe-inspiring but it’s not bad. However, the market prices CTAS at a TTM sales multiple of 5.87. That definitely is bad. According to Gurufocus, this stat ranks worse than 88.8% of the competition. So, CTAS represents one of the value stocks with high risk.Equifax (EFX)little girl holding a stock chart with athumbs down. stocks to avoidSource: ShutterstockBasically the Houston Astros of the business world, I don’t feel bad labeling Equifax (NYSE:EFX) as one of the overvalued value stocks to sell. Yes, I’m referring to the data breach incident. And yes, the incident does live “rent free” in my head, as the kids like to say. Honestly, the matter should live rent free in every Americans’ head.Anyways, Equifax historically could make an argument as a value play. As a dividend provider and a credit reporting agency, it provides necessary services to the public. Fundamentally, the business offers predictability, which represents one of the hallmarks of a value-based investment. However, after flying over 24% in the trailing year, EFX might be one of the high-risk value stocks.Specifically, Equifax may offer strong financial stats, with three-year revenue and book growth rates of 13.1% and 14.9%, respectively. However, investors must now pay 31.33 times forward earnings. This stat ranks worse than 87.94% of its peers. Ahead of an uncertain economic environment, you should sell these overpriced value stocks like EFX.Quanta Services (PWR)a frustrated man with a white board behind him that features a black downward arrowSource: ShutterstockBased in Houston, Texas, Quanta Services (NYSE:PWR) provides infrastructure services for electric power, pipeline, industrial and communications industries. Its capabilities include the planning, design, installation, program management, maintenance and repair of most types of network infrastructure. It’s beautiful, relevant and boring as stink. Traditionally, you would look to something like Quanta Services for discounted value plays.You’re not looking at Quanta anymore for those discounts. Since the beginning of the year, PWR gained 35% of equity value. In the past 365 days, shares skyrocketed to nearly 57% up. It just continues to move higher and higher. However, at some point, the air will likely come out of this rally, making it one of the overvalued value stocks to sell.Sure, I get that Quanta enjoys a three-year revenue growth rate of 12%, outflanking 75.73% of its peers. At the same time, it features a sales multiple of 1.62, which ranks worse than nearly 75% of the competition. Also, you’d be paying over 26 times forward earnings, representing an 89% premium over the sector median of 14.01 times.Rollins (ROL)earningsSource: ShutterstockA North American pest control company, Rollins (NYSE:ROL) would easily qualify as a value play candidate. Generally speaking, few people enjoy having bugs in the house. At the same time, pest control isn’t exactly a growth industry. According to Fortune Business Insights, the global pest control industry will see a compound annual growth rate of 6.31% between 2020 and 2027. That’s not scintillating stuff.But now, it’s quite possible that ROL got ahead of itself. Since the January opener, shares gained nearly 14% of equity value. In the trailing one-year period, they’re up almost 22%. Don’t get me wrong, Rollins has expanded, with a three-year sales growth rate of 10.1% beating out 78.12% of its peers. At the same time, you’d be paying 7.43 times trailing sales, which ranks worse than 92.3% of the field.Also, bear in mind that by acquiring ROL, you’re also paying over 47 times forward earnings. This stat ranks worse than 92.86% of the underlying industry. That’s why ROL may be one of the overvalued value stocks to sell.COPEL (ELP)a keyboard with a greet enter key marked sell, representing overvalued stocks to sellSource: ShutterstockBased in Brazil, COPEL (NYSE:ELP) is an electric utility company. Levered to the exciting Latin America market, ELP admittedly features some growth elements. However, the fundamental nature of COPEL carries a value profile. Utilities generally don’t have exciting growth prospects. Instead, the motif centers on predictability.Unfortunately, ELP may have gotten ahead of itself. Occasionally, discounted enterprises with predictable businesses become overheated and that’s why you avoid overvalued value stocks. It’s possible that disappointed investors can quickly dump out of shares. Certainly, you don’t want to end up holding the bag on a play like this. Over the past year, ELP gained over 24%, which is a bit rich for a utility trade.Moving onto the financials, COPEL enjoys a three-year revenue growth rate of 11.4%, beating out 66.67% of rivals. However, investors must pay 109.18 times trailing earnings for the privilege. Also, ELP’s price-earnings-growth (PEG) ratio is 11.14 times, worse than 86.38% of the field. Therefore, it’s one of the value stocks with high risk.Installed Building Products (IBP)sell written on a chalkboard representing overvalued stocks to sellSource: ShutterstockHailing from Columbus, Ohio, Installed Building Products (NYSE:IBP) is the premier installation contractor for insulation for residential and commercial builders. According to its website, Installed Building employes over 10,000 workers who serve more than 220 locations nationwide. Under normal circumstances, IBP would historically qualify as a value play for its steady, relevant business. However, circumstances have gotten out of control.Since the start of the year, IBP gained over 47% of equity value. In the trailing one-year period, shares bounced up nearly 61%. Fundamentally, I’m cautious over the Federal Reserve and its hint that policymakers could raise interest rates. If so, that might kill the housing market and would likely lead to less insulation demand.To be fair, Installed Building gained handsomely from the Covid-19 crisis, delivering a three-year revenue growth rate of 22.3%. This stat beats out 83.17% of sector rivals. At the same time, investors must pay 16.5 times forward earnings for the privilege. That’s worse than 82.86% of the competition, making IBP one of the overvalued value stocks to sell.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Pedott is also credited with making popular the light-switch gizmo The Clapper.Remembered as a ""legend"" by longtime colleague Michael Hirsch, Pedott turned the once money-losing Chia Pet product into a profitable business with cultural relevance.A pro at selling products through unforgettable slogans, Pedott’s approach to finding hit items and subsequent advertisements was straightforward: ""Keep it fun, simple, and add value,"" Hirsch told Yahoo Finance by phone. Hirsch worked alongside Pedott for over 40 years.And that philosophy paid off. The sprout-growing terracotta figurine is among America’s best-selling items with more than 25 million sold in the US to date.Joseph Pedott, the marketing guru behind the Chia Pet and the Clapper, died on June 22 at the age of 91.Hirsch added: ""He was very good at watching his return on investment (ROI), always making sure there was a path to future returns at the end of the day.""Pedott started his career as a student at the University of Illinois. In 1955, he founded the agency Pedott &amp; Peters. It was there that he first worked on TV commercials. But it wasn’t until years later while in search of new clients that he learned of the powerhouse potential of Chia Pets.After being dismissed as a 'stupid item' by the head of sales of a leading drugstore chain, Pedott found untapped value in the product, later telling the University of Illinois alumni publication it ""just needed better advertising.""Soon after, Pedott offered (and bought) the rights to the Chia Pet from its importer Walter Houston and, according to Hirsch, ""threw away everything but the product.""Pedott moved manufacturing to Tecate, Mexico, rebranded the figurine, and with his unique and unparalleled advertising approach, debuted the Chia Ram in 1982. The debut marked the first widely distributed Chia Pet under the newly created Joseph Enterprises Inc.Story continuesMore plant-growing animal figurines followed, which ultimately led the company to its first big licensing deal: Warner Bros. Looney Tunes characters.For years, Pedott ran Joseph Enterprises Inc., where he not only turned the Chia Pet into a household name, but The Clapper light switch as well — a design first sold in 1985 and made memorable by its catchy ""Clap on, Clap Off"" TV commercial.Both products are archived in the Smithsonian, and the Chia Pet is also included in the New York Times time capsule, to be opened in the year 3000.Pedott sold his business to the National Entertainment Collectibles Association in 2018, a global distributor of licensed consumer products. According to Hirsch, that deal helped keep Chia Pet 'relevant,' and kept Pedott’s legacy alive.""The success is all because of his vision and determination to keep moving forward,"" Hirsch said. ""His reputation is for being a hard but fair negotiator. People would always walk away from doing business with Joe with a smile…He wanted to make sure everyone was winning.""And in the process, Pedott won too.Seana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

It is wrestling with everything from job cuts and a global investment banking slump to reports of partner unrest and concerns about strategy.Even Solomon’s side gig as a DJ and his partial interest in a real estate company are subjects of scrutiny.Goldman spokesman Tony Fratto said Solomon ""and the entire leadership team are focused on delivering for clients and executing on our strategy"" and that the CEO has acted as a DJ at ""only a handful of events a year - and hasn’t in over a year.""As for any dissension among the partners, he said ""the reality is people can have disagreements"" and that’s ""normal.""Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Goldman is not the only big name on Wall Street under pressure.Firms with big investment banking and trading units have made or announced cuts of roughly 12,000 jobs since the end of 2022. Dealmaking is drying up amid a rise in interest rates, economic uncertainty and the failures of several sizable regional banks.Those cutting back include other Wall Street stalwarts such as Morgan Stanley (MS), Citigroup (C) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM).UBS, which also has a sizable presence on Wall Street, reportedly plans to cut 35,000 jobs at former rival Credit Suisse Group AG following an emergency takeover orchestrated by the Swiss government in March.These challenges are a reminder that the pain for the banking industry is still acute months after the failures of regional lenders Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic. And the giant banks that rely on mergers or IPO underwriting for sizable portions of their revenue have specific problems of their own.Story continues'Green shoots'The slowdown in dealmaking will come into sharper focus in a few weeks when the biggest institutions report their second-quarter results.Worldwide revenue from mergers and acquisitions for the first half of 2023 fell 38% compared to the same period last year, according to data from Refinitiv, amounting to the slowest first half for deal making since 2020.That follows a subpar first quarter when major banks advising on mergers or IPO underwriting reported sizable drops in fee revenue. The largest decrease of 26% belonged to Goldman. A hint at the possible results came this week when a smaller investment bank, Jefferies Financial Group (JEF), said its fiscal second-quarter revenue from investment banking plunged 26%, pulling down profit for the period.One bright spot, however, was that capital markets net revenue surged 30% to $543 million in the quarter. Jefferies also said that “the month of June has brought green shoots.”Many big banks have warned that trading revenue will also be down in the second quarter. That includes Goldman. Its chief operating officer, John Waldron, has said such revenue may fall 25%.Goldman is fighting this year to keep its title as the world's largest dealmaker. It was still ahead of rival JPMorgan through June 30, according to Dealogic, with a market share lead of 1%. Another data provider, Refinitiv, said Goldman trailed JPMorgan as of June 27.Winning 'cures all'It wasn't long ago that deal making was responsible for helping Goldman — and the rest of Wall Street — churn out record profits.The last boom came in 2021, when CEOs used surging markets as a reason to buy other companies, go public, or take on new debt. Through the period, Goldman Sachs dramatically outperformed rival firms, scoring its best year of revenue in its century and a half historyThen came a year that most of Wall Street would like to forget.In 2022, three major stock averages fell by the most since 2008 and bonds had their worst year on record. Inflation reached its highest level in four decades, triggering an aggressive series of interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.All of that new economic uncertainty curbed the optimism needed from the corporate clients that are the lifeblood of Wall Street's investment banking business. As a result, bonuses were slashed and jobs were cut.John Waldron, chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid (Brendan McDermid / reuters)Goldman recorded its second-highest annual revenue that year but it had a rough end to 2022, with profits down a whopping 69% in the final quarter amid a sharp decline in deal-making. In January of this year Goldman Sachs let go of roughly 3,000 employees, or 6% of its workforce.Solomon, facing shareholders at the end of February during the firm's second-ever investor day, admitted mistakes were made. ""I think we’ve accomplished a lot over the past few years. We got some things right, got some things wrong.""He dismissed chatter about mass partner exits, saying there were fewer partner transitions in 2022 than any other year going back to 2014.He also made it clear Goldman would be scaling back its prior ambitions to become a consumer banking giant (a project known as Marcus) and would instead look to lean more heavily on the steady, fee-generating business of wealth management. Goldman has sold some Marcus loans and will likely take a write down for a purchase of a fintech lender.""The culture of Goldman Sachs is incredibly strong,"" Solomon said on Feb. 28.Less than two weeks later Goldman found itself in the middle of another controversial situation when it tried to help Silicon Valley Bank raise capital while purchasing some of its securities. The events preceded a run on the regional bank that upended the banking world.Silicon Valley Bank was seized by regulators on March 10. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)A spokesman said Goldman informed Silicon Valley Bank in writing that it would not act as its adviser on the securities sale and recommended the bank hire a third-party financial adviser for that transaction. Federal officials are now reportedly investigating the role Goldman played in those final days.Devin Ryan, analyst for JMP Securities with an overweight rating on Goldman, predicted the firm would bounce back once markets and dealmaking recovers.“Goldman Sachs will disproportionately benefit when that happens,"" he told Yahoo Finance.Winning, said Wells Fargo banking analyst Mike Mayo, ""cures all.""""So if and when capital markets resume,"" he added, paychecks will go higher and ""I think employees will be a lot happier.”Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

(NYSE:OMC) received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$96.75 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$87.04. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Omnicom Group's current trading price of US$95.15 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Omnicom Group’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Omnicom Group What Is Omnicom Group Worth?Good news, investors! Omnicom Group is still a bargain right now. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $135.38, but it is currently trading at US$95.15 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. Another thing to keep in mind is that Omnicom Group’s share price may be quite stable relative to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. This means that if you believe the current share price should move towards its intrinsic value over time, a low beta could suggest it is not likely to reach that level anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range again.What does the future of Omnicom Group look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by a double-digit 13% over the next couple of years, the outlook is positive for Omnicom Group. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since OMC is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on OMC for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy OMC. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed buy.If you want to dive deeper into Omnicom Group, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

If it can keep that out-performance up over the long term, investors will do very well! However, the stock hasn't done so well in the longer term, with the stock only up 26% in three years.Since the stock has added US$1.9b to its market cap in the past week alone, let's see if underlying performance has been driving long-term returns. Check out our latest analysis for Align Technology To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During the last year, Align Technology actually saw its earnings per share drop 55%.So we don't think that investors are paying too much attention to EPS. Therefore, it seems likely that investors are putting more weight on metrics other than EPS, at the moment.Align Technology's revenue actually dropped 8.1% over last year. So the fundamental metrics don't provide an obvious explanation for the share price gain.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. So we recommend checking out this free report showing consensus forecastsA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Align Technology shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 43% over the last year. That's better than the annualised return of 0.4% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

As always, during the conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on slide two and those outlined in our latest forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement after this presentation, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions or otherwise. You can find our press release and the slides referenced on this call in the Investors section of the Walgreens Boots Alliance website. The slides in the press release also contain further information about the non-GAAP financial measures that we will discuss during this call. I'll now turn the call over to Roz.Story continuesRoz Brewer: Thanks, Tiffany, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start today's call with an acknowledgment that our performance in the third quarter did not meet our overall expectations, and we are disappointed to have to change our fiscal 2023 guidance. While we achieved good sales growth and return to adjusted earnings growth in the quarter, several dynamics created margin pressures that we are factoring into our full-year outlook, We have seen changing market trends that have consumers prioritizing value in response to a more uncertain and challenging economic environment. There has been a steeper drop off in COVID vaccines and testing with the end of the public health emergency. We are also experiencing a slower profit ramp for U.S. Healthcare.Importantly, we remain committed to our strategy through immediate actions to accelerate our path to profitability and unlock long-term value. I remain confident in the long-term trajectory of our transformation, which is underpinned by significant progress against each of our four strategic priorities. We are continuing to transform and align our core business with advancements in our tech enabled pharmacy operating model. Today, we are announcing a scalable partnership with TelePharm to expand telepharmacy services; improve access to care; and provide flexibility for how and when patients engage with our pharmacists. Our model is also supported by our micro fulfillment centers, covering over 40% of our Walgreens store footprint. In U.S. retail, our flat year-to-date comp sales have successfully lapped last year's record 8.8% growth and retail gross margin is up over 100 basis points yet again.We have also made significant progress on building our next growth engine in healthcare, rapidly establishing our portfolio of assets across the care continuum. VillageMD acquired Summit to create a leading independent care delivery platform, and we accelerated the full acquisition of Shield and CareCentrix. This segment has gone from zero sales contribution just two years ago to a run rate of $8 billion in the third quarter of 2023. To fund our transformation and focus the portfolio, we have realized $4.1 billion in proceeds from the sale of ABC shares this fiscal year and also exited our Option Care Health position for $800 million in proceeds. Finally, we have continued to invest in strategic talent and capabilities, most recently, strengthening VillageMD's bench to welcome CFO, Rich Rubino.Turning to the third quarter, WBA returned to adjusted EPS growth, up nearly 4%. Third quarter sales were solid, growing almost 9% in constant currency. U.S. comp sales were up 7%. Let me call out U.S. retail digital sales, up 19% on top of a 25% gain last year with 3.7 million same day pickup orders. International was also notable, up 6.9% in the quarter. It is clear that consumers continue to appreciate the value, convenience and range of services delivered by Walgreens and Boots. Our increased expense discipline in the quarter only partly offset outsized margin pressure, and earnings growth was held back by three external factors. First, we saw lower-than-expected COVID-related demand, we had called out COVID as a wildcard heading into the quarter and have unfortunately seen less patient willingness to vaccinate.Walgreens administered 800,000 COVID-19 vaccines in the quarter, down 83% year-on-year and testing volumes are also down sharply. We are in turn taking the prudent [Indiscernible] of further reducing our expectations for COVID contributions going forward. We are currently projecting to administer 9 million to 10 million COVID vaccines next year in line with the typical flu season and compared to 12.5 million COVID vaccines expected in fiscal 2023. Second and similar to other retailers, we've been impacted by the rapid softening of the macro environment and a more cautious and value-driven consumer. Our customer is feeling the strain of higher inflation and interest rates, lower SNAP benefits and tax refunds, and an uncertain economic outlook.They are pulling back on discretionary and seasonal spend and responding strongly to promotional activity. For example, promotional unit is running up 10% in the retail channel, including a sharp increase over just a five-week period, while non-promotional units fell 8%. Let me add that we see the retail pricing environment as remaining rational. We have also seen some pressure on industry script volume excluding COVID, which may be related to these broader consumer headwinds. [Day fall] (ph) adjusted market growth excluding immunizations has slowed almost 2 percentage points from February to May. Our core retail pharmacy business is resilient and relatively well positioned in times of volatile consumer confidence. However, we're not immune to these external pressures and have trimmed our expectations accordingly, while at the same time ramping up our efforts around cost savings.Third, we've experienced a drag from a recent weaker respiratory season. We are feeling the effects through our script volume through our front of store sales, especially in the higher margin cough cold flu category and in CityMD’s traffic trends. These trends are likely to persist into the fourth quarter against last year's category strength. Importantly, we achieved strong quality of earnings considering a 4.7% adverse net impact to adjusted EPS from COVID the sale of ABC shares, sell in leaseback, incentive accruals, and tax. This trend gives us line of sight to accelerating adjusted operating income growth in the fourth quarter. Let me turn to our updated guidance. We now expect fiscal 2023 adjusted EPS at $4.00 to $4.05, reflecting consumer and category trends, lower COVID-19 contribution, and a more cautious macroeconomic forward view.This guidance represents core earnings to be flat to up 1%, excluding COVID and currency. We are also providing preliminary fiscal 2024 commentary. Let me be clear, there are some factors impacting us today that are likely to extend into next year, namely the macroeconomic-driven consumer pressure and COVID headwinds. We are closely watching emerging challenges to consumer spending and sentiment, such as the end of fiscal stimulus and the resumption of student loan payments. There are other factors that are more specific to our business today and should not be annualized into fiscal 2024, such as the weaker respiratory season. Most importantly, we have undertaken several aggressive initiatives to enhance profitability and cash flow into next year, especially in our Healthcare business.We expect low-to-mid-single-digit adjusted operating growth in fiscal 2024 with the U.S. Retail Pharmacy and U.S. Healthcare Businesses more than offsetting headwinds from COVID, sale and leaseback and ABC. AOI growth should outpace adjusted EPS, due to offsets from higher tax and non-controlling interest. We will provide a more detailed discussion of 2024 guidance when we report fourth quarter and full-year 2023 results. The positive operating growth trends with improving quality of earnings support our continued confidence in building to sustainable long-term low-teens adjusted EPS growth over time. To drive shareholder value, we are taking the following immediate actions to enhance profitability and accelerate our journey. First, we are raising our transformational cost management program savings goal to $4.1 billion, this includes $800 million of savings in fiscal 2024.Second, we have implemented capital and project spend reductions, and we've launched a working capital optimization program. Third, we are pursuing portfolio simplification at an even faster pace. Fourth, we are announcing several specific actions to accelerate U.S. Healthcare's path to profitability focused on VillageMD and Summit Health. We are also accelerating the synergies between our U.S. Healthcare segment and our core Walgreens business. We have a unique opportunity to improve local healthcare and wellbeing in this country. The flywheel of healthcare and retail pharmacy working together will deliver more affordable, accessible, quality healthcare to our communities and will also deliver sustainable shareholder value. It starts with our trusted brand and pharmacist, national footprint, and digital offerings.58% of Americans are likely to visit their local pharmacy as a first step when faced with a non-emergency medical issue. Add to that, our leading assets across the care continuum. VillageMD, Summit, Shield, and CareCentrix and our early work with health corners and clinical trials. We've created a platform at scale that is absolutely proving to help health plans and patients improve outcomes and lower cost. Our teams are expanding partnerships and driving greater market access, which is the next step to getting our will to turn. As healthcare and retail pharmacy jointly serve consumers, we will deepen engagement and reinforce our trusted brand. Let's look at a few tangible examples of how we're driving that value through our integrated portfolio.In partnering with VillageMD, our team based healthcare delivery enhances adherence. We are building digital connections and standalone clinics. More than 30 in Arizona and Texas are now supported by Walgreens pharmacies virtually with more coming online in Georgia this summer. To make the virtual experience seamless, we're piloting a healthcare concierge program to provide extra care coordination. We are also exploring an integrated pharmacist ambulatory care model. The pilot has driven over 40% reduction in hospital readmissions over 30-days and a material A1C reduction in diabetic patients. Remember also that roughly 50% of patients have co-located VillageMD clinics opt to get their prescription filled at Walgreens. VillageMD co-located sites that have been open for over [Technical Difficulty] per day.CareCentrix and a leading national healthcare services provider are partnering to offer a turnkey durable medical equipment benefit management solution and point-of-care platform for health plans. This should drive medical and administrative savings, while improving the overall member experience. Shields and Walgreens are working together to establish Walgreens as the single contract pharmacy for health systems. Walgreens is also converting existing specialty pharmacy locations to Shield partners to increase access to specialty drugs and services. Finally, at Walgreens Health, we are exploring new healthcare service lines such as additional diagnostic services and data analytics and insights. We've already seen strong results with our at-home testing programs such as the one we conducted last fall with Blue Shield of California to boost patient access to colorectal cancer screening.Members due for screening had the opportunity to visit Walgreens Pharmacy locations across the state to pick up an at-home kit. The test completion rate was 50 percentage points higher when members chose pharmacy pickup, compared to those that received a kit in the mail. Based on these successful results, we are launching similar at-home testing programs with other payer partners. In summary, our healthcare and retail pharmacy businesses are working together to improved outcomes and lower cost as only Walgreens can do. I’m not satisfied by today's headline guidance revisions. However, I see the enterprise approach coming together to deliver sustainable value to consumers, to our partners and to shareholders. We have the right strategy. We are driving good progress across each of our strategic priorities and we are taking appropriate measures to account for the recent macroeconomic challenges and uncertainty.Through the necessary actions discussed today, we are pushing harder toward profitability with a strong sense of urgency, while continuing to reimagine local healthcare and wellness for all. With that, I'll hand it over to James to provide more color on our results and our outlook.Pharmacy, Medicine, HealthPhoto by freestocks on UnsplashJames Kehoe: Thank you, Roz, and good morning. In summary, while we returned to adjusted EPS growth in the third quarter, earnings were below our expectations. As we encountered lower COVID contributions, shifting consumer behaviors, and a recent slowdown in respiratory incidences. Overall, we delivered 8.9% sales growth on a constant currency basis ahead of our plan, led by our U.S. pharmacy business, up 10%. Our Boots U.K. retail business, which delivered a solid 13% comp and our scaling healthcare business, which added $1.4 billion in sales versus the prior year. Adjusted EPS increased 3.6% on a constant currency basis despite a 19 percentage point headwind due to a lower COVID-19 contribution and 8 percentage points from reduced ownership of AmerisourceBergen.These were partly offset by favorability’s from sale and leaseback, incentive accruals, and tax. All of these items net out to be a 4.7 percentage point headwind to EPS growth and this demonstrates overall good quality of earnings in the quarter. As Roz discussed, we are lowering our fiscal ‘23 adjusted EPS guidance to $4.00 to $4.05. This updated outlook reflects consumer and category trends, a lower contribution from COVID and an overall more cautious forward view given the continued macroeconomic uncertainty. Later, I will provide more color around the key assumptions underpinning our revised guidance. But first, let's look at the third quarter results in more detail. Adjusted operating income increased 0.6% on a constant currency basis.This included a 22 percentage point headwind from COVID-19 and a 7% drag from reduced AmerisourceBergen ownership, partly offset by sale and leaseback gains and incentive accruals. All of these items net out to an approximately 6% headwind to AOI growth. GAAP net earnings of $118 million declined a $171 million, compared to prior year. The current quarter included a $323 million after tax impairment charge related to pharmacy licenses in the U.K. Adjusted net earnings increased 3.4% on a constant currency basis to $860 million. Now let's move to the year-to-date highlights. Year-to-date sales increased 4.8% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EPS was down 20.7%, reflecting a lower COVID-19 contribution of 20 percentage points and reduced AmerisourceBergen ownership of 3 percentage points.GAAP earnings were a loss of $2.9 billion, compared to net earnings of $4.8 billion in 2022. With the current year including a $5.5 billion after tax charge for opioid related claims and lawsuits. Now let's move to the U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment. Sales increased 4.4% in the quarter with comp sales up 7%. Adjusted gross profit declined 3.2% year-on-year, reflecting a 5 percentage point negative impact from COVID-19, a 5% reduction in SG&amp;A expense more than offset the gross profit decline and led to AOI growth of 8.4% before the inclusion of AmerisourceBergen equity income. The sell down of our ABC stake led to a slight AOI decline of 0.4%. Let me now turn to U.S. Pharmacy. Pharmacy sales increased 6.3% and advanced 9.8% on a comparable basis, driven by both script growth and brand inflation.Excluding immunizations, comp scripts grew 2.8%, a slight deceleration from the prior quarter and reflecting broader prescription market trends. As expected, adjusted gross profit declined year-on-year, although excluding COVID, gross profit increased as script growth and lower cost of goods sold more than offset reimbursement pressure. Turning next to our U.S. retail business. Following several quarters of very good performance, the retail business encountered some headwinds in the third quarter as the consumer navigated through a difficult macroeconomic backdrop. Excluding tobacco, comp sales grew 0.2%, held back by 90 basis points due to holiday seasonal weakness as consumers pulled back on discretionary spending and 80 basis points due to lower sales of COVID-19 OTC test kits.We saw solid growth in grocery and household, up 4.7% and beauty, up 3.7%. Cough cold flu sales were flat, but slowed significantly in May, due to a decline in respiratory incidences. IQVIA fan data shows flu, cold and respiratory activity, down 8% in the third quarter, versus a 15% increase in the second quarter with May down in the mid-20% range. Following several consecutive quarters of year-on-year margin expansion, retail gross margin came under modest pressure in the third quarter. We've seen similar trends as the broader market with our promotional units, up around 7% in the most recent 13-week period. However, on a year-to-date basis, gross margin has increased by more than 100 basis points, driven by effective margin management. Turning next to the International segment and as always, I'll talk to constant currency numbers.The international segment continues to perform very well. Sales increased 7% with good growth across all international markets. Boots U.K. was up 10%, and Germany wholesale grew 4%. Adjusted operating income of $208 million increased 21%, despite a $40 million year-on-year headwind from sale and leaseback transactions. Let's now look in more detail at Boots U.K. Boots U.K. sales advanced 10%, pharmacy comp sales increased 6%, and comp retail sales grew 13%. And this comes on top of a 24% comp in the same quarter last year. Boots grew market share for the ninth consecutive quarter with gains across all categories. We successfully launched Future Renew, a range of innovative new skincare with very positive consumer response. This product line was recently launched in Walgreens.Boots.com sales grew 25% year-on-year, and have more than doubled versus the equivalent pre-COVID quarter. Over 14% of our U.K. retail sales now comes from Boots.com. Turning next to U.S. Healthcare. The U.S. Healthcare business continues to rapidly scale with sales reaching $2 billion more than doubling from the prior year, pro forma sales growth was 22%. VillageMD sales were $1.5 billion, up 22% on a pro forma basis. Legacy VillageMD growth was driven by expansion of the clinic footprint, with an additional 93 clinics opened in the past year and the ongoing maturation of existing clinics. Summit Health was, however, impacted by a weaker respiratory season that led to fewer CityMD visits and fewer referrals across the Summit Health Network.Shields delivered another strong quarter, up 35% and driven by contract wins, including the addition of six new health system partners and further expansion of existing partnerships. CareCentrix sales were approximately $360 million with pro forma sales growth of 15%. Adjusted EBITDA reflects weaker-than-expected results at VillageMD and Summit Health, partly offset by continued growth at Shields. CityMD has been impacted by lower visit volume, whereas the VillageMD EBITDA loss reflects new clinic expansions. We anticipate improvement in the fourth quarter as we build patient [tunnels] (ph) and traffic and align the cost profile with sales. Let's now look at some of the key metrics for the U.S. Healthcare Business. VillageMD managed 850,000 value based lives at quarter end, reflecting year-over-year growth of approximately 27% in the legacy VillageMD business and the addition of 309,000 value based lives from Summit.Total value based lives include 179,000 full risk lives. Our clinical trials business continues to expand with eight contracts signed and a robust pipeline. Turning next to cash flow. We generated $1.2 billion of operating cash flow, with free cash flow of $116 million. The year-over-year decline reflected lower earnings due to COVID-19, a lower contribution from working capital and increased capital expenditures related to growth initiatives. Looking ahead, we are reprioritizing capital projects to reduce plan spend and are rolling out of comprehensive set of working capital optimization initiatives to enhance our cash generation. Turning now to guidance. We are updating our full-year ‘23 adjusted EPS guidance $4.00 to $4.05, a constant currency decline of around 20%.Excluding the impact of COVID-19 and ForEx core adjusted EPS is flat to up 1%. The EPS contribution from COVID-19 is $0.23 lower than our original assumptions at the start of the year. At the beginning of the fiscal year, we expected 16 million vaccinations. And despite the spring booster recommendation, we have reduced our full-year expectations to 12.5 million vaccinations. COVID testing has decelerated at an even faster pace. Additionally, we have incorporated the impacts of a more cautious consumer outlook, leading to a $0.20 to $0.25 impact as we realign our fourth quarter sales and margin goals to reflect recent trends. Finally, while reducing our ownership stake in AmerisourceBergen has improved our debt position. It has, however, led to a $0.05 headwind.Let me now walk you through our assumptions for each of our business segments. Starting with U.S. Retail Pharmacy, we now project sales of around $110 billion, up low-single-digits year-on-year. AOI is projected at $3.8 billion to $3.9 billion, a decline of 22% to 24%, reflecting a 23 percentage point headwind from COVID-19 and 3 percentage points from our reduced ownership stake in AmerisourceBergen. Excluding these two impacts, AOI growth is up 2% to 4%. Turning next to the International segment, which is performing well this year. Sales are projected to grow 6% to 8% on a constant currency basis, reflecting strong execution, especially in the U.K. Adjusted operating income of around $900 million, represents constant currency growth of approximately 30%.This performance is towards the top end of our original expectations. Our revised outlook for U.S. Healthcare reflects lower visits at CityMD, the continued ramp up of new VillageMD sites and the slower integration of prior acquisitions into Summit's multi-specialty business. We expect sales of $6.3 billion to $6.8 billion, an increase of $4.8 billion versus prior year and growing approximately 25% on a pro form a basis. We are projecting an adjusted EBITDA loss of $340 million to $380 million, including the factors I mentioned earlier. While the profit performance so far this year has been below plan, rapid correction actions are underway, and we expect to drive sequential adjusted EBITDA improvement in the fourth quarter and beyond. Turning now to our corporate assumptions, our full-year tax rate is now expected to be around 12% and this basically reflects the favorability we have seen so far in fiscal ‘23, with some of the benefits reversing in the fourth quarter.More specifically, we expect the fourth quarter tax rate of around 23%. Full-year guidance of $4.00 to $4.05 implies fourth quarter EPS of approximately $0.70 to $0.75. The result is weighed down by a much higher average tax rate and the fourth quarter typically is the lowest to extrapolate the quarter. As such it would be incorrect to extrapolate the quarter as a proxy for 2024. First, normalizing for the tax rate would result in an additional $0.08 in the quarter. Second, seasonality impacts all of our businesses. Looking back over the past five years, and excluding the impact from COVID-19 and ABC, approximately 20% of our adjusted operating income comes in the fourth quarter. To conclude, adjusting the fourth quarter for tax rate, an accounting for seasonality would result in annual adjusted EPS of around $4 per share.Next, I would like to cover the key factors that will influence 2024 performance. Overall, we expect the long-term tailwinds to outweigh the near-term pressures. Some of the challenges we faced in fiscal ‘23 are expected to continue into ‘24. We do expect to see some continued weakness in consumer spending, together with moderate increases in labor costs. While reimbursement pressure has eased somewhat over the past 18 months, it is not going away and we will continue to identify way to offset the pressure. In addition we expect lower sale and leaseback activity in fiscal ‘24, and the tax rate will be higher as we lap a very favorable fiscal ‘23 performance and higher statutory tax rates are introduced in both the U.K. and Switzerland.However, we have multiple profit drivers and initiatives that will drive sustainable profit growth Our U.S. Healthcare business will be a significant profit driver, including the first full-year of Summit Health, a maturing VillageMD clinic profile and strong actions to accelerate their path to profitability. We expect continued script volume growth and strong contribution from front of store initiatives. These include own brand penetration gains and the further expansion of our successful category performance improvement program. Lastly, the transformational cost management program will deliver at least $800 million of savings next year. Next, let's take a deeper look into 2024. We expect fiscal 2024 adjusted operating income to grow low-to-mid-single-digits, led by the U.S. Healthcare segment and solid execution in U.S. Retail Pharmacy.We are expecting U.S. Healthcare to be the largest driver of total company AOI growth, as the business is rapidly gaining scale, and we will now accelerate the path to profitability. John Driscoll will provide much more color on the immediate actions we are taking to accelerate EBITDA delivery. We expect U.S. Retail Pharmacy AOI to be flat to down slightly, due to lower COVID contributions of approximately $290 million and a $260 million step down in sale and leaseback gains. Absent these items, we anticipate solid core growth led by transformational cost management program savings and expanding gross profit. Finally, we expect international AOI to decline year-on-year as we lap sizable real estate gains and lose the relatively small AOI contribution from the sale of our business in Chile.Core profit growth will be flat as the business manages through high levels of cost and labor inflation. That being said, our International business is well positioned for long-term success with market share gains and an advantaged and growing e-commerce presence. We do expect AOI growth to outpace EPS, due to a higher tax rate and non-controlling interest. Next, we'll look at U.S. Pharmacy in more detail. Excluding COVID, we expect to grow pharmacy gross profit. Underpinning the growth is our differentiated tech enabled operating model, which frees up capacity for pharmacists to spend more time on clinical programs and supporting our expanding pharmacy service offerings. We are projecting solid script growth benefiting from improved operating hours, increased access to lives and growth in specialty.We are integrating AllianceRx community-based specialty pharmacies and Shields under a new go-to-market strategy with a payer agnostic provider-centric approach. In addition, we have launched multiple programs across our pharmacy and U.S. healthcare business and continue to see engagement from payers and partners for clinical quality initiatives that leverage our integrated assets. Moving now to our U.S. Retail business. Gross profit growth will be driven by low-single-digit comp growth and continued margin improvement. We are creating significant value through category performance management, where assortment decisions should deliver at least $200 million of savings in fiscal 2024. We are accelerating our own brand penetration through innovation and increased points of distribution and display, our own brands have margins that are significantly higher than national brands.We are creating more value for consumers as we scale our e-commerce platform and evolve our store formats, including a new digital forward store concept and a health and wellness focused store with favorable early feedback on both concepts. Let me now hand it over to John to discuss our U.S. Healthcare strategy and profit growth drivers.John Driscoll: Good morning. As Roz and James outlined, while we're confident in the range and scale of our healthcare business, we are disappointed with the pace of our path to profitability. U.S. Healthcare missed targets due to VillageMD and CityMD underperformance. Directly related to reduce COVID, cold and flu season and softer market demand. We're taking immediate actions to drive improved profitability. We anticipate this year will remain a transition year as we take action to deliver value and drive profitability. We're rightsizing our cost structure, through optimizing overhead and revenue synergies to better match market demand. We're raising and accelerating synergy capture goals. We believe that we can enhance Village growth and value by focusing on gaining density in existing markets to accelerate VillageMD's path to profitability and supporting the integration of our digital assets with our VillageMD platform, and we continue to enhance our Village management team.We've recruited Rich Rubino, a seasoned healthcare CFO, to be the Chief Financial Officer of the combined VillageMD Summit Business. Longer term, we're implementing a high impact three-year plan to improve performance through an intense focus on operational excellence and cost optimization. Achieving our healthcare vision depends on each of our companies, delivering on their respective plans, and relentless execution of harvesting growth synergies across the Walgreens portfolio. We're building a differentiated value-based care delivery model that successfully integrates pharmacy and medical care for a value-based care market that will more than double by 2027. Walgreens has a unique right to win, with our reach, consumer engagement, and enterprise investments in primary care, specialty, and care to the home.We continue to see the enhanced value of our individual healthcare assets connected to our core Walgreens pharmacy to create value for patients, providers, and plans. A great example of that is our quickly scaling clinical trials recruiting business. Next, let me turn to Summit Health, where we see opportunity to drive meaningful AOI in U.S. Healthcare. While we are obviously disappointed with the pace of unlocking the full value of Summit and CityMD, we expect Summit to contribute materially to profit growth in fiscal year ‘24. Leveraging WBA, we will invest in targeted marketing campaigns to increase the patient base at CityMD sites. Our continued focus on operational excellence and cost optimization should continue to improve growth and synergies from prior acquisitions.Finally, we are raising and accelerating the synergy capture goal from $150 million in 2027 to $200 million in calendar year 2026. Turning to VillageMD. Over the last few months, we've slowed the pace of clinic openings in new markets. As we've studied their performance, we have refocused our growth plans to leverage regional density to support more profitable growth. To achieve our strategic objectives of better engagement and lower cost of care in a more cost effective manner, we are launching new virtual and asset light models. We've expanded our marketing efforts to support patient panel growth in our clinics and are working with new leadership to accelerate cost control. We continue to be impressed by the performance of our more mature VillageMD markets risk performance and are focused on continuing to accelerate the conversion of our fee for service lives to our proven risk based model.VillageMD is a high quality care delivery model. As James mentioned, most of our newer VillageMD clinics are at an early stage of development. But if we focus on the performance of our more mature Medicare Advantage markets, where we have achieved an appropriate level of market density, including Arizona, Georgia, and Houston, VillageMD has demonstrated the ability to bend the cost curve. We will focus on replicating this performance in other markets, as we convert fee for service volume to our risk based model. And we will also leverage our integrated care models with pharmacy and our other healthcare assets across the U.S. healthcare business. As part of our refocused U.S. healthcare approach, we aligned our go-to-market products for health systems and health plans under one team of seasoned healthcare executives with some encouraging short-term sales results noted on the slide.In summary, Walgreens remains the independent partner of choice for health plans and health systems through the combination of our legacy pharmacy platform with our portfolio of health assets. Our portfolio consistently delivers better outcomes at lower costs for plans, systems, and patients, which we believe is well suited to meet the demands of a healthcare market that is quickly moving from fee for service to fee for value. While there is clearly work to be done, we now have the leadership, plans, an organizational structure in place to rapidly advance our priorities. Now let me turn it back over to James.James Kehoe: Thanks, John. Capital allocation priorities remain focused on core business investments, debt pay down, and our dividend. We will continue to pursue disciplined returns-based organic investment in our core business. And we are simplifying our portfolio to unlock value and provide financial flexibility. We are very committed to maintaining our investment grade rating and our dividend. Now, let's take a quick look at the transformational cost management program. We are raising the cumulative 2024 savings target $4.1 billion and this is the sixth target increase since the program began. With $3.3 billion saved by the end of this year, we are projecting at least $800 million of savings in ‘24. Let me talk to a couple of the cost saving initiatives.We just completed an organization restructuring, which included transforming our headquarters to better align our resources with our strategic priorities. This led to the elimination of more than 500 roles, representing around 10% of our corporate and U.S. support office workforce. Our pharmacy of the future operating model will drive significant savings we're optimizing the model through our micro fulfillment centers, tech enabled centralization of in-store activities and telepharmacy solutions. These initiatives will also elevate the role of the pharmacists and improve patient engagement. Finally, we will continue to optimize our locations and opening hours and expect to close an additional 300 locations in the U.K. and 150 locations in the U.S. As you have seen, we are accelerating our portfolio optimization to further simplify the business, we have fully exited from our Option Care Health position with overall proceeds of $1.2 billion since August 2022.Let me also highlight our recent monetization of AmerisourceBergen shares using a variable prepaid forward structure. Under the VPF approach, there is no EPS dilution until the contracts mature. We continue to receive dividends and we retain some share price upside. Please note that the remaining stake in AmerisourceBergen is worth approximately $5 billion. With that, let me now pass it back to Roz for her closing comments.Roz Brewer: Thank you, James. Before we kick off Q&amp;A, let me sum up what you've heard. WBA has the right to win through our differentiated model and we have the right strategy in place. We are now entering the next phase of our healthcare transformation with aggressive actions in motion to improve profitability. We are addressing current challenges head on and moving at a pace to deliver long-term shareholder value. We have the scale. We have the skills. We have the sense of urgency. And we have the right plans to drive sustainable profit growth ahead. Now I'd like to open the line for questions.

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 81% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).And last week, institutional investors ended up benefitting the most after the company hit US$41b in market cap. The one-year return on investment is currently 0.9% and last week's gain would have been more than welcomed.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Archer-Daniels-Midland. View our latest analysis for Archer-Daniels-Midland ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Archer-Daniels-Midland?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Archer-Daniels-Midland. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Archer-Daniels-Midland's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Archer-Daniels-Midland. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 11% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.8% and 8.6%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 11 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Archer-Daniels-MidlandWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$249m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 18% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Archer-Daniels-Midland. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Archer-Daniels-Midland better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Archer-Daniels-Midland  that you should be aware of.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do.

It is wrestling with everything from job cuts and a global investment banking slump to reports of partner unrest and concerns about strategy.Even Solomon’s side gig as a DJ and his partial interest in a real estate company are subjects of scrutiny.Goldman spokesman Tony Fratto said Solomon ""and the entire leadership team are focused on delivering for clients and executing on our strategy"" and that the CEO has acted as a DJ at ""only a handful of events a year - and hasn’t in over a year.""As for any dissension among the partners, he said ""the reality is people can have disagreements"" and that’s ""normal.""Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Goldman is not the only big name on Wall Street under pressure.Firms with big investment banking and trading units have made or announced cuts of roughly 12,000 jobs since the end of 2022. Dealmaking is drying up amid a rise in interest rates, economic uncertainty and the failures of several sizable regional banks.Those cutting back include other Wall Street stalwarts such as Morgan Stanley (MS), Citigroup (C) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM).UBS, which also has a sizable presence on Wall Street, reportedly plans to cut 35,000 jobs at former rival Credit Suisse Group AG following an emergency takeover orchestrated by the Swiss government in March.These challenges are a reminder that the pain for the banking industry is still acute months after the failures of regional lenders Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic. And the giant banks that rely on mergers or IPO underwriting for sizable portions of their revenue have specific problems of their own.Story continues'Green shoots'The slowdown in dealmaking will come into sharper focus in a few weeks when the biggest institutions report their second-quarter results.Worldwide revenue from mergers and acquisitions for the first half of 2023 fell 38% compared to the same period last year, according to data from Refinitiv, amounting to the slowest first half for deal making since 2020.That follows a subpar first quarter when major banks advising on mergers or IPO underwriting reported sizable drops in fee revenue. The largest decrease of 26% belonged to Goldman. A hint at the possible results came this week when a smaller investment bank, Jefferies Financial Group (JEF), said its fiscal second-quarter revenue from investment banking plunged 26%, pulling down profit for the period.One bright spot, however, was that capital markets net revenue surged 30% to $543 million in the quarter. Jefferies also said that “the month of June has brought green shoots.”Many big banks have warned that trading revenue will also be down in the second quarter. That includes Goldman. Its chief operating officer, John Waldron, has said such revenue may fall 25%.Goldman is fighting this year to keep its title as the world's largest dealmaker. It was still ahead of rival JPMorgan through June 30, according to Dealogic, with a market share lead of 1%. Another data provider, Refinitiv, said Goldman trailed JPMorgan as of June 27.Winning 'cures all'It wasn't long ago that deal making was responsible for helping Goldman — and the rest of Wall Street — churn out record profits.The last boom came in 2021, when CEOs used surging markets as a reason to buy other companies, go public, or take on new debt. Through the period, Goldman Sachs dramatically outperformed rival firms, scoring its best year of revenue in its century and a half historyThen came a year that most of Wall Street would like to forget.In 2022, three major stock averages fell by the most since 2008 and bonds had their worst year on record. Inflation reached its highest level in four decades, triggering an aggressive series of interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.All of that new economic uncertainty curbed the optimism needed from the corporate clients that are the lifeblood of Wall Street's investment banking business. As a result, bonuses were slashed and jobs were cut.John Waldron, chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid (Brendan McDermid / reuters)Goldman recorded its second-highest annual revenue that year but it had a rough end to 2022, with profits down a whopping 69% in the final quarter amid a sharp decline in deal-making. In January of this year Goldman Sachs let go of roughly 3,000 employees, or 6% of its workforce.Solomon, facing shareholders at the end of February during the firm's second-ever investor day, admitted mistakes were made. ""I think we’ve accomplished a lot over the past few years. We got some things right, got some things wrong.""He dismissed chatter about mass partner exits, saying there were fewer partner transitions in 2022 than any other year going back to 2014.He also made it clear Goldman would be scaling back its prior ambitions to become a consumer banking giant (a project known as Marcus) and would instead look to lean more heavily on the steady, fee-generating business of wealth management. Goldman has sold some Marcus loans and will likely take a write down for a purchase of a fintech lender.""The culture of Goldman Sachs is incredibly strong,"" Solomon said on Feb. 28.Less than two weeks later Goldman found itself in the middle of another controversial situation when it tried to help Silicon Valley Bank raise capital while purchasing some of its securities. The events preceded a run on the regional bank that upended the banking world.Silicon Valley Bank was seized by regulators on March 10. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)A spokesman said Goldman informed Silicon Valley Bank in writing that it would not act as its adviser on the securities sale and recommended the bank hire a third-party financial adviser for that transaction. Federal officials are now reportedly investigating the role Goldman played in those final days.Devin Ryan, analyst for JMP Securities with an overweight rating on Goldman, predicted the firm would bounce back once markets and dealmaking recovers.“Goldman Sachs will disproportionately benefit when that happens,"" he told Yahoo Finance.Winning, said Wells Fargo banking analyst Mike Mayo, ""cures all.""""So if and when capital markets resume,"" he added, paychecks will go higher and ""I think employees will be a lot happier.”Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. Looking at TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX), it does have a high ROCE right now, but lets see how returns are trending.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on TJX Companies is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.27 = US$4.9b ÷ (US$29b - US$11b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023).Therefore, TJX Companies has an ROCE of 27%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 14% earned by companies in a similar industry. See our latest analysis for TJX Companies roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for TJX Companies compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsIn terms of TJX Companies' historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. While it's comforting that the ROCE is high, five years ago it was 45%. Meanwhile, the business is utilizing more capital but this hasn't moved the needle much in terms of sales in the past 12 months, so this could reflect longer term investments. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.Story continuesThe Bottom LineTo conclude, we've found that TJX Companies is reinvesting in the business, but returns have been falling. Since the stock has gained an impressive 90% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high.If you'd like to know about the risks facing TJX Companies, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should be aware of.If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.Have feedback on this article?

23,b8c98d46-a26d-3ff9-9e9c-e1e68b7a7d03,GD,2023-07-02,There's A Lot To Like About General Dynamics' (NYSE:GD) Upcoming US$1.32 Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/theres-lot-general-dynamics-nyse-120235780.html,1688212955,STORY,['GD'],"[General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Therefore, if you purchase General Dynamics' shares on or after the 6th of July, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 11th of August.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.32 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$5.28 to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, General Dynamics has a trailing yield of approximately 2.5% on its current stock price of $215.15. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. View our latest analysis for General Dynamics Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. That's why it's good to see General Dynamics paying out a modest 41% of its earnings. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Fortunately, it paid out only 47% of its free cash flow in the past year.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at General Dynamics, with earnings per share up 4.9% on average over the last five years. Earnings per share growth in recent times has not been a standout. However, companies that see their growth slow can often choose to pay out a greater percentage of earnings to shareholders, which could see the dividend continue to rise.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the last 10 years, General Dynamics has lifted its dividend by approximately 10.0% a year on average. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.To Sum It UpIs General Dynamics worth buying for its dividend? Earnings per share growth has been growing somewhat, and General Dynamics is paying out less than half its earnings and cash flow as dividends. This is interesting for a few reasons, as it suggests management may be reinvesting heavily in the business, but it also provides room to increase the dividend in time. We would prefer to see earnings growing faster, but the best dividend stocks over the long term typically combine significant earnings per share growth with a low payout ratio, and General Dynamics is halfway there. General Dynamics looks solid on this analysis overall, and we'd definitely consider investigating it more closely.While it's tempting to invest in General Dynamics for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved. For example, we've found 1 warning sign for General Dynamics that we recommend you consider before investing in the business.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

Sure, people shouldn’t aspire to philanthropy to enhance their own wealth; that sort of defeats the purpose. Nevertheless, you can kill two birds with one stone (literally, I guess) with renewability-oriented enterprises.First, let’s get into the facts. According to Precedence Research, the global renewable energy market size reached a valuation of $1.03 trillion in 2022. Further, experts in the field anticipate that the sector will expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.6% from 2022 to 2030. At the culmination of the forecast period, the industry will hit just under $2 trillion. That’s a great reason to consider top renewable energy stocks to buy.Another factor to keep in mind is the political pivot. While hydrocarbons will likely remain relevant for decades to come, policymakers have stressed the importance of addressing climate change. Therefore, renewable energy stocks with upside potential benefit from a burgeoning narrative.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTo be sure, no guarantees exist in the market. Nevertheless, if you want to improve your odds of success, buy these renewable energy stocks.NEENextEra Energy$74.17SEDGSolarEdge$243.65PLUGPlug Power$9.20NextEra Energy (NEE)Person holding the glowing world in their hands with icons with different types of energy. Top energy stocks for high returnsSource: PopTika / ShutterstockTo be fair, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) might not be the most accelerative entity among high-potential renewable energy stocks. As one of the vanguards of the renewable energy space, new market participants will require patience with NEE. Nevertheless, that patience should be rewarded thanks to its massive footprint. Featuring both wind turbines and solar power networks, NEE represents a confidence booster.However, NextEra also offers room for speculation. Since the beginning of this year, NEE fell more than 10%. In the trailing one-year period, it’s down almost 3%. Over time, the red ink should transition back into the black given the aforementioned industry forecast of the renewable sector. Therefore, it’s a solid pick among top renewable energy stocks to buy.Story continuesFinancially, NextEra’s main strength lies in its consistent profitability. For example, its trailing-year net margin clocks in at 26.97%, outpacing 91.22% of companies listed in the regulated utilities space.Finally, analysts peg NEE as a moderate buy. Their average price target comes in at $89.40, implying 19% growth. It’s not the most exciting idea but it belongs on a list of renewable energy stocks with upside potential.SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG)Solar penny stocks: a close up of a solar cell farmSource: Fit Ztudio / ShutterstockBased in Israel, SolarEdge Technologies (NASDAQ:SEDG) develops and sells solar investors for photovoltaic arrays, energy generation monitoring software and battery energy storage products.

SolarEdge features a presence in Germany, Italy, Japan and the U.S.While an enticing bet among high-potential renewable energy stocks, it’s also incredibly risky. Think of SEDG as an effort to launch a grand slam rather than batting a run or two in with a well-placed hit. Since the beginning of this year, SEDG slipped over 14%. Worryingly, shares have suffered a severe loss of momentum recently. Just in the trailing five sessions, they’re down more than 9%.At the same time, SEDG could be one of the best stocks in renewable energy sector for speculation. Financially, it features fiscal stability (an Altman Z-Score of 5.88) and a strong revenue growth trend.Lastly, analysts peg SEDG as a consensus strong buy. Out of 13 analysts, only one failed to issue a buy rating. Overall, the average price target clocks in at $387.23, implying over 58% upside.Plug Power (PLUG)An image of a hydrogen fueling station against a blue sky. Best Hydrogen Energy StocksSource: DesignRage / Shutterstock.comAnother risky enterprise among high-potential renewable energy stocks, Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) has been fascinating throughout the post-pandemic new normal. At one point, shares on an average weekly basis were flying toward the $70 level. At the moment, they trade hands at less than $10. So, you have a relative discount here, which might entice speculators once again.Fundamentally, Plug Power intrigues because of its green hydrogen specialty. By green, we’re talking about hydrogen that can be generated by renewable resources like wind and solar energy. If successful, Plug Power may facilitate national energy security while simultaneously addressing climate change. That’s what makes PLUG one of the top renewable energy stocks to buy for gamblers.Nevertheless, it’s quite the gamble. According to Gurufocus, PLUG suffers from six red flags and no compelling positives to balance out the pessimism. One of the most worrying stats is that the company continues to issue new debt.At the same time, analysts peg PLUG as a moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $18.42, implying over 90% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Credit: Bloomberg NewsWASHINGTON — The Bank of New York Mellon's ability to expand its custody business for cryptocurrencies and other digital assets could be hampered by an accounting bulletin published last year by the Securities and Exchange Commission. It's a problem BNY Mellon didn't initially see coming, according to a regulatory filing obtained by American Banker.BNY Mellon — the country's oldest bank — announced its new business line in October of 2022. Earlier that year, the SEC released Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, which requires that custodians of digital assets record them on their balance sheets, raising questions about the feasibility for banks — especially those like BNY Mellon that specialize in trust services — to scale up their digital-asset custody business.For BNY Mellon, that roadblock wasn't identified until after the bank had already moved toward establishing its digital-asset custody business. The bank's application with the New York State Department of Financial Services to hold digital assets, recently obtained by American Banker, as well as the bank's earnings statements, shed light on a timeline that stretches from before the SEC released its bulletin to roughly the time BNY Mellon went live with its product, showcasing an early conflict between the SEC and BNY Mellon's understanding of how digital assets would be treated on banks' balance sheets.BNY Mellon's challenges could be an indicator that having to hold capital against digital assets is a deal breaker for other banks seeking to wade into crypto custody. While BNY Mellon is the first global systemically important bank to do so, State Street has tried to break into the business with an external technology provider, and other large banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, have signaled interest in cryptocurrency more generally.BNY Mellon told the New York State Department of Financial Services that digital assets held by the bank as a custodian would not be recorded on its balance sheet, similar to the way it treats more traditional assets, according to a copy of BNY Mellon's application, obtained by American Banker via a public records request.Story continues""The Bank aims to support the [Digital Assets Custody] product pursuant to the same general considerations regarding financial administration including, accounting treatment, liquidity and capital management, regulatory reporting, corporate tax, and billing as it does with the custody and safekeeping of traditional assets,"" the bank said in the application.""The Bank will adhere to the U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ('GAAP') and International Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRS'), which advise that digital assets held at a custodian are not to be reported on the balance sheet and only the associated fiat currency balances need to be reported,"" the bank continued.While the date of the application is redacted, footnote citations that denote the access date of various online sources date as late as Dec. 14, 2021. SAB 121 was released a few months later in March 2022.BNY Mellon declined to comment on the date of the application, and on how the SEC's accounting bulletin affects the banks' future plans for its digital asset custody business.""We have always complied with SAB 121's requirements,"" a BNY Mellon spokesperson said in a statement.The SEC declined to comment.The accounting bulletin shows up in BNY Mellon's financial statements multiple times after the SEC published it. In August — before BNY Mellon announced that it would custody crypto assets — the bank said that it was ""evaluating"" how the bulletin would apply to digital asset custody.""This guidance was effective for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2022, with retrospective application as of the beginning of the fiscal year to which the interim or annual period relates,"" BNY Mellon said in its second-quarter earnings statement, released in August 2022. ""Currently, BNY Mellon does not hold in custody any assets that would be impacted by the standards of SAB 121. We are currently evaluating the applicability and impact of SAB 121 to our digital asset custody initiatives.""In November — the first earnings report after BNY Mellon announced that it would custody crypto and other digital assets — the bank changed its tune.""We adopted the guidance in the third quarter of 2022 and recorded a de minimis asset and liability related to digital assets we safeguard,"" the bank said in its third quarter earnings, released in early November.In the bank's annual report, BNY Mellon said that as of the end of 2022 it still recorded a trivial amount in digital asset custody.Because BNY Mellon says it holds such a small amount of digital assets in custody that it's immaterial to its balance sheet, SAB 121 wouldn't have much of an impact on the business, experts said.Chris Odinet, a law professor at the University of Iowa who studies consumer finance and cryptocurrency regulation, said that the small scale of the digital asset custody business at BNY was likely baked in from an early point after the SEC released its bulletin. Instead, the bank likely sees the brand value of offering a wider suite of products that includes digital assets, he said.""They're just saying they're doing this, we offer this to our customers, knowing full well that not very many of their customers would have the interest and the sufficient capital to really be trading these things to such a large degree that it would really hinder the bank's ability to make money,"" he said. ""So it's like, 'Look, we're doing this, we're on the vanguard,' but kind of knowing that it's a lot of smoke and mirrors.""The SEC's guidance is, however, likely a deterrent for any bank that wants to grow crypto custody into a larger business, including at BNY Mellon.""The leverage ratio would be the bigger impact for banks, they would have to hold capital for it,"" said Lee Reiners, a lecturing fellow at Duke Law and the Duke Financial Economics Center. ""I think it will factor into other banks' decisions as to whether to provide this service.""As BNY Mellon points out, banks aren't typically required to put assets held in custody on their balance sheets in a way that would trigger leverage ratios and capital requirements.Whether or not crypto assets are, at their core, similar to more traditional ones is at the heart of a broader debate between banks and the SEC. The agency has a new proposed rule out for comment, which banks, including BNY Mellon, strongly oppose, saying that the rule would overhaul custody banking.""What people are trying to figure out is how much the safeguarding of crypto assets is whether it looks like a bank account or whether it looks like a safety deposit box,"" said Bryan Routledge, an associate professor of finance at the Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon University. ""The accounting statement is saying, no, no, if you have the keys you own the asset in the same way as if you had taken that $10 bill and handed it to the teller, you no longer own that $10 bill, you now have a liability from the bank where they are going to give you that money back.""BNY Mellon's comment letter on the SEC's proposal recommends that the SEC withdraw SAB 121, arguing that the SEC's proposal both encourages banks to develop safe ways to custody digital assets, while at the same time SAB 121 de facto limits their ability to do so.""On the one hand, the Proposal invites custodians to develop 'innovative safeguarding procedures' for digital assets and sets a pathway for banks to do so in a manner that mitigates the risks on which SAB 121 is premised,"" said Roman Regelman, BNY's head of securities services and digital, in their comment letter from May. ""On the other hand, banks cannot practically serve as qualified custodians for digital assets in any sufficient scale if they are still subject to the threshold limitations of SAB 121 by function of requiring custodied digital assets to be reflected on their balance sheets.""On some level, crypto assets and traditional assets don't pose the same risks, and there is a reasonable argument for treating them differently, said John Sedunov, an associate professor of finance at Villanova University in the School of Business. Specifically, crypto can present higher technological operational risks.Unlike, for example, a stock certificate sitting in a bank's safety deposit box, a stolen or hacked cryptocurrency could be lost forever, rather than recovered or otherwise returned to its rightful owner. The scale and speed at which this could happen is also much faster compared to most traditional assets that might be held in custody, he said.""That presents a unique set of risks that you don't see in other assets,"" he said. ""So it's worth a harder look at digital assets. Do we need to be draconian about it? Maybe not.""]"

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 75% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Lockheed Martin. Check out our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Lockheed Martin?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Lockheed Martin does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Lockheed Martin's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Lockheed Martin. State Street Global Advisors, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 15% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.7% and 6.6%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 15 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Lockheed MartinThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Lockheed Martin Corporation. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$95m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 24% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

Better, it  now it appears that a number of his other initiatives are starting to bear fruit. Providing evidence for that assertion, the firm’s operating margin is expected to jump to 3.9% this year from 2.4% in 2022, and the revenue of its cloud unit is expected to accelerate “in the fourth quarter,” according to Jefferies, an investment bank.  Moreover, the bank expects Amazon’s AI initiatives to boost its cloud business over the longer term.Similarly, another investment bank, Loop Capital expects the cloud unit to “bottom in the next 2-quarters” and expects the unit’s top line to get a boost from its AI “preparedness.”InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsiCAD (ICAD)Source: ShutterstockDana Brown became CEO of iCAD (NASDAQ:ICAD) in March.

As a result of the battle, Illumina’s former chairman lost his position.deSouza was trying to fight U.S. and European regulators in an effort to merge GRAIL, which has developed a successful blood test for about 50 types of cancer, with Illumina. I’m hopeful that the new CEO, who has not yet been hired, will find a way to spin GRAIL off to the owners of ILMN stock. I expect GRAIL to be a very profitable company down the road, given the life-saving blood test that it has developed.According to a ” discounted cash flow analysis” carried out by Seeking Alpha columnist Jishan Hidu,  the shares are worth $253.94, well above their current price of around $200.Alibaba (BABA)Alibaba sign on orange background in office space.

A photo of a cup of coffee and some coffee beans and a towel on a wooden table.Source: Evgeny Karandaev/ShutterStock.comLaxman Narasimhan took over as CEO of Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) in March.  Narasimhan has an impressive resume, as, after spending 20 years with the top-notch consulting firm, McKinsey,  he was CEO of Pepsi’s (NYSE:PEP) Latin American unit and its Chief Commercial Officer. He later became CEO of Lysol maker Reckitt. At the end of his leadership of the latter company, it was reportedly “just getting its mojo back.”Before becoming Starbucks CEO, he was given “”a unique immersion experience” there, visiting many parts of its operations.Starbucks could use some more  mojo, as  analysts, on average, expect its 2023 earnings per share to come in at $3.43 just 6% above its 2018 EPS of $3.24.  Additionally, an expected deceleration of China’s growth in the second half of the year and intense competition in the Asian country’s retail coffee sector may undermine Starbucks’ overall financial results going forward.On the company’s fiscal Q2 earnings call in April, Narasimhan noted that he plans to implement “efficiencies in (Starbucks’) supply chain, support systems and processes.” He added that he was seeking “to evolve and modernize (the company’s) brand,… business,… capabilities and….culture… by getting back to its basics.” The new CEO also plans to have the company “nurture the limitless possibilities of human connection,”  add new components to the firm’s digital offerings, while implementing “a more global presence.”Some of the new CEO’s plans sound vague,. but it will be interesting to see how they materialize and affect the company’s performance.Nikola (NKLA)An electric semi truck charging.Source: Scharfsinn / Shutterstock.comMichael Lohscheller became CEO of Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) in Jan. 2023 after serving as president of the company, which makes battery-elecric trucks and trucks powered by hydrogen fuel cells. As president of Nikola, Lohscheller helped the firm start producing its Tre battery-electric truck and move the company’s fuel-cell vehicle forward.Before joining NKLA, Lohscheller was CEO of European automaker Opel, which  “he led… to sustainable profitability and oversaw its transformation into a leading electrified car brand,” Nikola reported. He was named “Manager of the Year” by the magazine Auto Zeitung  in 2019.The CEO’s credentials are rather impressive, and I have long believed in Nikola’s tremendous potential due to the strong use case for fuel cell trucks and the firm’s top-notch partners.Lohscheller is sensibly trying to focus Nikola on achieving only a few major goals, as he’s eliminated many of its previous initiatives.“We like the strategic focus and view [Nikola’s fuel cell truck] as a differentiated product,” investment bank TD Cowen wrote recently. Although the firm lowered its rating on the shares to “hold” from “buy,” citing capital constraints, macro issues, and investor sentiment, I believe that NKLA can do great things with Lohscheller at the helm.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer held LONG positions in XPEV,NKLA,GE, ILMN, and ICAD.

Listen, nobody likes talking about this subject because, psychologically, it’s akin to hurting puppies. And if there’s one thing you don’t do in America, it’s hurting puppies. There will be perdition to pay for such evil and for what it’s worth, I stand by such sentiment 100%.However, when it comes to the topic of high-risk value stocks, the most important rule for investors is to look out for yourself. Sure, I suppose a certain level of nobility and honor exists in holding the line. But whose line are you holding? Believe me, these C-level suits – you know, CEOs, CFOs, CIOs, etc. – wouldn’t give a you-know-what about dumping hot potatoes on you. So, you should do it first.Another reason to target value stocks with high risk is the underlying nature of this asset class. By definition, value stocks represent securities that are discounted against some fundamental metric. That lulls investors into complacency. However, it’s important to realize that even value plays can get overheated.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSo, look out for number one and avoid overvalued value stocks.Church &amp; Dwight (CHD)Figurines of two little men in suits looking at downward stock arrow going through the floorSource: shutterstock.com/Black SalmonIncluding Church &amp; Dwight (NYSE:CHD) on this list of overvalued value stocks to sell pains me because I’ve written positive coverage about CHD before. As a consumer goods giant, the company makes sense, especially under this ambiguous market environment. Also, it used to be great value, providing a modest dividend for your troubles. Unfortunately, it might not be a stellar buy anymore.Since the start of the year, CHD soared to just under 19%. I think that’s a significant factor to consider because it outpaces the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index, which gained 14.58% during the same period. Also, I’m not seeing the justification for the premium based on its financial performances.Story continuesFor example, Church &amp; Dwight’s three-year revenue growth rate (on a per-share basis) pings at a modestly positive 8.1%. However, CHD trades at 4.38 times trailing-12-month (TTM) sales, which ranks worse than 87% of its peers. So, unless you see a bullish hysteria for baking soda, CHD ranks among the high-risk value stocks.Cintas (CTAS)Death: grim reaper in black cloakSource: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Mason, Ohio, Cintas (NASDAQ:CTAS) provides a range of products and services to businesses. These include mundane but important items such as uniforms, mats, mops, cleaning and restroom supplies, first aid and safety products, fire extinguishers and testing and safety courses. It’s boring as heck, which traditionally makes it a solid value play. But not anymore.Since the start of the year, CTAS gained almost 9%. In the trailing one-year period, CTAS soared to nearly 33%. Now, some of the enthusiasm is justified based on the broad push among companies recalling their employees back to offices. However, I’m not entirely sure if the premium makes sense, making it a possible candidate for overvalued value stocks to sell.For example, Cintas’ three-year revenue growth rate pings at 5.7%, beating out 57.26% of its peers. It’s not awe-inspiring but it’s not bad. However, the market prices CTAS at a TTM sales multiple of 5.87. That definitely is bad. According to Gurufocus, this stat ranks worse than 88.8% of the competition. So, CTAS represents one of the value stocks with high risk.Equifax (EFX)little girl holding a stock chart with athumbs down. stocks to avoidSource: ShutterstockBasically the Houston Astros of the business world, I don’t feel bad labeling Equifax (NYSE:EFX) as one of the overvalued value stocks to sell. Yes, I’m referring to the data breach incident. And yes, the incident does live “rent free” in my head, as the kids like to say. Honestly, the matter should live rent free in every Americans’ head.Anyways, Equifax historically could make an argument as a value play. As a dividend provider and a credit reporting agency, it provides necessary services to the public. Fundamentally, the business offers predictability, which represents one of the hallmarks of a value-based investment. However, after flying over 24% in the trailing year, EFX might be one of the high-risk value stocks.Specifically, Equifax may offer strong financial stats, with three-year revenue and book growth rates of 13.1% and 14.9%, respectively. However, investors must now pay 31.33 times forward earnings. This stat ranks worse than 87.94% of its peers. Ahead of an uncertain economic environment, you should sell these overpriced value stocks like EFX.Quanta Services (PWR)a frustrated man with a white board behind him that features a black downward arrowSource: ShutterstockBased in Houston, Texas, Quanta Services (NYSE:PWR) provides infrastructure services for electric power, pipeline, industrial and communications industries. Its capabilities include the planning, design, installation, program management, maintenance and repair of most types of network infrastructure. It’s beautiful, relevant and boring as stink. Traditionally, you would look to something like Quanta Services for discounted value plays.You’re not looking at Quanta anymore for those discounts. Since the beginning of the year, PWR gained 35% of equity value. In the past 365 days, shares skyrocketed to nearly 57% up. It just continues to move higher and higher. However, at some point, the air will likely come out of this rally, making it one of the overvalued value stocks to sell.Sure, I get that Quanta enjoys a three-year revenue growth rate of 12%, outflanking 75.73% of its peers. At the same time, it features a sales multiple of 1.62, which ranks worse than nearly 75% of the competition. Also, you’d be paying over 26 times forward earnings, representing an 89% premium over the sector median of 14.01 times.Rollins (ROL)earningsSource: ShutterstockA North American pest control company, Rollins (NYSE:ROL) would easily qualify as a value play candidate. Generally speaking, few people enjoy having bugs in the house. At the same time, pest control isn’t exactly a growth industry. According to Fortune Business Insights, the global pest control industry will see a compound annual growth rate of 6.31% between 2020 and 2027. That’s not scintillating stuff.But now, it’s quite possible that ROL got ahead of itself. Since the January opener, shares gained nearly 14% of equity value. In the trailing one-year period, they’re up almost 22%. Don’t get me wrong, Rollins has expanded, with a three-year sales growth rate of 10.1% beating out 78.12% of its peers. At the same time, you’d be paying 7.43 times trailing sales, which ranks worse than 92.3% of the field.Also, bear in mind that by acquiring ROL, you’re also paying over 47 times forward earnings. This stat ranks worse than 92.86% of the underlying industry. That’s why ROL may be one of the overvalued value stocks to sell.COPEL (ELP)a keyboard with a greet enter key marked sell, representing overvalued stocks to sellSource: ShutterstockBased in Brazil, COPEL (NYSE:ELP) is an electric utility company. Levered to the exciting Latin America market, ELP admittedly features some growth elements. However, the fundamental nature of COPEL carries a value profile. Utilities generally don’t have exciting growth prospects. Instead, the motif centers on predictability.Unfortunately, ELP may have gotten ahead of itself. Occasionally, discounted enterprises with predictable businesses become overheated and that’s why you avoid overvalued value stocks. It’s possible that disappointed investors can quickly dump out of shares. Certainly, you don’t want to end up holding the bag on a play like this. Over the past year, ELP gained over 24%, which is a bit rich for a utility trade.Moving onto the financials, COPEL enjoys a three-year revenue growth rate of 11.4%, beating out 66.67% of rivals. However, investors must pay 109.18 times trailing earnings for the privilege. Also, ELP’s price-earnings-growth (PEG) ratio is 11.14 times, worse than 86.38% of the field. Therefore, it’s one of the value stocks with high risk.Installed Building Products (IBP)sell written on a chalkboard representing overvalued stocks to sellSource: ShutterstockHailing from Columbus, Ohio, Installed Building Products (NYSE:IBP) is the premier installation contractor for insulation for residential and commercial builders. According to its website, Installed Building employes over 10,000 workers who serve more than 220 locations nationwide. Under normal circumstances, IBP would historically qualify as a value play for its steady, relevant business. However, circumstances have gotten out of control.Since the start of the year, IBP gained over 47% of equity value. In the trailing one-year period, shares bounced up nearly 61%. Fundamentally, I’m cautious over the Federal Reserve and its hint that policymakers could raise interest rates. If so, that might kill the housing market and would likely lead to less insulation demand.To be fair, Installed Building gained handsomely from the Covid-19 crisis, delivering a three-year revenue growth rate of 22.3%. This stat beats out 83.17% of sector rivals. At the same time, investors must pay 16.5 times forward earnings for the privilege. That’s worse than 82.86% of the competition, making IBP one of the overvalued value stocks to sell.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Kirby last week blamed the FAA for recent flight cancellations.United Airlines is also working with Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to get more gates, Kirby said, adding that the company would have to further change or reduce its schedule give itself more spare gates and buffer, particularly during storm season.""Airlines can plan for things like hurricanes, sub-zero temperatures and snowstorms, but United has never seen an extended limited operating environment like the one we saw this past week at Newark,"" Kirby said in a note to employees.(Reporting by Anirudh Saligrama in Bengaluru; Editing by David Gregorio)]"

This makes the dividend yield 3.3%, which is above the industry average. Check out our latest analysis for Target Target's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsWe like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. At the time of the last dividend payment, Target was paying out a very large proportion of what it was earning and 409% of cash flows. Paying out such a high proportion of cash flows certainly exposes the company to cutting the dividend if cash flows were to reduce.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 104.3%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 39%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendTarget Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $1.44, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $4.40. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 12% per annum over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.Target May Find It Hard To Grow The DividendInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Although it's important to note that Target's earnings per share has basically not grown from where it was five years ago, which could erode the purchasing power of the dividend over time. There are exceptions, but limited earnings growth and a high payout ratio can signal that a company has reached maturity. That's fine as far as it goes, but we're less enthusiastic as this often signals that the dividend is likely to grow slower in the future.Story continuesIn SummaryOverall, this is probably not a great income stock, even though the dividend is being raised at the moment. With cash flows lacking, it is difficult to see how the company can sustain a dividend payment. We don't think Target is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus.Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 4 warning signs for Target that investors need to be conscious of moving forward.

Pedott is also credited with making popular the light-switch gizmo The Clapper.Remembered as a ""legend"" by longtime colleague Michael Hirsch, Pedott turned the once money-losing Chia Pet product into a profitable business with cultural relevance.A pro at selling products through unforgettable slogans, Pedott’s approach to finding hit items and subsequent advertisements was straightforward: ""Keep it fun, simple, and add value,"" Hirsch told Yahoo Finance by phone. Hirsch worked alongside Pedott for over 40 years.And that philosophy paid off. The sprout-growing terracotta figurine is among America’s best-selling items with more than 25 million sold in the US to date.Joseph Pedott, the marketing guru behind the Chia Pet and the Clapper, died on June 22 at the age of 91.Hirsch added: ""He was very good at watching his return on investment (ROI), always making sure there was a path to future returns at the end of the day.""Pedott started his career as a student at the University of Illinois. In 1955, he founded the agency Pedott &amp; Peters. It was there that he first worked on TV commercials. But it wasn’t until years later while in search of new clients that he learned of the powerhouse potential of Chia Pets.After being dismissed as a 'stupid item' by the head of sales of a leading drugstore chain, Pedott found untapped value in the product, later telling the University of Illinois alumni publication it ""just needed better advertising.""Soon after, Pedott offered (and bought) the rights to the Chia Pet from its importer Walter Houston and, according to Hirsch, ""threw away everything but the product.""Pedott moved manufacturing to Tecate, Mexico, rebranded the figurine, and with his unique and unparalleled advertising approach, debuted the Chia Ram in 1982. The debut marked the first widely distributed Chia Pet under the newly created Joseph Enterprises Inc.Story continuesMore plant-growing animal figurines followed, which ultimately led the company to its first big licensing deal: Warner Bros. Looney Tunes characters.For years, Pedott ran Joseph Enterprises Inc., where he not only turned the Chia Pet into a household name, but The Clapper light switch as well — a design first sold in 1985 and made memorable by its catchy ""Clap on, Clap Off"" TV commercial.Both products are archived in the Smithsonian, and the Chia Pet is also included in the New York Times time capsule, to be opened in the year 3000.Pedott sold his business to the National Entertainment Collectibles Association in 2018, a global distributor of licensed consumer products. According to Hirsch, that deal helped keep Chia Pet 'relevant,' and kept Pedott’s legacy alive.""The success is all because of his vision and determination to keep moving forward,"" Hirsch said. ""His reputation is for being a hard but fair negotiator. People would always walk away from doing business with Joe with a smile…He wanted to make sure everyone was winning.""And in the process, Pedott won too.Seana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

41,f1ad25f4-208c-3837-a68d-a26611dc6195,MAR,2023-07-02,Threat of a hotel worker strike looms over Los Angeles on a packed July 4 weekend,LA Times,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/threat-hotel-worker-strike-looms-022542306.html,1688264742,STORY,['MAR'],"[Southern California hotel workers walk a picket line Sunday in downtown Los Angeles after thousands walked off the job, demanding higher pay and better benefits. (Genaro Molina/Los Angeles Times)For the record:7:16 p.m. July 3, 2023: An earlier version of this story said 62 Unite Here Local 11 contracts representing workers at Southern California hotel sites expired Friday at midnight. 61 contracts expired.Thousands of workers at hotels across Southern California walked off the job Sunday, demanding higher pay and better benefits and beginning what could be the largest U.S. strike for the industry in recent memory.The strike affects roughly 15,000 cooks, room attendants, dishwashers, servers, bellmen and front-desk agents at hotels in Los Angeles and Orange counties, including the JW Marriott in the L.A. Live entertainment district and luxury destinations like the Fairmont Miramar in Santa Monica.“Our members were devastated first by the pandemic, and now by the greed of their bosses,” Kurt Petersen, co-president of Unite Here Local 11 said in a statement Sunday morning. “The industry got bailouts while we got cuts. Now, the hotel negotiators decided to take a four-day holiday instead of negotiating. Shameful.”The union represents more than 32,000 hospitality workers across Southern California and Arizona. The union, which has been negotiating for a new contract since April, has pushed for higher pay for members — a $5 immediate hourly wage increase and a $3 boost annually for three years — to cover rising costs in the region.The strike, which is expected to last for several days, is the latest labor effort in Southern California, where workers across multiple industries say inflation and high housing costs have made it untenable to live and provide for families.More than 500 workers at the InterContinental and Indigo hotels in downtown Los Angeles were the first to join the strike, taking to the streets with picket signs at 6 a.m. Sunday. Workers at the DoubleTree by Hilton and the Biltmore Los Angeles downtown soon joined the walkout, along with those from the Laguna Cliffs Marriott Resort &amp; Spa in Dana Point, workers said.Story continuesMetro bus drivers and motorists honked their horns in support of the workers who had gathered outside the InterContinental early Sunday. Music in Spanish blasted next to a tent with doughnuts and coffee as strikers in red Unite Here Local 11 shirts checked in for shifts.“I couldn’t sleep last night,” said Diana Rios Sanchez, a supervisor and former room attendant at the InterContinental.Workers chanted, “Únete, únete — a la lucha únete!” (Join, join, join the fight, join!) as they marched on the sidewalk near the hotel entrances.Attendees of Anime Expo — the largest anime convention in North America, which kicked off Saturday — passed the striking workers on the way to the Los Angeles Convention Center. Some waved in support.At the InterContinental, staff cuts during the pandemic resulted in fewer workers doing more, Sanchez said. At the same time, healthcare and other costs have continued to rise.""Before, we had 800 [people]. Now we have 500,"" Sanchez said. ""Now we're basically doing the job of two or three.""Contracts expired Friday at midnight at 61 Southern California hotel sites where workers are represented by Unite Here Local 11. At least 17 of those hotels experienced work stoppages Sunday, including Hotel Figueroa and the Proper Hotel in downtown L.A. and the W in Westwood. Santa Monica hotels affected by the strike include Le Meridien Delfina, Hampton Inn &amp; Suites and the Viceroy. Workers at Courtyard by Marriott locations in downtown and Santa Monica are also striking.L.A. Councilman Kevin de León said he is solidly on the side of the employees. The son of a single mother, an immigrant and hotel worker, said he knows how hard the work is for this group that lives in the ""lowest economic strata.""""I believe that our city's economy is built on the hotel workers. … They are the backbone, the drivers of our economy,"" he said. ""To many people, hotel workers are viewed as expendable in a job that nobody wants. And I believe that cannot be further from the truth.""The union Wednesday evening landed a deal with its biggest employer, the Westin Bonaventure Hotel &amp; Suites in downtown L.A., with more than 600 workers. Union officials described the tentative agreement as a major win for workers. Bonaventure employees will receive higher wages, affordable health insurance and increases in pension contributions. The agreement also guarantees a restoration of cleaning staff to pre-pandemic levels.However, talks with other hotels have stalled. A coalition of more than 40 hotels involved in negotiations blasted the union Friday in an emailed statement, accusing its leaders of canceling a scheduled bargaining session and refusing to come to the table.Unite Here Local 11 ""has not budged from its opening demand two months ago of up to a 40% wage increase and an over 28% increase in benefit costs,"" the hotel group said. ""From the outset, the Union has shown no desire to engage in productive, good faith negotiations with this group.""Keith Grossman, an attorney with Hirschfeld Kraemer, one of two legal firms representing the hotel coalition, took issue with the union's support for certain policy proposals, including a measure set for the 2024 ballot that would require hotels in Los Angeles to rent vacant rooms to homeless people.Grossman said the coalition has offered meaningful wage increases, proposing raises of $2.50 an hour in the first 12 months and $6.25 over four years. Under its proposal, housekeepers at unionized hotels in Beverly Hills and downtown Los Angeles, currently earning $25 per hour, would receive 10% wage increases in 2024 and would make more than $31 per hour by January 2027.In an emailed statement Sunday, Grossman said the work stoppage ""was expected.""""We are fully prepared to continue to operate these hotels and to take care of our guests as long as this disruption lasts,"" he said. ""We also remain available to meet with the union whenever its leaders decide to make themselves available to resume negotiations.”Unite Here Local 11 spokesperson Maria Hernandez denied that the union had canceled any scheduled negotiations and said it is pushing hotels to accept the higher wage proposal it made at the outset of talks.""Workers won’t take anything less than that,"" Hernandez said.A substantial raise is necessary, workers say. Expensive housing in Los Angeles is forcing many employees to live far from their jobs, saddling them with hours-long commutes.Brenda Mendoza drives more than two hours from her home in Apple Valley to the JW Marriott, where she has worked as a uniform attendant for 13 years. When she started working there, she lived in Koreatown, but rent increases forced her and her two sons to move away.“A lot of the workers I train have moved away, because they’re not able to live where we are right now. The gas has gone up, and everything's expensive,” Mendoza said.Union member Sean Johnson hands out fliers to Anime Expo attendees in downtown Los Angeles. Johnson, a member of Unite Here Local 737 in Orlando, Fla., flew out to support Southern California hotel workers in their negotiations. (Helen Li / Los Angeles Times)Bellen Valle, a single mother who works as a housekeeper at JW Marriott, danced along the picket line holding a clapper. She criticized the hotel for bringing in workers from temporary staffing agencies to do the work of union employees.Amy Campbell, a spokesperson for JW Marriott, said the hotel has ""well-established protocols in place to operate ... and take care of guests."" She added that the hotel is ""committed to working toward a fair labor agreement.""Peter Hillan, a spokesperson for industry group the Hotel Assn. of Los Angeles, said it is ""standard practice"" for hotels to hire temporary workers to ensure guests are served.""I'm puzzled and confused about what Unite Here’s plans are,"" Hillan said.The strike is among a burst of actions in what California labor leaders have dubbed ""hot labor summer."" Unions across multiple industries are pushing for pay hikes.Hollywood writers have been on strike since May 2, and actors are in tense negotiations with studios. SAG-AFTRA members had voted to authorize a strike if their leaders couldn't secure a new film and TV contract to replace one that expired at midnight Friday, but the union agreed Friday to allow more time to negotiate, averting a strike.Hotel workers in California last staged a major strike in 2018, when nearly 8,000 housekeepers, bartenders and others walked off the job at 23 Marriott hotels in eight U.S. cities, including San Diego, San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose. That strike lasted more than two months before contract agreements were reached.Hospitality experts have said the current strike has the potential to cause temporary disruptions for hotel operators and guests but will likely have little significant long-term service effects. However, prolonged and concurrent strikes of hotel workers, screenwriters and actors could have ripple effects on other L.A. businesses that rely on tourism, as film and television are an important economic engine. The California economy lost an estimated $2.1 billion during the 2007 writers' strike.Read more: SAG-AFTRA agrees to extend negotiations with studios, averting a strike for nowThe hotel strike comes amid what is typically a busy time for the industry, as tourists flock to destinations across Southern California for the Fourth of July weekend. It coincides with the Anime Expo, which draws thousands of fans of Japanese pop culture to the Los Angeles Convention Center and nearby hotels over four days to celebrate manga art, cosplay and video games.Justin Zellerer, who traveled to the event from Ottawa, said it was his first time seeing workers strike.“I hope they get what they’re asking for,"" Zellerer said. ""I assume if they’re striking, then it’s pretty bad.""Some convention attendees had heard about the potential for a walkout over the weekend and planned ahead.Yohannes Laksana and Trisha Pei flew in from Austin, Texas, for the Anime Expo and on Saturday waited in the “weapons check” line outside the convention center’s North Hall entrance. Laksana sported a red wig, cosplaying as Diluc, a character from the action role-playing game ""Genshin Impact.""The pair are staying at a Hilton hotel in Pasadena and said that morning they found a notice that had been slipped under their door alerting them of the potential for a strike and suggesting that they request services ahead of time.Laksana and Pei are considering asking for extra towels, just in case.Sign up for Essential California, your daily guide to news, views and life in the Golden State.This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s examine KLA’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. Check out our latest analysis for KLA What Is KLA Worth?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 19.69% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy KLA today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $405.22, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that KLA’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What does the future of KLA look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Though in the case of KLA, it is expected to deliver a relatively unexciting earnings growth of 7.2%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. Growth doesn’t appear to be a main reason for a buy decision for the company, at least in the near term.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? KLAC’s future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on KLAC, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.If you'd like to know more about KLA as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

(NYSE:OKE) will no doubt be intrigued by the recent purchase of shares by Pierce Norton, President of the company, who spent a stonking US$1.5m on stock at an average price of US$60.96. That purchase boosted their holding by 141%, which makes us wonder if the move was inspired by quietly confident deeply-felt optimism. See our latest analysis for ONEOK ONEOK Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn fact, the recent purchase by Pierce Norton was the biggest purchase of ONEOK shares made by an insider individual in the last twelve months, according to our records. That implies that an insider found the current price of US$61.72 per share to be enticing. That means they have been optimistic about the company in the past, though they may have changed their mind. While we always like to see insider buying, it's less meaningful if the purchases were made at much lower prices, as the opportunity they saw may have passed. In this case we're pleased to report that the insider purchases were made at close to current prices.In the last twelve months ONEOK insiders were buying shares, but not selling. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeONEOK is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Does ONEOK Boast High Insider Ownership?I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that ONEOK insiders own 0.7% of the company, worth about US$189m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At ONEOK Tell Us?It's certainly positive to see the recent insider purchases. And an analysis of the transactions over the last year also gives us confidence. Once you factor in the high insider ownership, it certainly seems like insiders are positive about ONEOK. Nice! So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, Bloomberg Finance L.P. reported that short-term futures for liquefied natural gas cargoes in East Asia saw an impressive $2.21 increase, settling at a weekly average of $11.50 per metric million British thermal unit (/MMBtu). The Netherlands’ Title Transfer Facility also experienced a rise of $1.77, reaching a weekly average of $12.17/MMBtu. These prices are significantly higher compared to the same period last year. That has investors searching for the top energy stocks for natural gas news.Meanwhile, U.S. utilities pleasantly surprised with a gas storage increase of 95 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the week ending June 16, surpassing the expected 91 bcf. Notably, this figure also outperforms the 76 bcf increase recorded during the same week last year and exceeds the five-year average of 86 bcf. Considering these developments, let’s take a look at three energy stocks with high growth potential.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPhillips 66 (PSX)Phillips 66 gas station in the daytimeSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comDiversified energy company Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) recently shared its first-quarter 2023 financial results, demonstrating strong performance. They achieved earnings of $2 billion or $4.20 per share, surpassing the previous quarter’s earnings of $1.9 billion. During the same period Phillips generated $1.2 billion of operating cash flow, reaching a total of $2.5 billion when excluding working capital. The company’s commitment to delivering value to shareholders was evident through returning $1.3 billion to them via dividends and share repurchases.As an additional testament to their dedication the company increased their quarterly dividend by 8% to $1.05 per common share. Moreover, Phillips received industry recognition for its exemplary safety performance in Midstream, Refining and Chemicals throughout 2022. This acknowledgement highlights their unwavering commitment to maintaining high safety standards for their employees and the communities they serve. This is definitely one of the top energy stocks for natural gas news to keep an eye on.Story continuesSuncor Energy (SU)Suncor Energy logo displayed on a modern smartphoneSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.comSuncor Energy Inc (NYSE:SU) places a strong emphasis on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and actively collaborates with industry peers and government entities through the Pathways Alliance. They were recently awarded exploratory rights for a carbon capture and storage hub in northern Alberta, in addition to an engineering contract for a CO2 transportation line.In the first quarter of 2023 Suncor generated $3 billion in adjusted funds from operations and $1.8 billion in adjusted operating earnings. They returned $1.6 billion to shareholders and achieved a production rate of 742,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) alongside refinery throughput of 367,700 barrels per day (bbls/d).

Additionally, Devon successfully brought 7 new wells online and initiated drilling operations for 19 additional wells. They also achieved an all-time high of 320,000 bbls/d, showcasing their efficient extraction and delivery capabilities.This robust operational performance translated into solid financial results, with operating cash flow totaling $1.7 billion and free cash flow reaching $665 million during the first quarter. In recognition of their positive performance, Devon Energy declared a fixed-plus-variable dividend payout of 72 cents per share based on their first-quarter results.

(NYSE:URI) Looks Like A Quality Company",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-united-rentals-inc-nyse-130016543.html,1688216416,STORY,['URI'],"[Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand United Rentals, Inc. (NYSE:URI).ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. See our latest analysis for United Rentals How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for United Rentals is:31% = US$2.2b ÷ US$7.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.31.Does United Rentals Have A Good Return On Equity?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, United Rentals has a higher ROE than the average (17%) in the Trade Distributors industry.roeThat's what we like to see. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Story continuesCombining United Rentals' Debt And Its 31% Return On EquityUnited Rentals clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.61. Its ROE is pretty impressive but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.ConclusionReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.If you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.Have feedback on this article?

If it weren’t for a quick call with his former boss (and now close friend) Larry Ellison, co-founder of Oracle Corp., Goldberg’s multibillion-dollar empire might never have seen the light of day.Goldberg first met Ellison in 1987 when he interviewed for an engineering role at Oracle. He got the job and developed a relationship with Ellison thanks to the company’s small footprint and startup culture. After eight years at Oracle, Goldberg moved on to found his own venture mBed Software, but the two stayed in touch.On one catch-up call, Goldberg shared that his first startup wasn’t working out, but he wanted to build software for businesses. Ellison liked the idea but suggested the service run on the internet because founders were tired of managing various software on their computers. Within five minutes, the entire business model was dreamed up, and a year later, NetSuite was a reality. In 2016, NetSuite joined the Oracle empire in a $9.3 billion acquisition deal.Goldberg’s advice for befriending your boss?“You have to be proactive,” he said, cautioning that these relationships cannot be forced. Finding opportunities to connect with senior staff members and shining through your work is key. But it’s also important to remember that C-suite is invested in nurturing relationships with future talent. As Goldberg puts it, “It’s a two-way street.”Story continuesTo stay updated with top startup news &amp; investments, sign up for Benzinga’s Startup Investing &amp; Equity Crowdfunding NewsletterHe admits had he joined Oracle today, he would have been one of its 170,000-strong workforce making it much harder to have a conversation, let alone become friendly, with the big boss.""Oracle, back in the day, had a great culture,"" Goldberg said.

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Seagate Technology Holdings The MethodWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$639.0mUS$1.17bUS$1.34bUS$1.44bUS$1.52bUS$1.58bUS$1.64bUS$1.69bUS$1.74bUS$1.79bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x5Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 5.32%Est @ 4.36%Est @ 3.68%Est @ 3.21%Est @ 2.88%Est @ 2.65% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 13% US$566US$915US$929US$885US$826US$763US$701US$641US$584US$531(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$7.3bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 13%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.8b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (13%– 2.1%) = US$17bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$17b÷ ( 1 + 13%)10= US$5.0bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$12b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$61.9, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Seagate Technology Holdings as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 13%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.509. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Seagate Technology HoldingsStrengthNo major strengths identified for STX.WeaknessInterest payments on debt are not well covered.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Tech market.Expensive based on P/S ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityExpected to breakeven next year.Has sufficient cash runway for more than 3 years based on current free cash flows.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Total liabilities exceed total assets, which raises the risk of financial distress.Dividends are not covered by cash flow.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

Recent regulatory approval from Washington made NuScale, a startup with a new reactor design, the frontrunner in that market.Mr Wileman is keen to receive approval to build reactors at Wylfa on Anglesey, which he thinks could host 16 units.The UK is an attractive market for GE Hitachi because of its long history of nuclear power and its target to build new plants, he said, adding that Britain’s plans for an additional 24 gigawatts from the energy source by 2050 fit well with the company’s own timetable.Mr Wileman said: “We look at the UK and see something that excites us.“We’ve got to have the right cost structure and we’ve got to meet our schedules as well. And that’s what we’re all about doing right now.”Hinkley Point C is the next nuclear power plant to come online in the UK - Kin Cheung/APIt comes as speculation mounts that Great British Nuclear (GBN), the government’s new agency for rolling out Britain’s new nuclear fleet, will officially launch on July 13.Ministers have hired financial advisers to help draw up a shortlist for mini-nuclear projects, as the Government ramps up plans to give the green light to next generation reactors.Grant Shapps, the Energy Secretary, has brought in consultants from Deloitte to advise GBN on running the competition.They will evaluate the viability of bidders’ financial strategies, including their funding plans and credit ratings, and lead the development of a financial support package for successful candidates. Potential bidders are expected to include Bill Gates’ TerraPower, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Westinghouse Electric as well as Rolls and GE-Hitachi.The government was approached for comment.

One great example is General Electric. (NYSE:GE). When Larry Culp took the helm of that storied firm in 2018,  it was losing billions of dollars. However, after cutting GE’s costs and making it far more customer-focused, he was to turn the sinking ship around.

At the end of his leadership of the latter company, it was reportedly “just getting its mojo back.”Before becoming Starbucks CEO, he was given “”a unique immersion experience” there, visiting many parts of its operations.Starbucks could use some more  mojo, as  analysts, on average, expect its 2023 earnings per share to come in at $3.43 just 6% above its 2018 EPS of $3.24.  Additionally, an expected deceleration of China’s growth in the second half of the year and intense competition in the Asian country’s retail coffee sector may undermine Starbucks’ overall financial results going forward.On the company’s fiscal Q2 earnings call in April, Narasimhan noted that he plans to implement “efficiencies in (Starbucks’) supply chain, support systems and processes.” He added that he was seeking “to evolve and modernize (the company’s) brand,… business,… capabilities and….culture… by getting back to its basics.” The new CEO also plans to have the company “nurture the limitless possibilities of human connection,”  add new components to the firm’s digital offerings, while implementing “a more global presence.”Some of the new CEO’s plans sound vague,. but it will be interesting to see how they materialize and affect the company’s performance.Nikola (NKLA)An electric semi truck charging.Source: Scharfsinn / Shutterstock.comMichael Lohscheller became CEO of Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) in Jan. 2023 after serving as president of the company, which makes battery-elecric trucks and trucks powered by hydrogen fuel cells. As president of Nikola, Lohscheller helped the firm start producing its Tre battery-electric truck and move the company’s fuel-cell vehicle forward.Before joining NKLA, Lohscheller was CEO of European automaker Opel, which  “he led… to sustainable profitability and oversaw its transformation into a leading electrified car brand,” Nikola reported. He was named “Manager of the Year” by the magazine Auto Zeitung  in 2019.The CEO’s credentials are rather impressive, and I have long believed in Nikola’s tremendous potential due to the strong use case for fuel cell trucks and the firm’s top-notch partners.Lohscheller is sensibly trying to focus Nikola on achieving only a few major goals, as he’s eliminated many of its previous initiatives.“We like the strategic focus and view [Nikola’s fuel cell truck] as a differentiated product,” investment bank TD Cowen wrote recently. Although the firm lowered its rating on the shares to “hold” from “buy,” citing capital constraints, macro issues, and investor sentiment, I believe that NKLA can do great things with Lohscheller at the helm.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer held LONG positions in XPEV,NKLA,GE, ILMN, and ICAD.

It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. Importantly, Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) does carry debt. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?Why Does Debt Bring Risk?Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. See our latest analysis for Valero Energy What Is Valero Energy's Debt?You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Valero Energy had US$11.4b of debt in March 2023, down from US$13.2b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$5.52b, its net debt is less, at about US$5.91b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Strong Is Valero Energy's Balance Sheet?We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Valero Energy had liabilities of US$15.4b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$17.7b due beyond that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$5.52b as well as receivables valued at US$9.07b due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$18.5b.This deficit isn't so bad because Valero Energy is worth a massive US$42.4b, and thus could probably raise enough capital to shore up its balance sheet, if the need arose. But we definitely want to keep our eyes open to indications that its debt is bringing too much risk.Story continuesWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).Valero Energy's net debt is only 0.28 times its EBITDA. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 36.6 times over. So you could argue it is no more threatened by its debt than an elephant is by a mouse. Better yet, Valero Energy grew its EBIT by 332% last year, which is an impressive improvement. That boost will make it even easier to pay down debt going forward. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Valero Energy's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. Over the most recent three years, Valero Energy recorded free cash flow worth 77% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.Our ViewHappily, Valero Energy's impressive interest cover implies it has the upper hand on its debt. But, on a more sombre note, we are a little concerned by its level of total liabilities. Zooming out, Valero Energy seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. While debt does bring risk, when used wisely it can also bring a higher return on equity. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.

72,b4d8f7bb-122a-305e-962c-26b51532341b,DHI,2023-07-02,The CEO of Fortune 500 homebuilder D.R. Horton reveals how he cornered the housing market amid a historic affordability squeeze,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ceo-fortune-500-homebuilder-d-135913045.html,1688219953,STORY,['DHI'],"[As last year's mortgage rate shock threw the U.S. housing market into a sharp slowdown, many homebuyers started to get cold feet, worrying they'd be buying at the peak. Some of those buyers even backed out of their contracts, and left their earnest money on the table. That saw the cancellation rate at D.R. Horton, the nation's largest publicly traded homebuilder, spike from 16% in the first quarter of 2022 to 32% in the third quarter of 2022. It was starting to look like builders might be in for a bumpy ride.Fast-forward to June 2023, and stocks of homebuilders including D.R. Horton and Lennar have set new all-time highs, as new home sales continue their speedy resurgence. Consider D.R. Horton, in particular, which saw its cancellation rate fall back down from 32% in Q3 2022 to 18% in Q2 2023.To understand how builders were able to beat 2023 expectations—which most economists thought would be a bad year for housing—Fortune reached out to D.R. Horton's CEO David Auld.As the market started to sink last year, Auld says, builders began to reduce their profit margins—which had grown to record levels during the boom—to do things that would entice buyers back into the market. For some builders, that meant offering aggressive rate buydowns, which in some cases lower buyers' mortgage rate below 5%. In some communities, it required cutting prices by 5% and 10%. In fast-correcting markets like Austin, where D.R. Horton is the largest builder, some new construction communities saw home prices cut by over 15%.Entering 2023, builders' affordability adjustments—relative to a lack of adjustments in the resale/existing home space—combined with a lack of existing home inventory put single-family builders in a good spot.View this interactive chart on Fortune.comFor evidence of the rebound—and how they did it—just look at D.R. Horton's earnings.Back in April, D.R. Horton reported that its Q2 2023 revenues were down 0.3% from Q2 2022. However, its net income (i.e. profit) in Q2 2023 was down 34% from its net income level in Q2 2022. Those numbers suggest that affordability improvements, like mortgage rate buydowns, are eating into D.R. Horton's profits, while also helping to boost sales.Story continuesDespite the mortgage rate shock, D.R. Horton was also able to move up from No. 124 on the Fortune 500 list in 2022 to its highest ever ranking of No. 120 in 2023.To understand the nuances for how builders cornered the market, Fortune did the following Q&amp;A with D.R. Horton's CEO David Auld. Auld has been at the helm of the Arlington, Texas based builder since 2014, and has led D.R. Horton through the post-Great Financial Crisis era, the COVID-19 recession, and the 2022 mortgage rate shock.Below is Fortune's Q&amp;A with Auld.Fortune: D.R. Horton beat earnings and revenue estimates for the second quarter. What explains the sales improvement this spring? How did D.R. Horton bring buyers back into the market following last year's mortgage‐rate‐induced slowdown? Despite higher mortgage rates and inflationary pressures, fundamental housing demand has remained solid, and our net sales orders improved during our second fiscal quarter due to normal seasonal factors, coupled with our use of incentives and pricing adjustments to adapt to changing market conditions.The typical seasonal trend for D.R. Horton is a roughly 50% increase in our net sales orders from the December to March quarter. This year, we experienced better than normal seasonality, with a 73% sequential increase in our net sales orders, primarily the result of the existing and growing imbalance of demand versus supply.To address affordability concerns in the market, we introduced increased incentives into the market and adjusted base pricing of our homes where necessary. Our most successful incentive recently has been interest rate buydowns. We are generally offering a point below market on a 30‐year fixed rate mortgage for the life of the loan.You told investors this spring that ""pricing adjustments"" helped D.R. Horton bring demand back into the market. In what types of communities/regional housing markets did D.R. Horton cut house prices over the past year? And roughly how big were those price cuts? Our average sales price on closings in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 was $378,800, down 6% from a high of $403,700 in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Pricing adjustments are made by our local market operators on a community‐by‐community basis based on market conditions and demand. Price adjustments varied greatly across our operating footprint of 110 markets and 33 states, and generally speaking, pricing held up better in our communities in Florida.Despite higher mortgage rates and inflationary pressures, fundamental housing demand has remained solid, and our net sales orders improved during our second fiscal quarter due to normal seasonal factors, coupled with our use of incentives and pricing adjustments to adapt to changing market conditions. The typical seasonal trend for D.R. Horton is a roughly 50% increase in our net sales orders from the December to March quarter. This year, we experienced better than normal seasonality, with a 73% sequential increase in our net sales orders, primarily the result of the existing and growing imbalance of demand versus supply. To address affordability concerns in the market, we introduced increased incentives into the market and adjusted base pricing of our homes where necessary. Our most successful incentive recently has been interest rate buydowns. We are generally offering a point below market on a 30‐year fixed rate mortgage for the life of the loan.Given the sales improvement, could builders soon pull back on buydowns or incentives? If the market were to continue to improve, we would expect the opportunity to be able to either pull back on incentives and/or begin to start gradually increasing the base prices of our homes. This will still be done on a community‐by‐community basis based on local market conditions.During the Pandemic Housing Boom, builders like D.R. Horton expanded their profit margin. Having the breathing room to then reduce those margins to 'find the market', analysts say, has helped builders to weather the mortgage rate shock. Do you agree with that assessment, and how did that play out for D.R. Horton?We do agree with that assessment. Even with a decline in our gross margins due to the significant increase in rates in the second half of calendar 2022, they are still above our historical norm of 20%. Our home sales gross margin in the March quarter was 21.6%, and we publicly guided to a June quarter gross margin in the range of 21% to 22%. Our homebuilding SG&amp;A is still at historically low levels, with our consolidated pre‐tax margin strong in the mid‐teens.Deutsche Bank recently released a paper saying that the ""U.S. housing market was simply navigating a mid‐cycle crisis"" last year, and the lack of housing supply would keep builders busy in the years ahead. How does that assessment compare to your personal view? Just how ""under built"" is the country? It is hard to pinpoint exactly how underbuilt the country is, but I firmly believe we are still in an extremely undersupplied housing market, for both new and existing homes, likely for years to come due to development and construction capacity constraints in the industry.According to an analysis conducted by John Burns Research and Consulting, institutional investors—those owning over 1,000 homes—bought 90% fewer homes in January and February than they did in the first two months of 2022. Did you see that manifest in D.R. Horton's build‐ for‐rent business? We still see numerous buyers interested in purchasing our multi‐family rental projects and our single‐family rental communities, and we have continued to sell our rental communities to investors at a good pace. As we continue to scale those businesses, D.R. Horton is uniquely positioned to be the largest provider of rental communities to the growing number of institutional investors focused on reducing the cost and increasing efficiency of the acquisition and management of their portfolio.As of Q2 2023, what percentage of D.R. Horton's business is BTR? And what do you think that figure will be in, say, 5 years? As of March 31, 2023, our rental inventories (both multi‐ and single‐family) were $3.3 billion or approximately 14% of total inventory. We don’t have a set target for the future size of our build‐to‐rent businesses. We plan to continue to consolidate share in the rental market, just as we have steadily aggregated share in the for‐sale side of our business for many years.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. Check out our latest analysis for Sherwin-Williams How Quickly Is Sherwin-Williams Increasing Earnings Per Share?The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Sherwin-Williams managed to grow EPS by 12% per year, over three years. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. While we note Sherwin-Williams achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 11% to US$23b. That's a real positive.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time.

So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for Sherwin-Williams?Story continuesAre Sherwin-Williams Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$68b company like Sherwin-Williams. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$208m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.3% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.Is Sherwin-Williams Worth Keeping An Eye On?As previously touched on, Sherwin-Williams is a growing business, which is encouraging. For those who are looking for a little more than this, the high level of insider ownership enhances our enthusiasm for this growth. The combination definitely favoured by investors so consider keeping the company on a watchlist.

But more than that, you probably want to see it rise more than the market average. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) share price is up 43% in the last five years, that's less than the market return. The last year has been disappointing, with the stock price down 4.9% in that time.So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. Check out our latest analysis for Union Pacific To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, Union Pacific actually saw its EPS drop 3.7% per year.So it's hard to argue that the earnings per share are the best metric to judge the company, as it may not be optimized for profits at this point. Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.We are not particularly impressed by the annual compound revenue growth of 1.5% over five years. So why is the share price up? It's not immediately obvious to us, but a closer look at the company's progress over time might yield answers.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthUnion Pacific is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. You can see what analysts are predicting for Union Pacific in this interactive graph of future profit estimates.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Union Pacific the TSR over the last 5 years was 59%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveInvestors in Union Pacific had a tough year, with a total loss of 2.5% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 16%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 10% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.
